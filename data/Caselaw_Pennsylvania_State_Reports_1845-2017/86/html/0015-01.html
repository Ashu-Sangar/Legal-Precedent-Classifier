It was the intention of that act to reach parties who bought votes, not those who made promises to secure them. Nor was this promise within the constitutional prohibition. The only other act is that of 1860, which requires that the electors must be “qualified” electors, and this fact must be specially pleaded. It is a penal statute and must be strictly construed, and an offer therefore made to one who was not a “ qualified” elector, is not within the act, and there is no averment in the suggestion that McLure or, any other of the parties alleged to have been corruptly approached, had the right to vote. The charge that money was paid to be used in carrying the election is not- specific enough, and is insufficient in certainty of pleading. The suggestion utterly fails to charge any disqualifying act on the part of the respondent. In State <em>v. </em>Church, 5 Oregon 375, in a similar proceeding, and founded on a constitution and laws analogous to ours, it was charged that Church, while a candidate, offered, if elected, to pay $200 into the county treasury, and that by such offer he obtained seventy votes and thereby secured his election. The suggestion did not charge that any of the parties to whom the offers were made were taxpayers, and the court held that the suggestion was defective in that it did not state that they were taxpayers of the county.</p>

In this case all the surroundings forbid its exercise. The information and amendments specifying charges are answered by the respondent, and every act alleged and charged therein is denied under oath, and the answer contains the allegation that the suggestion does not sufficiently charge any offence with the plea of not guilty added. There is no precedent where judgment of ouster has been entered on demurrer where answer and plea were on file, and not withdrawn or attempted to be withdrawn. The demurrer may'have been, and may now be, futile in fact, may, as a matter of law, never have had an existence ; but the plea and answer of respondent are good in law, and will afford him his constitutional right of trial by jury before his property, rights and reputation can be swept from him.</p>

The suggestion avei’s that the said Walter, while a candidate for said office, “ paid one John McLure money to use in carrying said election for him, for other purposes than for printing and travelling expenses, the dissemination of information to the public, or for political meetings, demonstrations and conventions, or for any necessary and proper expenses expressly authorized by law, but <em>for corrupt and illegal purposes in procuring Ms </em>election.” The suggestion then avers specific acts of corruption, and proceeds to charge that “ the said George Walter, having taken <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>the oath of office required by the Constitution of the state of Pennsylvania after he had been declared elected to the said office of sheriff, did then 'and there commit and was guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury, having committed and been guilty of the acts and offences first above alleged and charged, which in said oath, taken as aforesaid, he denied; whereby the said George Walter has become and is disqualified from holding the said office of sheriff of the county of Butler, and since the first Monday of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, he has usurped and does usurp on the Commonwealth therein, to the great damage and prejudice of the constitution and laws thereof.” An amended suggestion, and amended specifications were filed by leave of court, a reference to the details of which is unnecessary under the view we take of the case. Nor need we now allude to any of the subsequent proceedings in the cause until we come to the demurrer filed by the defendant on the first day of October 1877. Under the well-settled rules of law this demurrer was an admission of all the facts sufficiently pleaded. The demurrer was general. An attempt was made to show that it was special by a certificate of the learned judge of the court below, that it was only taken to a single point. The certificate was no part of the record, although filed in the cause, and it may well be questioned whether the unofficial declaration of the judge can be received to contradict his own record. It is, however, wholly immaterial, as we are unable to perceive any- difference between a general and a special demurrer as to the admission of the facts. Both alike admit the facts well pleaded. We are, therefore, brought to a consideration of the sufficiency of the suggestion.</p>
    <p id="b20-6" data-blocks='[["BL_20.4",20,[281,1630,1167,821]],["BL_21.1",21,[217,427,1167,822]]]'>The law of the case will be found in section 9 of article 8 of the constitution, and thé Act of 18th of April 1874, Pamph. L. 64. The constitutional provision is as follows: “Any person who shall, while a candidate for office, be guilty of bribery, fraud, or wilful violation of any election law, shall be for ever disqualified from holding an office of trust or profit in this Commonwealth; and any person convicted of wilful violation of the election laws, shall, in addition to any penalties provided by law, be deprived of the right of suffrage absolutely for a term of ^our years.” The act of 1874, after defining, in the first section, what shall be considered legal election expenses, provides that “nothing contained in this act shall be so construed as to authorize the payment of money or other valuable thing for the vote or influence of any elector, either directly or indirectly, at [Drimary, township, general or special elections, nominating conventions, or for any corrupt purposes whatever incident to an election; and all judicial, state, county and municipal officers hereafter elected shall, before entering upon the duties of their respective offices, take and subscribe the oath prescribed by section first, of article seven of. the constitution of this Com<a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>monwealth.” The averment in the suggestion that the defendant paid money to John McLure other than for the legal expenses provided for in the Act of 1874, but “ for corrupt and illegal purposes in procuring his election,” sufficiently charges a violation of said act. The only expenses recognised by law are, 1st, printing and travelling expenses; 2d, for dissemination of information to the public; and 3d, for political meetings, demonstrations and conventions. Beyond these authorized expenditures a candidate for office may not go. The Act of 1874 declares that a candidate for either a nomination or an election shall not pay or contribute, either directly or indirectly, any money or valuable thing, or knowingly allow it to be done by others for him, either for the nomination, election or appointment, except for the three purposes above specified. We think, therefore, that the averment in the suggestion that money was paid, not for the legal objects designated, but for corrupt and illegal purposes in procuring his election, brought the defendant within the prohibition of the constitution and the penalties of the Atít of 1874. It follows that the court below erred in sustaining the demurrer.</p>

If the defendant had demurred promptly there would have been much force in the suggestion pressed upon us at the argument that we should give judgment of <em>respondeat ouster. </em>But the Commonwealth has been greatly delayed. This case was -here a year ago upon another point. We then heard no word of any defect in the suggestion. The judgment was reversed November 24th 1876, and a <em>procedendo </em>ordered. It was not until October 1st 1877, the day upon which the case was ordered for trial, that the demurrer was put in. This delay was calculated to baffle the Commonwealth and seriously protract the proceedings. If we now allow the defendant to withdraw his demurrer it is not probable the case will be disposed of during his term of office. We cannot permit him to practically defeat this inquiry in this manner. He has had an ample opportunity of having his case passed upon by a jury if he desired it. Having, after great delay, interposed a demurrer, he must be held to all its legal consequences. The Commonwealth is entitled to final judgment.</p>

The section of the constitution above cited provides, as we have seen, that any person who shall, while a candidate for office, be guilty of a wilful violation of any election law, “shall be for ever disqualified from holding an office of trust or profit in this Commonwealth.” The entry of judgment for the Commonwealth upon the demurrer is conclusive upon the defendant that he has wilfully violated the election law of 18th of April 1874. It follows that the disqualification of the constitution attaches, and that he is “ for ever disqualified from holding an office of trust or profit in this Commonwealth.” He, there<a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>fore, fills an office lie is disqualified from holding by the very terms of the constitution, and he must be ousted therefrom.

Such a practice would lead to great delay, and would encourage men in desperate or doubtful cases to appear to stand aloof from their counsel, plead ignorance of law, take the chance of a decision in their favor in this court, and failing in that, to have the record remitted for a trial of the facts. If, as the defendant swears, the demurrer was against his judgment and protest, he ought to have controlled his counsel, in a matter so important to his interests. Not doing this he certainly ought to have applied to this court to permit him to take back the record for a trial of the facts, before arguing his case upon the demurrer and taking his chance of this decision in his favor.
