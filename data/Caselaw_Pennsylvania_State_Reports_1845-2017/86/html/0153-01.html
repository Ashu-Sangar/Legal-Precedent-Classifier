The owner of a sugar refinery employed a master rigger to remove certain heavy machinery for use therein from a railroad train to their place in the refinery. In the prosecution of the work he opened a coal-hole in the pavement. in front of the refinery, into which to place a beam to secure a purchase for his tackling. After this purpose was accomplished, the beam was removed, and the hole remained opened a few moments, in which interval a lad walked into it and was severely injured. The owner of the refinery did not interfere in any manner with the work, and the entire direction of the same was under the control of the rigger, who was paid by the day. Suit was brought on behalf of the lad against the owner of the refinery: <em>Held, </em>that he was not liable. <em>Held, </em>further, that the own'er would not be liable for this unauthorized uncovering of the hole until such time had elapsed, under all the circumstances, that a reasonable and prudent man ought to have discovered its dangerous condition.</p>

In May 1875, they had purchased two large iron coolers, weighing from seven to ten tons each, to be used in their business. They were brought by railroad to the north end of the railroad track on Swanson street, whence it was necessary to move them along the pavement and into the refinery. The distance they were to be moved was about eighty-eight feet. The defendants employed one John Connor, a master rigger, to move the coolers from the railroad tracks and place them in position in the refinery. Eor this work he was to be paid four dollars per day for himself and for each of the assistant riggers and for the use of his rigging. When he needed any additional men, he was to have the assistance of some of the men about the refinery. From the time he commenced until he finished the work, Connor controlled all the men, gave all the orders, and had the sole direction of whatever was done.</p>

This opening or hole is twenty inches in diameter, and is securely fastened by a heavy cast-iron cover, weighing about sixty pounds. At the bottom it was fastened with lock and key.</p>

In order to do this, he put wooden rollers under the cooler, and fastened ropes to it, and used the ordinary tackle of riggers. For the purpose of obtaining a purchase, he directed his men to open the coal-hole, and to put a strong piece of timber in it, and across and below the pavement, and fasten their ropes to it. This they did, and by means of the tackle they drew the cooler as far as. they could, with this purchase, to within <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>five or six feet of the hole. The cooler was about ten feet long by five feet wide and five feet deep. It was thus drawn to within a few feet of the coal-hole a little before 12 o’clock noon. The rigger then ordered his men to take the tackle from the coal-hole, and pull it around the corner of Bainbridge and Swanson streets, and thus get a new purchase. In doing this, the hole remained open from three to five minutes. In this interval the plaintiff, a boy about thirteen years old,-walked into it and was injured.</p>

They were sugar refiners, occupying buildings on Swanson street, in the city of Philadelphia. They purchased two large iron coolers, to use in their business. The coolers were brought by rail to within about one hundred feet of their works. They then employed John Connor, a rigger, to take thé coolers from the cars and place them in their building. He was to be paid four dollars per day for his own services, and for each of his three assistant riggers. On each off these three men he made a profit of fifty cents per day. He was to furnish the ropes, hoisting apparatus, and all the necessary machinery incident to his occupation. Yet for the use of these he appears to have received an additional sum. The distance to move the coolers being so short, he moved them with skids and rollers, over the sidewalk. While so moving them he uncovered the coal-hole, and left it open, by reason of which the defendant was injured. The question presented is, whether the plaintiffs in error are liable for the injury thus sustained.</p>

If one renders service, in the course of an occupation, representing the will of his employer only as to the result of his work, and not as to the means by which it is accomplished, it is an independent employment: Shearman &amp; Redfield on Neg., sec. 74; Pack <em>v. </em>The Mayor, &amp;c., of New York, 4 Selden 432; Barry <em>v. </em>The City of St. Louis, <a href="/mo/17/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="17 Mo. 121" data-case-ids="8853614" data-case-paths="/mo/17/0121-01">17 Mo. 121</a>.</p>
    <p id="b159-7" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[196,1624,1173,823]],["BL_160.1",160,[270,417,1168,129]]]'>In the present case the evidence was most ample to submit to the jury to find that Connor's employment was an independent one. It does not appear that the plaintiffs in error reserved any right to advise or direct as to the manner in which the coolers should be moved, nor that they assumed or exercised any such authority during the progress of the work. It is not pretended that the moving was an unlawful work. As to Connor it was a distinct employment in the line of his occupation. His employers stipulated for the result only. He alone superintended and directed the manner in which his assistant riggers should work. He had the exclusive control and direction of the plaintiffs’ men, who assisted him. He testifies that he did the job according to his own' views. Under his directions the coal-hole was opened. It is not shown that the plaintiffs in erroi’, or any one acting under their directions, were present, or had knowledge that it was opened. It is not claimed to have been opened by their express authority. How could their permission be implied ? We see no necessary connection between the work to be done and the use of this coal-hole in performing it. If the jury should think there was no reasonable presumption that <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>Connor would, use the hole in such a manner as to uncover it, the plaintiffs in error were guilty of no negligence in not stationing a man there to prevent its being opened.</p>
    <p id="b160-6" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[266,547,1172,989]]]'>The coal-hole appears to have been in all respects constructed and protected according to the city ordinance. Its cover was of solid cast-iron, weighing about sixty pounds. At the bottom it was securely fastened. Certain it is that the coal-hole was not made nor maintained for any such use as it was subjected to by Con-nor. If, then, it should be found that his employment was an independent one, and that he had no implied permission to use it in the manner in which he did use it, or if Connor was a trespasser while so using it, the plaintiff would not be liable for an injury sustained by the defendant, on the instant that Connor ceased to use it. While it is true, as the learned judge said, “the instant that he ceased to use it, its control reverted to the” plaintiffs in error; yet it does not follow “from that instant they were bound to protect it.” This is imposing too harsh terms on them. If they had no expectation that the hole would be uncovered or thus used, and no knowledge that it was, they should not be held liable until such reasonable time had elapsed, under all the circumstances, that a careful and prudent man ought to have discovered its dangerous condition. If, after such reasonable time had elapsed, and they failed to make the hole secure, they cannot be relieved from the consequences of their own negligence, by showing the previous trespass of Connor. It then follows that the assignments, except the last, are substantially sustained.</p>
