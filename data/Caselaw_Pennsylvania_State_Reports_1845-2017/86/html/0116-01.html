In a suit by S. on the note he offered a credit of $17,000. B. filed an affidavit of defence, wherein he averred that the full value of the mortgages was $42,000; that the plaintiff had acted as the owner thereof and sued them out and purchased the property without notice to B.; that at the time of the sale property was much depreciated and that with careful management much more could have been realized. Held, that the affidavit was insufficient and that the plaintiff vras entitled to judgment either for the balance of his claim, or if his action had converted him into a trustee holding land instead of mortgages, then to the whole amount of his claim, and the record must be remitted to the court below to enter such judgment as might be right and just.</p>

It was made upon the agreement that plaintiff should hold said bonds and mortgages as collateral security for said loan, to be returned to me when said loan was paid. And I believe, and expect to be able to prove, that the plaintiff, without authority from me, appropriated to his own use said bonds and mortgages, amounting at par to $42,508.33, with interest; that he caused the assignment to be re<a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>corded, and then brought suit in his own name upon said mortgages as absolute owner thereof, recovered judgment, and issued executions, whereon the mortgaged premises were sold by the sheriff, and bought from him by the plaintiff, to whom sheriff’s deeds therefor were made and acknowledged. I also believe that the plaintiff receipted to the sheriff for the sum of $17,708.20, as purchase-money of said real estate, and thus assumed to act as absolute owner of said bonds and mortgages without any notice to me, without any sale thereof, and without giving me any opportunity to redeem the same.
