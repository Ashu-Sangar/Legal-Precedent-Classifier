Under the Act of the 15th of April 1834, section 25, every collector of taxes is entitled to retain, at the final settlement of his duplicate, the sum of five per cent, on all moneys collected. The county could not enforce payment of this five per cent., and we fail to see any power given by the 6th section of the Act of the 24th of March 1851, to the county treasurer, to collect anything more from a tax collector than the ninety-five per cent, of the 'full amount of his duplicate. This bond was given to the county of Berks, and so far as the .proof went it was given in evidence under exception in precisely the form in which it was given originally to the county. The county could not recover on this bond. The equitable plaintiff could not recover any more than the legal plaintiff. An equitable plaintiff suing on a bond would be obliged to show his title to the obligation. There was. none (title) shown in this case. If the legal plaintiff cannot recover it is very evident that the equitable party cannot.”</p>

It appeared also that he had settled in full his duplicate, retaining his full commission of five per cent, on the amount. The difference between the' commission five per cent, and the amount of his bid was $89.30. Whether he is liable on his official bond to the county of Berks for this sum was really the question reserved and upon which a judgment for defendant <em>non obstante veredicto </em>was afterwards entered.</p>
    <p id="b362-8" data-blocks='[["BL_362.6",362,[281,1250,1177,1080]]]'>
      <em>We </em>are of opinion that on the proper construction of the Act of 1851, the collector is legally liable to the county for the whole amount of the duplicate, less the amount of his bid for collection. The difference is to be paid by the county into the common-school fund. Practically the effect of the act is to reduce the commissions to the amount bid. The collector is appointed by the commissioners and is to pay over the taxes collected to the county treasurer. He stands in no relation to the school directors. Some difficulty seems to have arisen in the court below from the fact that the suit on the bond had been marked to the use of the school district. It was mere surplusage. It is the legal party on the record only that is to be looked at, unless indeed a defence should be shown against the equitable party. No doubt this suit was prosecuted for the use of the school district, and if it’ had been shown that Levan had really paid the difference between his bid and the five per cent, commission into the common-school fund, it would have been a perfectly good defence. But nothing of the sort was pretended or offered to be proved. It was an error in the court below to suppose that an equitable plaintiff suing on a bond would be obliged to show his title to the obligation. It is never necessary unless for the purpose of meeting and answering some defence which though good against the legal plaintiff is not good as against him; as for example, payment to the legal plaintiff after notice of the equity. On the whole we think the plaintiff below, the county of Berks, is entitled to judgment on the reserved point.</p>
