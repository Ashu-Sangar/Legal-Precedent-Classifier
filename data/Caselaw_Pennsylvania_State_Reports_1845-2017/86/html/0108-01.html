The judgment index showed an existing judgment before his mortgage, which was certified to him after searches made, and believing his mortgage discharged by the sale, he made his bid accordingly. This judgment, by order of court, was stricken from the judgment index, having been erroneously entered thereon. The purchaser then, the purchase-money having been paid and the sheriff's deed acknowledged, took a rule to set aside the sale, vacate the acknowledgment and cancel the deed, which the court made absolute. <em>Held, </em>that this action was within the discretion of the court.</p>

Shakespeare against George Fisher and Henry Delany, two properties belonging to the latter were sold at sheriff’s sale, on the 8th of September 1876, to Charles Delany. On the 7th of October following he paid the purchase-money, and the sheriff’s deed was acknowledged, but not delivered or recorded, and remained in the hands of the prothonotary. An auditor was appointed to distribute the fund, when on the 18th of November, Charles Delany took a rule to set aside the sheriff’s sale, vacate the acknowledgment, cancel the deed and refund the purchase-money, proceedings meanwhile to stay.</p>

Searches taken out before the sale by his conveyancer and attorney disclosed the fact that there appeared on the judgment index docket a prior judgment for $1079.06, which he was advised by his counsel would discharge the lien of his mortgage, and under this belief he bought the two properties for $2950. It appeared from the copy of the record of the suit in which the judgment against Henry Delany was entered that the entry of the judgment was a mistake of the prothonotary; an appearance for Henry Delany had been entered for him by counsel, though he was not a party defendant to the suit, and judgment was entered against him, and carried to the judgment index docket.</p>

The purchase of the property was therefore made after searches had been taken out, and counsel had advised that it was necessary to bid at the sale, in defence of the mortgage held by the purchaser. A further equity on which the petitioner rested his application for relief was that the property covered by his mortgage was not worth more than $3000, and that there was therefore no value in it above the mortgage, and for which, under his bid, he had paid to the sheriff $2950.</p>

Here a purchaser at sheriff’s sale bid off the property of a defendant in an execution to protect his own interests as an encumbrancer by mortgage. The judgment index showed an existing judgment before his mortgage, which was certified to him, and believing his mortgage discharged by the sale, he made his bid accordingly. In doing this he did just what the law required of him. A few days after the sale, a rule was taken, and in two days afterward made absolute, striking this judgment from the judgment or lien index, leaving him exposed to a grave question arising upon the effect of his bid, and liable to a large loss, if his money should not be applied on his own mortgage. The difficulty of the question lay in the fact that there never was valid judgment against Henry Delany, the owner, though there was an appearance for him, and a judgment <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>was regularly indexed against him. Charles Delany being himself the purchaser at sheriff ’s sale, as well as an encumbrancer, clearly had the right to waive the effect of the delivery of the deed to him, and to surrender it for cancellation with the permission of the court. This being the case, and the process of the court being executed under such circumstances of manifest injury to the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, there was no excess or abuse of the power of supervision in the court below to demand our interference. On the contrary, it was proper that the court should, within the proper Circle of its power see that no injustice should be done.. As to costs in such cases the court below can make such order as will do justice among the parties.</p>
