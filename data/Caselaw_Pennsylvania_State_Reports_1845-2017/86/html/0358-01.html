Under a parol contract made with Addison Mohry by her father, the daughter, when about thirteen years of age, went to live as a servant in the family of Mohry, where she was to remain until she was eighteen years of age, receiving schooling, board and clothing from her employer, <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>and when she reached the age of eighteen, Mohry was to supply her with an outfit for housekeeping, consisting of a number of enumerated articles of furniture. The father reserved the right to call the daughter home in case of sickness in his family. She lived for two years with Mohry under this agreement, when she was seduced by Mohry’s son, a lad about seventeen years of age.</p>

There is no law providing for the arrest of the apprentice in such a case, and her return to the service of her master. While the father, here, might in a proper case, be held liable for a breach of contract, his parental right of control over his daughter is not transferred. The right of action for an injury such as this, <em>per quod servitum, </em>anvisit, therefore, remains, and especially where, as here, the son of the person with whom the contract is made, debauches her in his house. The form of action, or rather the ground of legal liability, is purely technical, while the real injury is the seduction; and as to this the plaintiff never gave his consent, or lost his control of his daughter.</p>
