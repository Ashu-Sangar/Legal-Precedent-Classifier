On August 20th 1867, Quinn and his wife executed a bond, with warrant of attorney, to confess judgment in favor of McGinness for $175, payable in seven payments. In 1870, Quinn and his wife mortgaged the two lots to the Pottsville Building Association for $600, which mortgage was recorded before the entry of judgment on the bond to McGinness. Judgment was entered on the bond February 1872, and it was then transferred to Kline, who issued a fi. fa. thereon. In September following, Mrs. Quinn filed an affidavit, setting forth her coverture, and the court granted a rule to show cause why the judgment should'not be opened. Depositions were taken under this rule, and McGinness testified on behalf of the plaintiff, that he sold the lots to Mr. Quinn and his wife, and that the bond was taken as security for the purchase-money. He further testified, that at the time of the assignment he “took no security, nor writing, or anythingthat he “did not want anything,” that he “thought it was all right,” and that he “never had said anything to Mrs. Quinn about being paid for the lots ’till after they had their house nearly built.” Quinn and his wife, on the contrary, swore that McGinness had given the property to Mrs. Quinn, who ivas his niece, and they had signed the bond without knowing what it was, and on the assurance of McGinness’s counsel that “it would not amount to anything.” There was also evidence to show that Mrs. Quinn had declared to Kline and his counsel, that she had no defence to the judgment before Kline purchased it.</p>

J., discharged the rule in an opinion, saying: “ For what then ivas the bond given ? In the absence of evidence of any other business transaction between McGinness and the defendants, to which the bond in question could have application, we have come to the conclusion that it was given for the purchase-money of real estate. If so, it is valid against Mrs. Quinn, notwithstanding her coverture, as is shown in Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Casey 81, and other cases. There is another ground upon which we may refuse to open the judgment in this case. M. McGinness testifies that after the bond was executed by the defendants, they severally, at different dates, made him a small payment upon it; acts inconsistent with the allegations they now make. Roland Kline testifies that before purchasing the judgment, he went with his counsel, Mr. Wright, to the house of Quinn, to learn whether <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>there was any defence to its payment, and was then informed by Mrs. Quinn that the bond was all right. In this he is corroborated by Mr. Wright. It appears from the testimony of Mr. Wright, that Martin McGinness called upon him (Wright) several times, and urged him to induce Kline to purchase the judgment. After he had become the assignee of the judgment, Roland Kline states that at the request of one or both of the defendants, he made an agreement by which the time of the several payments was extended. The assignee having shown that he paid a valuable consideration for the judgment, before doing which he had been informed by one of the defendants that no defence would be made to it; he is brought directly within the ruling of these points, in Weaver <em>v. </em>Lynch, 1 Casey 449. The principle of estoppel appears when an act or statement cannot be withdrawn without a breach of faith on the one-hand, and an injury on the other; such an act rises from the rank of evidence to that of an estoppel, and absolutely binds and concludes the party affected by it: Doe <em>v. </em>Oliver, 2 Smith’s Leading Cases 711, &amp;c.; this kind of an estoppel is applicable to <em>feme coverts </em>and infants as well as others, for it could not be tolerated that such persons should be allowed to injure others with impunity: 1 Story.’s Equity, sec. 385. See also Fulton <em>v. </em>Moore, 1 Casey 468. After a careful examination of the whole ease, we cannot find sufficient grounds for opening the judgment.”</p>

The sheriff made return that he had sold the premises for $600 ; that he had the receipt of Kline as assignee of the Building Association for the judgment and interest; and further, that he held Kline’s receipt for $160 on account of the judgment on the bond, which amount it appeared, however, he had not taken from the sheriff’s hands.</p>

In this case the judgment is upon a bond in the usual form, and does not show that it ivas for purchase-money, and standing alone, being given by a married woman, would not only be entitled to preference over exemption, but would be absolutely void. But the defendants having a knowledge of that fact went into court and asked to have the judgment opened. The depositions submitted are a part of the record in the original judgment, were submitted to and passed upon by the court, thus giving the defendants their full day in court, and the court decided against them. The auditor must, therefore, [no matter what impression of the fact the depositions might leave upon his own mind as to the original transaction,] treat the iudgment as valid against both defendants, and for the pur<a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>chase-money of the property against which they are not entitled to the exemption. Concluding thus, your auditor has nothing to do with the question whether the notice was in time or not, though he believes the notice was in time, and would entitle them, if nothing else prevented, to the exemption; and as to the point that Kline, the assignee of the judgment* is not entitled to the immunities of the purchase-money judgment, the assignee is certainly entitled to all the rights of the original plaintiff. This leaves it unnecessary for your auditor to make any particular distribution, as there is not. sufficient money in court to pay the purchase-money judgment, and the deed ought to be acknowledged and the sale confirmed to Roland Kline.”</p>

The bond did not even recite that it was given for the purchase-money of the land. The contract made by P. W. Shaefer, as attorney for Walter S. Shaefer and his wife, with Martin McGinness, was made on the 28th of May 1866. McGinness assigned his interest in the contract to Susan Quinn on the 12th of July 1866, and Shaefer and his wife executed the deed to her on the 23d of January 1867. McGinness paid the -whole consideration for the property when he received the contract. The character of the bond, which was not executed until the 20th of August 1867, as a purchase-money obli<a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>gation, could only bo made out by parol testimony, and to that the Common Pleas resorted in disposing of the rule to open the judgment. The usual consequences were developed by the experiment. McGrinness testified that he had sold the property to Quinn and his wife. They swore that he had given it to Mrs. Quinn, and that they signed, the bond without knowing what it was, and on the assurance of McGrinness’s counsel that “it would not amount to anything.” The conclusion that something like perjury ivas committed on one side or the other, could probably be safely drawn.</p>

McGrinness testified in terms that at the time of the assignment, he “took no security, no writing or anything;” that he “did not want anything;” that he “thought it was all right;” and that he “ never said anything to Mrs. Quinn about being paid for the lots till after they had their house nearly built.” The judgment-bond, therefore, was not even executed in pursuance of a previous agreement made either when the contract was assigned, or when the deed was delivered. In executing it, Mrs. Quinn was assuming, seven months after her title was vested, an entirely new obligation. She was performing no condition on which her tenure of the land depended, and was fulfilling no duty, legal or moral, which she owed to her assignor. Ramborger’s Administrator <em>v. </em>Ingraham was ruled by Chief Justice Lowrie on the ground that the conveyance and the lien for the purchase-money were all one transaction, and that the benefit and the burden were to be treated as valid alike. A judgment confessed by a married woman can be enforced in the single instance where, when a conveyance is made to her, it forms part of an agreement under Avhich she takes land subject to the condition that she shall pay its price: Brunner’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%2067" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="11 Wright 67">11 Wright 67</a>. In Schlosser’s Appeal, 8 P. F. Smith 493, two married Avomen purchased some real estate on which there AAas at the time a subsisting lien. The plaintiff satisfied the judgment against the vendor, and took a neAV one against the vendees. It Avas held to be a clear case of novation — the substitution of a neAV debt for the old one — and the judgment, being a new contract by married women, Avas declared to be void.. In the discussion of that case, Shars-WOODj J., said that “ the cases Avhich permit a married Avoman to bind her separate property, are exceptions .to a general rule of sound policy, and ought to be strictly confined within the limits prescribed. If aa'6 begin to reason upon the abstract justice of making her property answerable for her honest debts, the exceptions will soon eat out the rule itself.” At the utmost, the bond of Mrs. Quinn, was given for an antecedent debt, and for a consideration Avhich had passed to her months before. If under the facts presented, it could be treated as a purchase-money security, a rule Avould be established <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>which would place the property rights of a married woman at the mercy of an auditor or a jury whenever by the testimony of a single witness they would be subjected to attack.</p>

It was urged below, and has been argued here that she was estopped by her declarations from asserting its invalidity. This question was settled by an exhaustive and absolutely conclusive opinion of the present Chief Justice in Glidden <em>v. </em>Strupler, 2 P. F. Smith 400. It was there decided that the contract of a married woman being void, it cannot be ratified, even by deed, except in the mode prescribed by the statute; and that positive acts of encouragement which might operate to estop one <em>sui juris, </em>will not affect one who is under a legal disability.</p>

It was said that the appellees were fully heard, and that they acquiesced in that determination. Certainly, they acquiesced. They could do nothing else. No appeal to this court was possible until the Act of the 4th of April 1877, was passed, and then the property had long been sold. The appellants had no remedy except to assert their rights in the distribution. The judgment was void upon its face. The evidence on which it was found to have been for purchase-money was before the auditor and is here in the record of this appeal. It was wholly inadequate to support the decision of the court below refusing to open the judgment, and that refusal left it in precisely its original position.

In Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters, 6 Harris 79, a married woman was permitted to maintain an ejectment against a purchaser of her property at sheriff’s sale under a judgment which she had confessed.

But the common counts were added, and the vendee was relieved from the obligation of his contract because, notwithstanding the judgment, execution and sale, the wife would remain at liberty to show that the recovery was on claims covered only by those counts, for which she was subject to no liability. The discharge of the rule to show cause did not fix upon the record of the judgment against Mrs. Quinn the character of <em>res adjudieata </em>so as to exclude her from participating in this fund. *</p>
    <p id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[445,924,995,303]]]'>The decree is reversed at the costs of the appellee ; and it is now ordered and adjudged that the moneys produced by the sheriff’s sale, after payment of the principal debt, interest and cost .accrued in the judgment upon the mortgage to the Pottsville Building and Saving Fund Association, and of the costs of the audit, be distributed and paid to the appellants.</p>
