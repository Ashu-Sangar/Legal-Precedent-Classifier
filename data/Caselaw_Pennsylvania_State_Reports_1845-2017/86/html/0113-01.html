    <p id="AIp" data-blocks='[["BL_114.8",114,[306,1250,1174,853]]]'>—In Pennsylvania, since the Wills Act of 1833, a lapsed devise passes by the residuary clause if it be sufficiently clear and comprehensive to embrace it: Patterson <em>v. </em>Swallow, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20487" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Wright 487">8 Wright 487</a>. The Act of April 8th 1833, Purd. Dig. 1476, pi. 11, declares: “The real estate acquired by a testator after making his will shall pass by a general devise, unless a contrary intention be manifested on the face of the will.” The Massachusetts statute, R. S. C. 62, sect. 3, provides: “That any estate, right, or interest in lands acquired by the testator after the making of his will, shall pass thereby in like manner as if possessed at the time of making the will, if such shall clearly and manifestly appear by the will to have been the intention of the testator.” This'latter statute has the effect of changing the rule of construction that the residuary devisee can take only what at the date of the will was intended for him. It takes from residuary devises their specific character, and removes all ground of distinction between them and residuary bequests: Prescott <em>v. </em>Prescott, 7 Metcalf 141; Thayer <em>v. </em>Wellington, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Allen%20295" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Allen 295">9 Allen 295</a>; Allen <em>v. </em>White, <a href="/mass/97/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="97 Mass. 504" data-case-ids="707633" data-case-paths="/mass/97/0504-01">97 Mass. 504</a>. The same effect is ascribed to a similar statute in Maine, Drew <em>v. </em>Wakefield, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Me.%20296" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="54 Me. 296">54 Maine 296</a>.</p>

The words of the Massachusetts statute are much broader than ours, and the case of Drew v. Wakefield, in Maine, was not one of a lapsed devise, but one in which the special devise was upon a condition precedent which had never been performed. The New York decisions, upon their statute, which is similar to our own, favor our contention that it does not apply to lapsed devises: Van Cortland <em>v. </em>Kip, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Hill%20596" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Hill 596">1 Hill 596</a>; Waring <em>v. </em>Waring, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Barb.%20556" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="17 Barb. 556">17 Barb. 556</a>. What was said .in Patterson <em>v. </em>Swallow, <em>supra, </em>as to the effect of the statute upon lapsed devises, were mere dicta, for it was the case of a void devise. No specific devise had in fact been made. The decisions which gave the lapsed devise to the heir were based on the distinction between realty and personalty. The heir could only be disinherited by express words or necessary implication.</p>

    <p id="b115-8" data-blocks='[["BL_115.12",115,[159,1412,1178,645]]]'>Where the language of a residuary clause in a will has sufficient scope and extent, evincing the intent of the testator to take up and carry into the residuary estate all of his estate remaining'at his death undisposed for any reason, the residuary clause will receive and pass a lapsed devise. This follows from the manifest intent of the testator himself. Such was one of the aspects of Patterson <em>v. </em>Swallow, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20490" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Wright 490">8 Wright 490</a>, where the residuary words were: “ All the rest and residue of my real estate, <em>whieh does not pass by virtue of my will </em>and codicil I give, devise,” &amp;c. In his opinion Justice Woodward considers the italicised words as having a strong indication of the testator’s desire. Patterson <em>v. </em>Swallow was decided, however, on the ground that the antecedent blank legacies were void, and therefore nothing did or could pass under these bequests; in fact, they were no bequests, for there was no one named to take.</p>
    <p id="b115-9" data-blocks='[["BL_115.13",115,[159,2067,1176,391]],["BL_116.1",116,[288,421,1171,218]]]'>But where the residuary clause does not by its own terms take in a lapsed devise, so as to disclose the intent of the testator to pass the lapsed estate into the residue, the rule is different. This we consider settled: Neff’s Appeal, 2 P. F. Smith 326. That case was elaborately considered by the late Justice Read, and many authorities cited bearing on the question. The language there was: “ The rest (that is all), residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, whatsoever, I give, devise and bequeath to my sons,” &amp;c. This broad language was held in<a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>sufficient to carry the lapsed share into the residuary clause. While broad, it did not indicate a special intent to pass over lapsed shares into the residue. The language of the will of Mary P. Loxley is certainly no stronger, and evinces no certainty of intent to take up lapsed portions of the estate and pass them into the residue.</p>
