The prothonotary taxed the costs at $125.40, which included the fees of five witnesses, who were in attendance at the trial, but who either did not testify or knew nothing about the case. From this taxation of the costs McCauley appealed, and the court below dismissed the appeal. McCauley then took this certiorari and appeal, alleging that the court therein erred.</p>
