Stewart, the purchaser of the premises upon which said mortgage was secured, and who took a deed to said premises “ under and subject” to said mortgage. The mortgage was for $1200, dated April 3d 1873, made by John Haas to Thomas C. Price, who assigned it to Charles S. Potter, on the 29th of November 1873, who on the same day assigned it to the plaintiffs. On the 22d of May 187 5, W. M. Durant, the owner of the property, sold it to Stewart, the defendant, the deed being made subject to the payment of the foregoing mortgage. Stewart received the rents and paid the first instalment of interest, but refused to pay the second, whereupon a scire facias issued upon the mortgage and the property was sold for $950. A balance of $511.15 still remained due upon the mortgage, and the plaintiff brought this suit therefor, contending that defendant was liable by reason of the clause in the deed “ under and subject” to the payment of the mortgage debt. At the trial, before Elcock, J., the defendant offered to prove “ that he was a mere naked trustee, without knowledge or personal interest; that the real purchaser was John Jennings; that he took the title to oblige Jennings, without consideration, and paid nothing for the property; that he never dealt as a purchaser with Durant, the grantor, directly or indirectly, and that the conveyance was made to him merely in pursuance of his desire to oblige, and merely in trust, and at the time of the deed in evidence all these facts were known to Durant, the grantor ; that Stewart never knew anything of the terms of the deed until after its execution, and until it was brought to him by Durant, the grantor, and Jennings, the real purchaser, duly executed.”</p>

We submit that the principle is unsound, and contrary to the well-settled law of this state. Ross <em>v. </em>Hanna was brought to this court on writ of error, but was not prosecuted. If it is apparent that the plaintiffs would have no right of action for want of a privity of contract, we infer that this court would not interfere with the verdict, even if the other reasons herein urged were considered insufficient.</p>

He was merely a dry trustee, to whom the property came by the acts of others, and not his own. He is clearly not liable for the mortgage debt under such circumstances. The property was bound for it, but not himself personally. The criterion of personal liability, for an encumbrance to which property is subjected, appears to be the contract or consent of the purchaser to become bound for it where the debt forms a part of the price or consideration he is to pay for the encumbered property. His undertaking to páy the encumbrances <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>is a contract with his vendor.
