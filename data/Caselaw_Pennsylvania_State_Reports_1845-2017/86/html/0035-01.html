Mrs. Winternitz, a married woman, was engaged in the grocery and provision business in the city of New Castle, Lawrence county. She was living apart from her husband. In 1871 she obtained a decree from the Court of Common Pleas of said county, authorizing her to act as a feme sole trader. In 1873 she employed the plaintiff to paint and glaze two buildings owned by her, and Porter brought this suit to recover a balance alleged to be due for said work. The defendant, in addition to the usual pleas, pleaded her coverture.</p>

Smith 496. That was the case of a set-off for <em>maintenance </em>against a married woman, who never had acted or been declared a feme sole trader, and whose husband was residing in the same city and engaged in business. It was simply an attempt to make a married woman’s separate estate liable for her husband’s proper debt, contrary to the provisions of the Act of 1848. Here, however, Mrs. Winternitz was not only living apart, and an <em>actual </em>feme sole trader, but had been duly declared such by the couz-t. She was also the owner of real estate, and the debt was contracted by hez’self for repairs to her real estate. It was a debt for which her own estate was properly liable, and she had conducted herself toward it as one who is a feme sole. Being liable for the debt, and having at law the power to sue and be sued without joining her husband with her, it would be rather a fanciful distinction to hold that her husband must be joined with her in this suit — in other words, to hold that, as to all contracts concerning her grocery business, she could sue or be sued alone ; but that she cannot sue for the rent of her <em>real </em>estate, or be sued for its repairs without joining her husband. The case is cleaidy within the spirit of the Acts of 1718 and 1855 when taken together, and not against the Act of 1848. In the case of Cleaver <em>v. </em>Scheetz, the wife was neither liable for the debt, nor a feme sole trader; in fact or in law. That case does not refer to or in any manner speak of the exceptional liability of a married woman for necessary repairs and improvements to her sepai’ate real estate, which has been held to arise under the spirit of the Act of 1848. It therefore in no sense governs this case.</p>
