Rhoads, to the order of Charles M. Fauth, and endorsed by Charles M. Fauth, Charles L. Oberle and Schmidt &amp; Heil in the order named. Oberle put in an affidavit of defence, wherein he averred that he was informed, believed and expected to be able to prove, that Fauth was the real owner and holder of the note, and that the suit was brought for his benefit and not for that of plaintiffs, who were merely nominal holders. The court held this affidavit was insufficient, and entered judgment for the plaintiffs, which action defendant assigned for error.</p>

Prima facie he would be entitled to recover; but the defendant put in an affidavit of defence, averring that he is informed and believes, and expects to be able to prove, that the suit <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>is brought for the use and benefit of Charles M. Fauth (payee and first endorser), who is the real owner and holder of said note, and not for the benefit of the plaintiffs, who are merely nominal holders. This averment was sufficient to carry the case to a jury. Fauth is responsible, as payee and first endorser, to every subsequent endorser.. Hence, if Schmidt &amp; Heil are allowed to recover against Oberle, the next preceding endorser, he, in turn, would have his remedy against .Fauth. It is plain that the latter can have no right of action against any of the subsequent endorsers, and if he is really the owner of the note, as alleged in the affidavit, and this suit was brought for his benefit, there can be no recovery.</p>
