A. Humphreys, to pay the net income thereof, for life, to his widow, L. W. Humphreys, and at her death the testator gave his whole estate to the trustee <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>and his heirs. The trustee was also appointed executor of testator’s will. No trust accounts were ever filed in court. Income was collected semi-annually, and statements rendered, which were signed by the trustee and by the <em>cestui que trust. </em>These were accounts of income. No commissions had ever been charged in any [of these statements. The <em>cestui que trust </em>died August 11th 1876. At the time of her death the semi-annual interest, due on the 1st of July next previous, had not been paid over to the <em>cestui que trust. </em>The trustee filed his first and final account in the Orphans’ Court, October 5th 1876, and claimed a commission of five per centum ($2684.64) upon the amount of income actually collected ($53,692.86) during the five years of the trust, less certain small expenses attending such collection, and craved allowance out of the fund then in his hands.</p>

If he does not do so, he waives his right, and cannot seek to obtain it from some other fund. Even though the trustee may have managed the estate in such a way as to greatly enhance its value to the remainder-man, he cannot, if he chooses to pay all of the income to the life-tenant, subsequently charge the commissions upon the principal: Biddle’s Appeal, 2 Norris 340. If such a charge cannot be made against the remainder-man, who has been benefited, much less should it be made against the heirs or legatees of the life-tenant, who has had no benefit whatever. Where a trustee has for years rendered semiannual statements to his <em>cestui que trust, </em>of which duplicates were signed by both, and a copy retained by each of them, the latter has a right to consider these statements as settlements in favor of all claims, for in them were charged the expenses attending their collection, and other charges in relation thereto. There was no evidence that the <em>cestui que trust </em>was ever informed that commissions would be charged, and the length of time that elapsed rebuts any presumption that they would be: Barton’s Estate, 1 Pars.

The amount of <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>compensation due to a trustee depends upon the circumstances of each case. The rate has never been definitely established. It is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the court, dependent upon the amount of labor and shill expended by the trustee, and the risk and inconvenience attendant upon the discharge of his duties: Askew <em>v. </em>Odenheimer, Baldwin’s Rep. 380; Burr <em>v. </em>McEwen, <em>et </em>al., Id. 154; Pusey <em>v. </em>Clemson, 9 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 209; Walker’s Estate, Id. 225; McElhenny’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20347" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Wright 347">10 Wright 347</a>; Perry on Trusts, vol. 11, §§ 916, 918; Bispham’s Eq., § 144, p. 148; Spangler’s Estate, 9 Harris 337; Copely’s Appeal, 1 Norris 143.</p>

F. Smith 307.. Biddle’s Appeal, 2 Norris 340, has no application to the facts of this case. The <em>corpus </em>of the life-tenant’s estate is not looked to for payment. The claim is made to payment out of an instalment of income still in the hands of the trustee. The semi-annual statements were not formal accounts, nor were they formally accepted by the life-tenant. The signature of the trustee merely verified or identified the accounts. There is no proof that the trustee ever told the <em>cestui que trust </em>that he did not intend to charge commissions. The real intention of the parties is unknown. Certainty is essential to all estoppels. Certainty existed in Barton’s Estate. It was found as a fact that the trustee never intended to claim any commissions.</p>

The owner of the income had the advantage of the use of her whole income, and unless she had been so misled by the other acts of the accountant as to give these semi-annual statements the effect of an estoppel, the mere delay in claiming the commissions was not in itself an act of estoppel.
