If it was a question of doubt as to what the contract between the parties was, it should have been at least left to the jury to determine whether the insured assented to the conditions, without which express assent they could form no part of the contract. It is well settled that where a condition restricting the liability of a carrier, who is an insurer, is printed upon the back of the evidence of the contract, the ticket, or bill of lading, it can, under no circumstances, unless by the terms of the contract itself, made a part thereof, be considered more than a mere notice limiting the common-law liability ; and the defendants, upon whom the burden of proof is cast, must, in such cases, affirmatively show that the notice was brought to the attention of the party to be bound by it: Henderson <em>v. </em>Stevenson, House of Lords, on appeal from the Court of Sessions in Scotland, 27 L.

Not only do they, in fact, appear upon the instrument itself, accepted by the assured, and presumably were noticed by him, but they are referred to in the body of the policy, which declares that payment is to be made sixty days after the notice, proof and adjustment of the loss, “in conformity to the conditions annexed to this policy.” The assured was thus referred to the “annexed conditions,” in order to find those affecting the payment of his loss, and necessarily must discover the others in doing so. It would be going too far to say that he did not accept his policy affected by the conditions printed upon it, and thus referred to. Under the 17th condition the policy ceases <em>ipso facto, </em>when the insured property is levied upon, or taken into possession or custody, under any proceeding in law or equity. The next clause is, “ and should there, during the life of this policy, an encumbrance fall or be executed upon the property insured, sufficient to reduce the real interest of the insured in the same to a sum only equal to <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>or below the amount insured, and he neglect or fail to obtain the consent of the company thereto, then and in that case the policy shall he void.” The former clause having relation to an act of law, this is intended to protect the company against the. act of the assured himself. Hence, if he suffer a judgment to be entered against him, the encumbrance <em>falls, </em>and if he executes a mortgage, it is <em>executed </em>upon the property, and he must give notice and obtain consent; or, otherwise, if the encumbrance gives another a right, and lessens his own interest in the property to a sum not exceeding the amount in the policy, he forfeits his policy.</p>
