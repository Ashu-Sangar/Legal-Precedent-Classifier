Stones having died, the case proceeded in the name of Tallman alone. The action was to recover on an alleged promise of the defendant to pay the debt of Philip Wilson. It appeared that the latter, in 1867, owed Stones &amp; Co. $1662.33, and was at the same time indebted to Justice in the sum of $23,000. Wilson testified that Stones &amp; Co. pressed their claim for settlement, and he then made a transfer of his property to Justice, with the understanding that the latter would pay this claim. His testimony in regard to this alleged agreement was: <em>“ </em>My indebtedness being very large to Mr. Justice, he naturally wanted to get all he could of his claim. Before handing him certain notes which I had received from Mr. Westcott, I stated to him my indebtedness to Mr. Stones, and I understood him to say that he would see that matter settled.” And again; <em>“ </em>I placed ^he whole of the assets received from Gideon. G. Westcott, viz., house and lot in West Philadelphia, and notes above mentioned, in the hands of Mr. Philip S. Justice, the defendant, with the understanding, as I suppose, that this indebtedness would he paid.”</p>

The jury having found the promise or undertaking of Mr. Justice to Philip Wilson to pay E. Gr. Stones &amp; Co. their debt out of the funds then placed by Wilson in the hands of Justice, the case falls within the class known as the exceptions to the Statute of Frauds, and the promise is not simply to pay the debt of another, hut to hand over funds appropriated by the debtor himself to the creditor for whose use he deposits them. In such case the creditor, though not present, is the party to be benefited, and becomes the owner of the fund thus impressed with a trust for him and can sue for it: Townsend <em>v. </em>Long, 27 P.
