The constitution does not, of itself, exempt any property; it merely permits the legislature to do so within certain limits. The first question, therefore, is whether the complainant’s case is within the Act of 18-74, and this we think so clear that it may be considered and dismissed briefly. The complainant is an ‘association or institution of learning.’ The educational influence of great libraries has been recognised by all civilized people in all ages. They have been the refuge and preservers of knowledge in the darkest times of ignorance and superstition; the source and’rallying point of awakened interest in philosophy and science, wherever the human mind has aroused itself to a new search for intellectual light; and the glory and pride of nations, in exact proportion as they have attained a higher plane of enlightened and progressive civilization. It is the concurrent and universal opinion of scholars that no single event in recorded history has been so great a misfortune to the interests of pure learning as the destruction of the Alexandrine Library.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b309-7" data-blocks='[["BL_309.5",309,[198,1346,1174,734]]]'>“The complainant was founded in 1731, by Benjamin Franklin, James Logan, and others, not only as an institution of learning, but undoubtedly as a charity, within- the long-settled and clearly-defined legal meaning of that term. In 1742, it was incorporated by letters-patent from the proprietaries of Pennsylvania, who recited in their patent that the founders had, ‘at a great expense, purchased a large and valuable collection of useful books, in order to erect a library for the advancement of knowledge and literature in the city of Philadelphia.’ This library subsequently received the accession of the library of James Logan, in its time, and for many years afterwards, the most valuable collection of books in’ America, and has, from time to time, been added to and endowed by gifts, bequests, and accumulations from various sources, including subscriptions and annual payments by members of the corporation. We do not think it admits of doubt that it is not only an institution of learning, but that it is also founded, endowed, and maintained by charity, within the meaning of the Act of 1874.</p>

It is conceded that the legislature cannot go outside of the class of cases in which the constitution permits exemption from taxation, but it is to be remembered that the provision of the constitution is not a grant of power to the legislature, which belongs elsewhere, and is therefore to be strictly construed as in derogation of the people’s right. On the contrary, it is a restriction upon a legislative power which -would <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>otherwise be unlimited and unquestionable. It is a tying up of the legislative hand, and, therefore, to be. construed in a liberal spirit to remedy the mischief at which it was aimed, and not further unnecessarily to fetter the proper governmental powers of the people’s representatives.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[281,627,1169,1163]]]'>“ The power of a court to set aside the legislative will is unknown, except in American jurisprudence. . The authority of an Act of Parliament is supreme and unquestionable in- the country from which we derive our laws and the fundamental principles of our political liberty, and in the early days of the republic, it was not without grave doubts and serious opposition, that the judicial power was carried to this extent even here. And though it is now firmly settled that the courts are the ultimate interpreters of the constitution, and that all acts or legislation which are forbidden by the constitution are to be declared void, yet it is equally well settled that this power can only be exercised where there is a clear and undoubted infringement of the constitution. In all cases the presumption is in favor of the validity of the legislative act, and where there is room for doubt, this presumption must prevail. Especially is great respect due to the legislative construction of a constitutional provision where, as in the present case, it is a question, not of private right, but of public policy. For the preservation of individual rights, whether as between man and man, or between the citizens and the public, or the government, the courts are the natural guardians, with special advantages of training and modes of procedure for the attainment of justice, but for the preservation, as well as for the determination in the first instance, of matters of state policy, the proper tribunal is the legislature; and its construction of a constitutional mandate upon this subject, must be held binding and conclusive until shown clearly and beyond all question, to be in violation of the intention of the people in their sovereign expression of their will through the constitution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b310-7" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[281,1791,1162,688]]]'>“These principles are trite; but the haste and crudity of.much recent legislation has required such frequent exercise of the judicial power to keep it within constitutional bounds, that the delicacy and exceptional nature of the power is too commonly lost sight of, and I have thought it proper to recall its true limits, familiar as they are, because of the tone of argument for the defendant in the present case, which assumes that as exemption from taxation is a special privilege, it must be clearly shown, and that it is, therefore, sufScient for the defendant to show a doubt to defeat the complainant’s case. Such certainly is the rule in determining whether or not exemption' has been granted to any particular claimant by an Act of Assembly. The sovereign power of taxation is never to be taken away except by a clear grant. But where the legislature has clearly intended the exemption, the validity of that act must be assumed like all others, until clearly shown to be beyond the legislative authority.</p>

As already-said, it exempts nothing, but it authorizes the legislature, by general laws, to exempt, speaking generally: First, public property; second, actual places of religious worship; third, burial-places not for profit; and fourth, ‘institutions of purely public charity.’ The last is the only class with which we are directly concerned, though, as we shall see, some light can be had from the language used in describing the others.</p>

The large majority, however, were true charities, both in the legal and popular sense, and were worthy objects of legislative aid; but it was felt to be a hardship that that aid should be rendered as a matter of individual favoritism granted to one and withheld from another, as the views of successive legislatures might be more or less liberal on the subject. To remedy this evil, the new constitution provided, first and chiefly, that all exemptions from taxation should be by general laws; and secondly, that those laws should include only the classes of property named. Bearing in mind that institutions of public benevolence for the poor, hospitals, literary, scientific and educational institutions, and most of the military institutions in class 6 above (being like the Lincoln Institute and Soldiers’ Orphan Schools), are all included under the general class of public charities, it is plain that, tried even by.the standard of <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>the present constitution, the long list of exemptions in the one hundred and thirty acts referred to would still he valid, except so for as they include church property not used for public worship, cemeteries for private profit, and institutions of private benevolence. This comparison of the legislation of the last quarter of a century on the subject, with the legislation still permitted under the present constitution, demonstrates clearly that the primary intent of this constitutional provision, as of so many others in the same instrument, was not so much to limit the scope of exemptions to charities as to destroy the obnoxious feature of favoritism by special legislation ; the key-note to the whole clause is in the permission to exempt only by general laws.</p>

The moment the word is used in connection with the present subject-matter of charitable gifts or charitable institutions, the popular as -well as legal mind' takes in at once its wider scope of good-will, benevolence, desire to add to the happiness or improvement of our fellow-beings. It is in this sense that, not to mention the numerous other illustrations, our own local gifts of Elliott Oresson, for the planting of shade trees in the streets of Philadelphia (Cresson’s Appeal, 6 Casey 437), and a gift to a volunteer fire company for the protection of the property of the citizens (Thomas <em>v. </em>Ellmaker, 1 Pars. 98), have been recognised as charities, both in the legal and in the popular estimation.</p>

So there is no charity conceivable which will not, in its practical operation, exclude a large part of mankind, and there are few which do not do so in express terms, or by the restrictive force of the description of the persons for whose benefit they are intended. Thus, Girard College excludes, by a single word, half the public, by requiring that only <em>male </em>children shall be received; the great Pennsylvania Hospital closes its gates'to all but <em>recent </em>injuries, yet no one. questions that they are public charities in the widest and most exacting sense.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Tried by this standard, it would seem clear that the Philadelphia Library is public so far at least as regards the use of the books within the building; that is free to all alike without charge. Is its public character destroyed by any special privileges to members or other individuals? -We cannot see that it is. Some system of government, some regulations of administration, are necessary in all large bodies; provided they be reasonable and not repugnant to the general purpose, they are valid and do not affect the character of the institution. The general privilege of reading the books within the building, and under the supervision of the librarian, being conceded freely to all, the further privilege is sought of taking books away to be read at home, and this we find is also conceded'to all persons alike, on the condition that a deposit shall be made of the value of the book to insure its return, and a sum paid for its hire or loan. A step farther brings us to the third and last privilege, that of members, who, instead of paying the hire of each book from time to time, as they take it out, pay a single annual sum as an equivalent. The principle of commutation is familiar. It is as old as the history of tithings in England, as universal as the convenience and the necessities of business everywhere. The law prohibits a common carrier from discriminating between persons; it requires him to carry all men the same journey for the same price; yet there is probably no railroad in the country that does not issue season or mileage tickets, or commutation in some form or other, to its local customers, and this has never been held to impair or infringe upon its public character as a common carrier. Such regulations, within reasonable limits, are mere <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>administrative details, necessary in all but the most insignificant business, and not in any way affecting the general character of the institution.</p>

Plainly, then the charities authorized to be exempted are those that are completely and entirely public. The phrase is intended to exclude those charities which are private or only quasi public, such as many religious aid societies, and also those Avhich, though public to some extent or for some purposes, have, like Masonic lodges and similar charities, some mixture of private with their public character. The true test is to be found in the objects of the institution. Are they entirely for the accomplishment of the public purpose, or have, they some intermixture of private or individual gain? We get a clear and strong light on this subject from the words of the same clause of the constitution descriptive of burial places which may be exempted, to wit, those ‘not used or held for private or corporate profit.’ Such places .are unquestionably public charities, and the specification of them might have been omitted without impairing the force of the provision. But, as we have seen, the exemption of cemeteries had been recently abused by including some that were wholly for private profit, and the constitution was made to emphasize its prohibition of such acts by specifically naming those burial-places which alone might be exempted. Having done this, it passed on to name concisely and collectively all .other institutions of purely public charity. The phrase might have been expressed, ‘places of burial and other institutions of public charity, not for private or corporate profit.’ The language used, taken as a consistent and consecutive whole, shows that this is its plain meaning.</p>

The stock is also bought subject to the approval of the board of directors, and under such a Regulation every one could not become a member, for if a member object, how could, the stock be transferred ?

It is state policy to foster such institutions as these libraries. If they are taxable, they are liable to confiscation, for their income is wholly inadequate to the purpose of taxation. The words “purely public charity” are a direction to the legislature to prohibit what was an old and flagrant abuse, the exemption of private property, such as Odd-fellows’ halls. These words are terms of art, and are as technical a definition of a class of property as a freehold. This library is a charitable use, and it is the duty of the state to see that it is administered for. the charity. The ground upon which this charity was granted exemption was that of “being a public beneficial use for the benefit of the community as a community.”</p>
