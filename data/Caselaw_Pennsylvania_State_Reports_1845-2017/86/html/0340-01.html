    <p class="headnotes" id="b340-9" data-blocks='[["BL_340.7",340,[295,1275,1170,453]]]'>The Bank of Brandywine, incorporated by the legislature of the state, prior to the adoption of the new constitution, was authorized by its charter to borrow money by mortgage of its real estate. It executed a mortgage upon its bank building, to secure a loan, and some time thereafter was compelled by its embarassments to make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors. Proceedings were instituted to foreclose the mortgage, when the assignee applied to the court for an injunction to restrain the collection of the debt, on the ground that the mortgage was unlawfully created, inasmuch as the bank had'not complied with the provisions of sect. 7, art. 16 of the constitution, prescribing the mode in which the indebtedness of corporations is to be incurred, and the Act of April 18th 1874 enacted to carry the section into effect. The court below granted a preliminary injunction: Held, that the injunction should not have been granted.</p>

Paschal a bond and mortgage upon its bank building, to secure a loan of $15,000. This bond and mortgage were purchased by the defendant, Lewis, on the 2d of July 1874, who believed it a safe and permanent investment, and who received from the bank, at the same time, a declaration that it had no set-off. . The mortgage was made in pursuance of a resolution of a majority of the board of directors of the bank, and it subsequently had the approval of a majority of the stockholders at the first annual meeting thereafter, in May 1875. One of the directors who passed the resolution to create the mortgage was Charles Dingee, the president of the Dingee and Conard Company, and it appeared the money to be raised thereon was to be applied to the discharge of a mortgage upon the real estate of said company, a foreclosure of which was threatened, and which it was found would endanger a large indebtedness of the company which the bank held. It .appeared, however, that a first mortgage upon the real estate of the company was held by the bank, and the aggregate indebtedness of the latter was not therefore increased by the creation of the mortgage in suit. Two semi-annual payments of interest were made to Mr. Lewis, and until the filing of this bill no objection whatever was made to the validity of the mortgage. The bank soon thereafter became embarrassed, and made an assignment to the complainant for the benefit of creditors on the 22d of December 1875. The assignee sold the bank building for $19,700, and alleging that by reason of this mortgage a cloud was cast upon the title, and he was prevented from making a marketable title to the property, he prayed in the bill filed: 1. that the said creation of the indebtedness of $15,000 be declared unlawful. 2. That the <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>mortgage be declared void and delivered up to be cancelled. 3.

If there had been any doubt as to the application of the pi’ohibition of this section of the constitution, it might be expected to be found and settled in the legislation which was to carry out the constitutional provision. The language of the act is as positive and general as the constitution. It affords no inference that any such doubt existed in the minds of the legislators. The manifest object of the constitution and the act is, that owners of corporate property shall have some supervision over that property and over their agents. We do not see how the second section of the schedule helps the argument of the defendant. What right is interfered with by giving the stockholders an opportunity to pass upon the question of mortgaging his property ? What right is obstructed in staying for a time the inundation of debt ? What vested right has the agent to endanger the property of the principal without his consent ? If, however, this is no answer, a complete one may be found in the fact, that the legislature, in the charter which created the bank, reserved the right to alter or rescind any of its provisions. The Act of April 18th 1874 is the exercise of that right. The directors of the bank made the mortgage against the prohibition of the constitution and the Act of Assembly. This was not merely <em>ultra vires, </em>it was unlawful, and therefore void, and could not be ratified: Fowler <em>v. </em>Scully, 22 P. F. Smith 456. Are bonds and mortgages within the term ‘indebtedness.’ There surely cannot be higher or more dangerous debts, as applied to corporations. When it is considered that chattel mortgages may be so gen erally applied, it becomes evident that mortgages of all kinds are the very debts against which the stockholder might find his only protection, in the law which requires his consent. A mortgage <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>upon the place of business and machinery of a manufacturing, printing, or publishing company; or upon the real estate and rolling stock of a steam or street railway, might be the surest and swiftest means of destruction. It is not necessary for us to refine upon the wórd ‘indebtedness,’ or to enlarge or restrict its general meaning. If, as has been argued by the defendant, a strict and literal reading of the constitution and’ act would prevent the receipt of deposits, and compel a cash business in all cases, we will wait until the exigencies call upon us to act. The present case involves no such questions. We now say only, that a bond and mortgage are within the meaning and intention of the law. This case furnishes a fitting example of the evil which was intended to be guarded against by the constitution. Three directors create a debt, not to meet an emergency of the business of the bank, but to lend the proceeds to a corporation, the president of which is one of the three directors. From such financiering, what but insolvency can result ?</p>
