He died July 21st 1873, having survived his wife but three or four weeks.

Decedent subsequently, on September 29th 1871, executed a codicil to his will wherein he bequeathed to his wife the sum of $1150, payable one year after his decease, an annuity of twelve dollars per month and certain real estate for life. During the period between the death of his wife and his own, Murphy, in conversation with different persons, frequently referred to the paper written by him at her request. To one he stated, if his life was spared he would settle that account, and whatever was “ for” his wife he would settle. To another, that if he lived three or four weeks he would pay eleven hundred and fifty.dollars to his wife’s sister, Mrs. Collins, and that this money was for his wife’s friends; that she was a <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>very worthy woman ; and had that amount of money herself. He specified the amount and said it was the same as that contained in his will, and she wanted that amount distributed. Decedent also inquired of the sister of his deceased wife'in regard to this paper, and upon being shown it, said, “Yes, that is my handwriting; I did this according to her wishes, and if I live three or four weeks I will pay this off.” He also said, “ My will says a year, but I will not keep it that long;” that she (the witness) should keep the paper, and show it to his executors, and they would pay the money. Testator further stated to this witness he had invested his wife’s' money in bonds. These bonds were in the possession of the executors of decedent after his death, but were not accounted for nor inventoried, and formed the subject of a surcharge against them by the auditor.</p>

It was never considered by either of them in the nature of a loan, or to be held by him in trust for her. This being the case, and the receipt of the money by the husband having been prior to the statute of April 11th 1848, without any cotemporaneous declaration or admission that he received and held the same in trust for her, is sufficient to work a change of ownership: Gochenaur’s Estate, 11 Harris 460. No ante-nuptial agreement by parol was shown, whereby the parties agreed that the money should remain the property of the wife.

A positive and clear declaration at the time of receiving the wife’s chose in action (previous to 1848), may be sufficient to establish the husband as a trustee for the wife; but loose declarations of an intention to repay the money are not enough: Johnston <em>v. </em>Johnston’s Admr., 7 Casey 450.

In order to award payment of the claims of the persons named in the paper dated June 22d 1871, the auditor has construed it as a declaration by the testator that he held the sum of $1150 in trust for his wife; that she, the cestui que trust, had then directed him, her trustee, to dispose of the money mentioned therein in the manner indicated; that he assented <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>thereto, and thenceforth held the money as trustee for the parties named in the paper, and no longer for his wife, and that the testator agreed to execute the trust in one year after his wife’s death. In this view we think the auditor was in error. That said paper was never prepared as a declaration of trust is apparent, and from the testimony in behalf of the claimants it appeared that the paper was written as, and for, the last will of Mrs. Murphy, who after-wards delivered it into the custody of a sister for safe-keeping. At the date of this paper the testator had already executed his will, whereby he bequeathed to his wife only a legacy of $1000, payable one year after his decease. This was not satisfactory to her, and no doubt the testator then agreed to increase her legacy to $1150, the amount she had given him on her marriage, and in case of her death before him, to pay and distribute the same among her relatives and friends named in the paper he had written at her dictation.</p>

It was a promise without consideration, and the persons named in the paper are but volunteers. If this paper constituted a declaration of trust, and had the wife survived her husband, she would probably have been-entitled to both her legacy and the like amount as cestui que trust. This certainly was not intended by the testator. The auditor to a great extent relied upon the promises of testator after the death of his wife, but these were merely declaratory of an intention never performed, and an agreement and undertaking without consideration. It is almost unnecessary to cite authorities to sustain the views entertained by us in disposing of the questions submitted. In Hill on Trustees, pages 91 and 126, the fundamental principle is laid down that in order to fasten a trust on property of any description, by means of parol declarations, the expressions used must amount to a clear and explicit declaration of trust. Loose and indefinite expressions, and such as indicate only an incomplete and executory intention, are insufficient for this purpose.</p>

However, it has been held that a blood consideration was sufficient to support an executory trust in equity, at least where the instrument was under seal: See above. But in this state, in Campbell’s Estate, 7 Barr 100, it was held that natural love and affection was not a sufficient consideration for an equitable assignment.

On another occasion, when told by an acquaintance that he thought that the money obtained from Ireland should go to Mrs. Gray and her children, the decedent said ‘they should have it,’ and he did not intend to claim it as his own. And again, when another acquaintance ‘ put it at him ’ that he had the money of Mrs. Gray, he admitted it, and said she and her children should have it. Mrs. Gray claimed this five hundred dollars from her husband’s estate, and the auditor awarded her the amount, with interest.

The court below reversed this finding of the auditor. Upon a careful examination of the evidence, Ave are by no means sure that he was so clearly wrong that his finding of the facts should have been reversed. It must be conceded that the decedent had the right to convert the money. It was evidently the proceeds of property derived by Mrs. Murphy from her parents, at the time of her marriage with the decedent in 1830. At that time there was no statute protecting the separate estates of married women, and his right of conversion ay as clear. But there Avas evidence, not overwhelming, it is true, but sufficient to go to a jury in a common-law proceeding and to sustain a verdict, that the decedent did not convert, and never intended to convert, the money to his OAYn use. The finding of the auditor upon an issue of fact being like the verdict of a jury, ought not to be set aside because it might have been the other Avay. Unless it ought to have been the other way, and was clearly Avrong, it should - not be disturbed. But if we were to reverse the decree upon this point it AYOuld not help the <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>appellants. Assuming that there had been no conversion, and that the decedent held the $1150 in trust for his wife ; that it was her money, to dispose of as she saw proper, have the appellants any valid claim upon it ? The answer to this question depends upon what Mrs. Murphy did to confer such right. It is very plain that any promise made by the decedent not based upon a valid disposition of the money by his wife, would be without consideration and void. The facts are that in the year 1871, his wife being ill at the time, the decedent, at her express direction, wrote, down on a piece of paper the following words :—</p>

What is the effect of this paper ? Was it intended as a present irrevocable gift to the parties named therein, or was. it intended as a testamentary paper merely ? There was nothing to indicate that it was a present gift. She had no idea of parting with the money during her life. The contrary intent appears upon the face of the paper. She speaks of not being in good health and wishing “to make a devide of what I have past me to my friends.” Then her husband adds to the paper, “I, John Murphy I will Ancer this Bill in one year after the decease.” Whose decease ? Evidently the decease of Mrs. Murphy. Mrs. Collins testifies that Mrs. Murphy “ asked Mr. Murphy to write down how she wished her property to be distributed, and he wrote then this paper at her dictation.” The paper was evidently intended as a will. It was a rude attempt on the part of Mrs. Murphy to dispose of her property after her death. It is needless to say that the paper possessed none of the statutory requirements of such an instrument. The right of a married woman to make a will of her separate estate rests upon statute, and its provisions must be strictly complied with.' It was contended, however, that although the paper is invalid .as a will, it nevertheless creates a, trust in favor of the appellants; that the decedent, as her trustee, was bound to execute it, and has in fact promised to do so. Undoubtedly, if Mrs. Murphy had created a valid trust of this money, <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>assuming it to be her separate estate, her husband, in his lifetime, and his personal representatives since his death, could have been compelled to execute it. But this paper creates no trust that equity would enforce. Had it been in the nature of a present gift to the appellants, the case might have been different. But a paper which is evidently of a testamentary character, which was intended to operate as a will, and which is wholly invalid, cannot be turned into a declaration of trust, so as to operate as a will, and defeat the statute prescribing how the will of a married woman shall be executed. If, then, the paper is inoperative, either as a present gift or testamentary disposition of Mrs. Murphy’s money, it does not need an argument to show that the declaration of the decedent that he would “Ancer the Bill,” or pay the money to the appellants, amounts to nothing. In the absence of any legal liability or duty to pay, his promise to do so was a mere <em>nudum pactum.</em>
