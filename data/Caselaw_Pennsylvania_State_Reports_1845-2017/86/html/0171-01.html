The policy was dated December 4th 1874, and Kerns died October 14th 1875. Defendants, under the belief that the policy of insurance was not such an instrument as would support a judgment by default under the affidavit of defence law, filed no affidavit, and judgment was entered against them. This fact having beeen represented to the court in an affidavit filed, a rule to open the judgment was granted. One Kramer then filed an affidavit, which in substance averred “that he was the soliciting agent of the company, and received the application of Kerns; that the latter not being able to pay the whole of the first premium of $110.35, deponent took his note for the balance, upon the express agreement that if said note was not paid at maturity the policy should be void; that the note was as follows:—</p>

It is not only such a written declaration of non-payment, but it is a contract of even date, qualifying the terms of the policy, and an agreement that the policy shall be without effect and surrendered, in case the note for the premium be not paid. It therefore superseded the policy to the extent of the agreement. It would be a harsh measure of justice to hold the company to the terms of the policy, upon a concession made to the assured for his benefit, and evidenced by his own writing of even date with the delivery, and intended by him to govern his rights. Clearly the company caannot be held to the letter of a policy not paid for, and so altered for the benefit of the assured.</p>
