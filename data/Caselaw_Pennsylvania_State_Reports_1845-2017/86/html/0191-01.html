It was provided, however, that if Rogers should not have a theatre well built, costing at least $17,500, in one 'year from the date of the lease, he should pay rent for the first year; but if such a building should be completed at any time before the termination of the lease, this first year’s rent should be refunded. It was also provided that Rogers should pay in addition to the rent all license fees, and other charges, gas and water bills, Barclay paying the taxes, unless they were increased, in which case Rogers should pay' the excess, being entitled to a credit if they were 'diminished; that Barclay should not be called on for repairs, &amp;c., or to insure; but that Rogers should insure for at least $15,000, and assign the policies to Barclay as security that Rogers would perform his covenants, Barclay, however, being bound in case of a fire to apply the money recovered on the policies to rebuilding. All structures or erections were-to become the property of Barclay at the termination of the lease, and he was to have the right to buy all the personal property appurtenant to the theatre, at a value to be settled by reference if the parties could not agree. Rogers was not to use the premises for any unlawful purpose. He was allowed to assign or underlet. He had an option to buy on terms fixed at any time during the lease, Barclay, however, having the privilege, if Rogers did not buy for two years, upon giving Rogers sixty days’ notice, to sell said premises to anybody who would buy.</p>

It is true no rent was here to be charged for the first year, but it will not be urged that this would make the difference between a lease and a building agreement. It was a mere encouragement to take the lease. It is true, also, that the building, if erected, was to be left at the end of the term, but it must be remembered that the original structure was to be pulled down. There was no covenant to build. It is left to the option of the lessee. If he builds, it is for his own benefit, and not for the advantage of the owner. The true distinction is that where the lease contains a covenant on the part of the lessee to build, and is therefore a mere building agreement in disguise, the lessor is owner of the lessee contracts within the meaning of the lien laws: Woodward <em>v. </em>Leiby, 12 Casey 437; Leiby <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2063" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Wright 63">4 Wright 63</a>; Fisher <em>v. </em>Rush, 21 P.

The court below disregarded the averment of Rogers that the lien was not to be sued out until the mortgage ivas due, on the ground that this verbal agreement contradicted the written one.

Does it admit of argument that this was in fact a contract between Barclay and Rogers, by which the latter was to build a theatre, costing at least $17,500, upon the lot of the former, in consideration Avhereof Rogers Avas to have a lease of the premises for five years at a nominal rental, pay no rent for the first year, and also have the privilege of purchasing the property at a fixed price ? Barclay had it in his poAA'er to compel Rogers to build, by the provision making Rogers liable .for $8400 a year for the entire five years for what was an unproductive piece of property unless improved. What was the inducement to Rogers to “build a theatre upon his lessor’s land ?” It was this : “ erect a substantial theatre upon my lot costing at least $17,500,” says his lessor by the lease, “and I Avill contribute $8400 toAvards the cost by charging you no rent for the first year ; further, I will give you a lease for five years, and I also permit you to purchase the property at á fixed price upon easy terms.”</p>

Wainwright &amp; Bryant, in the agreement with Rogers, reserve in the most unequivocal manner all rights under the mechanic’s lien law, and leave themselves free to proceed forthwith. It is a strained construction that would make “forthwith” read “a year hence.” Rogers, in his affidavit, does not set forth anything as taking place or anything said at the execution of the agreement, which under the cases would be a ground for equity to relieve, nor was the parol evidence clear, precise and indubitable: Martin <em>v. </em>Berens, 17 P.

L. 474, so as to subject the ground and building to the lien of a mechanic or material-man. As was said by Chief Justice Lowrie, in Woodward <em>v. </em>Leiby, 12 Casey 441, “We do not confound building contracts, payable in rents, with improvement leases; though we do not anticipate experience by any theoretical definition of their exact differences. Our most common improvement leases provide only for such labor as is to be done by the tenant himself and his servants, and no question of mechanic’s lien can arise on them. But contracts of letting and building are infinitely various in their forms, and no definition of ours can prevent this variety, for none would be bound to conform to it; and we must be content to ascertain, as cases arise, the special character of each contract, and the class to which it belongs.” It will not do, therefore, to hold, as we have been strongly urged to do by the learned counsel of the plaintiff in error, that the presence of an express covenant by the lease to build, is that which distinguishes a building contract from an improvement lease. It is true there was such a covenant or agreement in Woodward <em>v. </em>Leiby, 12 Casey 437; Leiby <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2063" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Wright 63">4 Wright 63</a>; and Fisher <em>v. </em>Rush, 21 P.

The lessors there agreed to let the lessee erect, at his own expense, a shingle mill; to allow him to use timber on the tract; and the lessee was to pay the lessor a certain sum for every thousand shingles manufactured by him. It is true that in the latest case, Reid <em>v. </em>Kenney, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.N.C.%20452" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 W.N.C. 452">4 W. N. C. 452</a>, the absence of the covenant to build was relied on, but it was not all that was relied on, for after <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>stating that the lease contained a mere license, of which the lessee might or might not avail himself, the opinion adds : “ His omission to build, or his actual building, in no wise affected the' amount of the rent he was to pay.”</p>
    <p id="b196-7" data-blocks='[["BL_196.4",196,[321,609,1173,475]]]'>Considering the whole agreement before us, we think it falls within the category of a building contract. It is true that there is no express covenant to build; but the amount of the rent the lessee was to pay was directly affected by his omission to build, or his actual building. If he did proceed to erect the contemplated building, he was to he released from the payment of the stipulated •rent for the first year. In effect the lessor contributed this sum of $8840 towards the erection of the building. This lease is undoubtedly a very ingenious instrument; hut if we were to allow it to prevail as a mere improvement lease, the lien of mechanics and material-men might in every case be evaded.</p>
    <p id="b196-8" data-blocks='[["BL_196.5",196,[324,1085,1169,516]]]'>We think, however, that there was quite enough in the affidavits of Rogers and Barclay to carry the case to the jury. The former swears very positively, that at the execution of the agreement for the collateral, May 18th 1876, “it was then and there distinctly understood and agreed between plaintiffs and deponent that no proceeding would he had upon said mechanic’s claim until the maturity of said mortgage, which agreement was the consideration of said assignment, and upon the faith of said agreement deponent signed said paper.” This is precisely within the case of Miller <em>v. </em>Henderson, 10 S. &amp; R. 290; and the facts as sworn to by the affidavit would he evidence of fraud, where under all the cases parol evidence is admissible to vary the terms of a written contract.</p>
    <p id="b196-9" data-blocks='[["BL_196.6",196,[321,1601,1168,381]]]'>We think also there was sufficient in Barclay’s affidavit to prevent the entry of the judgment below. He says that he believes, and expects to be able to prove, that the labor and materials for which the claim had been filed, “were not furnished upon the credit of said land, but solely upon the transfer of other securities” to the plaintiff by the contractor, as he has narrated in the affidavit.
