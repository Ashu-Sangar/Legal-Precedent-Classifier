    <p class="summary" id="b219-13" data-blocks='[["BL_219.13",219,[208,1424,1175,773]]]'>Xavier Ditsche died intestate, in 1871, leaving a widow, the accountant, but no issue, nor father, nor mother. A brother, Conrad, and sister, Rosalie, survived him, the latter being intermarried, with Henry C. Woltemate. The auditor found that Xavier, Conrad and Rosalie were the illegitimate children of Elizabeth. Ditsche, who died in 1844. The balance of the fund for distribution, $15.-89.2.45, was claimed by the accountant, as the widow of the intestate, on the ground that he had died without heirs or known kindred. Rosalie and Conrad each claimed $3973.11, one-half the balance, after deducting the widow’s share, as sister and brother of the intestate, on the ground that they were entitled, even if illegitimate, under the third section of the Act of April 27th 1855, Purd. Dig. 810, pi. 40. The auditor held that Rosalie and Conrad were not sister and brother of Xavier Ditsche, nor were they entitled to inherit from him under the Act of 1855, and awarded the whole fund to the widow. Rosalie excepted to this report, but the court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the same, when she took this appeal.</p>

This is in accordance with the precise language of the act, to wit: “And they (illegitimate children) and their mothers shall respectively have capacity to take or inherit from each other.” This has been held to be the extent to which the legislature opened the door to illegitimates." As the mother of both the brother and sister, -whose supposed relationship had produced this controversy, died in 1844, not only before the passage of the Act of 1855, but long before the death of the intestate, Xavier Ditsche, there was no link in existence at the time of his death, to bind the brother and sister to each other in a legal bond. Xavier could not transmit to his mother, while his mother only if alive could have transmitted to her child, his sister. There was therefore no relationship between Xavier and Rosalie through which his estate could come to her, unless it be held that the purpose of the Act of 1855 was to legitimate bastards, an intent distinctly denied in Grubb’s Appeal, and reaffirmed in Steckel’s Appeal.</p>
