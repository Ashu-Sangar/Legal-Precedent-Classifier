McFarland and wife for a house and lot in the city of Titusville. The writ was served on both defendants, who were about to remove from the premises. Under a rule of court plaintiff filed a brief of title, which set forth that the property had been sold to him as the property of McFarland, under a judgment obtained against the latter. An order was made upon defendants to answer within twenty days, which they failed to do, but a sworn statement was filed by Milton Stewart, claiming title to the property by a conveyance prior to the judgment on ivhich it was sold to the plaintiff, and alleging that at the time of the service of the writ in ejectment the defendants were in possession of the property as his .tenants under a lease.

To this, however, it is a sufficient answer that the sheriff, when he served the writ, found him still in possession, and of this, in the present controversy, the return is conclusive, and whether McFarland retained the property under the terms of the lease or merely at the sufferance of the Stewarts, nevertheless he was there under them, and hence the judgment in ejectment determined the right of possession against them and in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
