The plaintiff entered judgment on the verdict in Court No. 4, and moved for an arrest of the judgment in No. 2, on the ground that the entry of judgment in Court No. 4 was conclusive upon Court No. 2, <em>Held, </em>that this was no ground for an arrest of judgment, and the court properly entered judgment on the verdict for defendant.</p>

Dambly made cognisance as bailiff of defendant. The plaintiff pleaded that the defendants had entered and evicted him from part of the premises, on the 6th of September 1875, before any of the rent was due. The defendants filed a replication, and issue was joined. The cause was tried on the 20th of October 1876, and the jury found a “verdict for defendants,” without finding the value of the goods, or the amount of rent in arrear. Before the verdict was rendered in No. 2, another action of replevin had been instituted in the Court of Common Pleas, No. 4, to try the right of the defendant to distrain for the November rent for the same premises, in which a verdict was given for the plaintiff. After the verdict in No. 2, the plaintiff entered <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>judgment on the verdict in No. 4, and. then filed a motion in No. 2, in arrest of the judgment in that court, on the ground that, the suit in No. 4 having been between the same parties, and for the same subject-matter, the judgment therein was conclusive. The court struck off the motion, and entered judgment for defendant on his verdict. Plaintiff then took this writ, alleging that the court erred in entering judgment upon a verdict which was incomplete and did not dispose of the issue, and in entering judgment on said verdict after the entry of judgment in No. 4.</p>
