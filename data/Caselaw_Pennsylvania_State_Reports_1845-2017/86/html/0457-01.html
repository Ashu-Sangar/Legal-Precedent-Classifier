On November 3d 1875, Breisch entered into an amicable action to revive said judgment and continue the lien thereof for five years, and confessed judgment therein for $2100, on Avhich judgment of revival Avas entered for that amount. In June 1876, Breisch <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>obtained a rule to show cause why this judgment should not be opened and he be let into a defence; and in support of the rule, deposed that he had paid interest on $2300, the amount originally borrowed, from the date of the loan until March 1875, at the rate of 3 per cent, per month. It appeared that he had also paid $300 of the principal. Nothing was paid after the judgment to revive. The court, Pershing, P. J., made the rule absolute, when the plaintiff took this appeal, under the provision of the Act of April 4th 1877, Pamph. L. 53, giving the right of appeal in cases of this kind in like manner as equity cases are appealed.</p>

If the amicable revival were conclusive upon the defendant confessing the judgment, usury would seldom be reached. An&lt;l creditors, aware of such law, would always make it a condition of giving time, that a judgment or war<a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>rant of attorney to confess it, or to waive it, would be given. This corrective power of the court must be exercised to prevent the ruin of unfortunate debtors who are in merciless hands. This case is an apt illustration of the benign effect of-the law against wrong. The defendant in this case for several years paid interest at the rate of thirty-six per cent', per annum, the usury amounting to a larger sum than the original debt.</p>
