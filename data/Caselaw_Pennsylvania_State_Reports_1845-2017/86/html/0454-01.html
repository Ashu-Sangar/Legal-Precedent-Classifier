    <p class="summary" id="b454-13" data-blocks='[["BL_454.13",454,[268,1914,1168,507]]]'>The claim filed set forth: “ The amount claimed to be due is seven hundred and eighty-six dollars and thirty-five cents, for work and labor, sand, lime, brick and materials furnished in and about the erection of said building by L. P. Loomis, within six months past; the work and labor having been done and the -materials furnished in pursuance of a contract for the erection of said building entered into between B. R. Bedford and said L. P. Loomis, dated June 27th 1871, and supplement thereto, dated September 11th 1871, as occasion required, commencing on the 10th day of October 1871, and continuing until the 10th day November 1871, when the last work was done and the contract performed on the part of said L. P. Loomis.”</p>

      <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>The defendant entered a rule to show cause why the claim should not be stricken from the record, which the court discharged. The defendant then filed a plea of “Nil debit.” At the trial the agreement of June 27th 1871, was put in evidence by plaintiff, wherein it was stipulated that Loomis would furnish the brick, lime, sand and other materials necessary, and in a good and workmanlike manner erect the outside walls for a brick building, in accordance with certain plans,, and that in consideration therefor Bedford was to pay Loomis $13.50 per thousand bricks “at measurement, and to be measured after said walls and work were completed.” By the supplementary contract of September 11th 1871, certain additional work was to be done by Loomis, for which he was to receive an additional sum of fifty cents per thousand bricks. A computation showed that the number of bricks actually used at the contract price made the amount claimed. It was also shown that the claim was assigned to Miller. The plaintiff having closed his evidence, the defendant moved for a nonsuit, which the court, Ingham, P. J., refused, saying:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-6" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[214,1187,1163,121]]]'>“ This motion is overruled for the purpose of taking the verdict of the jury on the evidence, the court reserving the legal points involved.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-7" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[215,1317,1162,130]]]'>The verdict was for the plaintiff. The court subsequently entered judgment for the defendant <em>non obstante veredicto, </em>in an opinion, inter alia, saying :—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b455-8" data-blocks='[["BL_455.6",455,[210,1446,1166,994]],["BL_456.1",456,[253,415,1169,592]]]'>“ The plaintiff having closed his evidence, the defendant, by his counsel, moved for a compulsory nonsuit. This motion we overruled for the purpose of submitting to the jury the facts proved in the case, reserving the points: whether the claim filed in the case was sufficient to create a lien under the mechanics’ lien laws, and whether the plaintiff has given such evidence as is in law sufficient to maintain the action, or sufficient evidence to submit to the jury. The right of a mechanic or material man to a lien upon a building can only be asserted in the manner provided by the statute. The statute, among other things, provides that every claim must set forth ‘the amount or sum claimed to be due, and the nature or kind of work done, or the kind and amount of materials furnished, and the time when the materials were furnished, or the work done, as the case may be.’ The claim filed by Loomis does not state ‘ the nature or kind of the work done, nor the amount of material furnished.’ On its face, therefore, it is defective as a lien unless the omission to comply with the form of the statute is supplied by the fact that the work and labor were done and the materials furnished in pursuance of an agreement for a stipulated sum. The claim sets forth that the work and labor were done and the material furnished in pursuance of a contract for the erection of a building. The amount claimed to be due is $786.35. On the ground that this claim appeared to be founded on a special contract <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>for a round sum of money (and not having the contract before us), we overruled the defendant’s motion to strike off the lien and compelled him to plead to the scire facias. When the contract was offered it appeared that the value of the work could only be computed by the measurement of the work and a computation of the number of the brick; that it was nob for a round sum of money, but provided for payment for the work of laying the brick at a fixed price per thousand. Construing the allegation in the claim as we were compelled to construe it in order to sustain the validity of the lien, and there appears a clear variance between the evidence offered and the claim filed, the <em>allegata </em>and the <em>probata </em>do not correspond. For these reasons we find that judgment cannot be entered for plaintiff on the verdict, and judgment-must be entered against him <em>non obstante veredicto.”</em>
