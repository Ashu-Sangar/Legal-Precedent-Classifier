Cake, to recover from the defendant the amount of a draft, dated December 27th 1872, for $3150, at four months, 'and a note, dated May 1st 1873, for $650, at two months, on which defendant was an accommodation' endorser. These instruments had been discounted by the plaintiffs for Simon J. Stine, in renewal of similar paper, the original debt having been created at least two years prior to the date of the draft, and renewals having taken place every few <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>'months ; interest at the rate of twelve per cent, per annum having been paid by Stine during the whole time. About the dates at which the respective instruments in suit fell due Cake endorsed other notes of Stine to take up those in suit, and Stine sent the new notes to the bank for that purpose, the note to renew the draft being sent after protest of the draft. The bank made no response to the request to renew the credit, though it had been common for them' to renew protested paper for Stine, but they retained the notes. Calce always thought the instruments in suit had been renewed by the new notes until this suit was brought. Stine was insolvent at the time of suit brought; but when the instruments sued on were protested, and the note renewing the draft fell due, he had enough property to save Cake harmless. The bank’s cashier told Stine, some time after the receipt of the new notes (Stine said after the note renewing the draft fell due), that they would not renew the instruments in suit, hut they did not return the notes sent them for the purpose of effecting a renewal.</p>

No notice of non-payment was given to Cake on these notes. This suit was instituted on the first notes. It is the very case of Hart <em>v. </em>Boller, 15 S. &amp; R. 162, in which this court held that it was error to take from the jury the question whether the renewal notes were accepted in payment.</p>

It was there decided that where there has been a series of renewal notes given for the continuation of the same original loan, the taint of usury in the first transaction follows down the descent through the whole line, and when, therefore, a national bank sues to recover its debt on the last of the series of renewal notes, the borrower is entitled to credit for all the interest he has paid from the beginning on the loan, and not merely to' the excess above the lawful rate.</p>
