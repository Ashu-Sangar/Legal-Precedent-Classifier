    <p class="summary" id="b284-10" data-blocks='[["BL_284.10",284,[275,1180,1171,1078]]]'>Bill in equity, filed by William E. Naile, against Henry C. Olmsted and George N. Watson, which set forth that Henry Sell, being seised in fee of certain real estate, died on May 18th 1842, leaving a will dated November 2d 1841, with two codicils, dated respectively, November 2d 1841, and April 29th 1842, which were duly admitted to probate. By this will and codicils he devised certain real estate to a trustee, to pay the income to certain parties for life, and upon their death to sell and divide the proceeds among his surviving brothers and sisters and the issue of any deceased. By the second codicil, the testator revoked the bequest in remainder to his brother Charles, and directed that the share intended for him should be given to the testator’s adopted daughter, Cecilia Erben. Henry Sell left surviving him seven brothers and sisters, who are still living. Cecilia Erben died July 26th 1852, a minor, intestate, unmarried and without issue. The last of those having a life interest in the real estate before referred to, died October 20th 1876, and thereupon the trustee sold the real estate as directed in the will of Henry Sell, and has filed his account as trustee, accounting for the proceeds in the Orphans’ Court, where it now remains unadjudicated. On May 9th 1877, the defendant, George N. Watson, filed with the auditor-general an information, alleging the death of Cecilia Erben, intestate and without known kindred, upon which information a commission has issued to the defendant, Henry C. Olmsted, as deputy escheator, under which he was about to proceed- according to law.</p>

The finding of the inquest in favor of the Commonwealth will not conclude the plaintiff from contesting any subsequent proceeding taken on behalf of the state to obtain the fund from him; it will <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>only place the Commonwealth in a position where she will be entitled to be a party to proceedings to test her right to this particular fund. As the finding of the inquest in favor of the Commonwealth can do the trustee no irreparable harm, he has no equity upon which to ask for this injunction. It is to be noticed that this case is entirely distinguishable from West’s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 186, and West <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., Id. 195 ; in that in these the plaintiff’s equity consisted in the fact that these proceedings for an escheat were calculated greatly to injure the credit of the Savings Fund, and that as the depositors were a class of persons easily alarmed, irreparable injury would ensue if a panic once seized them. This was the equity upon which that case rested, and was clearly sufficient in a case where it was manifest that the proceedings for an escheat would result in nothing to sustain the injunction. But as no such equity exists in this case, entirely apart from the general merits of the Commonwealth’s case, the granting of this injunction was erroneous.</p>

He is still liable to be surcharged for neglect or mismanagement, and must account to the true owner, whoever it may be, and, until such owner is found, may be deemed to hold the legal title for the purpose of protecting the fund. There is no certain knowledge that Cecilia Erben has not some heirs- or kindred who might now claim, and who should not be bound by the proceeding under the Act of 1787, and it w'as for this protection of a possible unknown owner that the court held the Act of 1869, providing for the escheat of trust estates, inoperative, in the cases of West’s Appeal, and West <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., <em>supra; </em>and precisely the same difficulties as to possession which apply in attempting to escheat a remainder, are also applicable to the escheat of a cestui que trust’s interest.</p>
