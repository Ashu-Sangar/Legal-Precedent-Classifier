He now complains that tbe court below rejected certain testimony offered for the purpose of showing tliat he was intoxicated at the time he committed the crime. The evidence rejected did not measure up to this standard. At most it would have shown that he had liquor in his house and might have drank it. This was not specific enough and tbe court below was right in rejecting it.\nThere was also an offer to prove that the prisoner was drunk at some other time, and the effect upon bim. This was properly rejected.\nThe fourth specification is not properly assigned, and will not be considered.\nThe judgment is affirmed, and it is ordered that the record be remitted to the court below for tbe purpose of execution.",

T., 1891, by defendant, Dennis Cloonen, from judgment of O. & T. Allegheny Co., March T., 1892, No. 13, on verdict of guilty of murder.\nBefore Paxson, C.

Latterly, Mr. Cloonen, do you know what his habits were as to liquor? Objected to. A. Well, he was a very hard drinker. Mr. Burleigh: I object to the question in the general way in which it is put as incompetent and irrelevant.\nMr. Marshall: I propose to prove by the witness and all the children that this man constantly kept in his house a very considerable lot of whiskey, and that after supper nearly every night he drank heavily of it to intoxication; and that on many a night would drink over a quart between getting home and bedtime, and that it was a constant practice latterly to keep it in the house all the time, and it was in the house at this time.\nThe Court: The objection is sustained. The offer is not directed to the condition of the defendant at the time of the alleged offence. Exception. [1]\nThe same witness was asked: \u201c Q. Could you tell from anything that he said or did that evening after you met him on Webster avenue what his condition was as to soberness or otherwise ? A. Well, he was not drunk\u2014what you would call drunk\u2014and he was not sober; but can\u2019t tell when he\u2019s drank; he only gets drunk in the head. Q. Have you seen him drunk? \u201d Objected to as incompetent and irrelevant.\nThe Court: At other times ?\nMr. Marshall: Yes; at other times-\u2014many times.\nObjected to as incompetent and irrelevant.\nBy the Court: Will you state the purpose ?\nMr. Marshall: The purpose is to show his condition then, as far as we can, and what effect liquor had on him.\nThe Court: He can testify as to that particular time. I do not think he can testify as to any other times. Exception. [2]\nWhen Gilbert Cloonen was on the stand, defendant proposed to prove by the witness that a day or two before this death, defendant, Dennis Cloonen, brought home a bucket filled with whiskey, holding a gallon at least, and that after the death ol his mother, that same night, he looked at the place where the whiskey was kept and that there was only a small portion ol one bottle of that gallon of whiskey left; and follow it up b_y the evidence of all the living members of the family that none of them tasted liquor but the father.\nObjected to as incompetent and irrelevant, objection sustain ed, exception.
