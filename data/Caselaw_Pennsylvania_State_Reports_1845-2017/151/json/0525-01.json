    "head_matter": "Miller\u2019s Estate. McKay\u2019s Appeal.\nDecedent's Estate\u2014Declarations to charge legatee.\nWhere a legatee is sought to be charged with a sum of money in her hands alleged to be the property of the decedent, and the only evidence to support the claim is a declaration of the legatee herself that she had received the money from the decedent before his death as a gift, the whole of the declaration must bo taken as true, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Those who are seeking to charge the legatee cannot ask the court to believe that the money is in her possession, and at the same time to disregard her statement that it was received as a gift.\nIn such a case the possession of the money at the date of the decedent\u2019s death being in the legatee, the presumption that she owned it would follow.\nArgued Oct. 18, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 136, Oct. T., 1892, by John A. McKay et al., legatees, from decree of O. C. Washington Go., May T., 1891, No. 81, confirming report of auditor in estate of William Miller, deceased.\nBefore Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Heydrick, J J.\nExceptions to report of auditor appointed to distribute estate of William Miller, deceased.\nBefore the auditor, appellants claimed that Isabel Sumney (now Gilmore), a niece of testator, should be charged with the sum of $2,000, money of the decedent alleged to be in her hands. The only evidence to support the claim was a declaration made bjr Mrs. Gilmore to Mrs. Sanders. Mrs. Sanders, in her testimony, stated the conversation as follows: \u201c She told me that Mr. Miller gave her some money for herself, I think on the Friday before; that he told her to take it from its hiding place where he kept it and put it away for herself. She also said that if he got well, she was to give it back to him. I think what she said was that if he should die, it was to be hers. She stated how much it was, and I saw four packages of $500 each. . . . Before she went up-stairs to get it, she said there was $2,150. When she came down she said there was not as much as she thought by $50. Before she went up she said there was $150 in gold; when she came down she said there was only $100. I did not see the gold; only saw the four packages marked $500 each. She said he gave it to her for her own, and told her to put it away for herself. She told me, almost the first thing, that if he got well she was to hand it back to him. . . . Mr. Miller died on Monday morning following.\nThe claimants also averred and introduced evidence tending to show that decedent was mentally incapable of making a valid gift at the time referred to in Mrs. Gilmore\u2019s declaration.\nThe auditor found that the fund in dispute was a valid gift from the decedent to Mrs. Gilmore. Exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report alleging that the auditor erred (1) in not charging Mrs. Gilmore with $2,000; (2) in his finding that decedent was mentally capable to make a gift and in his finding the fact of a gift, and (3) in allowing Mrs. Gilmore to share in the estate, were dismissed, the court filing the following opinion:\n\u201c The exceptants, John A. McKay and others, by their attorney John L. Gow, Esq., in the distribution of the estate of Wm. Miller, deceased, seek to have deducted from the legacy bequeathed to Isabel Sumney, (now Mrs. Gilmore,) the sum of $2,000. In our opinion the evidence is insufficient to establish the claim set up by the exceptants as a set-off against the legacy of the legatee. There is not a particle of evidence that at the date of Wm. Miller\u2019s death, Isabel Sumney owed him a cent or had in her possession any of his money, except her own admission to Mrs. Sanders, and that admission shows that the money which she received from Mr. Miller in his lifetime was a gift. The exceptants\u2019 whole case rests on the declaration of Mrs. Gilmore to Mrs. Sanders, and to make out their case, of this declaration, they ask the court to believe that part which is favorable, and to disbelieve that part which is unfavorable to them. They ask us to believe her when she says that she got the money from Mr. Miller, but to disbelieve her when she says that he told her when he gave her the money that she was to keep it\u2014that it was to belong to her if he died.\n\u201c But even granting that we have the fact admitted\u2014but nothing more\u2014that on the BTiday before Mr. Miller died Isabel Sumney received from him $2,000, which she deposited in bank in her own name where it was when he died, it does not follow that the money belonged to the estate of Wm. Miller; on the contrary the possession of the money at the date of his death being in Mrs. Gilmore, the presumption that she owned it would follow. And the only way the exceptants can expect to succeed in establishing their claim, is to have the court not only disbelieve Mrs. Gilmore\u2019s declaration that the money was a gift, but to believe without evidence that her possession of it was fraudulent if not felonious. That is, that she took the money surreptitiously or feloniously and voluntarily told Mrs. Sanders a fabricated story for the purpose of covering up her theft. Fraud, and much less a'crime, is never presumed.\u201d\nErrors assigned were (1-3) dismissal of exceptions, quoting them.\nJohn L. Gfow, H. M. Eougan with him, for appellant.\nAll of the parties were fully competent witnesses : McCabe\u2019s Est., 6 Pa. C. C. R. 42; Bowen v. Goranflo, 73 Pa. 357; Frew v. Clark, 80 Pa. 170.\nWhile the whole of a declaration or admission is to be taken together: Kean v. Ellmaker, 7 S. & R. 5; McCulloch v. McKee, 16 Pa. 294; Gr. Ev. \u00a7 201; it does not follow that every part is to have equal credit.\nThe policy of the law is against gifts mortis causa: Wells v. Tucker, 3 Binney, 366; Headly v. Kirby, 18 Pa. 829; Hills v Hills, 8 M. & W. 403; Nichola v. Adams, 2 Wh. 17; Rhodes v. Childs, 64 Pa. 18; and clear and unmistakable proofs are required to sustain them: Hatch v. Atkinson, 56 Maine, 324; s. c. 96 Am. Dec. 464. The declarations of a party in his own hehalf are not evidence : 1 Gr. Ev. \u00a7 201; Clever v. Hillberry, 116 Pa. 438.\nThe facts are not disputed and the deductions to be drawn from them are the result of reasoning; and the Supreme Court is as competent to judge as the auditor and court below: Phillips\u2019 Ap., 68 Pa. 138; Hindman\u2019s Ap., 85 Pa. 470; Gaines v. Brockenhoff, 136 Pa. 195; Milligan\u2019s Ap., 97 Pa. 525.\nM. C. Aeheson, It. W. Irwin and N. U. Clark, not heard, for appellee.\nIt is true that the admission that Miller gave her that money was, by inference, an admission that the money formerly belonged to Miller; but the whole of her admission must be taken together and neither a jury nor an auditor would be warranted in disregarding that part that was favorable to her unless there were circumstances in the case which discredited or cast suspicion upon it: Newman v. Bradly, 1 Dall. 240; Farrell v. McClea, 1 Dall. 392; Hamshire v. Kline, 57 Pa. 397; 9 Am. & Eng. Enc. L. 355. See also Milligan\u2019s Ap., 97 Pa. 525.\nThe facts found by an auditor are conclusive, unless clear mistake, misconduct, or manifest error be shown: Beddell\u2019s Ap., 87 Pa. 510; Roddy\u2019s Ap., 99 Pa. 10; Logue\u2019s Ap., 104 Pa. 136; McConnell\u2019s Ap., 97 Pa. 31; McCarty\u2019s Ap., 14 Atl. R. 352.\nOctober 31, 1892."
