The case was heard on bill and answer, and the injunction, from which this appeal is taken, was awarded.</p>

It is claimed however that the court below erred in holding that appellant company has no authority to lay a track on Germautown avenue ^ <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>that it has not even obtained the consent of councils to such extension of its tracks as was authorized by the act of March 22, 1865; and, lastly, that the Germantown Passenger Railway Company has no standing to inquire whether such consent of councils has been obtained or not. These are the only questions involved in the four specifications before us.</p>
    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[286,708,1174,1016]]]'>The first two questions were presented .by the record in City of Philadelphia v. The Citizens Passenger Railway Company, appellant, No. 164, July Term 1891 [the preceding case]; and, in an opinion just filed in that case, we have~held that the learned court committed no error in ruling both questions in favor of the appellee. It is unnecessary to repeat what is there said, as to the proper construction of the act of March 22, 1865, authorizing appellant to extend its road northwardly on Tenth and Eleventh streets, “ between Montgomery street and the Germantown road (now Germantown avenue) with the right to connect the same on any street between these two points,” etc. For reasons there given, we held that the extreme northerly limit of the grant is the southerly line of Germantown avenue, and consequently appellant has no right, even with the consent of councils, (which in fact it never obtained) to construct or operate an extension of its railway on Germantown avenue. To hold otherwise would violate every principle of construction, and run counter to many well considered cases which have been cited by the learned counsel for appellees.</p>

And when doubt arises as to the construction of the language, the maxim ordinarily applicable to the interpretation of statutes, that <em>verba cartarum fortius occipiunter contra </em>proferentem, or that words are to be understood most strongly against him who uses them, is justly applied. The benefit of the doubt is to be given to those who might be prejudiced by the exercise of the powers which the enactment grants, and against those who claim to exercise them.”</p>

In 1865, when the act was passed, that road belonged to the Perkiomeu Turnpike Co. By the terms of its charter, granted in 1858, the Germantown Passenger Railway was required to compensate and did compensate the turnpike company for the use of its road. Afterwards, about the year 1869, the city of Philadelphia succeeded to the rights of the turnpike company but that, of course, cannot injuriously affect the rights of the railway company previously acquired and paid for under the provisions of its charter. It cannot therefore be supposed that the legislature, in 1865, intended to authorize appellant company to interfere with the Germantown Passenger Railway Co., in the enjoyment of its right of way theretofore legally acquired and paid for.</p>

If the act of June 19, 1871, Purd. 357, P. L. 1361, means anything, it recognizes the right of either of the appellees to be heard on the main question involved in this case. The averments contained in their bill are quite sufficient to bring them within the provisions of that act. Among other things, it is averred that the threatened acts of appellant are without authority of law, and will be a serious inconvenience and hindrance to plaintiffs in the operation of their road, and a source of annoyance and injury to them. The act provides that, in all proceedings in courts of law or equity in which it is alleged <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>that the rights or franchises of other corporations are injured or invaded by any corporation claiming a right to do the act from which such injury results, it shall be the duty of the court, in which such proceedings are had, to examine, inquire and ascertain whether such corporation does in fact possess the right and franchise to do such injurious act, and if such right or franchise has not been conferred upon such corporation, such courts, if exercising equitable power, shall by injunction restrain such injurious acts, etc. This act has been before us for construction, etc., in several cases, among which are, Western Penna.
