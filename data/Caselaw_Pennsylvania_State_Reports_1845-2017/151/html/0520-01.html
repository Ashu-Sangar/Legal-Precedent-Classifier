On Aug. 1,1882, a judgment was entered against Boas. Payments on account of the purchase money were made by defendant to Boas until August 22, 1882, when Boas executed a deed for the promises and took a mortgage for $555, residue of purchase money, both deed and mortgage being duly recorded. Further payments were made until April 27, 1888, when the mortgage was assigned to plaintiff. The balance due at that time was $415. After notice of the assignment payments were made by defendant to plaintiff, the assignee, aggregating to April, 1888, $140. On Nov. 8, 1887, plaintiff purchased the judgment against Boas, issued execution on the same, and bought in the land at the sheriff’s sale. <em>Held, </em>in an action of ejectment, that plaintiff had constructive notice of defendant’s equity to have the payments made on the mortgage sot off against the judgment, and the verdict should be conditioned accordingly.</p>

    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.7",545,[198,704,1167,197]]]'>It is claimed by defendants that the sum named in the conditional verdict is too great; that they were entitled to further credits which would have reduced the balance to $328,89 with interest from April, 1886, the date of last payment.</p>
    <p id="b545-6" data-blocks='[["BL_545.8",545,[198,910,1166,863]]]'>In April, 1882, Mrs. Weldon, one of the defendants, agreed with Mr. Boas, the then owner of the property, to purchase the same for $850, and pursuant thereto the defendants went into possession in May or June following and immediately made valuable improvements. Payments were made by Mrs. Weldon from time to time on account of the purchase money until August 22, 1882, when Boas conveyed the premises to her, and took a mortgage for $555, residue of purchase money, which was recorded on the following day. Further payments were thereafter made to him until April 27, 1883, when he assigned the mortgage to Samuel Stephens, the plaintiff. The balance due at that time appears to have been $445.75. After notice of the assignment, payments were made by Mrs. Weldon to Stephens, the assignee, aggregating, to April, 1888, $140. An entry made by him in Mrs. Weldon’s book, April 30,1885, shows $359.10 balance then due. Subsequent payments reduced the amount to $309.10, plus accrued interest.</p>
    <p id="b545-7" data-blocks='[["BL_545.9",545,[195,1781,1167,140]]]'>Nearly all of the foregoing recitals of fact are undisputed; the others appear to be supported by evidence tending, at least, to establish their truth.</p>
    <p id="b545-8" data-blocks='[["BL_545.10",545,[197,1934,1166,299]]]'>On August 1,1882, Hapgood, Hay &amp; Co. obtained judgment against Boas for $300, which was afterwards purchased by Stephens and assigned to him November 3, 1887. On an execution issued on said judgment the land in question was sold by the sheriff and by him conveyed November 21, 1887, to Stephens, who afterwards brought this action of ejectment.</p>

The judgment was an encumbrance upon the land conveyed to <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>her, which he was bound to remove: In re McGill, <a href="/pa/6/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="954588" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0504-01">6 Pa. 504</a>; Dunn v.

    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[260,502,1182,966]]]'>It does not appear that Mrs. Weldon has done anything to estop her from asserting the equity which she had of having the residue of purchase money so applied as to relieve her property from the lien of the judgment. Stephens, the assignee first of the mortgage and afterwards of the judgment, had constructive if not actual notice of her equity. In taking the assignment of the mortgage it must be presumed that he knew the condition of the record. He is at least visited with notice of what an examination of the record would have disclosed. The judgment of Hapgood, Hay &amp; Co. was obtained August 1, 1882, and thereupon became a lien on Boas’s interest in the land which he conveyed to Mrs. Weldon three weeks thereafter. He also had record notice that the mortgage he was about to purchase was given for residue of purchase money of the encumbered land. In short, he had such notice as should have put him upon inquiry, and he cannot now claim to be an innocent purchaser without notice. He placed himself in no better position, as regards Mrs. Weldon’s equity, etc., by subsequently purchasing the judgment.</p>

    <p id="b546-10" data-blocks='[["BL_546.9",546,[263,2144,1179,135]]]'>4th. “ That at the time of said assignment of the mortgage there was enough due thereon to pay off and satisfy the judgment.”</p>

As assignee of the mortgage, he stands in the shoes of his assignor, and holds the nonnegotiable security subject to all defences that might bo made against it in the hands of said assignor: Rider v.
