Standing alone the above-quoted clause would be interpreted to include everything connected with the agreement, as well moneys earned as those to be earned by H. H. Smith. But it has been found as a fact that at the time last referred to, January 1, 1883, H. H. Smith, in conversation with D. S. Ewing with respect to this indorsement on the contract, as the latter had written it, said that it did not express his purpose; for it seemed to mean that he was giving up whatever was due on the machines on which twenty dollars had been paid. To which D. S. Ewing replied,41 have used the word “benefits ” as that which you give up, and that means what is to be due in the future, not what has grown due already.’ That H. H. Smith accepted this explanation and thereupon both signed the indorsement. This has been found to be the actual transaction in the face of the denial by D. S. Ewing, because it harmonizes with what an ordinary business man would do with respect to moneys that he knew he had earned; it is clear, circumstantial, and explicit, whereas the denial of D. S. Ewing Is general; it does not set forth the conversation which admittedly preceded the abrogation of the agreement of 1881, and the reason given by him in support of his denial, that is, that H. H. Smith was making a better bargain by the agreement which took the place of that of 1881, to wit, that of January 1,1883, is not persuasive unless it had been shown that the <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>giving up of what had been earned under the agreement of 1881 was a part of the consideration of the agreement 1883, and this was not done.

The elements of it stand un contradicted by circumstances, and it is thought that where there is such testimony it suffices, although it be that of a party in interest, uncorroborated by any other.

That is to say, the assets amounting to $100,000 did not include good-will, and because they did not, and because the plaintiff did not get on this head what otherwise he would be entitled to, he should be compensated by not being required to bear whatever loss might happen to the assets of the estimated value of $100,000. It appears that there has been marked loss in the defaulters’ account, but this account is enumerated among the assets which go to make up the $100,000. Doubtless it is true that of this loss but a part happened with respect to the defaulters up to 1886, and that other loss occurred among those who became defaulters after 1886. Nevertheless, it is upon this interpretation of the agreement, as well as by reason of the payment of interest by the plaintiff during the partnership upon the face value of the assets, it is concluded that he should not bear the loss which might and probably would result from the conversion of the estimated profits of $8,000 upon the books to their cash value.

In the meantime he had made sales of a number of machines, upon some of which, at the last mentioned date, the stipulated price on account of twenty dollars had been paid. Upon other sales the twenty dollars had not been paid. On the 1st day of January, 1883, the parties entered into a new agreement, determinable at any time upon thirty days’ written notice by either, with a stipulation, however, that the party giving such notice should pay a forfeit of five hundred dollars to the other. By this agreement the appellee was to act in the same capacity as before, but it was stipulated that he should receive in full compensation for all services rendered a commission of five per cent upon all net cash receipts arising from the leasing and sale of sewing machines to parties residing in the county of Philadelphia. All allowances for old machines, discounts to customers, and commissions or salaries due to the party effecting the sales or lease being first deducted from the retail or published prices at which the machines were to be leased or sold. Simultaneously with the making of this new agreement, the following words were written across the face of the agreement of 1881, and signed by the respective parties thereto :</p>

In the end it was canceled, and a new agreement dated March 16,1886, was substituted therefor. It was upon this last agreement that the appellee rested his claim of partnership and his demand for an account. We will refer to it later.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[276,696,1175,543]]]'>The difficulty upon the first branch of the case arises upon the construction of the indorsement upon the agreement of 1881. Upon this point the parties differed radically in their testimony, each stating at some length what he understood it to mean at the time he executed it; the appellee contending that it was not his understanding that it was intended to cancel his claim for sales made under the agreement of 1881, while the appellant was equally emphatic in his testimony that it was a full settlement of any such claim. There was no corroboration of either witness in this respect. There was only the assertion of the one and the denial of the other.</p>

He further says: “ The elements of it stand uncontradicted by circumstances, and it is thought that where there is such testimony it suffices, although it be that of a party in interest, uncorroborated by any other.” It is just here the learned master appears to have misapprehended the rule in equity. To overcome the oath of the appellant there must be the oath of the appellee sustained by another witness or corroborated by circumstances which are the equivalent of a witness. It is not enough that the oath of the appellee “stands uncontradicted by circumstances,” it must be corroborated by circumstances, and there is no such corroboration in the case.</p>

    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[283,662,1174,1527]]]'>We think the learned court below and master erred in their construction of this paper. We regard its meaning as clear. The parties evidently regarded the assets at that time as worth a hundred thousand dollars. Among those assets, however, there were some items as to which there might be a shrinkage. The value of the good-will was not taken into an account in estimating the value of the assets. Under these circumstances, it was doubtless thought reasonable that “ whatever of loss and shrinkage may result in aiijr and all of the above-named assets shall be regarded as the price and value of the goodwill of the business.” As the appellee had paid nothing for the good-will, whatever may have been its value, it does not seem unreasonable that the shrinkage, if any, should be set off against the good-will. That this clause of the agreement in regard to shrinkage was intended to apply only to the assets as they existed at the time the agreement was entered into, is clear from the language of the agreement itself. In terms it applies only to “ all of the above-named assets,” and cannot, by any reasonable construction, be regarded as applicable to shrinkage on future assets. The claim of the appellee would throw all the losses up to the time of dissolution upon the appellant, while the appellee would be entitled to a guaranteed capital of $100,000, even though the whole of it should be lost by business reverses or bad debts. Few persons would be willing to engage in business upon such terms. The most that the appellee can claim under the agreement is ten per centum of the actual capital of the concern as it stood at the time of dissolution. The appellant can only be charged with a shrinkage of the original assets or those in existence at the date of the agreement.</p>
