Countryman sold the horse and cattle to Joseph Mishler, and Mishler paid $244 of the price at the time and gave his note for $100, the balance; the wife made no claim to the property. The cross-ties were purchased by Joshua Berkebile from Countryman, and they were made from timber growing on Countryman’s farm. The money was paid to Countryman, and the evening before he died, when he declared that he had $200 on hand for Wendle Winters, and asked Miss Mary Shaffer if she would not take it to Winters, his wife was present and heard all that was said, and made no claim to the money, nor did she contradict what her husband said or claimed. Countryman sold the horse, cattle and cross-ties to Mishler and Berkebile as his property, he collected the money as his own and declared in presence of his wife that it was his, and she made no claim to either; she cannot make claim to it after his death. Your auditor is at a loss to see how the widow can have any claim, either in law or in equity, to the $119 paid by Berkebile for cross-ties. Your auditor is clearly of the opinion that the $200 which Countryman had in his possession at the time of his death, and which he said was for Winters, was his money, and that the administrators should be charged with the same.

The widow should have acknowledged this fact and made her claim as widow for the $800 exemption to herself and her brother as administrators of said Countryman a year or two ago. The administrators were the only parties from whom she could demand an appraisement of the $300 exemption. She cannot make the demand now. She is too late. She has waived her right. The widow claimed and still claims to be the owner of this money and that it did not belong to the estate of Geo. J. Countryman, her deceased husband. The creditors of Geo. J. Countryman deny her right and these proceedings are to determine the right, and when the ownership is found to be in the estate and not in the widow, then she" abandons her unjust claim and asks that it be turned over to her as the widow under the act of assembly of April 14, 1851. If the money was hers it could not be appraised and set apart to her as the widow or a part of the estate of Geo. J. Countryman, deceased. If the money belongs to the estate of Geo. J.

They must stand unless clearly erroneous. The decedent was living on the farm which he had bought, but had not fully paid for. The title was in his name and he dealt with the stock and products as 'if they were his own. The money with which the accountants were surcharged was admitted to have been the proceeds of sales of farm products and farm stock, and much the larger part of it was not only in his hands as money at the time of his death, but he was shown to have used and treated it as his own. The burden of showing the contrary was on the widow claiming it as hers. Whether the secret arrangement between husband and wife by which he “ delivered all I (he) have accumulated, and for the five years to come all is to belong to ” plaintiff could stand against his creditors we are not required to consider. The auditor found that the widow’s claim of ownership was not proved, and a careful reading of the evidence has not convinced us that his conclusion was wrong.</p>

That was an extremely hard case where a frugal and industrious woman had with a small money-present from her father and her own labor without any assistance from an intemperate and improvident husband, accumulated a fund which she naturally con sidered and treated as her own. The auditor found expressly <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>that ber claim was the result of a misapprehension of the law, and was entirely free from fraud. He also reported as a fact that there were no creditors of the husband opposing. This court was obliged to hold that her earnings were the husband’s, but accepting the auditor’s report as conclusive on the question of fraud and equity, allowed the exemption. The present is not such a case. The claim of the widow to the property was not based on any wrong view of the law bat on a dispute as to the facts, and the auditor while not finding fraud expressly, yet speaks of the claim as fraudulent. It is not necessary to go so far, or to suppose that her claim was fraudulently^ made. It is enough that she is making inconsistent demands. When objection was made to the account she had two courses open to her, to claim the money under the exemption law, or to maintain that it was her own, leaving her claim for exemption open as a charge on the rest of the estate. She chose the latter course, and in so doing became responsible for the delay and expense of the contest before the auditor. Having made her election, contested the matter to the end, and failed, she could not then go back to the other claim and enforce it without manifest inconsistency, and injustice to the exceptants. The auditor and court rightly held that she had waived her right to the exemption.</p>
