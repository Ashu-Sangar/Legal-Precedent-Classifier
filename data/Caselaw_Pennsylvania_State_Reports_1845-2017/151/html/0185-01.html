Other facts are stated in the opinion of the court below. The case was referred to Henry C. G. Reber, as master, who recommended a decree as prayed for.

The approval neither retards nor denies the making of public improvements. No such issue is involved. Under the municipal act of 1889 the municipal authorities have the power to pave or macadamize Fifth street, or any other street of the city, at the expense of the city, out of its general treasury, whenever deemed necessary, and when so done they may also prescribe the kind of material with which it shall be done. They are charged with the duty of maintaining streets and highways in proper condition. The present controversy involves their right to make such improvements at the expense of the abutting property owners entirely. This is alleged to be illegal and unjust, placing public burdens on the few for the benefit of the many, the streets being for the benefit of the public at large and not for a particular locality. The right of the city to pave or macadamize a newly opened street, at the expense of the abutting property owners, is also conceded. The original paving brings the abutting properties into the market as building lots, with benefits almost exclusively peculiar to the abutting properties, and is, therefore, a local improvement for which they may be assessed. But starting with the case of Hammett v. Phila., <a href="/pa/65/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="65 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="430574" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0146-01">65 Pa. 146</a>-156, and following it with Appeal of Orphans’ Asylum of Pittsburgh, <a href="/citations/?q=111%20Pa.%20143" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="111 Pa. 143">111 Pa. 143</a>; Williamsport City v. Beck, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20Pa.%20150" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="128 Pa. 150">128 Pa. 150</a>, and kindred cases, the Supreme Court has held, as the settled law of Pennsylvania, that ‘ when a street is once opened and paved, and thus assimilated with the rest of the city and made part of it, all the particular benefits to the locality derived from the improvements have been received and enjoyed. Repairing streets is as much a part of the ordinary duties of the municipality for the general good as cleaning, watching <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>and lighting.

It is held immaterial whether the first paving was done by the city out of the general treasury or paid for by the owner. In the Hammett case the paving was paid for by the abutting owners, although the city had done the work in the first place. In the Williamsport case the original paving was done at the general expense of the city. If, therefore, Fifth street was paved or macadamized, its repaving is illegal, except when paid out of the general funds of the city. The costs cannot be assessed upon the property of the abutting owners. To assess and collect therefrom, under such circumstances, is, in the language of the Supreme Court, ‘to take private property for public use without compensation.’ Any act or ordinance authorizing it to be done is unconstitutional and void.</p>

L. 227, § 10), and so maintained for years, abandoned by the company, kept in order and repair by the city, torn up and reconstructed, spalled, that is, covered with small broken stones, and rolled with the city’s steam roller so as to form, and forming a smooth and hard surface, at the expense of the city, in exact conformity with Webster’s definition of ‘ macadamize,’ to wit: ‘to cover the roadway with small broken stones so as to form a smooth and hard surface,’ and, as Engineer Tyson says, commonly called ‘ macadamized.’</p>

    <p id="b216-7" data-blocks='[["BL_216.9",216,[248,763,1179,146]]]'>The facts of this ease, found by the learned master and approved by the court, together with the questions arising thereon, are fully and clearly presented in the record.</p>
    <p id="b216-8" data-blocks='[["BL_216.10",216,[247,917,1180,350]]]'>The controlling questions are substantially the same as those in Harrisburg v. Segelbaum, No. 18 May Term 1891, in which an opinion has just been filed. [The preceding case.] In view of what has been said in that opinion, as well as what may be found in the able and exhaustive opinion of the learned president of the common pleas, in this case, bearing on the same questions, we deem it unnecessary to discuss either of them.</p>
    <p id="b216-9" data-blocks='[["BL_216.11",216,[247,1275,1181,505]]]'>After depicting in strong colors the disastrous consequences that are likely to result from being unable, under our decisions in Hammett v. Philadelphia, Beck v. Williamsport and others, to repair public streets at the expense of the abutting property owners, etc., the learned counsel for the defendant, with commendable frankness, admits -that the decree which he asks us to reverse is in full accord with the law as laid down by this court in the cases above referred to, and says: “ The' only remedy then is to prajr the Supreme Court to relax its rule or adopt another better suited to the necessities of the times.”</p>
    <p id="b216-10" data-blocks='[["BL_216.12",216,[248,1785,1179,405]]]'>We are far from being convinced that the “necessities of the times,” or any commendable consideration requires us to reverse or so modify the decisions, referred to, as to permit the cost of repaving public streets, for the benefit of the general public, to be assessed upon and collected from the property abutting on such streets; and, because we are not so convinced, we think there was no error in granting the injunction complained of.</p>
    <p id="b216-11" data-blocks='[["BL_216.13",216,[251,2194,1173,98]]]'>Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the defendant.</p>
