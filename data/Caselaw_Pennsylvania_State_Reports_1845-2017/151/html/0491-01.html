Defendant contracted to sell his own and Watt’s undivided interest in the land to plaintiff. Evidence for plaintiff tended to show that when Watt’s deed was tendered to plaintiff he objected to taking it through fear of judgments binding the land. Defendant being anxious to sell the land, then said to plaintiff: “ I will stand good to you for all judgments against Watt.” The land was subsequently sold on a judgment against Watt, and plaintiff bought it in.

If the matter, then, rested here upon the face of the deeds alone, the plaintiff would have no .standing, even though the interest of L. S.

In such instances, the promise of this third party becomes an original undertaking. To make it plainer, where a party may be the defendant in a judgment, for instance, and a third party, outside of that defendant, has dealings with another party about a matter that that judgment affects, if this third party makes a promise to the party with whom he is dealing to protect him against the liability of this debtor, he can make himself liable for this debtor—the defendant in the judgment— notwithstanding he does not put it in writing, if the transaction partakes of an original undertaking.

Now, that is a principle of evidence that is applicable where a contemporaneous verbal contract is set up with a written contract. To make it plain; when a written contract is made between the parties and it is alleged by one of the parties to it that he would not have entered into it if it had not been for the verbal agreement made contemporaneously or at the same time with it, why it is incumbent upon the party so setting up that parol agreement, which may alter, change or vary the writing, to establish it by evidence clear, precise and indubitable. That is the rule or standard or quality of the testimony. <em>We </em>recognize the force of that rule. We may say that we do not think that principle obtains here, for the reason that here is a deed of release executed by Labana S. Watt for the interest in the land about which we are inquiring and against which this judgment was executed. There was no writing between Mr. Timlin and Mr. Elkin. The contract was made verbally. Mr. Timlin made his deed; Mr. Watt made his deed. I am now •speaking of the writing alone, to avoid any confusion, we have no reference to the testimony about there being an alleged parol agreement. I am speaking now only of the deeds. Now, Mr. Timlin did not sign any writings about Watt’s deed; and, to establish that rule here, we would have to require that Mr. Timlin should have written in that deed of Watt the alleged guarantee. Consequently, we do not think that rule applies. But the jury must be satisfied, from. the weight of the testimony, as we have instructed you, that Mr. Timlin sold this land, these two shares to Mr. Elkin, and that he made the guarantee or the agreement to stand good for it; you must find that from the weight of the testimony.

There was therefore no error in affirming the point, as more fully explained in the general chargé. Nor was there any error in affirming plaintiff’s second point, and thereby instructing the jury, in substance, that if defendant bargained with plaintiff for the two undivided interests in the land, and, as an inducement to accept the deeds therefor as drawn, promised to stand good to him for anything that might be entered against Watt’s undivided interest, and plaintiff, relying on that promise, paid the consideration money and closed the transaction, he is entitled to recover.</p>
