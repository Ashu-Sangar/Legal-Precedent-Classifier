J., the evidence was to the following effect: Greenback colliery, in which plaintiff’s husband lost his life, had been sold to defendant, who took possession on Aug. 20, 1884, the day of the accident. Luther, chief mining engineer, came to take possession; with him was Booth, division superintendent. One White had been mine boss for the previous owner. The adjoining mine of Buck Ridge, owned by defendant, was found to be on fire, and all the surface openings were' closed so as to smother the fire. Booth directed White to send men down in the Greenback colliery to drive a hole through the pillar separating the two collieries for the purpose of turning a stream of water through the Greenback into Buck Ridge to flood the latter colliery. White sent plaintiff’s husband, and others, who lost their lives by inhaling gas which escaped from the Buck Ridge mine into the Greenback mine through openings which had been negligently left unclosed in the Greenback mine. Further facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>

You must, of course, take into consideration all the facts and circumstances in evidence in relation to this matter. That there were three holes from the Buck Ridge colliery into the Greenback colliery at the line pillar, as it was called by the witnesses, there is no doubt. It has been proven by several witnesses and is undisputed, and some of the witnesses testified that Mr. Booth knew of these holes—that there were such communications between the two mines—that he had been there on former occasions and he seems to have known all about it, and I leave it to you to determine from all the evidence in the case whether he was guilty of negligence whilst he was so acting as the agent, or division superintendent, of the defendant, at the defendant’s two collieries.

And that is a question for you to determine, whether that is so or not. You heard the testimony in regard to the door that it is alleged was placed in that first lift gangway for the purpose of turning the air, or preventing the air and gases from going through into the mines at the place where they were being worked. You have the testimony, in regard to that, of Mr. Schreffler and Mr. Jefferson, as to their having closed that door on the 21st of August, at the time they were making an effort to get the men, who had been suffocated, up out of the mine.

That is one of the principal contentions in this case. The Greenback colliery had been in possession of and worked by Mr. Toudy for some time; several years, perhaps, prior to the 20th of August, 1884, the time of the accident. He had in his employment one Andrew G. White, as inside foreman, or mine boss. Mr. White had been engaged in mining, as he states, nearly all his life and had been underground mining boss at the Greenback colliery several years just previous to the taking possession by the defendant. He was Mr. Toudy’s mine boss up to the time that the defendant, the company, took possession, on the afternoon of the 20th of August. About that there seems to be no dispute. Then Mr. Booth, the division superintendent, came there on the premises at the Greenback colliery for the purpose of taking possession; o,r rather Mr. Luther. At least the agents of the defendant came there on that afternoon for the purpose of taking possession between two and three o’clock. Now the plaintiff alleges that Mr. White did not become, at that time, the mining boss of the defendant, but that he was employed by the defendant and went to work for the defendant shortly afterwards, and the contention is, on the part of the plaintiff, that Mr. White was not acting in the capacity of mining boss on the afternoon that Patrick Haley and the others were sent down in the mines to do the work that I have referred to. That is a question that I leave to you to determine from the evidence in the case. You will recollect the testimony of several witnesses, and I need not refer to them by name, indeed Mr. White is one of them who stated that in the afternoon of the 20th of August, Mr. Booth came there,' and after talking over matters, authorized Mr. White, who the defendant claims from that time became the mining boss or underground foreman, at that time, to <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>employ hands for the purpose of going down into the second lift at the face for the purpose of doing the work.

White in not properly examining the air-ways and ventilation of the said colliery, and taking the proper precautions to prevent the escape of noxious or poisonous gases from Buck Ridge colliery, or any other source, into Greenback colliery where the plaintiff’s husband was employed, the plaintiff cannot recover because such negligence would be the negligence of a fellow servant, and within the ordinary risks taken into consideration at the time said Patrick Haley became employed as a workman at Greenback colliery.

      <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>Up to this point we find no fault with the ruling of the court below. The error into which the learned judge inadvertently fell, was in submitting to the jury the question whether Andrew G. White was inside foreman or mine boss at Greenback colliery at the time of the accident. The submission of such a question to the jury in a case of this description, whether with or without evidence, could lead only to a verdict for the-plaintiff. The law is practically so administered in Pennsylvania. It is therefore especially important to inquire whether the facts justified such submission. The plaintiff’s husband lost his life by inhaling deadly gases in what is known as the Greenback colliery on the 20th of August, 1884. Prior to that day one H. J. Toudy was the owner of this colliery and operated it. He sold it to the defendant company, which owned an adjoining colliery, called the Buck B-idge mine. The formal delivery of the mine was made on the afternoon of the day before mentioned. Early in the morning of that day, and before the formal transfer, a fire was discovered in the underground workings of the Buck Ridge mine. The gases generated by this fire found their way into the Greenback colliery by means of openings between the two collieries. It was clearly the duty of the mine boss of the Greenback colliery to have closed these openings, and thus prevent the impure air from entering it. It was the neglect of this duty which caused the accident. Of this there cannot be a shadow of doubt as the Greenback colliery was shown to be free from impure air until the fire broke out in the Buck Ridge colliery. At the time of the transfer the fact was known to the parties that the Buck Ridge colliery was on fire. There was evidence which I do not understand to be disputed that when the defendants took possession of the colliery they inquired of Mr. Toudy, the former owner, as to its condition and were told that it could be worked without regard to Buck Ridge. In other words, that it was not in any danger from gas from the Buck Ridge colliery. They could only know this from the report of others competent to judge or from personal inspection. Mr. White, the mine boss, denied that any inquiries had been made of him by the defendant in regard to the condition of the mine. Be that as it may, it does not appear that he warned defendant that the openings in question had not been closed up.</p>
    <p id="b149-3" data-blocks='[["BL_149.3",149,[217,396,1169,965]]]'>
      <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>With this brief statement of the facts it remains to consider the position of Mr. White. That he was the mine boss under Mr. Toudy is not disputed. That he continued in that employment was proved by a number of reputable witnesses, whose testimony was practically un contradicted. The only conflicting evidence was that of Andrew G. White himself. This witness was called by the plaintiff and was manifestly an unfriendly witness to the defendant. Indeed, it was alleged that he had a suit pending against the defendant company. Mr. White does not deny that he was mine boss for Mr. Toudy, and, after the transfer, for the defendant company. His allegation that the latter did not pay him for his services on the 20th of August, but that his pay commenced upon the 21st, is the merest quibble. He admitted that he had been paid for the 20th by the Greenback colliery, and that his pay commenced on the 21st by the defendant company. So that in point of fact there was not a moment of time that he was not paid for his services as mine boss. And he was acting as mine boss at the very time of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b149-4" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[216,1369,1170,1060]],["BL_150.1",150,[266,396,1170,146]]]'>Aside from this, the negligence of which he was guilty, and which was the cause of the unfortunate accident, was committed by him prior to the day of the transfer, and when there was no dispute as to his being the mine boss. It was his duty to have kept these openings closed, and it was only the rapid generation of gases by the fire in the Buck Ridge colliery, and the subsequent accident, that disclosed his negligence. It was his duty to have kept those openings closed at all times and under all circumstances to prevent just such accidents as this. Neither he nor any one else could tell at what moment foul air might come in from the Buck Ridge mine, nor from what cause. He had a map of the mines and might and ought to have known of the openings. This is a duty cast upon him by the act of assembly. The most important of all his duties is to see to the proper ventilation of the mine, and to guard against the possibility of such an accident as this. The employment of a mine boss is made compulsory upon the mine owner, and there is no allegation that White was not a competent man, much less that his employer knew that he was incompetent. We have repeatedly held, as before stated, that the owner of a mine is not responsible for the negligence of the mine boss, unless <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>he is incompetent and the owner knows him to be so. To allow a recovery under the facts as developed would be to fritter away this rule so far as it is applicable to this case.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[266,548,1170,297]]]'>The fact that the defendant company sealed up its mine to smother the fire, has little importance. It was not negligence to do this, and it was not bound to know that the openings had been left open by "White. -And it is more than probable from the evidence that careful inquiries were made as to the condition of the Greenback colliery before the accident occurred.</p>
    <p id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[265,853,1172,94]]]'>We are of opinion that the defendant’s first point should have been affirmed without qualification.</p>
