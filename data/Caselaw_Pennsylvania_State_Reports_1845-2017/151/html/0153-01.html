The later cases hold that the character of the contract controls. Of course, if the contract is to build houses in different squares, they are distinct contracts, and the material-man may ascertain what material is delivered in each square, but where the contract relates wholly to a single square, even though the contractor leaves a space in the middle to be located as a street, there is no means of determining to which of the houses the material is furnished.

The acts of 1836 and 1850, while omitting the word “adjoining,” were passed for the purpose of defining the mode of working out an apportionment of claim authorized to be filed by previous acts. Houses built on the opposite side of the same street do not adjoin, whether the street is public or private. Lots may adjoin in the rear when the houses are built on the opposite sides of parallel streets. An alley in the rear may not separate the lots, as in Fitzpatrick v.

The amendment would not have cured the defect; it was too vague. What is “ dedication ” is an inference of law rather than of fact. It did not negative the fact that Rutledge avenue was opened for the purpose of building a row of houses on each side thereof and that plaintiff furnished the materials with that end in view. The opening of the street was a permanent severance. Dedication is a question of intention. It may be shown by conveyance of lots described as bounded by streets: Schenley v.

    <p id="b178-6" data-blocks='[["BL_178.6",178,[237,742,1176,607]]]'>It sufficiently appears that the claim was filed, in due form, to cover a building operation in which the defendant, in the dual capacity of owner and contractor, built one hundred and two houses upon a block of land bounded by Indiana avenue on the north, Cambria street on the south, C street on the east and Rosehill street on the west. Prior to commencement of the work and for some time thereafter there was not, nor had there ever been any street or public highway of any kind between either of said boundary streets and avenue; nor had any right, by dedication or otherwise, to use any portion of said block of land, been acquired by the public, prior to the commencement of said building operation thereon, and for some time thereafter.</p>

Some of the houses are described as fronting on one side and some on the other side of that strip or avenue. That does not necessarily make the houses fronting on one side so wholly separate and distinct from those on the other side of the street, as to prevent the inclusion of them all in one general apportioned lien within the meaning of the mechanics’ lien law, any more than were the houses in Taylor v. Montgomery, , <a href="/pa/20/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="20 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="972393" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0443-01">20 Pa. 443</a>, or those in <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>Fitzpatrick v.

In the first of these cases, thirty-two houses had been erected by the same person on one piece of land—one half of them on one street, and the others on an adjacent parallel street. The lots on which each row or block of houses, respectively, was erected adjoined each other in the rear. It was there contended that, inasmuch as the respective houses were on distinct streets and of different sizes, there could be no apportionment; but this court held otherwise. It is there said: “ The mechanics’ lien laws recognize the filing of one lien against several houses and the apportionment of the amount among them; but they do not define the cases in which such joint lien is proper. In order to obtain such definition, we must resort to the analogy of other cases, and the case of joint contracts requiring joint remedies is an obvious one.” “ Here all the buildings were put up by the owner at one time and on one lot, and the materials were furnished for them all jointly, and it was entirely proper to make them the subject of one apportioned lien.”</p>

Allen, supra, an apportioned lien was filed against twenty houses, ten on south side of Christian street, between 23d and 24th streets, the lots extending south to a narrow alley, and ten on north side of Montrose street, between same streets as above, and the lots extending north to same alley. After noting the fact that the expression, “ adjoining houses,” in the act of 1831, was modified by the omission of the word “ adjoining,” in the 13th section of the amended act of 1836 and also in the act of April 25, 1850, and referring to several adjudicated cases, it is there said: “ Thus it is evident, from the current of legislation and judicial decision, that the chief criterion in these cases of apportioned liens is the contract under which the claim arises, while the characteristic of the adjoinder of the buildings is not so prominent. Indeed, its omission, both in the act of 1836 and 1850, shows a decided want of attention to it in the legislative mind. . . . Under the spirit of legislation and decision we may hold, with perfect confidence, that where two blocks of houses, built under the same contract, are not divided by a public street or alley, but merely by a private way, the right of which belongs <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>to both blocks, there is not such a severance as will prevent an apportionment of the claim among the several houses.”</p>

Allen, and is expressly ruled by it. It is there said: “ The space of sixty feet, between these blocks of houses, was not a public street; it had not been dedicated as such before the buildings were commenced, whatever may have been the intention of the parties.
