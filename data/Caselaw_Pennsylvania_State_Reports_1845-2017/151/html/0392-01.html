Am coming over with purchaser ‘ City of Kingston,’ representing Northern Pacific interest, to look at4 Charlotte.’ If we cannot trade satisfactorily with owners you can get a new contract. If we can trade you can of course contract to duplicate. Better meet us at hotel and make Jackson’s acquaintance. In making him price cover usual brokerage five per cent.” Defendants replied that Mr. Levy would meet plaintiff, and on the evening of ' Oct. 3,1889, they met, and he was introduced by plaintiff to Captain Jackson. Plaintiff testified that he introduced Jackson to Levy as the manager of the Puget Sound &amp; Alaska Steamship Co., who was in the market to buy two steamers and to build two steamers, and that they had come over to <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>see the steamship “ Charlotte,” which the defendants were then building for other parties, as one of the vessels which, from general description, seemed suitable for his requirement. Plaintiff introduced evidence which tended to show that negotiations were then commenced for the making of a contract for the building by defendants for said company of a new steam vessel; and that these negotiations, in which plaintiff took part, had terminated, on Nov. 27,1889, in a contract between defendants and said Puget Sound &amp; Alaska Steamship Co. for the construction of a steam vessel for the price of 1158,000. He also averred that his services had been used in negotiations for the contract without any intimation on the part of defendants that they did not expect to pay his commissions, and that five per centum was the usual commission charged by brokers in such case.</p>

The uncontradicted evidence is that Captain Jackson had no power to award the contract to build, and that, as testified by Mr. Jackson, Mr. Oakes and Mr. Mallory, when the competitive bids were opened it was found that the defendants’ bid and that of Mr. Marvel were nearly alike, and that Mr. Oakes alone had the power to award the contract and that he gave it to Neafie &amp; Levy, the defendants, because they offered to build and deliver the vessel at an earlier date, and by advice of Mr. Mallory, whom Oakes had employed as constructing engineer. With this award of the contract the plaintiff had nothing whatever to do; the plaintiff is, therefore, not entitled to recover any portion of his commissions, and your verdict must be for the defendants.” Refused.
