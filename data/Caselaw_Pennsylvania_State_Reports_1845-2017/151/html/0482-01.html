The possession of such blanks was a highly suspicious circumstance, calling for clear explanation, and none the less so, whether plaintiff then had this note or not. The lapse of time was not important. If this note was a forgery as defendant claimed, then its having been ante-dated was not only consistent with defendant’s theory but was highly probable, and even if it was not antedated the possession of blanks with the maker’s signature, when the plaintiff already had this note representing the value of a large part of his estate, called equally for explanation.</p>
