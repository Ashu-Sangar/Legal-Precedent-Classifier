Harper, then the joint owner with David Williams of the Fulmer land; that the dam so erected was maintained and at the time of the bringing of this suit existed as it had been from the time it was first built when Henry Fulmer, and those under whom he claims, purchased the title of Henry Harper, part of the Fulmer tract; that the dam was visible and apparent; that the dam did not at any time operate to divert or draw any of the water of the Lehigh river out of its natural course or channel, and that it did not in any way interrupt, impede or interfere with the navigation of the Lehigh river, or any of its parts; that the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company, holding from the commonwealth the exclusive right itself, and those to whom it granted permission to use all the water power of the Lehigh river, and to build dams for that purpose, knew of the existence of this dam and made no objection to its maintenance, but frequently consulted and conferred with the plaintiff as to the rental he should pay for the use of the water. Plaintiff proposed to prove that along this western bank of the Lehigh river and at his factory, he put in a turbine water-wheel some six or eight years before the injury complained of, the waterwheel being at a point between high and low water mark, and that the putting in of the wheel did not interfere with the navigation of the stream; that from this water power the plaintiff operated the machinery of his mill, employing from one hundred and fifty to two hundred hands; that in 1881, before the commencement of this suit, Mr. Fulmer, the defendant, deposited and dumped the refuse and rubbish of his slate quarry to the extent of thousands of tons into this branch or arm of the river at a point above the lands of the plaintiff, and that before this suit was brought this deposit of rubbish extended beyond low water mark, and almost entirely across the channel of the river, thus preventing the flow of the water through said arm as it had been accustomed to flow, gradually reducing the quantity of water that flowed through the chan<a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>nel, so that there was not sufficient to furnish the power for propelling plaintiff’s mill.

For, if the question of obstruction cannot be submitted as a matter of fact for the determination of the jury, then such injury must be deemed to have been <em>damnum absque injuria. </em>The strip between high and low water marks is as much a part of the highway as the middle of the stream is, for, when the water is high, there may be navigation there. I conceive that it cannot be submitted to the jury to say that a part of. the public highway may be obstructed, except temporarily by municipal regulation, simply because it does not interfere with the public’s use, and that for interference with such an obstruction, the erector thereof may recover damages. I understand the decisions of the Supreme Court upon this subject, including that rendered in this ease, to be, that no one may lawfully place an obstruction in a navigable stream even below high or low water mark. An undershot wheel, such as is described in the offer, is an obstruction. No matter how it is constructed, it must touch the water and be in the highway. It differs from a dam only in the extent of the obstruction created. The objection is sustained and the evidence excluded; bill sealed for the plaintiff. [2, plaintiff.]</p>

[I can conceive of a case where lands might be owned in large tracts, and where the ground might be comparatively flat and level, and with a stream which is a public highway flowing through it, and where one man by damming up the stream and digging a trench might take away the stream entirely from his neighbor, and then bring it back again to its natural bed below his neighbor’s land, and nobody might be affected by it except that neighbor.

The same parties were before us in 1888 with substantially the same questions, and the case is reported in <a href="/pa/122/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="122 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1948393" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0191-01">122 Pa. 191</a>.</p>
    <p id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.7",435,[188,649,1165,402]]]'>The plaintiff is a manufacturer of school slates. His factory is situated on the west bank of the Lehigh river, and prior to 1883 the machinery was propelled by water power. This was obtained by means of a dam thrown across an arm of the river that flowed between an island and the main land on which the factory was located. The dam raised the surface of the water above it from one to two feet, which was sufficient to furnish the power required for the factory.</p>
    <p id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.8",435,[189,1058,1165,503]]]'>The defendant owns and operates a slate quarry on land immediately above that of the plaintiff. He has been dumping the refuse from his quarries for many years into the river a little way above the plaintiff’s factory. He had in this manner filled up the channel of the arm of the river far beyond low water mark, and had nearly closed the channel into which it flowed. The water was by this means diverted from the front of the plaintiff’s land and thrown into the channel on the opposite side of the island, and the water power of the plaintiff was completely destroyed.</p>
    <p id="b435-6" data-blocks='[["BL_435.9",435,[191,1569,1169,857]],["BL_436.1",436,[270,395,1174,1010]]]'>This action was brought to recover damages for the destruction of the water power. The defence rested on the general proposition that the Lehigh river was a navigable public highway belonging to the commonwealth; that the plaintiff as a riparian owner had no right to its waters or the power to be obtained from them, but that the state had granted the exclusive right to such water power to the Lehigh Navigation Company which was still its owner. We held that the defence was well taken so far as the water power was concerned; but that the plaintiff was nevertheless entitled to recover for any injury he had sustained by reason of the diversion of the stream from its natural channel along the front of his land; and if any such diversion had been affected with malice toward the plaintiff, or for the purpose of inflicting injury upon him, exemplary damages might also be given. Another trial has now taken place resulting in a recovery for the plaintiff, although for a smaller sum than before. From this judgment both parties have ap<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>pealed. The plaintiff asks us to reconsider our former holding so far as it relates to the water power, and allow a recovery at the very least for the loss of such power as the water flowing between high and low water marks would afford him, in addition to the damages which he has recovered as a riparian owner. The defendant on the other hand asks us to reconsider our judgment so far as to deny the plaintiff any right to recover damages for the diversion of the stream, and hold him to be remediless. We must decline to do either. The plaintiff is without title' to the water or the power to be derived from it whether above low water mark or below it. He used it for years it is true, but the right to use it was in the Navigation Company, the grantee of the commonwealth, and not in him. His use of it could have been stopped at any time. He cannot recover for that to which he has no title. But he was the owner of land lying upon a navigable stream. The advantages of his location were inseparable from the ownership of the land, and if they increased its desirability or added to its value for purposes of business or of pleasure they were his property as truly as the land itself.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[270,1414,1172,961]]]'>The diversion of the stream was an injury to his land that was direct, peculiar, and not shared with the general public. It was as clearly actionable as the diversion of a stream passing over his land. Whoever brought about such diversion so as to deprive him of the advantages of his location, whatever they were, inflicted a pecuniary wrong upon him. The manner in which the diversion is brought about is not important. It might be accomplished by means of elaborate works arranged to carry the stream elsewhere, or it might be affected by filling up the channel so as to compel it to seek another. The result accomplished and the injury inflicted would be the same. The lower riparian owner would be deprived of the natural advantages which ownership of the land at that point gave him, by the unlawful act of another; and he would have a right to call upon the wrongdoer to repair the wrong done him by restoring the stream to its channel or making compensation for its loss. The learned trial judge followed the rule laid down in Williams v. Fulmer-, <a href="/pa/122/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="122 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1948393" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0191-01">122 Pa. 191</a>, and tried the cause with discrimination and ability.</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[275,2383,1168,93]]]'>The assignments of error in both appeals are overruled and the judgment affirmed.</p>
