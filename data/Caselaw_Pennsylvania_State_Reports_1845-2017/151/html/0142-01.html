If you recollect that in the latter part of 1889 you were requested by the board of directors to inquire of Charles S. Wentzel whether the indorsement upon a note of $650 was his or not, state whether or not you did inquire of him, and state what answer he gave you. A. I recollect it; yes, sir. The note was presented at the bank at the meeting of the board and was passed upon, was looked over by the members of the board, and, as 1 knew Mr. Wentzel, I was requested to see him and ask him about his indorsement on that note, which I did on the same day. Q. Where did you see him? A. I met him at his place of stopping at the Berks County House, about noon or a little after 12 o’clock. Q. What was the amount of the note which you were to inquire about? A. Six hundred and fifty dollars. Q. Made by whom and indorsed by whom? A. Made by William C. Keller and indorsed by Charles S. Wentzel. Q. What did you say to Mr. Wentzel? A. I spoke to him about Mr. Keller, as to his standing, first; he told me he was not considered worth anything, and then I spoke to him about this note that was presented at the bank and asked him if it was all right, if he had indorsed for him. He said he had. He said <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>he had indorsed frequently or a number of times, and that it was all right. I asked him what he thought Mr. Keller did with so much money at once. He said he thought he used it in his business. Q. Did you mention the amount of the note? A. I said so large a note, $650, so much money. Q. Did you then report to the cashier what Wentzel told you? A. After Mr. Wentzel said it was all right and that he had indorsed for Mr. Keller—shortly after that, I do not know how long—I went to the bank and said it was all right. Q. The same day ? A. The same day; yes, sir. Q. When was this? How do you fix the date ? A. This was the same day the note was presented at the bank for discount; I fix upon that day, which was September 7; that was the time it was presented.”</p>

Which of the $650 notes did you inquire about, the one dated September 7 or December 14? A. September 7. Q. How do you know it was September 7 and not the note of December 14 ? A.

Not after-wards, no ; only about this note. Q. You never spoke about the notes in suit, did you ? A. No, sir; never spoke to him about those. Q.

Defendant’s liability, as maker of the first note, was virtually conceded, and there was accordingly a verdict in plaintiff’s favor for $211.87, the amount of said note, with interest.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[199,1533,1170,606]]]'>Defendant’s liability on the $650 note or the $550 renewal note was the main subject of contention in the court below, as it is here. It was claimed by the bank, that, as indorser of the $550 renewal note, duly protested for non-payment, etc., defendant was liable for the amount thereof with interest from April 19, 1890, the maturity thereof. Evidence was introduced, tending to prove that both $200 notes were made by defendant and that he indorsed the others. Keller, by whom the notes were negotiated, testified in substance that the names of both the maker and indorser of all the above mentioned notes, as well as others referred to in the testimony, were genuine signatures.</p>

Rowland, cashier of the bank, were examined, and both testified, in substance, that after the $200 and $650 notes came into the bank’s possession they were shown to defendant, in their presence, and after examining them he admitted that his signatures as maker of the former and indorser of the latter were respec<a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>tively genuine. Mr. Bertolet was asked: “ Do you recollect on one occasion that Charles'S. Wentzel came into bank and your showing him this original $200 note, and a note for $650, which is not here, made by Keller and indorsed by Wentzel, and asking him whether these were his signatures? A. Yes, sir; this seems to be the note I showed him at the time. Q. Did you show him the $650 note at the same time ? A. Yes, sir; I think I did; positive I did. Q. Are you positive you showed him two notes? A. Showed him two notes. Yes, sir; those which we had on hand at the time. Q. The other was for that amount ? A. The other was for $650, afterwards renewed for $550. Q. Who was the maker and indorser of that $650 note? A. Keller was the maker and Wentzel the indorser. Q. How did Wentzel happen to come into bank? A. I think he had a check cashed. I knew the gentleman and called Mr. Rowland’s attention to the matter. We decided then to show him the notes. As I spoke to Mr. Wentzel on the subject I found that he had indorsed for him and I showed the two notes to which he acknowledged his signature. Q. Did he examine them ? A. He examined them very closely. I gave him first the larger note, and while he was looking at that note I gave him also the $200 note. He after-wards went to the window and examined them closely, put on his glasses to make doubly sure of it. Q. What did he say? A. He said after I had asked him—he spoke in German to me—he said he had written these notes, these signatures were his.”</p>

In the words of the witness: “ Mr. Wentzel examined them carefully, and in my presence, in my hearing, he answered that he had written the names.”</p>

This was objected to, and the court, refusing to sustain the objection, said: “ The witness having testified that he saw the <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>genuine signature of the defendant, admitted by the defendant to be genuine, he will be permitted now to give his opinion as to the genuineness of the signature in question, based upon his knowledge of the handwriting acquired in that form.” The two notes were then handed to the witness, and he thereupon testitified: “ I think they are Charles S. Wentzel’s signatures.”</p>

He admitted that the $650 note was shown to and examined by him in the bank, as testified to by the cashier and teller, that the latter asked him if he had signed it, and he believed he did not deny that he had. He also testified that he then knew the indorsement was a forgery; and on the witness-stand he undertook to explain why he did not frankly say so to the bank officers when he was asked whether the indorsements were genuine or not. His conduct, in that regard, as testified by himself, was not what it should have been.</p>
    <p id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[215,1320,1170,402]]]'>The case was submitted to the jury on the evidence above referred to, and other testimony including test papers containing signatures of defendant admitted to be genuine, with instructions to inquire and determine whether the indorsement of either the $650 or the $550 note was genuine.

As expressed in the offer itself, it was made for the specific “ purpose of estopping the defendant from denying the signature.” We are unable to see that it was competent for that purpose. If the witnesses had such knowledge of defendant’s handwriting, <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>from having seen and examined signatures which, in their presence he admitted to be genuine, as would have enabled them to testify to his alleged indorsement of the $550 note, it doubtless would have been received for that purpose. In point of fact, the cashier of the bank was permitted to testify that in his opinion, based upon the knowledge he had, etc., the indorsements in question “ are Charles S. Wentzel’s signatures.” But the mere opinion of witnesses that the signatures were his, could not have the effect of estopping the defendant from denying that they were. Moreover, test papers, bearing signatures admitted to be his, were submitted to the jury, and it was their.duty to make the comparison, and draw therefrom such inference as was warranted.</p>

    <p id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[279,1259,1174,708]]]'>There was no error in refusing to affirm plaintiff’s second point, recited in the 4th specification. Aside from the reasons assigned by the learned judge for not affirming the point, we think it was rightly refused on other grounds. As to the item of claim referred to,- the action was against defendant as indorser. The $650 note was not protested for non-payment; and, of course, no recovery could be had against him as indorser of that note. Under the statement of claim filed, the bank was not entitled to a verdict for the $550 and interest, without proving to the satisfaction of the jury that the indorsement of the $550 note was made by defendant or by his authority. That note was duly protested, and the only question was whether the indorsement was genuine. The burden of proving that it was rested on the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b174-6" data-blocks='[["BL_174.6",174,[277,1973,1171,401]]]'>Appellant has no just reason to complain of the learned judge’s answer to defendant’s second point, in which he was requested to charge: “ Even if the jury believe the evidence of John M. Bartolet and F. A. Rowland that the defendant admitted to them that he had signed the $650 note, dated December 14, 1889, they cannot find a verdict in favor of plaintiff for the $550 note, unless they believe that the defendant, Charles S. Wentzel, signed and indorsed said note for $550.”</p>

But it is not pretended that he was the maker of that note. On the contrary, it is averred in the statement of claim that he indorsed it, and there is no evidence that it was protested for nonpayment, or that demand and notice of protest were waived by defendant.</p>

      <em>It </em>may be that there was a miscarriage of justice in this case, but we find nothing in the record that would warrant a reversal of the judgment. If the jury made a mistake in not finding the facts as they should have done, that is an error which we are powerless to correct.</p>
