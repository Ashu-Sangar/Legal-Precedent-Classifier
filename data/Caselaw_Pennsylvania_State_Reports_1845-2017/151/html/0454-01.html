If the court should be of the opinion that the defendant was not exempt, then judgment for the plaintiff upon the verdict; but if the court should be of the opinion that the defendant was exempt, then judgment for the defendant, non obstante veredicto. The defendant is a corporation or association of individuals, doing a general banking business in the city of Oil City. In 1881 the city of Oil City became a city of the third class, under the act of 1874, known as the Wallace act. Under this act, cities <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>of the third class were, inter alia, empowered under clause 4 to levy and collect license tax on auctioneers, contractors, druggists, bankers, peddlers, etc., and regulate the same by ordinance. Under an ordinance approved May 29, 1885, all banks doing business in this city were required to pay a license of $50 per annum. The validity of the ordinance was not attacked, except in so far as its power to levy and collect the license fee in controversy is concerned, and the disposition of this question, in my opinion, is reduced to a single proposition, viz.: Is the charge in controversy a tax, or is it a license fee, under the police regulation ? If it be a tax for revenue, the plaintiff cannot recover, whether it be denominated a tax or a license fee. The taxing power is to be distinguished from the police power, and the power to license and regulate particular branches of business or matters is usually a police power, but when license fees or exactions are plainly imposed for the sole and main purpose of revenue, they are in effect taxes: Dillon on Municipal Corporations, section 609; see also Ibid., sections 291-296, inclusive, and the numerous citations in the foot notes. In Franklin &amp; Philadelphia Passenger Railroad Co. v. Phila., <a href="/pa/58/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="58 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1013222" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0119-01">58 Pa. 119</a>, under an ordinance, the city imposed a license tax of $50 on each street car run by the company in the city; this was held a valid ordinance as a police regulation. The same principle is affirmed in Johnson v. Phila., <a href="/pa/60/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="60 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="1014396" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0445-01">60 Pa. 445</a>, where it was held, inter alia, that the imposition of a reasonable charge for a license, as a police- regulation, although its incidental operation should augment the receipts into the treasury, is not invalid, and that if a municipal regulation, when intended for one purpose, is lawful, and unlawful if for another, the presumption is that the purpose is lawful, unless it clearly appears otherwise. There is nothing in this case we are now considering from which it could be inferred, nor is it contended by counsel for the defendant that the license fee charged is an unreasonable one, and in the absence of anything appearing to the contrary, the presumption is that it is a reasonable one ; see cases last cited. For the reason given, I am of the opinion that the charges in controversy are not a tax, but a reasonable license fee, valid - under the city police regulation. And now, to wit: April 4, 1892, it is ordered that judgment be entered for the plaintiff on the verdict.”</p>

On its face it purports to be a license fee on the occupation of banking, and though we may suppose it was not imposed without an eye to the increase of revenue, yet its good faith and the reasonableness of its amount are not questioned here, and the presumption therefore is that it is what it professes to be: Johnson v.

    <p id="Ayr" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[207,754,1166,1114]]]'>The appellant argues that banks are not specially subjects of the police power, and quoting Dillon on Municipal Corporations, sect. 141 (edition of 1890) that “ laws and ordinances relating to the comfort, health, convenience, good order and general welfare of the inhabitants are comprehensively called police laws or regulations,” asks wherein does the regulation or licensing of the business of banking relate to the comfort, health or good order of the community? We are not required to answer this question further than to say that it is a matter for legislative determination. Certain occupations, such as tavern keeping, theatrical and kindred shows, public conveyances, barges, etc., were regulated by license in England before the settlement of Pennsylvania, and the colonists brought with them the idea of state control of such matters. Others, such as auctioneers, hawkers and peddlers, etc., were licensed by statute so early and so continuously in the history of our legislation that their appropriateness as subjects of liegnse became familiar as part of the common law of Pennsylvania. Thus aetioneers were classed with hawkers, peddlers, and petty chapmen in “ an act for regulating peddlers, vendues,” etc., passed February 14, 1729-30, aud have been subject to license regulations almost if not quite continuously from that date.</p>

What business or occupations so far affect the public Welfare and good order as to require to be licensed, is a matter of legislative consideration and control, which when exercised in good faith are outside of the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>

The act therefore does not exempt banks from the power of cities to impose a license tax under the act of 1874, and. the learned judge below was right in so holding.</p>

The judgment is for the license tax for the years 1886 to 1890 inclusive. As already said banks are not intrinsically and obviously subjects of license under the police power by the common law of this state. They become such by statute only, and the license fees recovered in the present case rest on the authority of the act of 1874. But that act was supplied and repealed by the act of May 23, 1889, P. L. 277. The act of 1874 confers the taxing powers for revenue in clauses 1, 2 &amp; 3, of sect. 20, P. L. 238, the license tax power in clause 4, and then, in the following clauses, enumerates expressly the most usual and important police powers, over tippling houses, games and gambling houses, sanitary and quarantine regulations, etc. In this act the licensing of banks is apparently intended to be classed under police powers. The act of 1889 however enumerates and classifies the various municipal powers more fully and more accurately. Article V, sect. 3, clauses 1, 2 &amp; 3 of the act of 1889 follow closely the language of clauses 1, 2 &amp; 3 of sect. 20 of the act of 1874, and clause 4, like that of the prior act, relates to license taxes, but <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>makes this important change in the language, “ to levy and collect, for <em>general revenue purposes, </em>a license tax,” etc., enumerating many kinds of business and occupation, but significantly omitting shows, theatres, etc., included in the corresponding section of the act of 1874. Then follow a number of clauses relating also to the revenue, as power to borrow money, to fund indebtedness, rates of interest, etc., and it is not until clause 16 that the usual police powers are reached, among which in clause 25 is included the power “ to license and collect license tax from skating rinks, theatres,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[190,899,1167,1158]]]'>By the express language of clause 4 above referred to the authority given to cities by this act to license bankers is for general revenue, and as if to emphasize the chango of legislative purpose, the grant is transferred from its previous place in the enumeration of police powers to a place among the powers of taxation for revenue. It is therefore unquestionably a tax in the general sense and we have to consider whether appellant is exempted from it by the acts of June 30, 1885, and June 1, 1889. Of this there can be no doubt. The language of the act of 1885, sect 3, has already been quoted. It exempts from “ all other taxation under the laws of this commonwealth.” The words could not be broader. They apply not only to taxation for state but also for local purposes, and that they were intended to do so is clear from the exception of capital, etc., “ not invested in real estate.” It is matter of public history that there was no state tax on real estate in 1885 or for many years prior, and if exemption from local taxation was not intended it is hardly supposable that the legislature would have inserted an entirely unnecessary and useless clause. But to put the matter beyond all possible question, the act of June 1, 1889, sect. 25, P. L. 433, changes the language previously used and makes the exemption “ from local taxation, under the laws of this commonwealth.”</p>
