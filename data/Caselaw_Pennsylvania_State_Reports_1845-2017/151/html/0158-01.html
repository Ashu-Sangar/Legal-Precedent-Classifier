Did you try to solve this problem as to how to take this tar away, to the best of your ability? A. Yes, sir. We studied the matter for a month or two, and we wanted to get the most economical way to do it. We came to the conclusion that this would be the cheapest way. Q. Did,.you try to get near works in which to do it? Were there any other works in which you could do it ? A. No, sir. Q. Where did you finally do it ? A. We finally took it away to our works at Point Breeze. Q. In order to do the work there, you had to get the tar down there? A. Yes, sir. Q. What was the only way you had to get it down there ? A. By this boat. Q. Why was it necessary to get the tar down by boat ? A. We had to take it away in order to distil it and dispose of it. Q. Why could it not be gotten there by rail or in carts ? A. Well, we figured on hauling it down there and found that it would cost from $25,000 to $30,000, and we had found out that we could not take it in tank-ears, and this was the last resort. Q. Then you built that boat for that? A. Yes, sir. Q. What else did you have to do in order to carry out your contract? A. We had to increase our plant at our works at Point Breeze. Q. In what way was additional expense thrown upon you in performing this contract by reason of your having the ground taken away from you ? A. We had that expense for the boat, and we had to go to the expense of increasing our plant at Point Breeze to work that much tar. Then we had to pay additional for hauling and for barrels and for delivery to the market. Q. What do you mean by saying that you had to pay that much additional for hauling ? A. When we worked our coal tar up into the various products, when we were right at Market street, we would only have to haul to the various warehouses, but when we were manufacturing it' at Point Breeze we were put to additional expense in hauling it from Point Breeze. Q. Did you estimate in barrels the product you <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>took away ? What I want to know is this: What quantity of tar during the twenty-one months you dealt with ? A. I have vouchers here for the amount of tar at Market street, 2,789,373 gallons. That is the amount of tar we received and paid for during the twenty-one months, the balance of our contract. Then there was tar from Camden and from the Northern Liberties gas works, which, we had contracted to haul, with the tar from the Market street works. After they took the works down there we were compelled to haul it to Point Breeze. I have the vouchers here from those two gas companies, the number of gallons that we took away during the twenty-one months. Q. Did you have to pay an additional cost for unloading the tar-boat? A. Yes, sir; it cost us $300 for a pipe line to fit up to unload that boat. Q. What was the aggregate amount of the additional cost you were put to in receiving and disposing of the tar during those twenty-one months? A. $37,776.39.” [1]</p>

In December, 1889, the viewers awarded $43,153.53 damages in favor of plaintiffs, and both parties appealed. The court ordered that the cause should be put at issue for trial, etc., “ to determine what legal damage, if any, the plaintiffs may have sustained in consequence of the location of defendant’s railroad and the consequent taking and occupying by the defendant of the strip of ground .... described in the report of the viewers, and the construction of a railroad thereon, subject to the ruling of the court <em>. , </em>as to the date when the right of action accrued to plaintiffs, with the right of appeal by either party to the Supreme Court.”</p>

Several points for charge were presented by defendant company, all of which, except the two recited in the 8th <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>and 9th specifications of error, were withdrawn. These two points, after referring to the fact that the lease of the lot was to Michael Ehret, Jr., alone, that it contains a clause against subletting without consent of the lessor, etc., and averring that no consent to subletting or transfer to the other plaintiffs has been shown, etc., request the court to charge that the verdict must be for defendant. Both of these points were rightly refused. The covenant against subletting or assigning was for the benefit of the city. In the absence of any evidence that the city authorities objected to its lessee associating others with himself in the business contemplated by the lease, the defendant company has no just reason to object. It cannot be prejudiced by having two others joined with the lessor as plaintiffs. Moreover, the bald technical objection, grounded on alleged want of proper parties, came too late. It should have been raised, if at all, in limine, when the petition for appointment of viewers was presented,, or, at the very latest, when the issue was framed by the court. The 8th and 9th specifications are dismissed.</p>

The circumstances of the case were somewhat peculiar—quite out of the ordinary course. We have already referred to the contract to take all the tar made by the gas works, etc. The location of the leased lot adjoining the works from which plaintiffs were bound to receive their supply of tar, at least to the extent of the production of those works, afforded facilities for economically handling supplies and disposing of products, that could not be had elsewhere. They were bound by Mr. Ehret’s contract with the city to take and pay for all the tar made at those works. These and other matters that might be mentioned were elements which evidently and properly entered into the consideration and determination of the value of the lease. It was part of the property taken by defendant company as locum tenens of the common<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>wealth, property for which defendant was bound to make just compensation to plaintiffs from whom it was taken. It is a mistake to say that the introduction of the testimony referred to was a covert attempt to recover profits. It was nothing of the kind. They sought to show that the lease was worth what they claimed, because it saved to them certain expenses in performing a contract which had been entered into because of the advantages that were afforded. Among other things, it was shown that, in consequence of the leased lot having been taken, it was necessary to convey the tar to the place where it was distilled by a specially constructed boat; that it was also necessary to erect temporary works for distilling the same, etc. On principle as well as authority we think such evidence was not improper.

Vance, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20Pa.%20327" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="115 Pa. 327">115 Pa. 327</a>, testimony was received to prove loss of custom at a mill, not with the view of recovering the amount as damages but for the purpose of showing the extent to which the value of the mill property had been diminished.</p>

Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/133/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="133 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="812882" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0234-01">133 Pa. 234</a>, plaintiff was lessee of a coal wharf, etc., on which machinery for handling coal was erected. The defendant constructed its railroad across the property, dividing it into two parts and so interfering with plaintiff’s sheds, runs and other appliances, that it became necessary for him to construct new ones, involving also the erection of a high single span bridge, etc. The operation of these new appliances involved considerable breakage of and increased cost of handling the coal. For the purpose of showing the value of his leasehold as it was before part of it was taken by the railroad company, the plaintiff was permitted to prove the cost of the substituted appliances, the extent of waste necessarily resulting from their operation and the increased costs of such operation. In that case our Brother McCollum speaking for this Court said: “ It is well settled that the proper measure of damages is the depreciation in the market value of the property caused by the location and construction of the railroad. But the elements to be considered in the ascertainment of this depreciation are as varied as the properties affected <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>and the uses to which they are applied. A specification of all these elements is impossible, because they cannot be anticipated, and many of them remain to be developed in the course of the litigation consequent upon the taking of property by eminent domain. In the ordinary appropriation of- land for railroad purposes, the opinions of witnesses who are conversant with the property, and the general selling price of land in the vicinity, are received on the question of its value unaffected by the road and its value as affected by it. But this is not exclusive of other and in some cases better methods of proof. It may be stated as a general principle, applicable to cases of this sort, that whatever injuriously affects the property, as the direct and necessary result of the location of the road upon it, may be considered in the assessment of damages.”</p>
