We are unable to understand why it was not. The partnership property was largely made up of lands, merchandise, flour, grain and other personal property which had a visible and tangible existence and an actual situs in this state. As was said by Comstock, C. J., in Hoyt v. Comrs., <a href="/citations/?q=23%20N.Y.%20224" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="23 N.Y. 224">23 N. Y. 224</a>, 228, “ the fiction or maxim, <em>mobilia personam sequuntur, </em>is by no means of universal application. Like other fictions, it has its special uses. It may be resorted to when convenience and justice requires. In other circumstances, the truth and not the fiction affords, as it plainly ought to afford, the rule of action. ... I can think of no more just and appropriate exercise of the sovereignty of a state or nation over property situated within it and protected by its laws, than to compel it to contribute toward the maintenance of government and law.” “A nation within whose territory any personal property is actually situated, has an entire dominion over it while therein, in point of sovereignty and jurisdiction, as it has over immovable property situated there: ” Story’s Confl. of Laws, § 550.</p>

    <p id="b36-7" data-blocks='[["BL_36.7",36,[291,2193,1169,248]],["BL_37.1",37,[193,405,1172,1009]]]'>In Orcutt’s Ap., <a href="/pa/97/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="97 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="444784" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0179-01">97 Pa. 179</a>, the fund under consideration was proceeds of United States bonds deposited, temporarily for safe keeping in Philadelphia, by the testator, a citizen of New Jersey. Recognizing the general rule that the situs of personal property follows the domicile of its owner, and conceding the <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>well defined exceptions thereto, that when used in carrying on business and for other particular purposes, some species of personal property may have an actual situs distinct from the legal one, it was held that there was no reason in that case why either the bonds or their proceeds should, for any purpose, have a situs different from the owner’s domicile. The bonds were simply evidences of indebtedness, not by any person or corporation within the commonwealth, but by the general government. The facts of this case, however, are different and bring it within the exceptions to the fictitious rule. In the formation, location, etc., of their partnership association, the testator and his brothers evidently established the situs of the personal property which constituted its capital. They organized the association under the laws of this state, located its principal office and conducted its business therein and thus enjoyed the benefit of the law and protection of the state and local government. In such circumstances, as remarked in Hoyt v. Commissioners, supra, the truth and not the fiction plainly affords the rule of action. Neither convenience nor justice requires us to resort to the fictitious rule.</p>
    <p id="b37-3" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[192,1430,1178,802]]]'>If the partnership association of P. A. &amp; S. Small, Limited, had been a common law partnership, and the testator’s interest therein had been specifically bequeathed to his two brothers it undoubtedly would have been liable to collateral inheritance tax. There appears to be no good reason why the bequest should be exempt because it happens to be an interest in a limited partnership association. There is, of course, some difference in the two forms of partnership. In the one, the liability of members is general, in the other it is limited to the capital subscribed, and provision is made for selection of managers by whom the business is conducted in the name adopted by the association, etc., but there appears to be nothing in the mode of organization under the law nor in the manner of conducting the business that requires exemption of the tangible property of the one from payment of collateral inheritance tax, while that of the other is liable thereto.</p>

As legatees under the will, appellants acquired and still hold title to the whole of testator’s interest in the partnership association. The widow’s claim under the intestate law was relinquished in consideration of the money, securities and property she received. In no event could she have successfully claimed any of the partnership property, in specie, nor any specific portion of the interest bequeathed by her husband to his brothers. She would have been entitled to one half of the residue of her husband’s personal estate, remaining after payment of all debts, expenses of administration, etc. That was never ascertained, because a compromise was effected and her claim under the intestate law was relinquished. The- entire interest specifically bequeathed to appellees was received, and, for aught that appears, is still held by them.</p>
