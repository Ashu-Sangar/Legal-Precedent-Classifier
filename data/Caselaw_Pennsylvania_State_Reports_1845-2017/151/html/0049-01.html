Nearly three months thereafter, a replication was filed by leave of court, and an application, then made, for a rehearing, was denied. The only error assigned is the refusal of the court to award the citation.</p>
    <p id="b72-6" data-blocks='[["BL_72.10",72,[271,1107,1172,196]]]'>Appellant elected to set the cause down for hearing on petition and answer. According to the settled practice in equity, the effect of this was substantially to admit the truth of all matters of fact properly averred in the answer.</p>
    <p id="b72-7" data-blocks='[["BL_72.11",72,[270,1310,1175,657]]]'>In the petition, appellant avers that his testator, James W. Mercur, died in May, 1853; that his last will and testament was admitted to probate in August, 1862, and that letters testamentary thereon were granted in 1880, to Harriet A. Scott, who died testate in November, 1887, without having filed any inventory or account of said testator’s estate ; that the will of said Harriet A. Scott was not admitted to probate until March, 1889, when letters testamentary thereon were granted to the appellee, N. N. Betts ; that more than eight years have elapsed since said letters were granted to said Harriet A. Scott and that she failed to file and exhibit a just account and settlement of her testator’s estate in the register’s office of said eounty as required by law.</p>
    <p id="b72-8" data-blocks='[["BL_72.12",72,[271,1973,1170,295]]]'>After averring that he is interested in said estate, the petitioner prays that a citation may be awarded, directed to the said N.

Betts, answering the petition, admits the statements contained therein, except that said petitioner is interested in said estate. He further says that the testator <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>above named, “ by his last will, etc., (a copy of which is attached and marked exhibit A.,)devised and bequeathed all his real and personal estate of every kind and nature and wheresoever situated, after the payment of all his just debts, unto his wife Harriet, (the said Harriet A. Scott,) for her sole use and benefit during the term of her natural life—to use, expend, sell and convey as she might desire and think proper; that James W. Mercur died in 1853, and immediately after his death the said Harriet A. Scott, by virtue of said will, took possession of all said property and fully paid and discharged all the debts of the said James W. Mercur, and all claims against his estate, so that there are now no creditors thereof; ... . that all the personal property of the said James W. Mercur, after the payment of his debts and funeral expenses, was by the said Harriet A. Scott, as legatee, taken possession of and by her in her lifetime used and expended; ” and then concludes, by averring his belief that “ no part of the same remained at the time of her death.”</p>

Subject to the payment of all his just debts, the testator gave all his property to his wife, “ for her sole use and benefit during the term of her natural life, to use, expend, sell and convey as she may desire and think proper; and upon and immediately after her decease (or my decease in case I should survive her) the residue 1 will and bequeath as follows,” etc.</p>

On the contrary, it is distinctly averred that immediately after his death, by virtue of the will, she took possession of all said property, and fully paid and discharged all her husband’s debts; that all the personal property remaining after payment of his debts and funeral expenses was taken possession of by her, “ and by her in her lifetime used and expended,” and, according to appellant’s expressed belief, “ no part of the same remained at the time of her death.” She had a right to so use and expend it.

To her is given the sole power and exclusive right to decide how much thereof she shall use and consume. No one can call her to account for so doing. No one can interfere with her right of possession to every part thereof .... An inventory and appraisement of property, all of which may be consumed by the widow at her pleasure, would be useless if made.”</p>
