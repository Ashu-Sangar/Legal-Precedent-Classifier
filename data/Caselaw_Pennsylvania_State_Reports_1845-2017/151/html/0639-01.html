In spiritual matters the church adhered to the doctrine of the Evangelical Association of North America and received as its pastors the appointees of that body. This association is a religious body divided into twenty-five annual conferences for the government of which the association had formulated rules, called the book of discipline, which are binding upon all members, churches and associations. Each annual conference is presided over by one of the <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>three bishops elected by the general conference. It was the duty of Bishop Bowman to preside over the annual conference, styled the East Pennsylvania Conference, under whose authority the said church is and was. Bishop Bowman had been suspended from his office March 7, 1890, in accordance with the rules and discipline of the said association; i. e., three elders presented to him charges against him and requested an opportunity to examine him <em>; </em>but he refused to submit to an examination on the ground that three elders had already examined him, but without stating upon what charges he had been examined. Such examination was collusive, to defeat and evade a real examination. After notice to the said bishop the trial conference proceeded with the trial and suspended the bishop in due form and according to the rules of the association. At the fifty-second session of the East Pa. Conference, on Eeb. 26, 1891, Bishop Bowman was not allowed to preside because of his suspension, above set forth, and C. S. Hainan was elected to preside in accordance with said rules; but Bishop Bowman with twenty members of the East Pa. Conference withdrew and organized a pretended conference in another church, and by this conference defendant was appointed pastor of the Salem Church and the several other churches which were thus with-' out authority united in one preaching circuit. The Salem Church having previously been a separate congregation, one of the plaintiffs, George W. Gross, was appointed by the East Pa. Conference presided over by C. S. Haman, to' take charge of the Salem Church, aud has entered upon the performance of his office of pastor and is attended by all but thirty or forty members of the congregation. But defendant, as appointee of the alleged East Pa. Conference, is attempting to act as pastor, and withholds the records and the parsonage from said Gross, the lawfully appointed pastor. Said Gross has been recognized by the trustees as pastor.</p>

The trial conference had the authority to depose Bishop Bowman, and they did depose him—at least they passed sentence of suspension against him. If that sentence was valid it incapacitated the Rev. Bowman to preside, and to have permitted him to preside would have been a plain breach of duty. But by whom was the validity of the sentence to be determined? Clearly by a majority of the members present. The book of discipline provided no other tribunal. Besides, the decision of the question was a necessary step in the organization of the conference and consequently fell within its implied powers. Nor, as has been seen, have we any power to review the decision. The question, then, of the validity of Bishop Bowman’s sentence having been decided against him by a competent ecclesiastical tribunal, over which we have no control in this proceeding, the question must be considered as settled. It follows that the pretended conference, organized by the seceders from the ‘ Ebenezer ’ conference was without authority in law, and that Mr. Wieand’s appointment by that pretended conference to the pastorate of the Bangor Church was null and void. It also follows that Mr. Wieand has no right to the possession of the property in controversy. . . .</p>

Gross, claimed title to his office as preacher at Bangor by virtue of an appointment made by a body claiming to be the true East Pennsylvania Conference, presided over by Rev. Haman. The defendant, Rev. Wieand, claimed title to the same office by virtue of an appointment made by a body also claiming to be the true East Pennsylva<a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>nia Conference, presided over by Bishop Bowman. The question which of these bodies was the true East Pennsylvania Conference, was a disputed question' between the litigants in this case, and neither conceded, but each denied, the right of the other. The hearing before the learned court below was upon an application for a preliminary injunction by the plaintiff. An answer was filed denying the right of the plaintiff and the validity of his title to the office, and impugning absolutely the right and title of the body presided over by Rev. Haman, to be the true East Pennsylvania Conference, and denying and disputing many other matters of fact averred in the plaintiff’s bill. No replication was filed to this answer, no issue was made up between the parties, no master or examiner was appointed to take testimony or decide the case on its merits of fact and law, no testimony was taken in support of the allegations of either party and there was nothing before the court except the bill, answer and some ox parte affidavits. The learned court below, considering that there were no disputed facts in the case, entertained the cause as upon final hearing and made a final decree upon the merits in favor of the plaintiff. At the time of the decree there was an open and undecided question pending in the courts of the Evangelical Association of North America of which the Bangor church was a member, to wit, whether the body presided over by the Rev. Haman, or the one presided over by Bishop Bowman, -was the true East Pennsylvania Conference. An affidavit by Rev. Leopold is now filed stating that a general conference of the Evangelical Association of North America was held at Indianapolis on October 21, 1891, that he was chosen one of the secretaries and kept the minutes thereof, and that at said conference a resolution was adopted by which it was officially declared that the annual conference held in the year 1891 in the district of East Pennsylvania under the presidency of Bishop Bowman was the only lawful and regular annual conference of the association in that district; that the acts and doings of said annual conference and its appointments of preachers were the only regular and valid appointments for the year 1891; and that presiding elders elected at said conference were duly and lawfully elected. As this general conference of the whole church or association is alleged to be the Supreme Court of law in the church, “ with <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>power to decide upon all cases arising between annual conferences, or between annual conferences and their officers,” it would seem that the claim of the body presided over by Rev. Haman to be the true East Pennsylvania Conference has been decided adversely by its own court of last resort. If such shall prove to be the fact, upon final hearing of the ease upon its merits, the decree of the court below would have to be reversed and the plaintiff’s bill dismissed. Of course it was premature to decide the case as upon final hearing, and to grant the permanent relief prayed for in the bill, upon such a state of the pleadings and in such a condition of the proofs.</p>
