    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.7",78,[270,703,1173,556]]]'>The claim of the plaintiff in this case is extremely stale. The title which he proposes to impeach is the title which Adam S. Haas acquired by an orphans’ court sale held the 31st day of October, 1863. The present action of ejectment was not brought until the 18th day of February, 1885. The plaintiff’s claim is founded upon an allegation that the orphans’ court sale of 1863 passed no title to Adam S. Haas. It is claimed for the plaintiff that the money which was paid for the land conveyed to Adam S. Haas under that sale, was the money of Henry Haas, his father, and as against the creditors of Henry Haas the title is to be regarded as vested in Henry Haas.</p>
    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.8",78,[263,1266,1178,1210]]]'>Of course the legal title was in Adam S. Haas, and Henry Haas being, according to the allegation of the plaintiff, a particeps criminis with Adam S. Haas, could not impeach the title of Adam S. Haas. But it is said that, for the creditors of Henry Haas, the transaction is to be treated as a device to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of Henry Haas, and that John Kirkpatrick, being one of those creditors, was privileged to impeach the validity of the title in Adam S. Haas, and that the plaintiff having acquired the right of Kirkpatrick has the same privilege. Kirkpatrick obtained a judgment against Henry Haas in June, 1865, and upon execution process upon that judgment the land in question was sold to Kirkpatrick in December, 1865, by the sheriff, as the land of Henry Haas, for the sum of twenty dollars. Silliman, the plaintiff, obtained a conveyance of Kirkpatrick’s title by deed dated May 31, 1884, and upon that title this action of ejectment is founded. It will be observed therefore, that the sole question in this cause is the validity of Kirkpatrick’s title to the land. A question of the application of the statute of limitations arises both under the statute of frauds, and by adverse possession for twenty-one years. Another question of controlling importance arises as to the sufficiency of the evidence to impeach the title which Adam S. Haas acquired in 1863 by the orphans’ court sale above mentioned.</p>
    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.3",79,[208,397,1172,1474]]]'>
      <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>There is no doubt that Adam S. Haas, by the sale, acquired the legal title to the land. But it is claimed on behalf of the Kirkpatrick title that the money which paid for the land was furnished by Henry Haas in fraud of his, Kirkpatrick’s, right as a creditor of Henry Haas. It is not the case of a debtor conveying his land to another in fraud of his creditors, but that land, for which Kirkpatrick’s debtor paid money, was to be treated as the land of Henry Haas for the benefit of his creditors. It is at once manifest that, unless this allegation of the furnishing of the money by Henry Haas to pay for the land, was true in fact, the plaintiff has no case. Therefore it is of the last importance to consider what is the character of the testimony in the cause on that subject. In point of fact there is no proof in the case of the actual furnishing of any money by Henry Haas for the payment of the purchase money of the land. No one testified to any knowledge of such actual payment. The plaintiff alleges, however, and gave evidence to prove, that Henry Haas subsequently to the sale, declared that he wanted the deed made to his son Adam, because he (Henry) had gone bail for parties and had to pay it and it broke him up, and he would not dare buy it in his own name, but he had saved money enough to buy this place and another one like it; that he dare not put it in his name or else his creditors would come and take it from him. Two witnesses were examined, Joseph Faust and Henry R. Mauger, who testified substantially to the declarations. Three other witnesses were examined by the plaintiff, Walborn, Mellon and Staufer, on this subject, but none of them testified to any declaration by Henry Haas that he had furnished the money to pay for the land.</p>

Mauger, it is necessary to examine and consider their testimony with some care. Had the present action been brought against Adam S. Haas, or some other alienee of his title than Henry Haas, it is clear under the authorities that the declarations of Henry Haas testified to by these two witnesses, could not have been given in evidence. There was no independent proof of any complicity of Adam S. Haas in the alleged fraud to cheat the creditors of Henry Haas, and therefore the declarations not having been made in the presence of Adam S. Haas could not have the <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>effect of destroying or impairing his title. In McElfatrick v. Hicks, <a href="/pa/21/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="21 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="411513" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0402-01">21 Pa. 402</a>, it was said: “ Nothing can be more plain than that the declarations of a grantor are not evidence of fraud, as against an honest purchaser for an adequate consideration, even when made before the execution of the contract, and it would be more absurd, if possible, to allow declarations made after the title had passed to affect its validity.” To the same effect are the cases of Unangst v. Goodyear, <a href="/pa/141/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="141 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="974924" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0127-01">141 Pa. 127</a>, and Tisch v.

Under these decisions it is clear that the title of Adam S. Haas could not have been affected by the declarations in question. Nothing but the fact that the declarations were said to have been made by Henry Haas himself and that he is the defendant in this case, could make the question debatable now. In the view we entertain as to the character and legitimate effect of the declarations it is not necessary to decide the question and therefore we pass it by.</p>

Joseph Faust was one of the sons of William Faust, the decedent, as whose property the land in controversy was sold, and had bought the land at the orphans’ court sale but was unable to pay for it and, after some negotiation with Henry Haas, it was agreed that the property should be put up again and knocked off to the purchaser for the same price that Joseph Faust had agreed to pay for it. All of this was done. Henry Haas attended the sale and bid the price agreed upon and he signed the conditions with the name of his son Adam S. Haas. The sale was returned to the orphans’ court as having been made to Adam S. Haas, and as such was confirmed by the court, and deed made accordingly.</p>

Q. What did he say? A. The last time he was up to the place? Q. Was that before the sale? A. Yes, sir. He said he wanted the deed made in his son Adam’s name, because he had went bail for parties and had to pay it and it broke him up, and he would not dare buy it in his own name, or else those fellows would. <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>come on Mm.

He said he had money enough to buy this place and another one like it.” On cross-examination the witness, after repeating the history of the negotiation, was asked: “ Q. Is that all that was said ? A. I do not know. Twenty-two year ago is quite awhile. There is a good many things that concerns the man that will stick to his memory, but things that do not concern him much it don’t. Q. He told there that he had gone bail and lost money? A. Yes, sir, he did, and he Avould make it in his son Adam’s name. But he said I have money enough of my own to buy this and another one like it. Q. Did he tell you he had broken up in business ? A. No, sir, he did not. He said he had went bail for fellows and they left him stick. That is the way he told me. Q. Did he not tell you he could not buy anything in his own name, that he would buy this for Adam S. Haas? A. No, he did not put it in that way. He said ‘ I must put it in Adam’s name so they can’t get it.’ Q. Did he not say ‘ I cannot buy this property in my own name?’ A. He did. I cannot put it in my own name. Q. Did not he say that Adam S. had some means, that he could pay for this property? A.

All the rest of the testimony was a mere explanation of why it was necessary to make the deed to his son, to wit, that he, Henry, had gone bail for parties who let him stick and he could not hold property in his own name because his creditors might take it from him. Of course this would be <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>so, but being so, it does not prove that the money which was paid was his money, or was not the money of Adam.

In other words, all the declarations of Henry Hass, as testified to by the witness, could be strictly true, and yet all the proof that Adam furnished the money that paid for the land could also be strictly true.

Said fraud consisted chiefly in obtaining the property at less than its value by falsely pretending that he was bidding it in for the family of the defendant in the execution, and by this and other devices deterring other persons from bidding. There must be some point of time when a purchaser of real estate at a judicial sale shall not have his title cut up by the roots by mere parol evidence of what took place at such sale, or by a secret trust disentombed after the lapse of years, and set up by the uncertain recollection of witnesses as to remote transactions. The act of 1856 was evidently intended to prevent titles being disturbed in this manner. It is a highly beneficial statute and ought to be liberally construed.” On behalf of the plaintiff the same argument was made as is made in this case, to wit, that the act of limitations of 1856 was inapplicable because the sale was absolutely void on account of the fraud. But Mr. Justice Paxson refuted that proposition, and held that if there was a trust it was because of a constructive trust arising from the fraud of the purchaser who became a trustee ex maleficio; and he further held that under the statute of 13 Elizabeth, which was invoked there as here, the title was not absolutely void but only relatively so, that a good title could be imparted to an innocent purchase for value, and that if the party suffering from the fraud did not choose to avail himself of his privilege of defeating the fraudulent title, it would remain good in the holder. The whole subject was most fully considered and we held that such a trust, arising ex maleficio, was a trust within our statute of frauds and was barred after five years.</p>
