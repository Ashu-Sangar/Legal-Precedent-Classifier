The title was vested in the present plaintiff in August, 1878. The defendant, Finley, was a judgment creditor of John F. Budd. Execution issued on the judgment; the land was sold and a sheriff’s deed, dated 11th November, 1878, conveyed the right, title and interest of John F. Budd to Nehemiah Finley, who, by deed 13th April, 1880, granted and conveyed the same premises to Henry Croushore, the other defendant herein.</p>

This paper on its <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>face does not purport to be a conveyance of the title. It is simply an agreement to convey on the performance of certain conditions. It may constitute Nehemiah Finley a trustee, as alleged by the defendants, or convert the deed, which is absolute in its terms, into a mortgage, as contended for by the plaintiff. But, in any aspect of the case, as we view it, the plaintiff’s claim is an equitable one, and his .right to recover rests upon an equitable title. Under the written agreement, he claims as a mortgagor seeking to enforce an equity of redemption. The following language of Strong, J., in Todd v. Campbell, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20Pa.%20251" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="32 Pa. 251">32 Pa. 251</a>, would seem to apply to the facts of this case, viz.: ‘ Their whole casé is an equitable one. They claim as mortgagors seeking to redeem. Their action, therefore, though in form an ejectment, is in substance a bill in equity, brought .... to compel a reconveyance of the land. The principles of adjudication, applicable to the latter form of proceeding, must equally control in this ejectment.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b564-5" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[268,1260,1176,351]]]'>“ If the sheriff’s deed is to be construed as a mortgage, it appears evident from Saunders v.

The court sits as a chancellor; the testimony is admitted under the rules of equity practice, nor is it permitted to refer such a matter to a jury, unless the evidence is such as would justify a decree.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b564-6" data-blocks='[["BL_564.5",564,[266,1619,1177,452]]]'>“We are therefore convinced that the former action was an equitable action of ejectment, and we are also of the opinion that the verdict and judgment therein are conclusive between the parties to this suit. Since Peterman v. Huling, <a href="/pa/31/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="31 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="985125" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0432-01">31 Pa. 432</a>, a judgment in ejectment upon any equitable title is conclusive between the parties, and a bar. to any subsequent ejectment for the same land.
