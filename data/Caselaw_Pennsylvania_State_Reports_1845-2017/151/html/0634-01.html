J., the evidence tended to establish that, on Feb. 6, 1890, plaintiff and defendant had a dispute about an account. Defendant walked away and plaintiff followed him with his hands in his pocket. Defendant turned suddenly and struck plaintiff, knocking him down, and followed up the attack with another blow or two. Defendant testified that he bad heard' that plaintiff was a fighting man, and thinking him under the influence of liquor had turno 1 suddenly without looking and struck him. Defendant’s description of the assault was as follows:</p>

I think we were probably about side by side; I was walking with the attempt to rid myself of him if I could decently ; he was boasting what he could do all the time; one thing that I remember was that he was just as good a man as anybody, and he said to me ‘you are trying to act the s-with me; this thing has got to be settled right here,’ and I knew the man to be a fighting man and I struck him. Q. Were you or he ahead as you came to the Monongahela House portico ? A. I think I was probably a little ahead; I wouldn’t say certainly, but I was on the inside of the pavement; I recollect that particularly. Q. When he made this remark to you what was his attitude ? A. It indicated clearly to me that he was going to attack me. [Objected to.] By the Court: No ; just what he did. A. I was walking alongside of him, and I possibly didn’t look around at him until I looked to strike him; it was what he said that indicated, more than anything else, that he was going to attack me.”</p>

In cases of wanton injury the jury is not limited to mere compensation, but they can go beyond and give what are called punitive damages, to teach the party a lesson for his improper conduct, so that he will take more care in the future, and it is for the jury to say whether or not this is a case of that sort. In determining that you take into consideration the fact that he has paid a small fine, $5, and the costs in a criminal prosecution, but that is not a bar to punitive damages, but you will take it into consideration. Then there is another thing that we have already said in answer to points, that you have a right to take into consideration. The rule is this, and it is different from a criminal prosecution. Where a party, by the use of words, has caused an attack to be made upon himself, we have said that it is not a justification, but it can be given in mitigation of damages. Suppose a man should follow up another and persist in abusing him, calling him vile names and exciting him by doing things that are improper and wrong, and calculated to make a man angry, and has an assault and battery committed upon him, when he comes into a civil court his own conduct is to be taken into account in mitigation of civil damages, not merely of punitive damages but damages in compensation.” [7]</p>

    <p id="b659-11" data-blocks='[["BL_659.13",659,[227,2076,1165,389]]]'>The first specification alleges that the court below erred in the answer to the defendant’s first point. The learned judge affirmed the point as a matter of law. He qualified this affirmance, however, by saying that “ if the facts be as Mr. Rodgers, the defendant, testifies to, there was nothing in the attitude of Mr. Rhodes to justify any belief or reasonable apprehension that ho, Rodgers, was about to be attacked when he, Rodgers, struck him.”</p>

      <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>We think this qualification of the answer to the point was entirely justified by the evidence. It is true, one or two-of the defendant’s witnesses made a stronger case for him than he did for himself. His justification for the attack upon the plaintiff, if there be any, must rest upon the state of facts as they appeared to the mind of the defendant when the blow-was struck. According to his own statement he did not look around at the plaintiff until he looked or turned to strike him. Pie does not testify to any movement or act on the part of the plaintiff, showing an intention to attack him, and the language of the plaintiff, as testified to by the defendant, would not justify the assault. Looking at the whole evidence in the case the conduct of the defendant appears to be without justification. The plaintiff testified, and in this he was not contradicted, that at the time he was struck he was walking by the side of the defendant with his hands in his pockets, and his overcoat on.</p>

Hambay, a case from the western district, decided in July last, at Philadelphia, [reported in <a href="/pa/150/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="150 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="834438" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0359-01">150 Pa. 359</a>,] we said that we did not care to enter upon the vexed question of punitive damages. They were allowed in that case, as they have been in. numerous other cases in this state. In Nagle v. Mullison, 34 Pa., at page 53, it was said by this court: “ In every case of oppression, outrage, and vindictiveness on part of the trespasser, the damages may be estimated and given in a punitive shape, rather than merely as compensatory.” This is the law of this state as it has been administered time out of mind by this court. The fact that the plaintiff has been prosecuted and convicted and subjected to a fine of five dollars and the costs of prosecution, does not alter the rule. The learned judge below submitted this matter to the jury in mitigation of damages, which would seem to be the proper practice: Porter v.
