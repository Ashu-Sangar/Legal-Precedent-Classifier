    <p class="summary" id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[262,495,1184,1128]]]'>The Pennsylvania Warehousing &amp; Safe Deposit Co. owned certain piers and warehouses on the Delaware river in the city of Philadelphia. In February, 1890, the company was financially embarrassed, and its property was out of repair. An offer was made to the Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co., to lease the piers of the warehousing company, but the railroad company declined. Subsequently the railroad company offered as an experiment to rent one of the piers for the term of one year, at an annual rental, of $10,000. The railroad company was to have the right to demand from the warehousing company a lease of all their other piers for a term of not less than ten nor more than one hundred years, at an annual rental of $6,000 for each pier. The warehousing company were also to endeavor to acquire certain intermediate properties which were also to be leased to the railroad company. After some opposition this proposition was accepted both by the directors and stockholders of the warehousing company, and the lease of pier No. 38 was executed by the railroad company on Feb. 1, 1890, and was confirmed at a stockholder’s meeting. On Feb. 3, 1890, the lease was executed by the officers of the warehousing company. On Feb. 17, 1890, the railroad company exercised its option to take the other piers of the company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[270,1627,1176,201]]]'>About Feb. 1, 1890, the market price of the common stock of the warehousing company was $42.50 per share. In March, when the exercise of its option by the railroad company became public, the stock rose to $125 per share.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b246-6" data-blocks='[["BL_246.6",246,[271,1835,1177,445]]]'>Defendant was elected secretary of the warehousing company on Feb. 3, 1890. For a few months prior to that time he had been acting secretary, and for several years prior thereto he had been employed as clerk or bookkeeper by the company. A few months before the transaction in controversy the president had urged upon the minor officials of the company the advisability of' their holding a small stock interest in the company. Defendant had accordingly, in January, 1890, purchased fifteen shares of the common stock.</p>

Early in February plaintiff re<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>ceived a note from a broker offering to sell his stock for him. Accordingly on Feb. 8, 1890, he called at the office of the warehousing company for the purpose of making inquiry as to its financial condition. He there saw defendant, the recently elected secretary of the company, and had an interview with him, at which he asked defendant what the condition of the company was, and what its earnings had been. Defendant thereupon showed him the annual report which had been made to the stockholders at their meeting held in Feb. 3, 1890, and explained it to plaintiff. At this interview plaintiff stated that he had received an offer for the sale of the stock. On Feb. 11, 1890, defendant wrote plaintiff 'telling him that he could find a purchaser for his stock. In answer to this communication, plaintiff, on Feb. 12, 1890, called again at the office of the company and saw defendant, who offered him $50 per share for his stock. Plaintiff refused to sell at that price, but wanted $60, finally, however, offering to sell for $55. Defendant was unwilling to pay that much, and the interview terminated in plaintiff’s giving defendant an option to buy his stock at $55 per share. On the same day defendant exercised his option and agreed to take plaintiff’s stock, and, on the following day, the sale was consummated.</p>

Defendant denied in his answer that any such inquiries were made by the plaintiff, or that he replied untruthfully as charged in the bill.
