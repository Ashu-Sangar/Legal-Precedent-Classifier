But as the necessity for opening Tenth street was avoided by the existence of Germantown road in its place, the legislature, by the act of April 6, 1848, P. L. 359, vacated Tenth street, as the same is laid down in the plan of the city of Philadelphia, from its intersection with the Germantown road northward to Indiana street, running along the edge of the said Germantown road. Germantown avenue or road was formerly a part of the Germantown and Perkiomen turnpike road. At the time the defendant’s charter was obtained (1858) and the date of its supplements (1863 and 1865) Germantown road was a turnpike owned by a company having a right to demand tolls for using it. It was not freed from tolls until 1869, when it became a public street, subject to municipal control. When the defendant company obtained its last grant of a right to extend its road in 1865, we may presume that the legislation conferring the power to extend its road was draughted by its own agents, for its own benefit, and with a view to give it further privileges without any expense which might be avoided. Any attempt to occupy Germantown road in 1865 would have been met with a demand by the turnpike company for compensation; for, while the legislature might authorize a railway company to occupy a turnpike road, it would have been subject to the constitutional terms of making compensation. Hence the grant was of authority ‘ to extend the road northwardly on Tenth and Eleventh streets, between <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>Montgomery street and the Germantown road, with the right to connect the same on any street between these two points, subject to all the limitations and restrictions, and with all the privileges granted to the said company under their act of incorporation.’ The right was to be exercised between German-town road and Montgomery street.</p>

In measuring space it excludes the objects which bound it. Webster describes it in this application as ‘ the intermediate space of, without regard to distance,’ and gives, as an instance, the phrase, ‘ New York is between Boston and Philadelphia.’ So Pennsylvania is between New Jersey and Ohio, and the Delaware river is between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but neither is part of the other. In Revere v. Leonard, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Mass.%2091" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Mass. 91">1 Mass. 91</a>, there was a grant of a right to convey water through any dams, gates, etc., between a mill and a dam, and it was contended if the grant could not be otherwise satisfied, it would be reasonable and equitable to construe the word between so as to include the dam, but the court said that the words of the deed were necessarily exclusive of the termini, and that it was against all legal principles to go out of the deed to inquire into the meaning of those and like words, there being no ambiguity in them. In case of State v. Godfrey, 12 Maine, 861, an act of the legislature authorized the construction of a dam between the foot of Rose’s or Treat’s Falls and McMahon’s Falls, and it was contended that the words of the charter included McMahon’s Falls, but the court said, ‘that which lies between a given place and another is quite distinct from the place given on either side. Perhaps no word in our language has a more precise and definite meaning than between. It indicates an intermediate space, which excludes, and cannot include that to which it refers. If land is granted between one township and another, both are excluded from the grant. If land is conveyed lying between lots number one and number three, it could not be pretended that either of those lots passed by the deed.’ The word ‘ between ’ in the charter of a railroad company confines the road to the point from which it is authorized to be constructed. It cannot be carried beyond that point (Plymouth R. R. Co. v. Colwell, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20Pa.%20837" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="89 Pa. 837">89 Pa. 837</a>, 1861). It has the same effect as a combination of the <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>words ‘ from ’ and ‘ to,’ as in the case of the Commonwealth v.

Co., <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%20839" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="27 Pa. 839">27 Pa. 839</a>, in which they were held to prevent the company from constructing its. road into the place from which it was to be built. The same interpretation on similar words was given in the case of Rex v. Inhabitants of Upton-on-Severn, 6 C. &amp; P. 133. A like rule applies in proceedings to lay out roads, in which it is necessary for the viewers to follow the petition and designate the termini of the road as therein fixed. ‘ To go beyond them,’ said the court, ‘ is to exceed the authority. ... If they can go beyond one terminus, they may disregard the other: ’ Road in Lower Merion, <a href="/pa/58/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="58 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1013211" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0066-01">58 Pa. 66</a>, 1868.

Its charter authorizes it to connect on any street between two points, that is, between Montgomery street and Germantown road. Now it is undoubtedly true that the words street, road and avenue are synonymous, and are included in the more general designation of highway; wherefore the fact that Germantown avenue was never called a street, would Hot be of much importance, if it had been a public highway in 1865; but as all charters are to be construed as of the date of their enactment (Commonwealth v. Erie &amp; Northeast R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/27/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="27 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="979639" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0339-01">27 Pa. 339</a>), when we consider that Germantown road was a turnpike road in 1865, that the legislature could not authorize the defendant to enter upon and lay its tracks on that turnpike without compensation, and that the defendant was looking for a public street or streets between Montgomery street and Germantown road, on which it could connect its road without further expense than the cost of construction, it is not giving the charter too strict an interpretation to say that what the defendant wanted, and <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>what the legislature gave it, was a public street without cost or delay, and not a turnpike road for which it would have been compelled to pay damages. That Germantown avenue has since become a public street, does not bring it within the view of the legislature at the time of making the grant in 1865, when it was not a public street. Besides, a street cannot be between itself and another street or point.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b155-3" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[217,761,1167,345]]]'>“ The order of the Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, upon the board of supervisors, to approve the plan of the defendant for laying its tracks on Germantown avenue, settled no rights. It was merely an order to approve the plan of constructing the road, the board having no power to determine whether the charter of the defendant gave it the right to occupy the avenue or not.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b155-4" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[209,1121,1174,1158]]]'>“ On the other point we are of opinion that the defendant is bound by its agreement with the city, made in compliance with the ordiance of April 16, 1858, to obtain the consent of the city councils to all future extensions of its road, as required by the ordinances of February 28, 1860, and May 7, 1869. This is in accordance, also, with the spirit of the constitution of 1874, which provides that ‘ no street passenger railway shall be constructed within the limits of any city, borough or township, without the consent of its local authorities.’ The power to dispose of rights in the few remaining streets has been taken away from the legislature, and is now vested in the municipal authorities. Independent of this, a correct construction of the charter of the defendant, and its supplements, requires the defendant to have the municipal consent before occupying any more of the public streets. When a charter requires the consent of the city councils, and a supplement authorizes the extension of its road without consent, a second supplement, which is silent as to consent, is to be taken subject to the requirement of the charter that consent shall be obtained: City of Philadelphia v. Lombard &amp; South Street Pass. Ry. Co., 4 Brewster, 14, 1866. This decision was made on a state of facts almost identical with those of the present case.”</p>

The ordinances to which appellant thereby became subject and bound itself to obey, require passenger railway companies, among other things, to conform to established street grades; to sub* <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>mit all plans, courses, and styles of rails to the board of surveyors for approval; to lay flag stones at crossings or intervals of two hundred and fifty feet; to pave, repair and repave the streets occupied by them; to keep said streets clear of snow; to run their cars at a safe rate of speed; to pay license for each car run on the road, etc. In the same connection, the learned judge of the common pleas referred to ordinances of February 28, 1860, and May 7,1869, prohibiting the department of highways from granting any permit to remove pavement for the purpose of laying passenger railway tracks, and prohibiting city surveyors from locating any such track until the consent of councils to the construction of the road has been given.</p>

L. 319, the company was authorized to extend its tracks to Montgomery street and connect them by a track on said street. Afterwards by act of March 22, 1865, P. L. 568, it was further authorized, whenever and at such times as the public convenience may require, to extend its “road northwardly, on Tenth and Eleventh streets, between Montgomery street and Germantown road, with the right to connect the same or any street between these two points, subject to all the limitations and restrictions, and with all the privileges granted to the said company under its act of incorporation. In pursuance of these acts the road was extended northwardly on Tenth and Eleventh streets to Cumberland street and there connected by a track laid on said last mentioned street. It was still further extended on Eleventh street, with a single track and turn-outs, to Cambria street, four squares north of Cumberland street.</p>
    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.6",158,[258,1930,1170,502]],["BL_159.1",159,[197,398,1168,1627]]]'>■ Waiving for the present, and for argument sake merely, any question as to the consent of councils, or the necessity for such consent, that extension appears to be in accordance with the provisions of said acts; but, it is claimed by appellant that the act of 1865 authorizes the further extension of its Tenth street line, northerly, on Germantown avenue to Indiana street; also the extension of its Eleventh street line to same street, and á connection, between the thus extended lines, by a track on said Indiana street. The answer to this contention is, that no authority can be found in said act, or elsewhere, to locate any <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>part of its road on Germantown avenue. As defined by the very words of the act above quoted, the authority to extend, northerly, on Tenth and Eleventh streets, is expressly limited to the portions of said streets, respectively, lying “between Montgomery street and Germantown road; ” that is to say, between the north line of the former and the southerly line of the latter. The northerly limit of the grant is the southerly line of said road, and that necessarily precludes the right to enter upon and occupy any part of said road. The word “ between ” indicates an intermediate space, which excludes and cannot include that to which it refers; in this case the street and the road. If land be granted between one township and another, both are clearly excluded from the grant. If land, described as lying between lot number one and lot number three, is conveyed, it cannot be pretended that either lot or any part thereof passes by the deed: 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, 186. The word under consideration is sometimes used in a different sense, but it is too plain for argument that, in the act in question, it was employed in its primary and general signification above stated. If it had been the legislative intention to include the Germantown road, or any part thereof, in the grant, it would have been an easy matter to clearly express it, and doubtless it would have been so done. To hold as contended for by appellant would require us to ignore the sound and well settled principle that, in construing grants of power to such corporations, whatever is not given in clear and express terms or by necessary implication, is conclusively considered to have been withheld. There appears to be a growing disposition on the part of some classes of corporations to reverse the principle and arrogate to themselves the right to do anything that is not prohibited by their charters. No such tendency should be encouraged.</p>
