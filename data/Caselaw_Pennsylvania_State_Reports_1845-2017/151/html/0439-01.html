Tilford to any person or persons or bodies politic for burial lots.” The warranty clause in the deed contains substantially the same exception. Lisle’s deed to Salaignac, for his equitable interest under Tilford’s declaration of trust, purporting to convey his “then right, title, interest, property, claim, demand,” etc., in and to same land, contains a recital of said exception, of all lots theretofore granted by Tilford for purpose of sepulture. The same recital is also contained in the respective deeds of Wood and Zieber aforesaid. Lisle had theretofore conveyed the cemetery lots in controversy to Troubat in September, 1850; but his deed to Troubat was not recorded until November 13, 1858, more than seven years after the conveyances from Tilford and others to Salaignac were made, and more than three years after said last mentioned conveyances were recorded.</p>

They were not intended to be conveyed, <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>nor were they, in fact, conveyed to Salaignac. He acquired no title to them; and, so far as they are concerned, he had no title thereto which he could convey to his vendee.</p>
    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[297,553,1171,657]]]'>The paper, dated April 26, 1851, executed by Salaignac, shows it was well understood by him that he acquired no title to the lots now in controversy. After reciting that Lisle had executed and delivered to him “ a deed conveying his interest in the land now occupied 'as the Philadelphia Cemetery Company,” he says : “ It is hereby agreed and acknowledged that the said deed is and shall in nowise affect or impair the right of said Lisle to two hundred burial lots in the said cemetery, particularly described in a certain deed of John W. Tilford to said Lisle, dated the sixth day of May, A. D. 1850, recorded September 17, 1850, but that the right of the said Lisle to the said lots shall remain in like manner as though the said deed to the undersigned had not been executed and delivered.”</p>
    <p id="b468-6" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[298,1215,1170,860]]]'>This paper was not recorded, nor does it appear that any of the parties, claiming through or under Salaignac, knew of its existence; but that is of no consequence. It shows what Salaignac’s own title papers and the record of Tilford’s deed to Lisle show, and that he then knew he was acquiring no title to the lots in controversy, part of the lots theretofore conveyed by said Tilford for the exclusive purpose of sepulture. Tilford’s deed to Lisle, as we have seen, has been on record since September 17, 1850. Salaignac and everybody about to take title under or through him, down to and including the defendant himself, had record notice that those lots, at least, had been conveyed by Tilford as and for burial lots; and, on the face of the deeds by which Salaignac acquired title to other portions of the land, they had the same kind of notice, that those lots and all others theretofore granted by Tilford for same purpose, were by the very terms of the deeds to him excluded from their operation.</p>
    <p id="b468-7" data-blocks='[["BL_468.6",468,[298,2083,1168,347]]]'>We fail to see that there was any question of fact to be sub mitted to the jury, in relation to notice or knowledge that said lots were not embraced in the deeds to Salaignac.
