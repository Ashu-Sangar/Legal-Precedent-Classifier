They were objected to as incompetent and irrelevant, and objections were sustained.</p>
    <p id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[300,538,1178,556]]]'>We think there was no error in thus ruling. Articles of association with accompanying schedules, required by the limited partnership act, should fully conform to all its provisions. They are designed to furnish information to all who may be interested in or have dealings with such associations, and should therefore be self-explanatory and self-sustaining. If they are not sufficiently so to meet the requirements of the law they cannot be supplemented or amended by oral testimony. There is no hardship in this. Those who expect to enjoy the benefits of limited liability must accept the terms and conditions on which they are offered.</p>
    <p id="b106-6" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[302,1101,1174,287]]]'>The second specification is to the refusal of the court to permit defendants to prove, “ that Mr. Carroll has been known in this community by the name of D.

    <p id="b106-7" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[305,1406,1174,248]]]'>The rejection of this evidence was technical error, but, inasmuch as we think some of the objections taken to the articles of association, etc., are necessarily fatal to the defence we would not be justified in reversing on a point that can be of no avail to appellants.</p>

Rep. 44, we recently had occasion to inquire what is meant by the expression “ full names ” of the persons composing the association, as employed in the limited partnership act; and, in a clear and exhaustive opinion by our Brother Mitchell, in which the history of legislation on the subject is traced, we there held that the requirement, as to “ full names,” etc., is met by giving the names in the form habitually used by those persons in business, and by which they are generally known in the community. The reasons there given for so holding are both satisfactory and conclusive.</p>

They were instructed that the schedules attached to the articles of association were “ insufficient to create a limited partnership <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>under the act of assembly, and the parties thereby became general partners,” etc.</p>

He would be left altogether in the dark as to the kind and quantity of the property designated by the very general and indefinite word “material,” at 33d street, Pittsburgh, valued at $2,772.95; and also, as to the kind, as well as the quantity, of the property described as “ raw material at 3d avenue, Pittsburgh,” valued at $20,797.13. Surely this is not the kind of schedule contemplated by the act.</p>
    <p id="b107-7" data-blocks='[["BL_107.6",107,[199,1242,1170,1169]]]'>The schedule of estimated profits on unfinished contracts, subject to further expense necessary for work, material, etc., referred to in paragraph (e), supra, aggregating $8,666.69, would furnish little if any information as to the so-called property therein mentioned. In Maloney v. Bruce, <a href="/pa/94/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="94 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="486236" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0249-01">94 Pa. 249</a>, the schedule contained an item in these words: “ Contract with the Globe Gas Light Company at a valuation of $2,500.” This was held to be insufficient. The present Chief Justice, delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ This is not the kind of a schedule contemplated by the act of 1876. The description is too general to enable any one to form a correct estimate of the extent of the property, and a lumping valuation renders it equally difficult to judge of values. The property contributed was intended as the equivalent of cash capital, and the plain object of the provision in the act of 1876, requiring a schedule, was to enable creditors to ascertain precisely of what the property consisted and to judge of its value. If parties seek to have all the advantages of a partnership, and yet limit their liability as to creditors, they must comply strictly with the act.” Our later decisions are to the same effect: Eliot v. Himrod et al., <a href="/pa/108/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="108 Pa. 569" data-case-ids="539262" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0569-01">108 Pa. 569</a>; Hite Nat.

If they did not, their attempt was abortive,” etc. ,</p>
    <p id="b108-4" data-blocks='[["BL_108.4",108,[270,630,1177,554]]]'>We might refer to other scheduled items that can scarcely be considered the equivalent of cash capital, or sufficiently described to meet the requirements of the act. The inquirer for the true character and value of partnership capital, would doubtless be puzzled to comprehend what is meant by the item: “ Good will of D. W. 0. Carroll, Fort Pitt Boiler Works, $30,000.00.” But enough has been said to show that the learned judge committed no error in directing a verdict for the plaintiff. He could not have done otherwise without disregarding the provisions of the limited partnership law as construed by this court.</p>
