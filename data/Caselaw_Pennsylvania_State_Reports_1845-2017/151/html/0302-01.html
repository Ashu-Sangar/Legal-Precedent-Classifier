There is evidence which, if believed, fully sustains the claims that have been allowed by the auditing judge, and it has not been shown that he ought not to have regarded it. No objection was made to the competency of the widow to prove her marriage to the decedent; but if we should exclude all that she has said there is still enough to sustain her claim. Even if it were conceded that she separated from the decedent and formed an illicit connection with another man (though this is most vehemently denied), the fact would not be enough, in view of the evidence of condonation which forms part of the case of the exceptants, to take away her right to participate in the distribution of her husband’s estate.] [2] Mere desertion has no such effect (Holbrook’s Estate, 20 W. N. 79; Nye’s Appeal, 11 Crum. 341); nor has adultery where the husband’s conduct has led to it: Heel v. Elder, 12 Smith, 308, Heslop v. Heslop, 1 Norris, 537. And so if the husband be blameless and yet, with full knowledge, renews his marital relations ; all of which ‘ is comprehended shortly ’ in the two hexameters given by Lord Coke (Co. Litt., 32, b), referred to by Judge Sharswood, in Heel v. Elder, supra. ”</p>
