J., it appeared that plaintiff owned a life interest in real estate under the will of her deceased husband. In 1888, A. J. Neeley, a solicitor of insurance for Barbour &amp; Dunbar, defendant’s agents at Titusville, approached plaintiff on the subject of insuring her personal property and the house and barn in which she had a life interest. There was some conversation between them as to whether the insurance should be taken out in the name of the executors of the will, or in her own name, but it was finally decided that she should make the application herself. A written application was prepared in which the plaintiff’s interest was described as <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>a “ life lease.” This application was forwarded to Barbour &amp; Dunbar, and a policy was issued, by mistake, for the full value of the fee. The barn was destroyed by lightning in 1890, and the loss was paid to plaintiff through Barbour. On March 8, 1891, the house and its contents were destroyed by fire. The facts as to the notice of the fire and proofs of loss are stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b631-3" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[267,757,701,43]]]'>The court charged in part as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[212,808,1183,1637]],["BL_632.1",632,[247,392,1182,812]]]'>“ As to the first grounds of defence, that the plaintiff made a false statement as to the ownership of the property, the application for insurance has been lost, and we have, as written evidence of the contract, only the policy upon its face. It shows an insurance of the property at nearly its full value, and for which plaintiff was the owner in fee ; that she was the sole and absolute owner of the real estate, while the uncontradicted testimony shows that, under the will of her husband, the plaintiff had only an estate for life, which was worth at her age the amount which you have heard detailed in the evidence here; the whole estate, which by the terms of the policy was wholly insured as the property owned by the plaintiff. But the plaintiff seeks to modify this written agreement by oral testimony, attempting to show that it was understood, and was stated at the time of the making of the contract of insurance that in fact only her interest on the life estate was stated as the interest which was to be insured. A contemporaneous agreement to this policy of insurance, if made at the time, and lost, may be shown by parol here upon the trial. But the presumption of law is, gentlemen, that the policy in the hands of the plaintiff, and read over by her, was notice to her that she had an insurance upon the house as the sole owner in fee, and this policy being a consummation of the contract in writing, it is presumed in law to be the precise and definite contract between the parties, and the- burden of proof is upon the party who seeks to change the written contract by parol, to satisfy the jury by clear and satisfactory evidence. Upon this question you have had the testimony of Mr. Neeley, Mr. Barbour, and the other evidence which you will remember. Mr. Neeley, who is the agent of the plaintiff, says he wrote up the application of the plaintiff’s interest in the real estate as being a life estate, and the writing made at the time specified a sole ownership in the <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>plaintiff, and. the fact that the house was insured at nearly its full value as shown by the witness for the plaintiff. If this was an honest mistake in thus stating the ownership, or if the agent of the company, at Titusville, issued the policy as he did, knowing the actual state of the ownership, then, if the plaintiff was acting in good faith, the change in the policy from the alleged application would not militate against the plaintiff. Upon the other hand, if the plaintff retained this policy knowing it was for about the full amount of the value of the property, the real estate insured, and that it was insured to her as the sole owner of the property, without notice to the company of the mistake in the contract contained in the policy, and with the intent of collecting the full value of the interest in the fee as the sole owner, it would be such a fraud as would render the policy void, and the plaintiff ought not to recover for any alleged loss upon the burning of the house. . . .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.4",632,[252,1211,1182,1272]]]'>“ The plaintiff claims, and asks you to find, that she, under some instructions or intimations from the authorized agent of the company for this purpose, proceeded to make out, to the best of her ability, a statement in writing of her alleged loss, which contained an itemized statement of the personal property destroyed, as well as the house, which had been entirely destroyed. That the same was given to the agent of the defendant company at Titusville, within two or three weeks after the loss occurred, and which has been produced by the defendant and given in evidence here upon the part of the plaintiff. They are not such proofs of loss as would comply with the terms of the contract, and if there were nothing more we would instruct you that the plaintiff could not maintain this action. [But it is contended by the plaintiff, and she asks you to find that the defendants, by their act, not only waived a literal compliance with the terms of the policy, requiring proofs in accordance therewith, but, further, that they are now estopped from setting up this defence in this action for the reason, first, that under the instructions, or, at least, intimations, of the agent of the company in its behalf, she furnished to the company as full and as complete a proof of loss as she believed to be necessary, and that the defendant company retained the same without any notice to her that there were any or further proofs required.

If so, the jury would be warranted in finding that such alleged defect in the proof of loss was waived by the defendant, and if so found by the jury, it would be no defence to this action. But upon the other hand, if the jury should find, as claimed by the defendant, that the plaintiff was told by the agent of the company that she must make out her proofs of loss as stated in the policy, and she did not do so, as there is no claim that she did, then she would not be entitled to recover unless the jury further find that the authorized agent of the company, after the retention of the admitted proofs of loss without notice of any alleged defect in such proofs, when payment was demanded, placed the reason for the nonpayment by the company upon entirely distinct and different grounds from the alleged defect in the proofs of loss, and the alleged false statement in the application as to her ownership of the property; if they did so, then the jury might infer a waiver of any other grounds of defence. And while the defendant company might have refused to pay without giving any reason at all, or might have relied upon any number of reasons, yet, having given notice to the assured in refusing to pay this claim, of a particular ground of defence, they cannot set up other defence upon the trial.

The failure to give such notice was evidence for the jury of a waiver. But it is said that the proofs of loss were not sent to the company as required by the policy but left at the office of the local agent, Barbour; and Trask v. Ins.

In both these cases the policy required the notice to be given “ forthwith ” and to the company, and it was held that unexcused delays of eleven and eighteen days respectively, were unreasonable and should be so pronounced as matter of law. And in Edwards v. Ins. Co. it was said that the local agent had no authority to receive the notice and was not bound to communicate it to the company. But since these decisions, the act of June 27, 1883, § 1, P. L. 165, has practically given a legislative definition of reasonable time by fixing the period of ten days for notice of the fire and twenty for the proofs of loss, and has settled the question of the agent’s authority by enacting that the notice and proofs may be delivered to the company at its general office or to the agent who countersigned the policy. There was evidence to justify submitting these matters to the jury in the way it was done, and the assignments of error relating thereto must be dismissed.</p>

Unexplained this was a solid defence on the merits, and the burden of explanation was on the plaintiff. It was testified by Neeley that he wrote the application for insurance for the plaintiff at her re<a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>quest, and that her interest in the house was correctly stated therein as “ a life lease.” This application was sent or given by Neeley to Barbour, who by his own testimony had authority to write up the policy by inserting the description of the insured interest in the land, and did so in this case. The application was not produced by defendant, nor was Neeley’s testimony as to its contents in any way contradicted. Upon the evidence therefore it was plain that the defendant had issued the policy with knowledge of the actual condition of the title, and the mistake in the description was that of its own agent which it could not set up as a defence : Burson v.

The learned judge below declined to affirm the defendant’s points and to say as matter of law that the policy was void, but submitted the case to the jury with full and explicit instructions as to the presumption in favor of the policy being the precise and definite contract, and the burden of proof resting on the plaintiff.

    <p id="b639-3" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[180,1418,1178,1019]],["BL_640.1",640,[287,382,1178,1069]]]'>The question of the measure of damages is not free from difficulty, owing to the meagreness of its presentation by both parties. Undoubtedly the general rule that the insured cannot recover more than his actual loss, or the value of his interest, would, without more, limit the recovery of a life tenant as of a lessee, to the value of his unexpired term. See Wood on Fire Ins. 481. But it is equally true that a carrier, or custodian, or agent may insure in his own name, and recover the entire loss, standing as a trustee for all the amount recovered in excess of his interest: Wood on Fire Ins. 617, 632, 1121 and cases cited. In Miltenberger v. Beacom, <a href="/pa/9/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="9 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="960688" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0198-01">9 Pa. 198</a>, it was said, “ the contract of assurance, like other contracts, may be effected by the agency of a third person, without the authority of the person to be benefited, if he subsequently recognize it. It is true that to enable the beneficiary to sue upon it directly he must be expressly named.” In the present case Neeley testified that there was some talk with plaintiff as to the name in which the insurance should be taken, she saying that some one thought it had better be in the name of the executor or administrator but she thought as she had control of it it had better <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>be. in her name. This, in connection with the fact that the full premium was paid and the policy issued for the full value of the fee, may fairly be taken to indicate the real intent of the parties to insure the whole for the benefit not only of the plaintiff as life tenant, but also of the remaindermen. The company is in no position to contest this intent, for with notice in the application that the plaintiff was only life tenant, it charged the full premium and issued the policy on the fee. It is in no danger of a second action by the remaindermen, for they are not named in the policy, and on the authority of Miltenberger v. Beacom, they cannot sue directly and a suit through plaintiff would be barred by the present judgment. On the other hand the plaintiff by suing for and recovering on this evidence the. full value of the fee, has put herself in the position of trustee for the remaindermen as to the excess of the judgment over the value of her life interest. As the evidence on this branch of the case was entirely uncontradicted the jury would not have been justified in taking any other view of it, and therefore the instructions on the measure of damages, though not so explicit as might be necessary in a contested case, cannot be held erroneous.</p>
    <p id="b640-4" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[282,1461,1179,963]],["BL_641.1",641,[191,395,1171,1269]]]'>There remain to be considered only the seventh and eighth assignments, in regard to the denial of liability for specified reasons, as a waiver of other defences. The only ground upon which such a result can rest is estoppel. No party is required to name all his reasons at once, or any reason at all, and the assignment of one reason for refusal to pay' cannot be a waiver of any other existing reason, unless the other is one which could have been remedied or obviated, and the adversary was so far misled or lulled into security by the silence as to such reason that to enforce it now would be unfair or unjust: Ins. Co. v. Brown, <a href="/pa/128/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="128 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="567099" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0386-01">128 Pa. 386</a>. The whole doctrine depends on estoppel, and the essential feature of it is loss or injury to the other party by the act of the party to be estopped. In this respect there is nothing peculiar about actions upon insurance policies. They stand on the same footing as other litigation. But it has been held that preliminary proofs of loss, though essential are in their nature formal, and “ a condition precedent not to the undertaking of the insurer, but to the right of action of the insured: ” Strong, J., in Ins. Co. v. Stauffer, <a href="/pa/33/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="33 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="988409" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0397-01">33 Pa. </a><a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a><a href="/pa/33/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="33 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="988409" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0397-01">397</a>. Substantial compliance with tbe requirements of tbe policy is therefore all that is necessary, and the jury may infer a waiver from the acts of the parties. The rule on this subject was carefully formulated in Gould v. Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/134/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="134 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="814923" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0570-01">134 Pa. 570</a>, 588, as follows: If the insured in good faith and within the stipulated time, does what he plainly intends as a compliance with the requirements of his policy, good faith equally requires that the company shall promptly notify him of their objections so as to give him the opportunity to obviate them; and mere silence may so mislead him to his disadvantage to suppose the company satisfied, as to be of itself sufficient evidence of waiver by estoppel. The circumstances under which plaintiff herself took the list and estimate to Barbour, were, as already said, sufficient under the above rule, to take the case to the jury on the question of waiver, and therefore the instruction complained of in the seventh assignment was proper. The plaintiff’s fifth point, however, that if the authorized agents of the defendants refused payment of the loss, giving a specified reason therefor to the plaintiff, they must be confined to that reason upon the trial, and the jury should disregard any other defence now made by them, was entirely too broad and its affirmance as a general proposition of law would be clear error. It ignores the elements of estoppel, and lays down a rule without reference to conditions essential to its existence and applicability.</p>

N. 9, there was a positive refusal to pay at all, on grounds that the proofs of loss would not have cured, and it was held that the latter were therefore waived; and in Pipe Lines v. Ins.

All of these cases rest upon the substantial element of estoppel, that the defendant having led the plaintiff to suppose that a compliance with the preliminary formalities would be unavailing, could not thereafter set up the want of such preliminaries. Of the soundness of that principle there can be no question.</p>
