        "text": "Justice EAKIN\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s per curiam affirmance of the Superior Court\u2019s order vacating appellee\u2019s judgment of sentence.\nThe magistrate issued a search warrant based on an affidavit of probable cause filed by veteran officer Levell Jenkins. The affidavit stated he received information from two reliable CIs that appellee was selling crack cocaine, and that one Cl, under the officer\u2019s supervision, made a purchase in appellee\u2019s apartment. Based on the subsequent search of appellee\u2019s apartment, and recovery of crack cocaine, plastic baggies, and a bag of marijuana, appellee was charged with numerous drug offenses.\nMoving to suppress, appellee requested disclosure of the identity of the Cl who participated in the drug buy; he argued a sign-in log for his apartment might establish the Cl did not purchase drugs from him, and he sought to compare the Cl\u2019s name with those in the log. Commonwealth v. Brown, 836 A.2d 989, 995-96 (Pa.Super.2003). The trial court denied this request. Appellee was convicted of all charges. The Superior Court vacated appellee\u2019s judgment of sentence and remanded. Id., at 996.\nWe have recognized two scenarios where disclosure of a Cl\u2019s identity becomes an issue when a Cl provides probable cause for a warrant, and when a Cl is a witness and misidentification is alleged. The test for the latter is set forth in Commonwealth v. Payne, 540 Pa. 54, 656 A.2d 77, 79 (1994), but the former is at issue here; hence, the precedential case is Commonwealth v. Bonasorte, 337 Pa.Super. 332, 486 A.2d 1361 (1984).\nBonasorte held the defendant must show the disclosure is material to his defense, reasonable, and in the interest of justice, then demonstrate 1) a good faith basis for believing the officer willfully misrepresented the existence of the Cl or the information conveyed by the Cl; 2) without the information from the Cl, no probable cause existed; and 3) production of the Cl is the only means of substantiating his claim. Id., at 1373-74. Only after the defendant has met this burden will the court weigh his proof against the government\u2019s need to withhold the CPs identity. Id., at 1374. A defendant must first make a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing\u201d of potential falsity. Commonwealth v. Miller, 513 Pa. 118, 518 A.2d 1187, 1194 (1986). Where disclosure would jeopardize the safety of the Cl, it will not be permitted. Id., at 1195.\nThe Superior Court cited Bonasorte, then determined appellee met his burden of showing the identity of the Cl was material to his defense, and that the request was reasonable and in the interest of justice. Brown, at 996. However, it concluded the trial court erred in requiring appellee to produce evidence there was material misstatement in the affidavit. Eliminating this threshold element, the Superior Court reasoned that, unless there was forced disclosure even without a preliminary showing of material misrepresentation, officers might be inclined to include false averments in an affidavit to ensure a search warrant is obtained. Id., n. 4. I find this reasoning unsupportable.\nThe Commonwealth contends appellee\u2019s only \u201cbasis in fact\u201d was his own denial of the allegations, which is not a reason to believe the officer made material misrepresentations. Bonasorte properly rejects such a bald assertion of an officer\u2019s misrepresentation as a reason for disclosure of a Cl\u2019s identity \u201c[I]f the only \u2018evidence\u2019 produced at the suppression hearing is a defendant\u2019s bald assertion (e.g., that [Cl] does not exist or that the officer misrepresented information conveyed by [Cl]), then the defendant has failed to meet his threshold burden.\u201d Bonasorte, at 1874. In this, the Commonwealth is correct\u2014 the Superior Court ignored the first prong of the test entirely.\nThe Superior Court concluded appellee was able to meet his burden by demonstrating the Cl\u2019s identity was material to his defense, reasonable, and in the interest of justice, by averring the existence of the apartment sign-in log, which may or may not have contained the Cl\u2019s name. While this appears to establish a possible means of testing the Cl\u2019s credibility, it does not raise a reason to test it, which is the proper inquiry.\nFurther, the real suppression issue is not the Cl\u2019s veracity\u2014it is the officer\u2019s veracity. The warrant is validly issued if the officer reasonably believed what he told the magistrate\u2014if he is later proven to be mistaken, the warrant is still valid. The sufficiency of any affidavit is measured by the magistrate\u2019s ability to evaluate the officer\u2019s assertions and credibility; this determination is no more undermined by subsequent attacks on the Cl\u2019s veracity than it would be confirmed (as here) by the results of the search. Absent threshold reasons to question the officer\u2019s veracity, mere denial of the allegations by an accused is not, nor should it be, sufficient to meet the Bonasorte test. Brown, at 996.\nAs the Superior Court\u2019s decision is published, it is arguably the \u201cfinal word\u201d on the subject to this point, changing dramatically the test in Bonasorte. Such a change in the law should come from this Court, not a panel of the Superior Court ignoring its own precedent. A per curiam affirmance does not provide the Court with an opportunity to enunciate the correct standard for disclosure of the identity of persons in an affidavit of probable cause, and it allows the modification of a long-standing test without our review. In accordance with our decision to grant review in this ease, I would review the merits of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal and issue a published opinion addressing these important issues. Accordingly, I dissent.\nJustice CASTILLE joins this dissenting statement.\n. The Superior Court\u2019s general concern for the potential of material misrepresentations ignores the fact that the learned trial court here saw the officer and evaluated credibility, just as did the magistrate\u2014any reason to doubt credibility was, or should have been, given to the court there. It was not. This goes beyond even the balancing approach of Payne and other cases where the Cl is actually a witness.",
