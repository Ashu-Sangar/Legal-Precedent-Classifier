    <p id="b1003-6" data-blocks='[["BL_1003.7",1003,[154,927,1158,944]]]'>The Township’s position regarding public policy is, not surprisingly, quite the opposite. It asserts that “a fee review schedule for legal and engineering fees that is passed directly to developers is an indirect method of regulation to ensure compliance with Township ordinances in a direct and concise manner which encourages minimal review and cost to developers and municipality residents.” Brief of Appellant at 10. It further alleges that “charging review fees to developers is a mechanism to ensure sufficient compliance by developers.

    </p>
    <p id="b1004-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1004.6",1004,[243,636,1152,850]]]'>Our review of the relevant sections of the MPC results in our determination that the reference in Section 503 to “consultant” does not include the Solicitor and, accordingly, does not allow the Township to pass on its legal costs to Mountain Village. The review costs contemplated by that Section at the time of this dispute are those incurred by professionals engaged in the review of plats. As the Solicitor’s activities, while no doubt useful and beneficial to the Township, did not involve that activity, the Township is obligated to pay its own legal fees. To hold otherwise would exceed the scope of the review fees contemplated by the statute in 1998 and would result in subjecting applicants to potentially large legal fees over which they have absolutely no control. As a result, we affirm the Order of the Commonwealth Court that remanded this matter for the entry of summary judgment for Mountain Village.</p>
