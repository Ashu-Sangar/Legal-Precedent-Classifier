As a result of the collision, Rozanna sustained serious injuries to her back which rendered her paraplegic. Thereafter, she underwent back surgery at AGH, with Dr. Douglas as her surgeon. Unfortunately, the surgery was not entirely successful as Dr. Douglas, by his own later admission, incorrectly implanted a pedicle screw into Rozanna’s vertebrae, thereby aggravating her preexisting injury. Rozanna subsequently underwent a second surgery to have the screw removed and in 1996, the Reutzels brought an action against Dr. Douglas and AGH, seeking to recover for the negligently performed surgery.</p>

Quinlin, however, was about to leave on a trip to Europe and therefore informed Danielsen that he should temporarily communicate with Dr. Douglas’ insurance agent, John Cleary, about all settlement matters. On August 7, 2002, Cleary advised Danielsen that he had obtained authority to settle the suit on Dr. Douglas’ behalf for the $100,000 figure that Danielsen had suggested. When Quinlin returned from Europe, Cleary informed her that he had accepted the $100,000 proposition from Danielsen. Quinlin, believing the case to be settled, relayed this information to Cavanaugh, who <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>agreed with Quinlin that there had been a meeting of the minds on the $100,000 figure, but cautioned Quinlin that Danielsen had since contacted him in an attempt to re-open negotiations, saying that he was “losing control of [his] client” and would actually need more money to settle the case.

For their part, the Reutzels and Danielsen claimed that they understood the voicemail and subsequent conversations merely to be part of ongoing negotiations and thus, were shocked by Quinlin’s and Cavanaugh’s filing of the Petition.</p>

The trial court therefore concluded that Quinlin and Cavanaugh had successfully established that Danielsen had acted with apparent authority, which was all that was necessary to bind his clients under Superior Court precedent.

In <em>Hannington, </em>the plaintiff, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania (the “University”), sued the University for breach of an alleged tuition agreement. Following several months of settlement negotiations, the plaintiffs attorney informed counsel for the University that his client had agreed to the terms of the parties’ negotiated agreement and release, and several weeks later, he sent a finalized version of the agreement to the University’s counsel and informed the court that the parties had settled. Nevertheless, the plaintiff thereafter refused to sign the final settlement agreement, hired new counsel, and moved to resume his case against the University.

In contrast, in the instant case, while Appellees contend that Danielsen misled them as to his authority, they do not go so far as to characterize his conduct as fraud and indeed, it seems clear that Danielsen’s representations to Appellees regarding settlement simply did not rise to that level.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In any event, unlike the attorney in <em>Rothman, </em>Danielsen certainly did not defraud his own client, much less enter into a settlement by forging his client’s signature and then pocketing the proceeds for his own use.

Finally, we think it noteworthy from an equities standpoint that the plaintiff in <em>Rothman </em>sought to set aside the settlement almost five years after it was executed, which would have seriously disrupted both the defendants’ and the court’s long-held belief that the case was settled, whereas here, the settlement had not been finalized, the case remained active, and at the most, the defendants only believed the case to be settled for a matter of two months. Accordingly, although this Court determined in <em>Rothman </em>that agency and equitable principles required Mr. Rothman to bear the losses sustained by his attorney’s misconduct, we conclude that these principles do not require a similar result here.</p>

Settlement disputes can arise if a recalcitrant attorney agrees to settle an action contrary to the express instructions of his or her client. Likewise, an attorney mistakenly may believe his or her client has authorized a settlement. Finally, a client may renege on a commitment to settle after authorizing his attorney to reach an agreement. Under the doctrine of express authority, the impact of such contests regarding the validity of a settlement falls disproportionately on a third party who relies upon an opposing party’s attorney’s acts and representations. This is due to the fact that a third party engaged in the settlement of a dispute seldom knows whether the opposing party’s attorney is acting with the express authority of his or her client. Furthermore, in enforcing a settlement agreement, a third party may find proving express authority difficult, as the proof necessarily will involve dealings between the client and his or her attorney to which the third party was not privy and which <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>may be protected by the attorney-client privilege. <em>See generally, </em>Grace M.

    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[244,541,1156,850]]]'>The doctrine of apparent authority as set forth in the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers alleviates, at least to some degree, these practical difficulties that are manifest in the settlement of disputes and the shortcomings of the express authority doctrine. Under the doctrine of apparent authority a third party bases enforcement of a settlement agreement upon the statements and conduct of the opposing attorney’s client. Therefore, if the third party is reasonably misled by the client’s communications or manifestations that the client’s attorney is authorized to bind the client to a settlement agreement, then it is the client who must bear the burden for misleading. By adopting the apparent authority doctrine, a balance of interest between the parties is maintained where clients retain ultimate control over settlement issues yet, at the same time, reasonable third parties are protected.</p>

Here, there was no fraud perpetrated upon either party, and there was no loss; one party merely tried to benefit from the statements of another’s counsel made during settlement negotiations. Insofar as that decision has been interpreted to allow apparent authority to bind the client in a case without fraud, it is rightly rejected. However, as the finding that apparent authority existed here is in error, resolving this issue might better wait for another day.</p>
