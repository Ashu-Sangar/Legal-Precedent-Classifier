For the following reasons, we reverse the Superior Court’s grant of a new trial on this claim, reinstate appellee’s judgment of sentence, and dismiss this claim of counsel ineffectiveness, as well as the claims of counsel ineffectiveness raised on appellee’s cross-appeal, without prejudice to appellee’s right to pursue them under the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The argument began after Dustin’s fíancée’s son placed a pet gerbil in front of appellee’s face while he was watching television. Appellee yelled at the child and threatened to physically harm him, angering Dustin. The argument escalated into a physical confrontation and, during the fight, Dustin stabbed appellee twice in the upper back with a butter knife, slightly wounding him. In response, appellee threatened to kill Dustin and proceeded upstairs, returning with a .9 mm handgun. The argument continued <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>until appellee fired eight shots at his brother.

The brief that counsel then filed in the Superior Court likewise raised no claims of trial court error, but instead, listed six claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and a derivative seventh claim respecting the cumulative effect of the specific claims.

On the question of whether the references here involved pre-arrest or post-arrest silence, the panel thought that this case was “remarkably similar” to <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Turner, </em>the prosecutor’s cross-examination of the defendant asked whether he had “ever” told police the version of events he had just testified to—which, as here, went to self-defense. Turner’s counsel timely objected before Turner could answer the question, the objection was sustained, and a cautionary instruction was issued, but the court refused counsel’s additional request for a mistrial. This Court held that the prosecutor’s reference encompassed post-arrest silence, and therefore was impermissible, and although it was subject to harmless error analysis, it could not be deemed harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under the facts of that case.</p>

Notwithstanding that the prosecutor uttered the open-ended word “never,” the context surrounding that remark made clear that the prosecutor was focusing on appellee’s conduct on the night of the killing, and why that conduct (specifically, appellee’s threat to his brother, his flight, and his failure to stay and tell police that he was defending himself when he shot his brother) belied his trial claim of self-defense. Moreover, the prosecutor argued that the reason appellee did not tell police he was defending himself from his brother’s assault was because he fled; that flight was, by definition, pre-arrest. Given this context, and the legitimate point actually being made, it would be difficult to say that counsel was constitutionally obliged to object to this single remark in closing.</p>

Second, although the primary thrust of the cross-examination focused upon the period during which appellee was in flight, the prosecutor’s disputed questions were broader; they were not confined either explicitly, or by context, to the pre-arrest period; and in point of fact they elicited testimony from appellee which specifically concerned his interactions with police after his arrest. Accordingly, at least as to the cross-examination of appellee, there were grounds for counsel to object to this questioning.

The fact that an appellate court, reviewing a cold trial record, cannot prognosticate a reasonable basis for a particular failure to raise a plausible objection does not necessarily prove that an objectively reasonable basis was lacking. Objections sometimes highlight the issue for the jury, and curative instructions always do. Particularly in a case such as this, where the general line of questioning concerning flight and post-incident behavior was legitimate to rebut the justification defense, and only the proper temporal bound was crossed, counsel could believe that it was better not to call attention to the temporal limitation and to let his client explain himself. <em>See Commonwealth v. </em>Whitney, <a href="/pa/550/0618-02" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="550 Pa. 618" data-case-ids="281075,281089" data-case-paths="/pa/550/0618-02,/pa/550/0618-01">550 Pa. 618</a>, <a href="/a2d/708/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="708 A.2d 471" data-case-ids="11812899,281075" data-case-paths="/a2d/708/0471-01,/pa/550/0618-02">708 A.2d 471</a>, 478 (1998). It may be that counsel believed that his client acquitted himself well in his response. In this regal'd, it is worth noting that the actual evidence which resulted from this examination did not reveal that appellee stood silent in the face of a police accusation, thereby tacitly admitting guilt; instead, it revealed that police did not even attempt to question appellee, but instead put guns in his face and threatened him, according to appellee.</p>

Finally, the verdict in this case, though not the outright acquittal appellee sought, nevertheless was favorable, as the jury acquitted appellee on the more serious counts of first and third degree murder.</p>

In addition, the nature of the prosecutor’s questions—if not appellee’s answers and the ultimate argument in summation forwarded by the prosecutor—certainly suggested that appellee failed to offer his self-defense account to police after his arrest, despite an opportunity to do so. Finally, the outcome of the trial turned upon the plausibility of appellee’s claim of justification which, if accepted in its entirety, would have warranted an acquittal.</p>

Given the procedural posture of this appeal where the Superior Court has reversed the trial court and the Commonwealth is the appellant, the question of prejudice, like the question of a reasonable basis for counsel’s inaction, was not passed upon by the trial court. We believe that the question is better determined by the trial court in the first instance following an evidentiary hearing. Given the nature of the defense forwarded in this case, and the partially-favorable jury verdict, any assessment of prejudice may necessarily be . affected by counsel’s disclosures concerning his trial strategy, including his assessment of the prospects for success in the defense pursued. <em>See Hughes, </em><a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="865 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="1140661,9035570" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01,/a2d/865/0761-01">865 A.2d at 799</a> (noting that “the absence of a hearing and fact finding affects our ability to assess prejudice” and holding that, “as the matter must be remanded for a hearing concerning the existence of a reasonable basis for counsel’s actions, it is preferable that any assessment of prejudice be made, in the first instance, by a fact finder”).</p>

This Court’s decision in <em>Grant, </em>which generally requires deferral of ineffectiveness claims to PCRA review, was made retroactively applicable to cases then pending on appeal, and this appeal was still pending in the appellate courts when <em>Grant </em>was decided. Although the Superior Court did not err in reaching the merits of the collateral claim when it did, since its disposition was entered before <em>Grant </em>was decided, we have now determined that the existing record cannot support the Superior Court’s holding that trial counsel was ineffective and that a new trial is required. Nor do we believe, on the existing record, that the claim should be rejected on the merits. Accordingly, the appeal is now properly subject to disposition pursuant to <em>Grant.</em>

Indeed, the Pennsylvania Appellate Rules of Procedure specifically proscribe such review. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 302(a). The Rules and case law indicate that such a prohibition is preferred because the absence of a trial court opinion can pose a substantial impediment to meaningful and effective appellate review. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
