Appellant and Julia Martinez lived together and were the natural parents of the decedent, four year old Marcia Reyes. By a previous relationship, Julia had older sons, Javier and Louis, who were a source of dissension between Appellant and Julia. After an altercation with Javier, Appellant threatened Julia that she would find Marcia in the river with her throat slashed if Julia ever had him arrested. On May 25,1993, upon learning that Louis had visited with Julia and Marcia, Appellant left his home, taking Marcia with him. That evening, Appellant presented himself at the Chester Police Station and stated to both Sergeant Lawrence Platt and Detective Walter Loveland that he killed his daughter. Later, Appellant told the Sergeant that he put Marcia in the water. Appellant also made incriminating statements regarding his involvement in Marcia’s death to Detective Robert Blythe. The next day, Marcia’s body was discovered in the Delaware River, about four miles from Appellants home. The coroner determined that Marcia drowned and classified her death as a homicide.</p>

The evidence shows: that Appellant was provided with a Spanish interpreter who was continuously seated next to him throughout the trial proceedings; that Appellant accepted the interpreter and used him as he saw fit; that the trial court repeatedly inquired into Appellant’s understanding of the proceedings; that Appellant communicated effectively in English with the trial court at the suppression hearing and during the colloquy regarding his waiver of a jury trial; that Appellant stated in open court that he understood what was said to him in English; that the attorneys who represented Appellant at trial testified that they had had no problem communicating with their client in English; that Appellant did not testify at the PCRA hearings as to any difficulty in understanding the proceedings; and that the expert opinions that Appellant introduced at the PCRA hearings to the effect that he did not have a working command of the English language stood in direct contrast to his own words at various trial proceedings.

Thus, in addition to the suggestion that courts may engage in an <em>ad hoc </em>negation of the PCRA’s previous litigation provision to serve the judicial preferences of the day, the Court also has recently rewritten the PCRA waiver provision to serve similar <em>ad hoc </em>ends. <em>See Commonwealth v.

If the General Assembly’s PCRA standards truly are merely advisory in the context of waiver, previous litigation, and Saranchak’s circumstance, why is there no room for similarly creative judicial exceptions for non-capital defendants—many of whom are serving life sentences? The Court having jettisoned the notions of separation of powers and judicial restraint, perhaps such exceptions are next on the agenda. As is, this Court’s unmoored and improvised PCRA jurisprudence provides only spotty guidance to counsel and to the judges below who must apply these devised precepts of post-conviction review.</p>
