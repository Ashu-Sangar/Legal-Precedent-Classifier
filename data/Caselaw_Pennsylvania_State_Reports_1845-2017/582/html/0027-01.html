In November of 1983, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County sentenced Appellant to a term of imprisonment of seven and one-half to fifteen years. On February 23, 1994, Appellant was paroled to the Bethesda Manor Halfway Back facility (Bethesda Manor) in Philadelphia. Approximately five months later, on July 20, 1994, Appellant fled from the facility.</p>

The following day, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (“Board”) lodged a detainer against Appellant for technical parole violations. On April 4, 1999 Appellant was tried and acquitted of the new criminal charges. At a parole hearing before the Board on July 14, 1999, Petitioner pled guilty to technical parole violations, specifically, leaving Bethesda Manor without authorization, failing to report upon discharge, and violating curfew. On September 2, 1999, the Board recommitted Appellant to serve eighteen months of back-time for the multiple technical parole violations relating to his flight from Bethesda Manor in 1994, and stated that Appellant would be listed for parole on the next available docket.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant’s parole violation maximum term will expire on April 19, 2005.</p>

Following another interview and a re-review of Appellant’s file, the Board ultimately-denied parole on May 3, 2000, because the Board did not yet have the updated INS status report and because of the Board’s finding that its mandate to protect the safety of the public and to assist in the fair administration of justice could not be achieved through Appellant’s release.</p>

In his <em>habeas corpus </em>petition in federal court, Mickens-Thomas alleged that the Board denied his parole in violation of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause by applying retroactively the 1996 amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 383. The court determined that the issue presented was whether, in practice, the new language had altered the underlying theoretical basis for reviewing parole applications. <em>Id. </em>at 384. The court examined the Board’s pronouncements of policy and its public statements shedding light on its interpretation of its statutory mandate, and found that after the 1996 amendment, the Board gave foremost importance to the public safety factor. <em>Id. </em>Further, of the 266 historical instances of commuted sentences on which the Board had kept records, all were granted parole on their first or second application. Mickens-Thomas’ application was distinguished from the 266 other commutation cases only by the intervening 1996 amendment.

In rejecting Morales’s argument that the 1981 amendment increased the punishment attached to his crime, the Court noted that both before and after the amendment, California punished the offense for which Morales was convicted with a sentence of “15 years to life.” <em><a href="/us/514/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="514 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="1339457" data-case-paths="/us/514/0499-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/514/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="514 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="1339457" data-case-paths="/us/514/0499-01">at 507</a>, <a href="/us/514/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="514 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="1339457" data-case-paths="/us/514/0499-01">115 S.Ct. 1597</a>. Moreover, the substantive formula for securing any reduction in that sentence remained unchanged. <em>Id.; </em>Cal.Penal Code Ann. § 190 (West. 1982). The Court noted that the amendment had no effect on the standards for fixing a prisoner’s initial date of eligibility for parole, but exacted only one change: “It introduced the possibility that after the initial parole hearing, the Board would not have to hold another hearing the very next year, or the year after that, if it found no reasonable probability that [an inmate] would be deemed suitable for parole in the interim period.” <em>Morales, </em><a href="/us/514/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="514 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="1339457" data-case-paths="/us/514/0499-01">514 U.S. at 507</a>, <a href="/us/514/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="514 U.S. 499" data-case-ids="1339457" data-case-paths="/us/514/0499-01">115 S.Ct. 1597</a>.</p>

Such bald assertions, however, fall far short of Appellant’s burden under <em>Gamer, </em>which requires a showing that the 1996 amendment creates a “significant risk of prolonging” Appellant’s incarceration. <a href="/us/529/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="529 U.S. 244" data-case-ids="9508391" data-case-paths="/us/529/0244-01">529 U.S. at 251</a>, <a href="/us/529/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="529 U.S. 244" data-case-ids="9508391" data-case-paths="/us/529/0244-01">120 S.Ct. 1362</a>. Appellant’s pleading is woefully insufficient to place the opposing party on notice of any evidence in this regard. Furthermore, as noted previously, the Board did not rely exclusively on the criteria of the 1996 amendment in denying Appellant’s parole. To the contrary, the Board cited additional reasons for denying Appellant parole in that the Board was waiting for Appellant to complete a substance abuse program and an updated status report from the INS. Consequently, he has failed to establish how his measure of punishment was increased based on the 1996 amendment.</p>

This, in my mind, amply distinguishes these cases from the situation in <em>Winklespecht v.

Indeed, it seems at least to me that the petitioners in these cases may be entitled to rely on the <em>Mickens-Thomas </em>court’s findings pursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion, since the question of whether previously convicted, violent offenders as a class have been disadvantaged by the amendments appears to be a common one; the finding is sought to be invoked against a party to the <em>Mickens-Thomas </em>case (the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole); there would appear to have been a final judgment on the merits in federal court; and there is at least no present indication that the Board lacked a fair opportunity to litigate the question there. <em>See generally Murphy v. Duquesne University, </em><a href="/pa/565/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="565 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="124733" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0571-01">565 Pa. 571</a>, 599, <a href="/a2d/777/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="777 A.2d 418" data-case-ids="11079601,124733" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0418-01,/pa/565/0571-01">777 A.2d 418</a>, 435 (2001) (cataloguing the elements of collateral estoppel).
