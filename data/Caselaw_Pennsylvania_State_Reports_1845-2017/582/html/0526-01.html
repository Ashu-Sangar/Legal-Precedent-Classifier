Appellant withdrew his revolver and demanded that the victim give him the money from the [Ljaundromat. After the victim refused to give appellant the money, appellant fired a shot which grazed the victim’s head. Appellant then fired another shot from a distance of approximately four (4) to ten (10) inches which entered the back portion of the right side of the victim’s head and traversed through the victim’s brain causing instantaneous death.

Several continuances were requested by Appellant, and finally, on July 13, 2000, an evidentiary hearing was held. On September 15, 2000, Thomas J. Wagner, Esquire, from the Chester County Conflict Counsel list was appointed to represent Appellant due to Mr. DiSantis’ withdrawal from the list. On October 19, 2000, the PCRA court denied relief. Significantly, the PCRA court determined that numerous claims raised in the PCRA petition were previously litigated or waived because they were not supported by any testimony or evidence at the PCRA hearing. The PCRA court did, however, address four claims of trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness during the penalty phase and two constitutional claims asserted in the petition.

Similarly, Appellant’s claim that the presentation of this statement would have affected the jury’s consideration of mitigating factors is also without merit. The jury found as a mitigating factor the following: “events leading up to the fatal shot including the possibility of a struggle.” Since, as noted above, Green’s statement indicates he was not even present when the fatal shots were fired, we cannot glean how his statement would have altered the jury’s consideration given that it already found this particular mitigating factor.

Additionally, counsel testified that Appellant remained steadfast in his refusal to testify, even after he was advised by counsel that it would be in his best interest to testify at the penalty phase. Indeed, Appellant informed counsel that he did not want his mother or any of the other witnesses who counsel had contacted to testify as to his good character. Notwithstanding Appellant’s objections, trial counsel chose to call Appellant’s mother and the mother of one of his children, both of whom essentially testified that Appellant had a “good heart” and was a caring person. Trial counsel testified that he chose not to call other witnesses that he had spoken with because of Appellant’s convictions that no witnesses be called to testify, and because he believed that Appellant’s mother would be most persuasive in the eyes of the jury. Significantly, Appellant takes no issue with the fact that during the penalty hearing, at the request of defense counsel, the trial court colloquied Appellant respecting his desire not to testify.

The Dissent's position that the assertions now being presented to this Court are sufficient to raise factual questions pertaining to prior PCRA counsel's stewardship is perplexing. Nowhere does Appellant even assert facts specific to PCRA counsel's stewardship. Indeed, aside from the boilerplate catch-all argument that all prior counsel were ineffective, which is found in the final paragraph of this particular argument, the focus of this entire argument is trial counsel’s actions. Moreover, direct appeal counsel had already vehemently challenged trial counsel's alleged failure to investigate and present potential mitigating evidence and, indeed, a significant portion of the remand hearing directed by this Court focused specifically on that aspect of trial counsel's preparation and investigation. Additionally, Appellant was asked at the remand hearing to discuss those areas he would have testified to had he testified at the penalty hearing. As for his background, Appellant spoke of his educational achievements, his employment, his caring relationship with his children, his relationship with his brother and his relationship with his neighbors. Appellant did not, however, mention any history of abuse, neglect or trauma. To attribute such significance to Appellant’s bald assertions as does the Dissent, at this stage of the proceedings and under these facts, not only ignores the pleading and proving requirements of the PCRA, but also renders meaningless the well-established standards applied to a claim of ineffectiveness.</p>

As concerns the stewardship of PCRA counsel, it is noteworthy that, in the post-conviction evidentiary hearing, counsel developed a single issue on the record, namely, the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony to rebut the Commonwealth's ricochet theory supporting the grave risk aggravator. As the majority notes, however, PCRA counsel presented no expert evidence to support that claim. Thus, he advanced a position that had no possibility of success, since he offered no attempt to establish prejudice, an essential component of an ineffectiveness claim.</p>

Finally, on the application of the previous litigation doctrine, the majority does not state a specific conclusion as to whether it believes that the mitigation-related issue is barred.

Moreover, this Court's reasoning in rejecting the mitigation-based claims on direct appeal (which were predicated on the failure to adduce education, employment and positive-character evidence) centered on a discrete evaluation of the potential impact of each form of evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Hall, </em><a href="/pa/549/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="549 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="18162" data-case-paths="/pa/549/0269-01">549 Pa. 269</a>, 295-301, <a href="/a2d/701/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="701 A.2d 190" data-case-ids="11891800,18162" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0190-01,/pa/549/0269-01">701 A.2d 190</a>, 203-06 (1997).
