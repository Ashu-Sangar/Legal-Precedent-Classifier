    <p id="b511-9" data-blocks='[["BL_511.10",511,[156,1126,1162,1224]]]'>This appeal involves the interplay of the Transfer of State Highways Act (“Transfer Act”), 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 9201-08, and the Sovereign Immunity Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 8521-28. This Court granted review to determine whether, as a matter of law, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation (“PennDOT”) could be held liable, under the Commonwealth real estate exception to sovereign immunity, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(4), for the alleged improper and dangerous design of a highway intersection located in New London Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania (“the Township”), which was the location of a fatal motor vehicle accident. PennDOT and the Township were parties to a previous agreement transferring jurisdiction of the highways from PennDOT to the Township, pursuant to the Transfer Act. The trial court determined that, notwithstanding the transfer, PennDOT could be found liable and thus denied its motion for summary judgment. The Commonwealth Court reversed and remanded, instructing the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of PennDOT. In this appeal, we hold that PennDOT cannot be held liable because it no longer had jurisdiction over the highways at the time of the accident, and was therefore protected by sovereign immunity. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

The parties agreed upon certain repairs to be performed on these roads and the Township consented to being responsible for performing these repairs. On August 1, 1997, PennDOT and the Township executed an agreement (“Transfer Agreement” or “Agreement”) pursuant to the Transfer Act, in which they agreed to a transfer of jurisdiction over six state routes, including Kelton-Pennocks Bridge Road and State Road.</p>

The Agreement specified that the payment was for the sole purpose of performing the work on the individual routes which was specified in an attached exhibit. The Agreement specifically noted that the Township undertook its responsibilities “as an independent contractor and is not to be considered an employee of the COMMONWEALTH for purposes of performance of the work described in Exhibit ‘A,’ ” and noted that the Township was “responsible for [the] maintenance and protection of traffic, at all times during the performance of its responsibilities.” The Agreement specified that the road transfer was in accordance with 75 P.S. Chapter 92 (the Transfer Act), that “the date of transfer shall be upon execution of [the] agreement and payment,” and that, upon transfer, the Township would have jurisdiction of the affected highways in perpetuity. On September 3, 1997, PennDOT <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>paid the Township $1.1 million for the agreed-upon repairs to the roadways.</p>
    <p id="b513-4" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[160,429,1156,733]]]'>Three months later, on December 2, 1997, at approximately 8:36 p.m., Crystal Vattilano (“the decedent”) was traveling southbound on Kelton-Pennocks Bridge Road, approaching the intersection at State Road. As she attempted to cross the intersection, her car was broadsided by an ambulance traveling westbound, operated by the West Grove Fire Company. Vattilano suffered multiple injuries resulting in her death. Joyce Mullin, the decedent’s mother and the administratrix of her estate, initiated a wrongful death and survival action on November 4, 1999, naming as defendants PennDOT, the Township, the West Grove Fire Company, and the ambulance driver, Ronald Weir. Mullin’s complaint alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>failure to properly design, construct and maintain the intersection of the roadways.</p>

In response, Mullin and the Township argued that the purported road transfer was not determinative of liability for accidents resulting from dangerous conditions in existence prior to the transfer.</p>

The trial court recognized that PennDOT generally enjoys sovereign immunity under Article 1, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, but found that the statutory immunity exception for Commonwealth real estate applied, which includes dangerous conditions on highways under the jurisdiction of a Commonwealth agency.

The <em>Litchfield </em>trial court found that a highway’s condition at the time of transfer determines PennDOT’s liability, rejecting the notion that liability rests with the local municipality merely because it accepted the transfer of the road. Applying <em>Litchfield, </em>the trial court here found that the issue of whether the highway was in satisfactory condition at the time of transfer was a question for the jury, therefore making it inappropriate to grant PennDOT’s motion for summary judgment. The trial court certified the issue for interlocutory appellate review.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[240,852,1158,631]]]'>On June 28, 2001, the Commonwealth Court granted Penn-DOT’s request for permission to appeal from the trial court’s interlocutory order pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 1311. On appeal, PennDOT argued that the trial court erred in failing to strictly apply the statutory provisions concerning the transfer of highways from PennDOT to local control and thereby improperly denied summary judgment. PennDOT maintained that, contrary to the <em>Litchfield </em>decision, jurisdiction of the highways was transferred to the Township three months prior to the date of the accident. Thus, PennDOT argued that it could not be held liable for the decedent’s injuries, since it was protected by sovereign immunity.</p>

PennDOT, </em><a href="/a2d/795/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="795 A.2d 459" data-case-ids="9424459" data-case-paths="/a2d/795/0459-01">795 A.2d 459</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2002). The panel agreed with PennDOT that the trial court erred in relying on <em>Litchfield </em>and had incorrectly held that the condition of the roads at the time of the transfer determined liability. The panel noted that, in <em>Litchfield, </em>the local municipality and PennDOT had agreed that PennDOT would complete the repairs, whereas here, the Township agreed to make the repairs and assumed responsibility over the highways after signing the agreement and accepting PennDOT’s payment on September 3,1997, before the tragic accident at issue. Because the parties to this transfer stipulated that PennDOT would not be responsible for the repairs to the highways, and PennDOT had fulfilled its part of the agreement by making payment to the Township, the Commonwealth Court conclud<a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>ed that the condition of the highways was not relevant to the transfer. Instead, it held that liability for the design, construction, and maintenance of a highway rests solely with the governmental unit which had jurisdiction over the highway at the time of the accident. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court determined that potential governmental liability rested exclusively with the Township, because PennDOT did not have jurisdiction over the pertinent highways and was therefore protected by sovereign immunity. The panel remanded to the trial court with directions to grant PennDOT’s motion for summary judgment. Both Mullin and the Township sought further review, which this Court granted.</p>
    <p id="b515-4" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[161,972,1154,475]]]'>Appellants Mullin and the Township maintain that Penn-DOT is subject to liability under the Commonwealth real estate exception to sovereign immunity and can be held liable for the alleged design defects of the highways. PennDOT counters here as it did below that the real estate exception does not apply because it did not have jurisdiction over the intersection at the time of the accident.

If the parties determine that repairs are required, the statute contemplates that it is the responsibility of the parties to agree as to which party shall make repairs.

Since <em>Litchfield </em>was crucial to the trial court’s decision here, and since it is the only existing published authority, some discussion of that case is warranted. In <em>Litchfield, </em>a lawsuit similar to the one <em>sub judice </em>was initiated following a car accident on a road that was the subject of a transfer agreement four years earlier, in which PennDOT had agreed to make certain repairs, and indeed made those repairs, and the local municipality agreed to accept the road transfer. PennDOT filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court denied. The trial court expressed concern with the local municipality’s judgment in explicitly agreeing to accept the road, without requiring PennDOT to first perform all of the rehabilitative work suggested by the munici<a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>pality’s engineer. In the court’s view, it was “difficult ... to believe ... that the General Assembly intended to permit PennDOT to rid itself of hazardous state owned highways ... simply by transferring them to local municipalities.” The court instead found that, by using the words “satisfactory condition” in Section 9207(a), the General Assembly intended to require that a highway be placed in a “condition such that the highway be safe for the activities for which it is regularly used, intended to be used, or reasonably foreseen to be used.” <a href="/pa-d-c4th/22/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="22 Pa.

The <em>Litchfield </em>court held that, if a jury were to find that a dangerous condition existed at the time of the transfer, then PennDOT would remain liable to users of the highway, even if those users could recover against both PennDOT and the local municipality and irrespective of any transfer of jurisdiction from PennDOT to the municipality.

      <em>Litchfield </em>was a single-judge decision, rendered by the Court of Common Pleas of Clinton County, and it is not controlling law before this Court. It is also not particularly persuasive.

It is not a question to be determined in hindsight, case by case, by a jury. Nor are municipalities to be rendered immune from the consequences of their contractual agreements merely because, in hindsight, an agreement appears to have been unwise. Although the <em>Litchfield </em>court’s rather absolutist position may be consonant with the view of the legislation expressed by Senator Kusse, that view was not adopted into the language of the statute, and it is the plain language of the statute to which we must give deference. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b) (“[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”).

Indeed, if that were the case, PennDOT would not have paid the Township such a significant sum for repair work. It is clear under the Transfer Act that transfers occur only when local municipalities give their consent and that municipalities are free to bargain over the extent of repairs and the responsibility as to which party makes those repairs. 75 Pa.C.S. § 9205.

Accordingly, a local municipality cannot be said to have unknowingly accepted a road that was in such poor condition as to warrant negation of a lawful transfer agreement on a mutual mistake theory, or a theory that PennDOT cannot transfer “dangerous roads” as a matter of law. It is also worth noting that there is nothing in this record to suggest that the Township’s bargaining abilities were unfairly restricted during its negotiations with Penn-DOT. If the Township wished to protect itself from exposure to liability, it could have thoroughly investigated the condition of the highways.

Accordingly, the real estate exception does not apply here and PennDOT is entitled to sovereign immunity. Because, as a matter of law, PennDOT cannot be exposed to liability, summary judgment in Penn-DOT’s favor is proper.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The Township also urges this Court to apply products liability law, to the extent that it suggests that the manufacturer of defective products is in a superior risk-bearing position, to find PennDOT liable. The Township asserts that such an approach would encourage PennDOT to safely design roads to minimize harm. The Township posits that, because PennDOT did not disclose the alleged design defects to the Township, it breached its implied warranty of safe design. This issue was not addressed by the courts below and appears to have been raised here for the first time. Accordingly, we will not address the claim.</p>

Although appellants do not expressly claim that a new exception to sovereign immunity should be recognized, that argument underlies their positions. We reach our determination today keeping in mind that the exceptions to sovereign immunity are to be narrowly construed and that the General Assembly can correct any misinterpretation of the immunity provisions by amending the statute so as to explicitly waive immunity for design defects in roadways transferred to local municipalities under the Transfer Act. <em>Dean, </em><a href="/a2d/751/1130-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="751 A.2d 1130" data-case-ids="11513963,93635" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/1130-01,/pa/561/0503-01">751 A.2d at 1132-34</a>; <em>cf. </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(5) (setting forth conditions of explicit waiver of sovereign immunity regarding potholes as a dangerous condition of the highways).
