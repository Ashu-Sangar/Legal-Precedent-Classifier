      <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>On January 16, 2001, the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint charging Appellant, David Meadius, with, <em>inter alia, </em>forgery and insurance fraud. The charges stemmed from allegations that Appellant had obtained an insurance policy using the identity of his deceased father, and then filed a false auto-theft claim with the insurance company. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for February 8, 2001, but that hearing was continued at the Commonwealth’s request because the prosecuting attorney was scheduled to attend a continuing legal education (CLE) class that day. The hearing was rescheduled for March 8, 2001, but it had to be rescheduled a second time because a Commonwealth witness failed to appear. Over Appellant’s objection, the hearing was postponed until March 22, 2001. On that date, however, the prosecution was again unprepared to proceed due to the absence of two essential Commonwealth witnesses, including the insurance company’s special investigator, who failed to attend because his wife had recently given birth. Unwilling to grant another continuance, the district justice stated that he would dismiss the case if the prosecution did not withdraw the charges. Consequently, the Commonwealth withdrew the complaint.</p>

Accordingly, the detective contacted the witnesses, who assured him that they would attend the next hearing. Having obtained such assurances, Detective Coropal filed a new complaint on March 27, 2001, charging Appellant with the same offenses included in the January 16 complaint. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 12, 2001. On that date, everyone appeared, including all of the Commonwealth’s witnesses. Appellant waived the actual hearing and consented to be bound over to court in exchange for a substantial bail reduction. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 541. On September 20, 2001, the Commonwealth filed a second criminal information against Appellant containing the same charges as the original com<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>plaint, and Appellant was formally arraigned six days later.

The common pleas court convened a hearing at which it inquired into the procedural background of the case and the reasons for the multiple delays, taking testimony from both Detective Coropal and the prosecuting attorney. Thereafter, the court granted Appellant’s motion and issued an opinion in which it found that the Commonwealth had failed to act with due diligence in bringing Appellant to trial within 365 days of the filing of the first <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>complaint. Thus, the court determined that the Commonwealth was not entitled to the benefit of the second filing date, as the delays in question were-solely due to its unjustified failure to comply with the applicable procedural rules. <em>See </em>Trial Court op. at 6-7.</p>
    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[241,595,1157,1162]]]'>In reaching its disposition, the trial court rejected the Commonwealth’s argument that the case is controlled by this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Whiting, </em>the district magistrate granted the Commonwealth’s motion for dismissal at the preliminary hearing. The Commonwealth filed a second complaint almost a year later. This Court calculated the time period from the date of the second filing. The trial court here distinguished <em>Whiting </em>by observing that that matter involved dismissal by an impartial magistrate, not withdrawal of charges by executive action. It found applicable instead the two-pronged test of <em>Commonwealth v. Sires, </em><a href="/pa-super/284/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="284 Pa.

Presently, the trial court determined that neither prong was satisfied, as the charges were withdrawn, not dismissed, and furthermore, the record indicated prosecutorial circumvention inasmuch as the serial filing occurred due to the Commonwealth’s being unprepared to proceed on three separate occasions.</p>
    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.6",558,[239,1780,1156,576]],["BL_559.1",559,[163,304,1156,311]]]'>The Superior Court reversed in a memorandum opinion. It read <em>Whiting </em>more broadly than the trial court, noting that the initial complaint in <em>Whiting </em>was dismissed on the Commonwealth’s motion without independent review by the district magistrate, thus prompting this Court to deem it “a voluntary withdrawal of the prosecution by the Commonwealth.” <em>Whiting, </em><a href="/pa/509/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="509 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="1795253" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0020-01">509 Pa. at 22</a>, <a href="/pa/509/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="509 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="1795253" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0020-01">500 A.2d at 807</a>. Therefore, the Superior Court concluded that the trial court had erred by distinguishing <em>Whiting </em>on the basis that the present charges against Appellant were withdrawn rather than dismissed. The Superior Court also found that the prosecution had not <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>attempted to circumvent Rule 600 by withdrawing the first complaint and filing the second, because the latter complaint was filed nine months before the one-year anniversary of the former, and hence, it would be unreasonable to assume that the prosecution undertook these actions with the intention of delaying trial beyond the one-year period.</p>

In particular, the need to determine whether the run date should begin with the first or second filing has caused some courts to discern within the rule’s explicit requirement of prosecutorial due diligence an implicit proscription against acting with evasive intent, that is, with an object to circumvent the rule’s limitation period. Thus, as noted, the Superior Court has developed a two-pronged test for use in such cases, under which the run date is calculated from the second filing only if the first complaint was properly dismissed by a competent judicial or magisterial authority, and the Commonwealth’s actions precipitating dismissal were undertaken without any intent to evade the rule’s mandate. <em>See Sires, </em><a href="/pa-super/284/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="284 Pa.

The <em>Simms </em>court appeared to endorse this two-part standard for some serial-filing situations, but deemed it inapplicable where (as there) subsequent events operate to change the nature of the offense committed. In <em>Simms, </em>the court held that the run date began with the second filing which was necessitated by circumstances beyond the prosecution’s control. Nine days later, this Court filed its opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Whiting, </em><a href="/pa/509/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="509 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="1795253" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0020-01">509 Pa. 20</a>, <a href="/pa/509/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="509 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="1795253" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0020-01">500 A.2d 806</a> (1985). In that matter, the Commonwealth effectively <em>nolle grossed </em>a charge of armed robbery because it lacked sufficient evidence to proceed after the victim unexpectedly failed to identify the defendant in a line-up. Later, when the necessary evidence <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>became available, the Commonwealth re-filed identical charges. Again, this Court held that the run date began with the second filing because there was no intent on the part of the Commonwealth to evade the speedy-trial rule. This result was consistent with that reached in <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/487/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="487 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1759043" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0197-01">487 Pa. 197</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="487 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1759043" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0197-01">409 A.2d 308</a> (1979), where prosecution was initially precluded when a crucial witness unexpectedly refused to testify before the grand jury. <em>See <a href="/pa/487/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="487 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1759043" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0197-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/487/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="487 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1759043" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0197-01">at 201, 204</a>, <a href="/pa/487/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="487 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1759043" data-case-paths="/pa/487/0197-01">409 A.2d at 308, 311</a>.

This is consistent with the rule’s text which specifically adverts to factors beyond the Commonwealth’s control.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth maintains, this case is qualitatively different from a situation in which the prosecution voluntarily withdraws charges, e.g., through use of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>procedure, and then re-files, in an attempt to evade Rule 600’s requirements. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[160,439,1154,464]]]'>To make the calculation from a dismissed filing, as my colleagues do, is not proper under the clear language of the rule. It is not warranted by a need to close loopholes in the existing caselaw, nor is there evidence of abuse of the rule’s purpose in this case or in general. The result creates needless uncertainty in application. This Court’s current pronouncements of Rule 600’s requirements for refiled complaints are plain, curtail abuse, and provide relief when the rule is violated.</p>

In short, the majority is fixing something that is not broken. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>
