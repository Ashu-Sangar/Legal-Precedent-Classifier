On-Point Technology Systems, Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/821/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="821 A.2d 641" data-case-ids="9133293" data-case-paths="/a2d/821/0641-01">821 A.2d 641</a>, 649 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003). Nevertheless, I would uphold the Board of Claims’ determination that the parties entered into a valid and binding agreement to negotiate in good faith. <em>See On-Point Technology Systems, Inc. v. Commonwealth, DOR, </em>No. 2267, <em>slip op., </em>at 26 (Board of Claims Mar. 21, 2002). I believe that the Board’s finding in this regard is supported in the record, in that such duty arose out of: the Commonwealth’s letter of intent to enter into a contract negotiation in the context of a request for proposal which both specified that negotiations resulting in a contract would be undertaken with the responsible vendor best meeting the Commonwealth’s needs and detailed an orderly, evenhanded procedure under which proposals were to be considered, <em>see <a href="/a2d/821/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="821 A.2d 641" data-case-ids="9133293" data-case-paths="/a2d/821/0641-01">id.</a> </em>at FOF ¶¶ 52, 73;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Appellant’s acceptance of the offer to negotiate in good <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>faith which was both express and via substantial preparatory and anticipatory efforts and expenditures; <em>see <a href="/a2d/821/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="821 A.2d 641" data-case-ids="9133293" data-case-paths="/a2d/821/0641-01">id.</a> </em>at FOF ¶ 85, and a substantial course of conduct on the part of Commonwealth representatives leading Appellant to reasonably believe that a procurement contract was forthcoming. <em>See <a href="/a2d/821/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="821 A.2d 641" data-case-ids="9133293" data-case-paths="/a2d/821/0641-01">id.</a> </em>at FOF ¶¶ 69-70, 86-98, 104-06. I would also specifically confirm the Third Circuit’s prediction that this Court would cognize a contract-based cause of action for breach of an agreement to negotiate in good faith. <em>See Channel Home Centers, Div. of Grace Retail Corp. v. Grossman, </em><a href="/f2d/795/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="795 F.2d 291" data-case-ids="1596064" data-case-paths="/f2d/795/0291-01">795 F.2d 291</a>, 299 (3d Cir.1986); <em>see also Flight Systems, Inc. v.

Additionally, the Commonwealth Court in no way <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>discounted the Board of Claims’ extensive findings supporting its determination that the Commonwealth breached its obligation of good faith.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Rather, the court merely attributed no legal significance to the Commonwealth’s conduct as found by the Board of Claims in terms of its contract analysis, which, again, appears focused on the procurement aspect. <em>See On-Point Technology, </em><a href="/a2d/821/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="821 A.2d 641" data-case-ids="9133293" data-case-paths="/a2d/821/0641-01">821 A.2d at 650</a>.</p>

Although the request for proposal and letter of intent contained the reservation that the Commonwealth was making no contractual commitment, I do not read such reservation as obviating a duty to negotiate in good faith and on the terms specified in the request for proposal. At most, I believe that the reservations create an ambiguity in terms of <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>their effect on an implied duty to negotiate in good faith arising from the commitment to future negotiations, <em>see generally City of Tacoma, Dep’t of Public Utilities v.

      <p id="b673-6" data-blocks='[["BL_673.3",673,[199,1815,1119,549]]]'>Notably, while denying that it had any contractual obligations or duties to Appellant in general terms, the Commonwealth’s brief never specifically advances the position that the Commonwealth lacked an obligation of good faith. Rather, on the subject of good faith, the Commonwealth merely indicates that it was maintained at all times, contrary to the picture that is reflected in the determination of the Board of Claims as fact finder. Significantly, however, the Commonwealth offers no directed effort to demonstrate that the Board of Claims' findings are unsupported by substantial evidence of record. Indeed, little reference is made to the Board's findings in the Commonwealth’s brief, which primarily advances the Commonwealth's position based on the evidence which was favorable to it, notwithstanding that our review of the fact finding aspect of the decision is deferential. <em>See Shovel Transfer and Storage, Inc. v.

The Board’s essential finding was that Commonwealth officials departed from the orderly and evenhanded procedures detailed in the request for proposal, conducted undisclosed meetings with a disappointed bidder while offering repeated assurances to Appellant causing continuing preparatory expenditures, and ultimately cancelled the request for proposal based upon pressure from the other bidder as opposed to considerations fairly related to the legitimate interests of the Commonwealth in terms of securing the intended procurement on the most beneficial terms. <em>See On-Point, </em>No. 2267, <em>slip op., </em>at 21-26. I acknowledge the Commonwealth’s argument that the Board of Claims’ findings and conclusions in this regard are in tension with the reasoning of a federal district court which granted summary judgment in an action brought by Appellant against the disappointed bidder seeking damages for tortious interference with contract. <em>See International Lottery, Inc. v. Lottery Enterprises, Inc., </em>C-1-96-205 (S.D.Ohio March 13, 1998). As the Commonwealth concedes, however, it did not invoke the theoiy of collateral estoppel before the Board of Claims; therefore, there is presently no basis for concluding that the Board of Claims was in error in making its own determinations based on the evidence before it and independent of those of the federal district court.</p>
