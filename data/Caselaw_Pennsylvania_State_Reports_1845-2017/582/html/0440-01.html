Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation &amp; Parole, </em><a href="/pa/576/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="576 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="16674" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0588-01">576 Pa. 588</a>, <a href="/pa/576/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="840 A.2d 299" data-case-ids="16674,9290632" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0588-01,/a2d/840/0299-01">840 A.2d 299</a> (2003). However, this does not end the matter. The Department is an executive branch agency that is charged with faithfully implementing sentences imposed by the courts. As part of the executive branch, the Department lacks the power to adjudicate the legality of a sentence or to add or delete sentencing conditions. Reviewing the sentence imposed by the trial court reveals that the Department has computed McCray’s maximum release date in accordance with the sentencing order of the trial court. The sentence imposed by the trial court upon probation revocation, does not indicate that McCray is to receive credit for time served. (R.R. at 15 (Bill 1), 23 (Bill 9), 24 (Bill 10), and 33 (Bill 19)). Accordingly, the Department did not have a duty to credit McCray for the time previously served because the probation revocation judge did not order credit for time served and the Department is without authority to alter sentencing conditions.</p>

The VOP judge is faced with rather unique concerns—concerns not present at initial sentencing—of whether his probationary order and conditions have been violated; if so, whether that violation warrants revocation or some lesser response; if revocation is warranted, whether a sentence of total confinement is warranted; and, if total confinement is warranted, how long the term of confinement should be. The notion that a VOP judge should go to the trouble of formulating a revocation sentencing term which is commensurate with the violation, but then be required to discount the term formulated for that distinct purpose to account for already-credited time served prior to the initial sentence, is absurd as well as impractical. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1); <em>Commonwealth v.

To double-credit time previously served ignores the very nature of a VOP sentencing proceeding; it is not required under the only provision of the Code addressing VOP sentencing; and I would not read Section 9771 as if it <em>sub silentio </em>imported the inapposite requirement from Section 9760.</p>

Thus, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>where appellee had already served twenty months and six days on these offenses, the greatest minimum VOP term of <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>incarceration that could have been imposed for any of appellee’s first degree felonies would be eight years, three months and twenty-four days <em>(i.e., </em>ten years minus twenty months and six days).

The Commonwealth Court’s reading of the Code would essentially require VOP judges to go through the following cumbersome four-part process after finding that total confinement is appropriate: (1) determining what term of incarceration the VOP warrants; (2) adding the previous term(s) of incarceration already served to the term distinctly warranted by the VOP; (3) announcing a new aggregate sentence; and then (4) announcing a “credit” against that aggregate. The notion that a VOP judge is required to offset previous time served against any new VOP sentence he fashions, and thereby must fashion a VOP sentence which is inflated to account for the previous time served to be offset, is certainly novel and would mark a clear departure from existing law. A VOP sentencing judge cannot be faulted for failing to anticipate this reading of the Code, and if such were to become the law, the judge should be given the initial opportunity to fashion a VOP sentence that reflects both the punishment he thought appropriate for the VOP and the endless and duplicative time credit that would have been required by the Commonwealth Court’s convoluted reading.</p>

The VOP judge here alone knows what his intention was in sentencing appellee to two to four years’ state imprisonment without awarding duplicative “time credit” against the VOP sentence. Appellee’s failure to seek timely review via direct appeal or through the PCRA has silenced the VOP judge. The judge being presumptively rational, it is safe to assume that he determined that the VOP alone warranted an additional two to four years’ imprisonment in a state correctional facility, in addition to the county time that he was well aware that appellee had previously served. For all the Commonwealth Court knows, the trial court consciously “credited” appellee for his previous sentence by not imposing consecutive <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>sentences, or harsher ones.
