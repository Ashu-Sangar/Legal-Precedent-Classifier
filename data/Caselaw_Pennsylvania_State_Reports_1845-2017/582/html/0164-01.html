Moreover, it observed that this Court had identified only one other limited circumstance in which counsel’s inaction would result in a presumption of prejudice, namely, the failure to file a requested petition for allowance of appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v. Liebel, </em><a href="/pa/573/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="573 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="197215" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0375-01">573 Pa. 375</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="825 A.2d 630" data-case-ids="197215,9116632" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0375-01,/a2d/825/0630-01">825 A.2d 630</a> (2003).

The Commonwealth acknowledges that, in <em>Johnson, </em>the appellant was not completely denied a direct appeal because other issues were preserved in the 1925(b) statement. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth argues that this represents a distinction without a difference. Further, the Commonwealth endorses the Superior Court’s rationale centered on the fact that Appellant was permitted to avail himself of the direct appeal procedure, albeit that waiver was ultimately invoked to foreclose merits review.</p>
