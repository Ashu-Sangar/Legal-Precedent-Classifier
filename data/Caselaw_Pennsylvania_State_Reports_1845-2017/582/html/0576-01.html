Appellant opened fire in the direction of Campbell and Easter, grazing Waters’ hand. Ronald Roebuck, the owner of the bar, identified appellant as the shooter.

According to Stanko’s statement, Bush was in possession of the Harrisburg newspaper, which reported the killings of Easter and Burton; Stanko asked Bush if he had any involvement with the killings and Bush smiled. The trial court found Stanko’s statement was so unreliable that it would have been inadmissible; the court concluded the statement constituted inadmissible hearsay with no applicable exception. Appellant argues this evidence was a statement against penal interest. A statement against interest is only admissible if the declarant <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>is unavailable as a witness.

In a criminal case, a statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.</blockquote>

Stanko rated Bush’s credibility a “2” on a scale from 1 to 10 and believed the information was “puffing.” <em>See </em>N.T., 9/5/03, at 58, 86, 92-93,101,103.
