The <em>Hannaberry </em>Court concluded that this Section of the Act was intended to ensure an accurate calculation of an injured worker’s average wages, and thus, we held that the diminished wages reflected by earnings in earlier periods when the claimant was a part-time student worker could not be included to dilute the appropriate benefit amount.</p>

In each appeal, the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (“WCAB”) construed the Act to require that the periods of time when the Claimants earned no actual wages due to the initial work injury be included in the calculation of the AWW for the second injury, thus resulting in an AWW which underestimated the workers’ true earning capacity. Also in each appeal, the Commonwealth Court, which did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Hannaberry, </em>reversed—by panel decision in <em>Zerby </em>and by <em>en banc </em>decision in Colpetzer—taking an approach to the question which followed this Court’s teaching in <em>Triangle Building Center v.

Section 309, as amended by the Act of June 24, 1995, P.L. 350 (Act 57), then sets forth a scheme of computing “wages,” a term which it defines as meaning “the average weekly wages of the employe.” 77 P.S. § 582.

Claimant argued that his “average” wages were artificially depressed in the fifty-two weeks preceding the present injury due to the fact of his March 1996 disabling injury. In Claimants view, his AWW for the December 5, 1996 injury should have been calculated by averaging only the wages he received during the two complete quarters when he was not disabled and was actually earning his normal wages. Claimant invoked Section 309(d.l) of the Act, which governs AWW calculations in situations where an employee was not employed for three consecutive thirteen-week periods in the year immediately preceding injury, and which permits a computation of AWW based upon averaging any completed periods of thirteen calendar weeks of employment.</p>

Thus, Claimant accrued seniority benefits, pension benefits, health insurance benefits and vacation benefits when he was out on disability and receiving workers compensation. Because Claimant was continuously “employed” during the year preceding his second injury, Standard Steel argued, <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>Section 309(d.l) did not apply. Instead, the calculation of AWW was governed by Section 309(d), which requires averaging wrages earned during the three highest of the four immediately prior thirteen-week periods of employment—even if those periods included weeks where no wages were actually earned because the claimant was totally disabled by a previous work injury.</p>

The WCAB affirmed, employing reasoning similar to that of the WCJ.</p>

Rather, Employers insist that their approach simply recognizes that the prior AWW has no place in the statutory formula used to calculate the AWW for the current work-related injury.

      <em>Hannaberry </em>and <em>Triangle Building Center </em>clearly control the outcome <em>sub judice </em>and require affirmance. The work scenario here, like that at issue in <em>Hannaberry, </em>is not specifically addressed by Section 309: <em>i.e., </em>the Section is silent as to the proper approach where a previous work injury deflated the otherwise typical wages of an injured worker. <em>Hannaberry </em>highlights the humanitarian purpose of the Act and the clear legislative intention that injured workers entitled to benefits be paid a fair benefit based upon an accurate calculation of their actual history of earnings and earning capacity. <em>Triangle Building Center </em>recognized the same crucial points, <em>i.e., </em>that the Act is humanitarian and remedial and, with respect to calculating AWW, it was designed with an eye toward “the economic reality of a claimant’s recent pre-injury earning experience.” <a href="/a2d/746/1108-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="746 A.2d 1108" data-case-ids="11479239,11479324,95744,95787" data-case-paths="/a2d/746/1108-01,/a2d/746/1108-02,/pa/560/0540-01,/pa/560/0540-02">746 A.2d at 1112</a>. It is not an accurate measure of economic reality to treat periods where no wages were earned solely because the worker was unfortunate enough to have suffered a previous work injury, as if the worker had no earning capacity for those periods. Such an approach would severely underestimate the reality of the worker’s typical earnings, punish the worker for no reason approved in the legislation, and contradict the overriding legislative goal of accuracy in calculation.</p>

Both panels below determined that Section 309(d) controlled, but that, in making the calculation under that Section, relevant periods of compensated work disability should be computed by using the AWW that was already established for that first work injury. We agree with this approach.

By the same token, however, we recognized that the Act was not designed to punish a worker merely because a work calamity befell him. Thus, we noted that Section 309, as amended, was “an attempt to ensure that the calculation of wages would be a more accurate and realistic measure of what the employee could have expected to earn had he not been injured which, in turn, would ensure both that the employee was not overcompensated and the employer not over-burdened.” <em><a href="/pa/575/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="834 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="630352,9080745" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0066-01,/a2d/834/0524-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/575/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="834 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="630352,9080745" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0066-01,/a2d/834/0524-01">at 528</a>.
