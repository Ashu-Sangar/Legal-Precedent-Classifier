A quarrel between the two occurred over appellant’s use of his father’s car for “hacking,” that is, an unlicensed taxi service. Appellant shot his father four times with a .38 caliber pistol and left him to bleed to death in their home. A neighbor who heard the shots called the victim’s granddaughter; she in turn called her grandfather. Appellant answered the phone and told his niece that her grandfather was outdoors. Appellant placed a .38 caliber revolver next to his father’s body and took $400 from his father’s wallet, then drove off in his father’s car. He disposed of the murder weapon by throwing it out the car window in Maryland en route to Georgia.</blockquote>

Current counsel was appointed to represent Appellant, and an amended petition was filed on April 2, 1998. Thereafter, Appellant filed supplemental pleadings, which he captioned as either replies to the Commonwealth’s motions to dismiss or supplemental amended petitions. These pleadings were filed on August 26, 1998, October 9, 1998, April 1, 1998, and June 16, 1999. The Commonwealth responded to each pleading by filing motions to dismiss. On February 2, 1999, May 17,1999 and December 22,1999, the trial court conducted hearings for the sole purpose of determining whether an evidentiary hearing was warranted. After Appellant and the Commonwealth argued their legal positions, the trial court took the matter under advisement. On April 12, 2000, the trial court orally granted the Commonwealth’s motion to dismiss the PCRA petition, and on April 13, 2000, the court filed its order and opinion in support thereof.</p>

Initially, we note that this Court has jurisdiction over Appellant’s petition because we directly review the denial of post conviction relief in death penalty cases pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9546(d). In cases where the judgment of sentence was final prior to the 1995 enactment of the timeliness requirement, a first PCRA petition is considered timely if filed within one year of the effective date of the enactment or January 16, 1997. Section 8(1) Act 1995 (Spec.Sess. No. 1), Nov. 17, P.L. 1118, No. 32. Because the instant petition is Appellant’s first PCRA petition and it was filed on January 15,1997, it is considered timely filed.</p>
    <p id="b850-5" data-blocks='[["BL_850.5",850,[238,904,1157,892]]]'>Prior to addressing the merits of Appellant’s issues, we must first entertain the Commonwealth’s contention that Appellant’s claims are not cognizable under the PCRA. The Commonwealth argues that Appellant erroneously raises allegations of error as if he were presenting the claims on direct appeal and ignores his burden of proof under the PCRA. It further argues that Appellant’s boilerplate assertions of all prior counsel’s ineffectiveness, without providing the required legal analysis for demonstrating each layer of counsel’s supposed ineffectiveness, is insufficient to avoid waiver of the underlying claims. Upon careful consideration of the manner in which Appellant’s claims have been presented, and in light of the strict requirements of the PCRA and this Court’s case law interpreting such requirements, we agree with the Commonwealth that several of Appellant’s claims are not renewable. Each issue, however, must be examined independently to determine whether review of the merits is required.</p>
    <p id="b850-6" data-blocks='[["BL_850.6",850,[235,1829,1155,521]],["BL_851.1",851,[160,309,1156,375]]]'>In order to be eligible for relief, a PCRA petitioner must establish by a preponderance of the evidence' that his conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the enumerated defects found in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2), and that the allegation of error has not been previously litigated or waived. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(3). A claim is previously litigated under the PCRA if the highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(a)(2). An allegation is deemed waived “if the petitioner could have <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>raised it but failed to do so before trial, at trial, on appeal or in a prior state postconviction proceeding.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b). We further note that, pursuant to <em>Commonwealth v. Albrecht, </em><a href="/pa/554/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="554 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="765988" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0031-01">554 Pa. 31</a>, <a href="/a2d/720/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="720 A.2d 693" data-case-ids="11805857,11805966,765946,765988" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0693-01,/a2d/720/0693-02,/pa/554/0030-01,/pa/554/0031-01">720 A.2d 693</a> (1998), the relaxed waiver rule is no longer applicable to PCRA appeals and therefore any claims that have been waived by Appellant are beyond the power of this Court to review under the terms of the PCRA.</p>

For purposes of our review, we do not examine these issues in the order raised by Appellant in his brief. Rather, we begin with those issues that we find to be “previously litigated” under the PCRA because they were reviewed by this Court on direct appeal. We agree "with the PCRA court that Appellant’s challenge to the evidence supporting the aggravating circumstance of a prior conviction of voluntary manslaughter, set forth at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(12) (Argument I), was raised on direct appeal and was rejected by this Court. To be precise, Appellant challenged the aggravator on direct appeal by arguing that the prosecutor elicited testimony from a detective establishing that Appellant had been “charged” in a prior homicide. Appellant argued that evidence of a charge was not evidence of a “conviction.” Our Court rejected this claim as frivolous, finding that the detective testified that Appellant had been charged with voluntary manslaughter <em>and </em>that he pled guilty to such charge. <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa/538/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="538 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="475548" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0410-01">538 Pa. 410</a>, 426-28, <a href="/pa/538/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="648 A.2d 1177" data-case-ids="475548,7882479" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0410-01,/a2d/648/1177-01">648 A.2d at 1185</a>. Appellant also argued on direct appeal that the prosecutor erred in the manner in which she presented the evidence of the aggravating circumstance, <em>ie., </em>by eliciting from the detective a long recitation of the facts of the prior manslaughter case. Our Court likewise rejected this claim on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 428-30, <a href="/pa/538/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="648 A.2d 1177" data-case-ids="475548,7882479" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0410-01,/a2d/648/1177-01">648 A.2d at 1186</a>. Such claim, raised again in the instant appeal as one challenging the detective’s testimony as hearsay, is not reviewable. Appellant cannot obtain post conviction review of claims previously litigated on appeal by presenting new theories of relief to support the previously <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>litigated claims. <em>Commonwealth v. Stokes, </em><a href="/pa/576/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="576 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="16780" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0299-01">576 Pa. 299</a>, 304-05, <a href="/pa/576/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="839 A.2d 226" data-case-ids="16780,9056868" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0299-01,/a2d/839/0226-01">839 A.2d 226</a>, 229 (2003).</p>
    <p id="b852-4" data-blocks='[["BL_852.5",852,[246,434,1153,837]]]'>In his current appeal, Appellant additionally argues that the sole aggravating circumstance found is legally inapplicable to his case. To satisfy section 9711(d)(12), the Commonwealth must demonstrate that “[t]he defendant has been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2503 (relating to voluntary manslaughter), or a substantially equivalent crime in any other jurisdiction, committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue.” 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(d)(12). Appellant maintains that because he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter prior to 1967, when 18 Pa.C.S. § 2503 was codified, the aggravator does not apply. As this is yet another challenge to the sole aggravator, which was upheld on direct appeal, this claim arguably has been previously litigated. To the extent that this specific issue was not previously litigated on direct appeal, the issue is waived due to Appellant’s failure to raise it on direct appeal. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b).</p>
    <p id="b852-5" data-blocks='[["BL_852.6",852,[245,1300,1153,590]]]'>The next claim that was previously litigated on direct appeal alleges that Appellant is entitled to relief because he was forced to wear shackles during his trial and because there was a large police presence in the courtroom (Argument VII). On direct appeal, we held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Appellant to be shackled in the courtroom because Appellant offered no evidence that any juror saw the shackles or was influenced by the observation. <a href="/pa/538/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="648 A.2d 1177" data-case-ids="475548,7882479" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0410-01,/a2d/648/1177-01">648 A.2d at 1189</a>. The latter part of Appellant’s claim, that he is entitled to relief as a result of the large police presence in the courtroom, was not raised on direct appeal, and is therefore waived. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b).</p>
    <p id="b852-6" data-blocks='[["BL_852.7",852,[245,1913,1154,443]],["BL_853.1",853,[163,321,1154,572]]]'>We also find waived several other issues that Appellant failed to raise on direct appeal. Appellant’s claims that the trial court gave an improper self-defense charge to the jury (Argument XII) and that his conviction and death sentence were the result of racial discrimination (Argument XVI) were never raised on direct appeal to this Court and are therefore not reviewable. Also waived are the following claims relating to jury selection: that prospective jurors were improperly dismissed for cause and were not life-qualified (Argument <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>XIII), that the trial court improperly restricted Appellant’s right to <em>voir dire </em>prospective jurors (Argument XIV), and that the prosecution exercised racially discriminatory peremptory challenges (Argument XV). Additionally, we find waived the claims that the trial court erred in its reasonable doubt instructions (Argument XVII), and that the trial court failed to provide a “life without parole” instruction (Argument XVIII). These issues were available to Appellant on direct appeal when he was represented by new counsel. As he failed to raise them on appeal from the judgment of sentence, they are waived. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In the context of this case, <em>McGill, </em>explains that “in order for a petitioner to properly raise and prevail on a layered ineffectiveness claim, suffi<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>dent to warrant relief if meritorious, he must plead, present, and prove” the ineffectiveness of direct appellate counsel, which necessarily relates back to the actions of trial counsel. <em><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">at 1022</a> (emphasis in original). Therefore, to preserve a claim that direct appellate counsel was ineffective, the petitioner must: (1) plead, in his PCRA petition, that direct appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to allege that trial counsel was ineffective; and (2) present argument and develop all three prongs of the <em>Pierce </em>test regarding the ineffectiveness of direct appellate counsel. <em><a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">Id.</a></em>

At trial, Appellant testified that his father pointed a gun at him with his <em>right </em>hand. (N.T. 7/19/91, 902). Thus, whether the victim’s left hand was raised or by his side is irrelevant to the question of whether he was aiming a firearm at Appellant. The Commonwealth further notes that Dr. Contostavlos and Dr. Preston agreed that the bullets passed through the victim’s body in a downward direction, which refutes Appellant’s trial theory that he dove to the ground and fired up at his father in self-defense. Under these circumstances, we agree with the Commonwealth that trial counsel’s failure to secure Dr. Contostavlos to testify at trial did not prejudice Appellant and therefore trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective.

The instant case, however, is clearly distinguishable from <em>Malloy. </em>First, this case is not one in which the PCRA court denied Appellant the opportunity to prove his claims. To the contrary, the PCRA court conducted several hearings solely to determine whether an evidentiary hearing was required. <em>See </em>(N.T. 2/2/1999, 5/17/1999, and 12/22/1999). The PCRA court ultimately adopted the Commonwealth's argument that, because it is clear from the record that trial counsel's performance at the penalty stage was objectively reasonable, there is no reason to present testimony of trial counsel's assertion of "self-ineffectiveness.” (N.T. 12/22/1999 at 65-66). In its brief to this Court, the Commonwealth characterizes trial counsel’s willingness to allege a lack of preparation as a “blatant misrepresentation to this Court” because it is simply not consistent with what actually occurred at trial.

First, the Majority argues that, as a matter of statutory construction, the PCRA waiver provision was not intended by the General Assembly to apply to defaulted claims of mental competency to be tried. Second, the Majority argues that a trio of 1980 decisions from this Court under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (“PCHA”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> the statutory predecessor of the PCRA, empowers and requires this <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>Court to craft a judicial “relaxed waiver” exception despite the PCRA’s explicit waiver provision.

Indeed, the statute does not speak <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>in terms of ephemeral judicial issue preservation doctrines at all. Instead, the PCRA waiver provision—contained in a statute that affords criminal defendants that which is afforded to no other litigant, <em>ie., </em>a chance to undo a final judgment— rationally speaks only in terms of previous opportunities to raise a claim, <em>ie., </em>whether the petitioner could have raised the claim before, but failed to do so. There is no absurdity in reading this sensible restriction upon collateral review according to its plain language'. The appropriate and preferred time to raise claims either monumental or small, constitutional or otherwise, is when they are ripe-when the record is fresh, when a fair opportunity to respond exists, and when a fair and timely resolution is possible. A claim which could have been raised at a point where relief could have been afforded and error averted, but was not, is properly deemed defaulted and merges into the final judgment. Such a foregone claim should be reviewable on collateral attack only as the collateral attack that it is, and as authorized by the General Assembly. The quintessential collateral claim, one specifically deemed cognizable under the PCRA, is a claim of counsel ineffectiveness.

Contrary to the <em>Albrecht </em>Court’s understanding, a PCRA court’s declining to deem waived claims which were not required to be preserved at trial because of relaxed waiver principles could not run afoul of the PCRA waiver provision because that provision was “intended to apply” only to claims which were “required to be preserved.” And yet, countless capital PCRA petitioners since <em>Albrecht </em>have seen their previously “nonwaivable” claims dismissed upon PCRA waiver grounds.

Mr. Justice Nigro, on the other hand, concludes that the purported declarations of lead and associate counsel establish trial counsel’s ineffectiveness as a matter of law as to one issue, thus negating the need for an evidentiary hearing and cross-examination on that question. In my view, where a contested claim for PCRA relief is premised upon the sworn affidavits of witnesses and the truth of those accounts is a necessary element to the success of the claim, the greatest relief available is the award of an evidentiary hearing. A mere affidavit cannot possibly prove the ultimate merit of a contested matter which may turn upon a faulty memory or a credibility assessment. This is so even where the putative witnesses are members of the bar: in a system of laws and not men, no witness’s memory, analysis, and credibility is beyond prodding and challenge and even manipulation.

Arguably, when the account of a witness is the basis for the “facts stated,” the only sufficient proffer which could warrant an evidentiary hearing is an affidavit; unsworn declarations “show” nothing. Having said this, I nevertheless recognize that there is considerable discretionary authority vested in the PCRA trial judge to determine what sort of proffer may warrant an evidentiary hearing. Although the PCRA judge would certainly be warranted in requiring reliability in the form of a sworn affidavit, it may well be that, in an appropriate case,-the court could order an evidentiary hearing based upon mere unsworn declarations and, perhaps, that course might be acceptable if the declarant is a member of the bar.</p>

As a final point concerning statutory construction, it is also worth noting that the Majority's assumption that the General Assembly intended special treatment for claims involving mental competency is contradicted by the overall structure of the Act. Competency claims are not the only claims which have been afforded special treatment against judicial waiver doctrines. Claims implicating the jurisdiction of the court and claims of sentencing illegality have also been shielded from waiver. These claims, unlike competency claims, involve the very legitimacy of the court's asserted power over the individual. It is notable that the PCRA specifically deems cognizable claims involving the jurisdiction of the court and sentences exceeding the lawful maximum, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(vii) &amp; (viii), while no such special status is afforded to claims involving mental competency. Instead, for PCRA purposes, it is plain that the General Assembly intended such claims to be treated precisely the same as other claims of error.</p>

In his concurring opinion, Justice Castille makes much of the fact that the attorneys' statements at issue here, in which both trial counsel and associate counsel all but concede that trial counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase, were not sworn to and therefore cannot be labeled, nor carry the weight of, “affidavits.” While there is no indication that the statements were notarized, I cannot agree with Justice Castille that this omission relegates the statements to a status that is more akin to “irrelevant chatter.” Indeed, such an assessment lends little import to the fact that the statements were submitted by attorneys, who, unlike other lay witnesses, are bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct and who function with a unique understanding of the consequences, both criminal and disciplinary, that may result from submitting false evidence to a court. <em>See </em>Pa.R.P.C. 8.4 (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904 (person commits misdemeanor of second degree if, with intent to mislead a public servant in performing his official function, he makes any written false statement which he does not believe to be true). And while Justice Castille insinuates that the attorneys here sought to escape these consequences by deliberately choosing the form of declaration they submitted in this case, this accusation seems unfounded in light of the Rules of Professional Conduct's general prohibition against engaging in dishonest conduct—in whatever form—and the attorneys' own certification that the information contained in their self-titled “affidavits/declarations” "is true and correct to the best of their personal knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to <a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746" class="citation" data-index="237" data-cite="28 U.S.C. § 1746">28 U.S.C. § 1746</a> and 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904.” (emphasis added).</p>
