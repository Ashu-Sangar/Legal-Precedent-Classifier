At the hearing, PennDOT presented one document in support of its case, which it described as the “certification under seal.” This document included a “certification” that the records presented were true and correct copies, a copy of the notification sent to Driver by PennDOT indicating that as a result of her July 17, 2001 conviction in New York,’ her Pennsylvania license was being suspended for a period of one year, and a copy of the notice received by PennDOT from the State of New York indicating that Driver was convicted there of DWAI on July 17, 2001.</p>

Based on the foregoing, Driver claimed that she was not a licensed Pennsylvania driver at the time of her “conviction” in New York, and, therefore, not subject to a suspension by PennDOT under the Compact. Specifically, Driver argued that despite having entered a plea of guilty to DWAI on July 17, 2001 while she was licensed in Pennsylvania, her “conviction” did not occur until judgment of sentence was imposed on November 19, 2001, at which time she had already surrendered her Pennsylvania license.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[246,1017,1151,417]]]'>The trial court rejected Driver’s argument. Noting that a plea of guilty operates as a conviction while sentencing involves the imposition of punishment for the conviction, the court found that the New York Abstract of Driving Record submitted by Driver, which indicated that she was “convicted” on July 17, 2001, was clear evidence that it was on such date that Driver was convicted for purposes of the Compact, and therefore, subject to suspension by PennDOT.</p>

Commonwealth, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, </em><a href="/a2d/824/1239-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="824 A.2d 1239" data-case-ids="9124744" data-case-paths="/a2d/824/1239-01">824 A.2d 1239</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2003). It held that Petitioner was not convicted for purposes of the Compact prior to the entry of judgment of sentence. Thus, the court held that because judgment of sentence had not been entered in New York while Driver was still licensed in Pennsylvania, and because Driver was licensed in New York at the time of sentencing, PennDOT lacked the authority to impose a suspension pursuant to the Compact. The court specifically relied upon its prior decision in <em>Lueth v. Department of Transportation, </em><a href="/a2d/785/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="785 A.2d 133" data-case-ids="9456820" data-case-paths="/a2d/785/0133-01">785 A.2d 133</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2001), wherein it held that a “probation prior to judgment” disposition pursuant to Maryland law, which stays the entry of judgment of sentence following a guilty plea and eventually permits an individual to be discharged from probation, did not constitute a <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>conviction for purposes of the Compact. Because it held there that the licensee’s plea of guilty was not a conviction without the further entry of judgment of sentence, it likewise held that in this case Driver’s entry of a guilty plea was insufficient to constitute a conviction for purposes of the Compact.</p>

    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.6",573,[163,860,1154,892]]]'>PennDOT makes several arguments in support of its position that under the facts of this case the entry of judgment of sentence in New York was not required in order to conclude that Driver was convicted for purposes of the Compact. Initially, PennDOT argues that the definitional language contained in the Compact itself regarding what constitutes a conviction relies upon the substantive laws of each party state to determine when, in fact, a conviction occurs for purposes of a convicting state’s obligation to report the subject conduct to the licensing, or, home state. Thus, in this regard, PennDOT asserts that the law of New York, the convicting state, must be examined to determine whether the entry of judgment of sentence was required following Driver’s adjudication of guilt in order for a valid conviction to have occurred. Finally, in this regard, PennDOT asserts that an examination of New York law, in fact, indicates that a person is considered convicted of an offense upon the entry of a guilty plea. We agree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

      <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>We begin by examining the pertinent language of the Compact itself, specifically, Article II, which defines the term “conviction” as follows:</p>

    <p id="b574-6" data-blocks='[["BL_574.9",574,[241,983,1155,419]]]'>Obviously, this definitional section is largely unhelpful to our query. It says, in substance, that a conviction is a conviction. However, as PennDOT notes, the language does clearly leave to the laws of the various party states to the Compact the task of determining whether a conviction of any offense of that state’s laws has occurred. Here, the law relevant to a determination of when Driver was convicted of an offense in New York State is clearly the law of New York.</p>

Laughlin appealed and the trial court sustained his appeal upon notice that the record of the conviction against Laughlin had been expunged. In affirming the Order of the trial court in <em>Laughlin, </em>the Commonwealth Court relied on the language of the Maryland Code, pursuant to which the conviction was expunged. <em>See </em>footnote 9, <em><a href="/citations/?q=739%20A.2d%20168" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="739 A.2d 168">supra.</a></em>

As concluded previously, because we look to the law of the sister state where the offense occurred to determine whether a conviction for purposes of the Compact has transpired, and because New York law treats the entry of a plea of guilty as a conviction, there is no question that Driver was convicted of DWAI on July 17, 2001, the date she entered such plea. We do not read <em>Laughlin </em>and <em>Lueth </em>to require entry of judgment on a conviction in all cases. Instead, in those cases, the court recognized that where the <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>disposition of guilt may ultimately be expunged as a function of Maryland’s law, Pennsylvania may not impose a suspension sanction pursuant to the Compact. Here, Driver did not participate in a program such as Maryland’s that would ultimately extinguish her conviction for DWAI. Clearly, on July 17, 2001, Driver stood convicted of DWAI in New York State, and under the Compact, PennDOT had the authority to suspend her driver’s license.</p>
    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[161,765,1159,571]]]'>Based on the foregoing, we hold that the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that entry of judgment of sentence in a sister state is required for Pennsylvania to deem a licensee “convicted” for purposes of the Compact without first examining how that sister state defines a conviction. Further, because New York’s definition of conviction does not include judgment of sentence and in fact is tantamount to a plea of guilty, the Commonwealth Court erred in requiring that judgment of sentence be entered for a valid conviction to have occurred. Thus, the decision of the Commonwealth Court is reversed.</p>
