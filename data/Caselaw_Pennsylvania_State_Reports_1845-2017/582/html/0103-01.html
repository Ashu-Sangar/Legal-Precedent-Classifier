The Secretary explained that members of the House serve a term of two years beginning December 1 after their election. Accordingly, the term of members elected in the November 2002 General Election expired on November 30, 2004, as did the term of the Speaker elected by those former members. The terms of office of the individuals elected to the House on November 2, 2004 began on December 1, 2004. However, the House has not convened since it adjourned <em>sine die </em>on November 30, 2004. The Secretary concluded that no one, including the House leaders, has been sworn or seated as a member of the House. Until the oath of office is administered to the elected individuals on Tuesday, January 4, 2005, and until those seated members elect their officers, the Secretary opined that neither Appellant could exercise the powers and duties of a Representative or officer of the House.</p>

He also disagreed with the relevance of Section 21.13m of the Act of January 10, 1968, P.L. (1967) 925, <em>as amended, </em>46 P.S. § 42.121m, because it discusses the role of the Majority Leader if there is a vacancy in the office of the Speaker when the House is in recess.

    <p id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[161,402,1155,1547]]]'>Both Appellants signed the Writs at issue in this matter. At the time that Speaker Perzel signed the Writs, the House was in adjournment, and the individuals elected to serve during the 2005-2006 Legislative Session had not convened to elect a Speaker. Although the House Republican Caucus had unanimously elected Speaker Perzel as its candidate for Speaker, his election was not a <em>fait accompli, </em>because any member of the House who garners sufficient votes may be elected to the office. Accordingly, when Representative Lewis resigned from his position, there was a vacancy in the office of Speaker. As previously noted, Section 628 of the Election Code provides that when a special election is necessary, the presiding officer of the House “shall ... issue a writ of election ... to the Secretary of the Commonwealth,” “whether or not [the House] then be in session.” Recognizing that no Speaker had yet been elected, Appellants relied on Section 21.18 of the Act of January 10, 1968, P.L. (1967) 925, <em>as amended, </em>46 P.S. § 42.121m, which provides, “If any vacancy shall occur during the recess of the Legislature in the office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the duties of said office shall be performed by the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives.” Applicability of Section 21.13 to the instant situation depends on whether there was a vacancy in the office of Speaker, whether Majority Leader Smith was able to carry out the duties of the Majority Leader when he signed the Writs and whether the time period in question was a recess.</p>

Section 1903 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903 provides in rele<a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>vant part that “[w]ords ... shall be construed according ... to their common and approved usage.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary defines “vacancy” as “3a: a vacating of an office, post, or piece of property b: the state of such when vacated or vacant c: the time such office or property is vacant.” It also defines “vacant” as “1: not filled or occupied by an incumbent, possessor, or officer.” Based on the dictionary definition, it is apparent that a vacancy in the office of Speaker existed at the time that Appellants issued the Writs.</p>
    <p id="b490-5" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[243,819,1155,628]]]'>The Secretary does not dispute that the House Republican Caucus has reelected Majority Leader Smith to his office for the 2005-2006 Legislative Session. He also recognizes that Judge Batton administered the oath of office to the Majority Leader on December 9, 2004. While he expresses some doubts about the process, he “regards issues pertaining to the seating of an individual member of the House to be matters solely within the jurisdiction of the members of the House.” Answer to Application for Expedited Extraordinary Relief at 9.

The authority to issue a writ for a special election for a vacant seat in the General Assembly is vested exclusively in that body pursuant to Article II, Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.

Rejection of the Writ of Election by the Secretary was an act unsupported by constitutional or statutory authority, and accordingly offends the separation of powers.</p>
