They further contended that the various provisions of the PLRA were unconstitutional on their face and as applied because they infringed on this Court’s exclusive authority to prescribe rules of practice and procedure pursuant to Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution.

Accordingly, it granted summary judgment to the Prisoners on this claim, but provided that any relief shall be prospective in nature. The Commonwealth Court further dismissed as moot the count alleging that the Department failed to lawfully promulgate DC-ADM 803 as a regulation because the Department had since done so.

There is no rule of civil procedure providing for the automatic dissolution of a preliminary injunction. Our Court’s silence on this sunset procedure of automatic dissolution is significant.

The Department further contends that the General Assembly likewise retains control over the disposition of the money collected in filing fees. <em>See e.g., </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 1725(c)(2)(iv) (specified funds to be used for computerization), (x) (judicial education and training), (d) (county law library); 42 P.S. §§ 21032.2 (Additional fee authorized in second class counties), 21042.2 (additional fee for computerizing prothonotary’s office), 21071.2 (Automation fee for prothonotary’s office) (Pürdon 2003 Supp.).

The difference between the establishment and the appropriation of filing fees and the directive that a litigant is not required to pay the same lies in the fact that our Court has enacted a procedure specifically governing the latter. Stated differently, we agree that the General Assembly has statutory authority to set filing fees and direct where such funds are to be appropriated. We further agree that such matters do not necessarily fall under the category of a “court” procedure. Section 6602, however, does not address the establishment of a filing fee or its appropriation. Rather, Section 6602 creates a <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>procedure whereby an inmate is required to pay costs when the court has granted him <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. Such edict directly conflicts with Rule 240(j), which provides that a party who has been granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>status shall not be required to pay any costs imposed by statute or local rule. Pa.R.C.P. 240(j) (emphasis added).

We treat the Prisoners’ challenge to Section 6602(e) as a facial one because the Commonwealth Court did not <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss their complaint on the grounds that it was frivolous or that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Rather, as noted, the Commonwealth Court adjudicated the claim on cross-motions for summary judgment and addressed the merits of each constitutional challenge.
