At the time, appellant, his girlfriend Denise Riddle, and his two-year-old daughter Jessica, were present. Ms. Roemer noticed appellant and Ms. Riddle on a second story deck; Ms. Riddle screamed for help while appellant calmly stood by with his arms folded. Appellant asked about his dogs and later, when referring to Jessica, said, “The firemen will get her. She’s probably dead anyway.” N.T., 9/30/02, at 97. Jessica died as a result of the fire.</p>

Trial Court Opinion, 2/27/03, at 17. The mere word “again” does not tell the jury about any prior crime; it does convey the relevant degree of his earnestness which the writer sought to create in the mind of the originally intended reader. We cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>

During trial, Ms. Riddle testified appellant had forbidden her from going to the Gaslight after learning she had met a former boyfriend there, N.T., 10/2/02, at 79-80; appellant was so adamant against her going to the Gaslight that he threatened to burn it down if she ever went there again, <em><a href="/a2d/709/0871-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="709 A.2d 871" data-case-ids="11836713,507771" data-case-paths="/a2d/709/0871-01,/pa/551/0140-01">id.,</a> </em>but appellant’s attitude changed in <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>the week prior to the fire as he repeatedly urged her to go to the Gaslight on the night of the fire. <em>Id., </em>at 108. Ms. Riddle also testified her sexual relationship with appellant changed around the time of the fire; Ms. Riddle and appellant typically engaged in daily sexual intercourse, but did not have sexual intercourse on the days leading up to the fire. <em>Id., </em>at 64, 115-16.</p>

With respect to the testimony regarding his threat, appellant points out not only that the testimony was unduly prejudicial given that he was on trial for arson, but also that it was not necessary to show he changed his attitude about Ms. Riddle frequenting the Gaslight. Similarly, appellant contends Ms. Riddle’s testimony concerning the fact he had sexual intercourse on a daily basis “did nothing but disparage [ajppellant in the eyes of the jury.” Brief of Appellant, at 32.</p>

While most relevant evidence is “prejudicial,” as it goes to prove the case against him, the court concluded that no unfairly prejudicial circumstances existed. The threat testimony showed appellant’s change in behavior because it evidenced how strongly he felt about Ms. Riddle staying away from the Gaslight and consequently, how very strange it was <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>when he urged Ms. Riddle to go to the Gaslight on the night of the fire. Because no evidence existed that appellant actually acted upon the threat, it was not unduly prejudicial. The sexual relationship testimony showed appellant’s unusual actions in the days preceding the fire and any resulting prejudice was minimal, as appellant and Ms. Riddle were consenting adults who lived together in a romantic relationship. There was no tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis or to divert the jury’s attention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially. We see no abuse of discretion in this conclusion. Further, even if there were error in the admission of the threat or sexual relationship testimony, it was harmless in light of the other overwhelming evidence of guilt.</p>

Because appellant made his request to represent himself during trial, the grant of such right was within the trial court’s discretion. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The trial court conducted a colloquy and denied the request, finding that allowing appellant to represent himself when the guilt phase of trial was nearly complete would have confused the jury and caused disruption, inconvenience, and delay.

In <em>Brady, </em>the United States Supreme Court held “the suppression by the prosecutor of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” <em><a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">at 87</a>, <a href="/us/373/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="373 U.S. 83" data-case-ids="11716714" data-case-paths="/us/373/0083-01">83 S.Ct. 1194</a>. Evidence is “material” under <em>Brady, </em>such that the failure to disclose it justifies setting aside a conviction, only where there exists a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result at trial would have been different. <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em><a href="/us/514/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="514 U.S. 419" data-case-ids="1339057" data-case-paths="/us/514/0419-01">514 U.S. 419</a>, 433-34, <a href="/us/514/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="514 U.S. 419" data-case-ids="1339057" data-case-paths="/us/514/0419-01">115 S.Ct. 1555</a>, <a href="/us/514/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="514 U.S. 419" data-case-ids="1339057" data-case-paths="/us/514/0419-01">131 L.Ed.2d 490</a> (1995). Appellant avers the Commonwealth made exculpatory financial information available but did not specifically turn it over to the defense; appellant argues that simply making the information available is not sufficient under <em>Brady. </em>Contrary to appellant’s contention, “no <em>Brady </em>violation occurs where the parties had equal access to the information or if the defendant knew or could have uncovered such evidence with reasonable diligence.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Moreover, appellant’s assertion that the Commonwealth’s files were too voluminous for him to discover helpful documents is frivolous where the files contained appellant’s own financial documents and the Commonwealth provided reports summarizing the file materials to appellant. <em>See </em>N.T., 5/1/03, at 15-17, 21.
