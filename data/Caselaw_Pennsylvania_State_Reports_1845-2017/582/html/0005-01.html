Singley purchased three rolls of duct tape, ammunition for a .44 Magnum handgun, a folding lock-blade hunting knife and camouflage hunting gloves at retail stores in or around Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. He then drove to the neighborhood where his cousin, Travis Rohrer, lived with his wife, Christine Rohrer. Appellant loitered in the neighborhood, waiting for Christine’s arrival home from work. At approximately 5:45 p.m. that evening, Appellant saw Christine Rohrer’s Jeep in the driveway of the duplex where she and her husband resided. Appellant parked his vehicle a block away and proceeded on foot to the Rohrer residence carrying two rolls of duct tape, the gloves, hunting knife, and the ammunition for the handgun he knew that his cousin Travis Rohrer owned. Appellant gained entry into the Rohrer residence by feigning car trouble to Christine and asked to use the telephone to obtain assistance. Appellant indicated to Christine that the car trouble may have been the result of a malfunctioning car battery. Mrs. Rohrer then indicated that she could assist Appellant but first needed to change clothes. <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>Once Mrs. Rohrer was upstairs, Appellant went to her room and began binding Christine Rohrer’s arms and mouth with the duct tape. Appellant went downstairs to retrieve something, and on his return upstairs, Appellant broke through the door which Christine Rohrer managed to lock in his absence. Appellant wrestled with Christine Rohrer for a time and then bound her arms to the bed frame, covered her eyes and mouth with the duct tape, leaving her nostrils exposed and bound her legs with the tape. He unbound her legs and raped Christine Rohrer. Appellant left the bedroom, smoked a cigarette in another room and then re-entered the bedroom where he repeatedly stabbed Christine Rohrer in the chest, neck and torso. She died as a result of the injuries inflicted.</p>

Appellant forced Travis Rohrer into the bedroom, where Christine Rohrer’s body was covered with the bedclothes. Appellant pistol-whipped Travis Rohrer before ordering him to the ground. Appellant then stabbed Travis Rohrer several times in the back. A scuffle ensued, during which both Appellant and Travis Rohrer struggled for control of the handgun. Appellant wrested the gun free and shot Travis Rohrer once in the arm and once in the ribcage before going downstairs. Travis Rohrer survived the assault.</p>

The shot missed Hock, but the muzzle blast left her with powder burns on her hand and ■wrist. Appellant left the scene in Christine Rohrer’s Jeep and drove through the countryside for a few hours before returning to Chambers-burg. Appellant then called his girlfriend from a pay phone.

In his first issue, Appellant contends that the trial court exceeded its authority in accepting Appellant’s guilty plea to first-degree murder in the death of Christine Rohrer. Appellant argues that <em>Commonwealth v. Berkenbush, </em><a href="/pa/267/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="267 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1057761" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0455-01">267 Pa. 455</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.%20263" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="110 A. 263">110 A. 263</a> (1920) and its progeny foreclose a court’s ability to accept a guilty plea to first-degree murder. Appellant isolates the following passage from <em>Berkenbush </em>in support of this argument: “[T]he accused may not plead guilty to murder of the first degree. He may plead guilty to murder, but it is incumbent on the court to fix the degree from testimony produced.” <em>Berkenbush, </em><a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.%20263" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="110 A. 263">110 A. at 265</a>.</p>

      <em>Berkenbush’s dicta. </em>Moreover, as will be discussed <em>infra, </em>Appellant overlooks that this court has upheld sentences where the defendant has pleaded guilty to first-degree murder.
