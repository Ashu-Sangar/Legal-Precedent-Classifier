As a result, Schneider, in <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>coordination with the Banks, began shutting down or selling off most of the Schneider Companies.

Ultimately, however, the Superior Court stated that the record reflects that the Vanadium Group “operated substantially the same businesses serving the same clients and had the same employees working in the same offices as the former Schneider companies” and that “there is clearly a genuine dispute over continuity of ownership and control.” <a href="/a2d/810/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="810 A.2d 127" data-case-ids="9307566" data-case-paths="/a2d/810/0127-01">810 A.2d at 135</a>.

Moreover, as the Superior Court recognized, section 1-103 of the UCC, entitled “Supplementary general principles of law applicable,” specifically provides that “principles of law and equity ... shall supplement” the UCC’s provisions “unless displaced” by particular provisions. 13 Pa.C.S. § 1103.

Rather, Continental merely asserts that the Vanadium Group is a successor to the Schneider Companies and as such, can be held liable for the debts of the Schneider Companies. Significantly, success on this claim will neither revive Continental’s lien on the assets sold at the section 9-504 sale nor give Continental any right to recover from the Banks. We reiterate: success, if obtained, will only permit Continental to proceed against the Vanadium Group as the Schneider Companies’ successor.
