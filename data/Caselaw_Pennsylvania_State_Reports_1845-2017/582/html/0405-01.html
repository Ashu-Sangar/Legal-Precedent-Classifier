Employer filed a Petition to Suspend or Terminate Benefits on September 1, 1999, alleging that Appellant was fully recovered from her work-related injury as of August 23, 1999. Appellant then filed a Petition <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>to Review Compensation Benefits on September 21, 1999, seeking attorneys fees and amendment of the description of the work related injury contained in the NCP.

The lift caught on a chair and the patient began to slide. She stated that she caught the entire weight of the patient and held her until the two other nurses were able to properly position the chair. Appellant reported the incident to her supervisor and went directly to the emergency room complaining of back pain. The Business Health Department of Employer provided follow up treatment for the six months following the injury.

Further, Dr. Williams diagnosed Appellant with Thoracic Outlet Syndrome in November of 1997. Appellant also described her unsuccessful, one-day, attempt to return to work for the same employer in October of 1995, her unsuccessful three-month return to work, and her continuing symptoms of pain, loss of mobility, and depression, which, in her view, prevented any return to work as a critical care nurse. She disclosed a previous work-related back injury in 1993 that had completely resolved and that, aside from irritable bowel syndrome and polycystic ovarian disease, she had been physically and emotionally healthy until this work accident.

She elaborated that Appellant has chronic unremitting pain causing depression and feelings of being overwhelmed. <em>Id. </em>In the <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>opinion of Dr. Rodgers, Appellant’s medical prognosis is guarded at best and she remains totally disabled by psychiatric infirmities that are directly connected to the work-place injury in 1995. <em>Id. </em>at 16. Although Appellant sees more than one physician, Dr. Rodgers prescribes all of her pain medications and coordinates Appellant’s pharmaceutical regimen to ensure that no contraindicated drugs are prescribed.

(Deposition of Dr. Michael Franklin dated April 26, 2000, at 16.) On physical examination, Dr. Franklin noted multiple tender points in the shoulder area, the lateral epicondyles outside the hips, the medial fat pads of the knees, and the bursa below the knee. Dr. Franklin thus concluded that Appellant is totally disabled by Fibromyalgia Syndrome and that her prognosis is poor to guarded.

Dr. Lipson testified that Appellant’s complaints of pain did not correlate with the results of his objective examination or diagnostic testing, and he opined that Appellant was being prescribed excessive amounts of narcot<a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>ics.

Specifically, he credited Appellant’s testimony that she had injured her shoulder in the August 1995 work incident and that she had not fully recovered from her injury. He found the testimony of Dr. Franklin credible because Dr. Franklin had reviewed all of Appellant’s medical records, had treated Appellant over time, and had credibly determined that Appellant suffered from fibromyalgia. The WCJ concluded that the testimony of Drs. Lipson and Fenichel was less credible, and determined that Appellant was not fully recovered as of August 23, 1999, from the fibromyalgia and “pain disorder with associated psychological and physical factors” sustained as a result of the August 1995 workplace injury. The WCJ decided that, based on the medical evidence, the NCP, in describing the injury solely as a “low back” injury, contained a material factual misstatement. The WCJ granted Appellant’s Review Petition and ordered correction of the NCP to add the shoulder injury, fibromyalgia, and pain disorder with associated psychological and physical factors, denied Employer’s Petition to Suspend or Terminate benefits, and rejected Appellant’s demand for penalties.</p>

The Board noted that the WCJ specifically credited the opinions of Dr. Franklin and Dr. Rodgers, which supported the contention of Appellant that disability had not ceased. Because it was Employer’s burden to prove that all disability had ceased, the credited evidence did not enable Employer to meet its burden.

The court noted that none of the additional injures alleged by Appellant existed when the NCP was issued and there was no material mistake. It opined that, for injuries that arise subsequent to the work injury and that are not accepted by the employer in its NCP, Section 413 does not apply and a claimant must file a claim petition subject to the limitations of Section 315, 77 P.S. § 602.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The court reasoned that the only <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>exception to this scheme is when the additional compensable injuries arise as a natural consequence of the accepted injury. <em>See Campbell v.

It noted that its decision in <em>Coover </em>was interposed with concerns of prejudice where the claimant was unfairly blindsided when he expected to address one matter and the WCJ decided another. In <em>Coover, </em>the WCJ terminated a claimant’s benefits based on the evidence presented, even though the employer had not sought termination before the close of the hearing process. The court reasoned that, even though the Act permits a WCJ to fashion appropriate relief, it was highly prejudicial to a claimant for a WCJ to terminate benefits where a claimant was unaware that benefit termination was an issue. The court observed that the unfair prejudice concern present in <em>Coover </em>was lacking in the instant matter where the Petition filed by Appellant adequately set forth the relief that she was seeking.</p>

It recognized that the WCJ credited the testimony of Appellant that she continues to have low back pain and specifically rejected the testimony of Dr. Lipson that Appellant had fully recovered from her work injury. The court opined that, based particularly on these distinct factual findings, the WCJ believed that Appellant had not fully recovered and that she had sustained additional injuries.

The paths converge when liability is established, and the employee receives medical and wage loss benefits, as applicable, for the established and accepted injury. Problems arise, however, when the injured employee develops additional physical or psychological maladies, because an employer is responsible not only for the direct and immediate consequences of a work-related injury, but also for injuries that are causally related to the accepted work injury. 77 P.S. § 411.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The essence of this controversy is whether a claimant who develops a subsequent physical or psychological condition is required to file a Claim Petition seeking an adjudication that the condition is compensable or a Review Petition seeking to amend the NCP to reflect further injuries.

Because there is no right to appeal from a notice of compensation denial, and because there exists no authority that would permit any entity other than the employer itself to add to the employer’s admission in the notice of compensation payable, Claimant here should have filed a claim petition in order to receive benefits for the hip injury which he alleges also resulted from his April 8, 1989 work incident.

Stated another way, a Petition to Modify an NCP functions as a claim petition for the purpose of adding additional injuries. Because it functions “in the same manner and ■with the same effect,” the burdens of proof for the respective parties are the same as if an actual claim petition had been filed. This provision is critical because the employer has not heretofore accepted liability voluntarily for the additional injury.

Having established that the appropriate filing to seek a modification of the NCP to correct the description of the work injury is a Petition to Review, we note that Appellant made the correct filing. The Petition alleges a material mistake of fact in that “The NCP fails to reflect claimant’s work-related shoulder injuries, fibromyalgia, Thoracic Outlet Syndrome and depression.” (Original Record, <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>Petition to Review dated September 21, 1999, side 1.) The burden belonged to Appellant to satisfy her burden that there was a material mistake as to the work injury description. To that end, Appellant testified that she injured her shoulder during the same incident and sought treatment within two days of the injury. The record also reflects that Dr. Williams treated Appellant conservatively with physical therapy and site injections before performing surgery five months after the injury. The WCJ found the testimony of Appellant completely credible and sufficient evidence supports the conclusion of the WCJ that the NCP was materially incorrect when it was issued and subject to modification to add the shoulder injury.</p>

The WCJ credited this testimony, which was unequivocal. Employer argues that the NCP could not have been materially incorrect at the time it was issued for failing to include this condition because Appellant’s fibromyalgia developed some time after the initial incident. While Employer is correct, Section 413(a) permits the WCJ to modify an NCP whenever it is shown that disability increased. Appellant’s increasing-levels of pain as evidenced by the difficulty that Dr. Rodgers and Dr. Franklin have experienced in finding a treatment regimen that will restore her quality of life, make reinstatement of Appellant’s earning capacity less than likely. Further, Dr. Franklin’s credible testimony established that Appellant’s fibromyalgia flowed directly from her work-related shoulder injury.

The WCJ credited the testimony of Dr. Rodgers, which was sufficient to undergird the conclusion of the WCJ that Appellant’s depression was a direct result of the work injury.
