Fine accepted Dr. Checcio’s recommendation and signed a consent form, which set forth the complications and physical conditions that could follow the surgery. The consent form included: “Lip, tongue, chin, gums, cheeks, and teeth, Parasthesia/Anesthesia (Numbness may be permanent)”. (R.198a). Dr. Checcio and Fine discussed the procedure and what Fine could expect. While Dr. Checcio testified in her deposition that she explained to Fine that the risk in his case. for post-operative numbness was higher than usual because of the position of the inferior alveolar nerve in his mouth, Fine testified in his deposition that Dr. Checcio did not do so.</p>

At that point, Fine had pain, bleeding, infection, swelling, and numbness on both sides of his face. As of July 17, 1998, Fine knew he was “hurt”; considered the conditions he was experiencing to be “normal”; believed the facial numbness to be one of several “after-surgery effects”; and found the numbness “significant” in scope. (R. 175a, 343a, 347a). Except for the numbness, these conditions disappeared entirely. From July 20, 1998 to October 9, 1998, Fine saw Dr. Checcio in her office on ten separate occasions. During each of the visits, Fine and Checcio discussed the lack of sensation that Fine continued to experience in his face. According to Fine, Dr. Checcio repeatedly told him that it would take about six months for the numbness to subside. According to Dr. Checcio, she consistently gave Fine a balanced prognosis, informing’ him that in the worst case scenario, she would refer him to an oral maxillofacial surgeon for an evaluation. While sensation returned to most of Fine’s face, the numbness in an area approximately two fingers in width and an inch in length on the left side of his lip and chin persisted. On April 16, 1999, Fine signed an authorization that permitted his attorney to retrieve his medical records from the surgery. About a year after the surgery was performed, Fine came to believe that the persistent numbness was abnormal.</p>

In his amended complaint, Fine alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Dr. Checcio was negligent in transecting his inferior alveolar nerve during the surgery and for failing thereafter to refer him to a neurosurgeon. Fine also alleged that the damage to the nerve caused him permanent facial numbness. Dr. Checcio raised the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in her answer and new matter.</p>

In response, Fine asserted that there <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>existed material, disputed facts as to whether the limitations period was tolled under the discovery rule or the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. The trial court denied Dr. Checcio’s motion for summary judgment, without opinion. The case proceeded to trial. On April 26, 2002, a jury returned a $500,000 verdict in Fine’s favor. Dr. Checcio’s post-trial motions were denied. A judgment was entered in Fine’s favor on August 28, 2002. Dr. Checcio filed a timely appeal in the Superior Court.</p>

Based on these facts, the Superior Court concluded that the discovery rule was inapplicable because Fine knew of his injury and its cause at the time the injury was inflicted. Determining that Fine failed to establish that Dr. Checcio either intentionally or unintentionally concealed the true nature of his injury from him, the Superior Court also concluded that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment was not triggered. Thus, the Superior Court ruled that the limitations period in 42 Pa.C.S. § 5524(2) began to run on July 17, 1998, and held that Fine’s action, having been commenced more than two years from that date, was time-barred.</p>

In Dr. Rice’s experience, temporary paresthesias and anesthesias commonly followed the procedure.

In his deposition, Dr. Rice testified that because Ward was older, he told her that the risk of numbness increases with age.

In the consent form, Ward acknowledged that Dr. Rice had explained the nature, purpose, and results of the operation to her.</p>

Immediately following the surgery, Ward’s face was sore and numb. When the hospital where the surgery was performed telephoned Ward the next day to inquire about her condition, Ward indicated that she was fine and did not mention the soreness or numbness. The numbness on the left side of Ward’s face continued. Ward had numerous post-operative office visits with Dr. Rice, starting on April 5, 1995, and ending on January 22, 1996. During the visits, Ward and Rice discussed her facial numbness. Ward testified that Dr. Rice repeatedly told her that sensation would return in two months’ time. Dr. Rice testified that he advised Ward that numbness is a complication of the operation he performed; that statistics show that feeling could return in about two months; and that because no one can know what the future holds, there was hope and a chance of recovery. At Ward’s seventh office visit with Dr. Rice on September 20, 1995, Dr. Rice referred her to Steven Kaltman, D.M.D. On October 11, 1995, Ward consulted with Dr. Kaltman, who outlined options for treating the numbness and pain. Ward returned to Dr. Rice for one last office visit on January 22, 1996. In March of 1997, Dr. Rice referred Ward to another oral surgeon for a consultation.

The trial court also determined that Ward did not sustain her burden of showing that Dr. Rice concealed Ward’s condition from her inasmuch as she experienced pain and numbness as soon as the surgery was completed.

Observing that Ward remained under Dr. Rice’s care after the surgery and relied upon his assurances that her pain and numbness would subside, the Superior Court determined that “a jury could conceivably conclude that [Ward’s] failure to investigate the possible causes of her condition until the first referral to Dr. Kaltman on October 11, 1995, was <em>reasonable____“Id. </em>at 1125. The court also determined that Dr. Rice’s assurances of full recuperation, which lulled Ward into a false sense of security, and Dr. Rice’s failure to refer her at the optimum time to a neurosurgeon, which impeded her ability to rectify her condition, constituted “concealment.” <em>Id. &amp; </em>n. 2.

The Judicial Code provides in pertinent part that limitations periods are computed from the time the cause of action accrued. 42 Pa.C.S. § 5502(a). In Pennsylvania, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff could have first maintained the action to a successful conclusion. <em>Kapil v. Association of Pa. State College and Univ.

Second, an interpretation of a statute of <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>limitations that premises a party’s access to the discovery rule on whether he knew or was able to know of his injury and its cause within the prescribed period would in many instances lead to unreasonable and arbitrary results and would be contrary to our long-standing approach in this area. Under such a conclusion, for example, a party who is reasonably diligent, but is unable to ascertain that he is injured until the day before the limitations period has run, must file suit within twenty-four hours or be time-barred by the statute of limitations. If that same party, however, reasonably discovers his. injury the day after the prescribed period has expired, he has the full statutory period within which to commence an action. In <em>Ayers, </em>we stated that a statute of limitations, like all statutes, must be read with reason and common sense; that its application to a given set of circumstances, must not be made to produce something that the General Assembly could never have intended; and that its interpretation must be guided by the presumption in the Statutory Construction Act that the legislature does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable. <em>Ayers, </em><a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.2d%20788" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="154 A.2d 788">154 A.2d at 789</a>. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (formerly, 46 P.S. § 552).

Therefore, to rule against the discovery rule’s application, the Superior Court had to undertake these fact-resolution and inference-drawing functions. In doing so, the court erred. We emphasize that it is not the court’s function upon summary judgment to decide issues of fact, but only to decide whether there is an issue of fact to be tried. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1035.2(1).</p>
    <p id="b653-5" data-blocks='[["BL_653.5",653,[163,872,1153,1068]]]'>Turning to the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, while Fine argues that the issue had to be resolved at trial, Dr. Checcio argues that Fine failed to show that he could sustain his burden of proof on the doctrine’s application. Here too, we agree with Fine. We conclude that the Superior Court’s determination that Fine failed to establish that the statute of limitations was tolled by the doctrine disregarded the court’s proper role when presented with a motion for summary judgment and was erroneous. Fine based his assertion for the application of the doctrine on post-surgery statements he attributed to Dr. Checcio. As is reflected in their respective depositions, however, the parties disputed what Dr. Checcio actually said. <em>See supra, </em>p. 3. As we have instructed, it is for the jury to determine what remarks a defendant made to a plaintiff, before a court can decide whether they amounted to fraudulent concealment. <em>See Nesbitt, </em><a href="/citations/?q=204%20A.2d%20473" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="204 A.2d 473">204 A.2d at 476</a> (concluding that unless disputed facts as to what was said to the plaintiff are resolved, a fair and intelligent judgment by the court as to whether the defendant is estopped from asserting the statute of limitations due to concealment is impossible).</p>

      <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>We now turn to Dr. Rice’s appeal. With respect to the discovery rule, the arguments made by Ward and Dr. Rice reflect those made by the parties in Fine’s appeal. Dr. Rice argues against the discovery rule’s application, contending that since Ward knew immediately after the surgery on March 28, 1995, that she was numb, she also knew at the same time that she had suffered an injury. Ward responds that given the nature of the procedure that she underwent and what she understood the procedure to involve, the record does not establish that she knew or reasonably could have known on March 28, 1998 that her numbness was indicative of an injury, and not a temporary post-operative condition.</p>
    <p id="b654-5" data-blocks='[["BL_654.6",654,[239,990,1155,581]]]'>Ward is correct. For the same reasons we stated in Fine’s appeal, the facts and inferences that are relevant to the discovery rule’s application—whether Ward knew or could have reasonably known that the numbness she admitted to experiencing upon the surgery’s completion was a manifestation of an injury, as opposed to, or in addition to, the typical and temporary conditions that dental surgery produces—are disputed and must be resolved at trial. <em>See supra, </em>p. 5. Therefore, as the Superior Court determined, Dr. Rice’s motion for summary judgment should have been denied. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1035; <em>Hayward, </em><a href="/pa/530/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="530 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1833007" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0320-01">608 A.2d at 1040</a>.</p>

The court focused on whether a jury could find Ward’s failure to investigate the causes of her condition until some seven months after the surgery to be reasonable. <em>See Ward, </em><a href="/a2d/828/1118-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="828 A.2d 1118" data-case-ids="9108116" data-case-paths="/a2d/828/1118-01">828 A.2d at 1125</a>. This is not the question that Dr. Rice’s motion for summary judgment and Ward’s response raising the discovery rule required the court to address. The court should have asked and answered whether there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Ward knew or was unable to know, despite the exercise of reasonable diligence, that she was injured and by what cause at the time the <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>injury was inflicted. <em>See Pocono International, </em><a href="/pa/503/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="503 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1785922" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0080-01">468 A.2d at 471</a>.</p>
    <p id="b655-4" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[159,453,1160,1249]]]'>Likewise, with regard to the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, while we agree that the Superior Court correctly determined that the doctrine precluded the entry of summary judgment for Dr. Rice, we disagree with the court’s approach. The court was in no position to base its ruling on the conclusion that Dr. Rice’s post-surgery statements were “assurances” of “full recuperation” that amounted to concealment. <em>Ward, </em><a href="/a2d/828/1118-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="828 A.2d 1118" data-case-ids="9108116" data-case-paths="/a2d/828/1118-01">828 A.2d at 1125</a>. This is because the record shows that the statements that Dr. Rice made to Ward about the numbness during post-operative visits are disputed. <em>See supra, </em>p. 5. Thus, application of the doctrine cannot be resolved until the jury determines at trial what Dr. Rice said to Ward in this regard. <em>See Nesbitt, </em><a href="/citations/?q=204%20A.2d%20473" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="204 A.2d 473">204 A.2d at 476</a>. Finally, we also take issue with the Superior Courts conclusion that Dr. Rice’s failure to refer Ward to a neurosurgeon in a timely fashion, which prevented her from securing corrective measures, constituted a second act of concealment. In doing so, the Superi- or Court usurped the province of the jury, finding facts regarding Dr. Rice’s conduct that remain disputed, and misapprehended the inquiry that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment entails, which is whether a defendant’s statements caused the plaintiff to relax his vigilance or deviate from inquiring into the facts. <em>See Deemer, </em><a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.%20215" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="187 A. 215">187 A. at 215</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
