The second Superior Court panel again reversed Appellee’s judgment of sentence and remanded, holding that the “law of the case” doctrine bound it to the earlier panel’s decision, including the language purportedly prohibiting the trial court from resentencing Appellee to a term of imprisonment greater than that contemplated in the negotiated guilty plea.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Despite the trial court’s assessment <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>that the particular language at issue was both dicta and contrary to the established law in <em>Smith, </em>the Superior Court refused to find that the previous panel made a “clearly erroneous” holding by limiting the trial court’s resentencing options as it did.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellee initially claims that the Commonwealth waived its right to appeal the issue of the maximum term available upon resentencing because that issue was decided within the first Superior Court panel's decision and the Commonwealth failed to appeal it to this Court at that time. However, neither Appellant nor Appellee ever raised the question of whether the trial court was bound by the maximum term contemplated in the plea agreement before the first Superior Court panel. Thus, the only Anderson-related issue before that panel was whether the imposition of consecutive sentences upon resentencing was prohibited under that case. As such, the court necessarily vacated Appellee’s sentence based on that issue alone and we consider the discussion regarding the maximum term of Appellee's sentence to be mere dicta. Given this fact, we simply cannot fault the Commonwealth for failing to appeal the maximum term issue to this Court at that time and we refuse to find that the Commonwealth waived its right to ultimately appeal that issue by failing to do so in conjunction with the first panel opinion.</p>

The rationale for giving the trial court such discretion upon resentencing is grounded in the nature of a negotiated guilty plea, which is a two-sided agreement that imposes obligations on both the defendant and the Commonwealth.

The defendant, on the other hand, accepts this benefit with the implicit promise that he will abide by the terms of the agreement and behave in accordance with the legal punishment imposed by the court. <em>See Commonwealth v.
