The analogy is flawed; if anything, it supports a holding that § 904 should require at least a level of reasonable suspicion to be constitutionally valid. “The operator of any vehicle ... <em>reasonably believed to have violated any provision of this title ... </em>shall, upon request, exhibit a registration card, [and] driver’s license....” 75 Pa.C.S. § 6808(a) (emphasis added). Although hunting is well regulated, it does not compare to the breadth and volume of law and regulation for vehicle operations. Yet, even in that heavily regulated realm, law enforcement officers must be able to articulate a level of suspicion prior to initiating a stop and asking for identification. Section 904, as written at the time of Ickes’ confrontation with state Game Officers, lacked the need for any such suspicion.</p>

There the court held Game Officers may stop a vehicle, but only upon reasonable suspicion, and search it, but only with probable cause. <em>Id., </em>at 249. Furthermore, the court held the Game Officers in that case should have administered Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> warnings as any other law enforcement officers would be required to do in a custodial interrogation. <em>Id. </em>None of these threshold requirements are enumerated in the statute that authorizes Game Officers to stop and search, but they are required if officers are to avoid constitutional impropriety. <em>Palm </em>has not unduly burdened Game Officers in performing their duties, and effective enforcement of Pennsylvania’s game laws will go on following our ruling herein.</p>
