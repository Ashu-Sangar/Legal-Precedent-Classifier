The substance of the October 15th letter focused on Appellant’s desire for the appointment of new counsel or permission to retain private counsel because of the difficulty he was having with present counsel. Appellant’s request to proceed pro se was posed as his only alternative if he was not afforded new counsel. Thus, it was employed as a bargaining device, rather than as a clear demand for self representation. Furthermore, at the hearing on the request, the trial court gave Appellant the opportunity to air his grievances, and Appellant’s focus was on retaining new counsel; his need for a continuance; and his dissatisfaction with his current counsel. Appellant never returned to the issue of <em>pro se </em>representation. Lastly, when directly asked by the trial court whether he wanted to proceed <em>pro se </em>on the first day of trial, Appellant clearly indicated that he did not want to represent himself.

From those first hand observations, he concluded that the cause of her death was a brain injury as a result of force being applied to her skull. He was able to reach these conclusions based on the nature of the injuries to the brain, i.e., the shearing and twisting that the autopsy revealed, and the victim’s condition at the time the police found her and at her arrival at the hospital. <em>See also id. </em>at 454 (“When it [g forces] is directed or <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>loaded to the head, and to the brain, that’s what causes massive unconsciousness, causes swelling and the hemorrhaging, and causes somebody to go unconscious rapidly.”). The reference to the number of “g forces” was merely a descriptive term used to describe the fact that the victim was hit with force; it was not a linchpin as to the cause of death. The substance of his testimony established the cause of death with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.

Appellant, apparently, had no complaints about Attorney Spahn.

It is apparent from the several record colloquies that appellant had continuing contact with both of his lawyers. These lawyers may have something pertinent to say concerning, for example, whether appellant had expressed a view to them in confidence concerning self-representation—as opposed to, for example, hybrid representation. Indeed, the communications between counsel and client may explain why counsel never requested that appellant be permitted to proceed <em>pro se </em>or why appellant changed his mind. On the other hand, proper review of the claim as one sounding in counsel ineffectiveness may reveal that appellant truly did desire to represent himself, but was impeded by counsel.</p>

I see no reason why a trial court should be obliged to conduct a colloquy that a counseled defendant never asks for. I think this Court should be circumspect in the <em>sua sponte </em>duties we impose on trial judges, in cases with counseled litigants, to act as supplemental advocates for one of the parties. Moreover, imposing a <em>sua sponte </em>requirement by opinion, rather than specifically memorializing it in a rule, risks uneven awareness and enforcement.

The course not taken also would have the benefit of including the Commonwealth in what should have been an adversarial process, since any motion counsel would file would have to be served upon the Commonwealth; that course would also thereby increase the likelihood that important issues would be discovered and explored, or foreclosed where appropriate. As is, the Commonwealth in this case was left totally in the dark as to the substance of the <em>ex parte </em>contact which was the subject of the November 14 hearing. But the failure of the trial court to simply forward the motion to counsel hardly absolved counsel of their responsibilities to their client.</p>
