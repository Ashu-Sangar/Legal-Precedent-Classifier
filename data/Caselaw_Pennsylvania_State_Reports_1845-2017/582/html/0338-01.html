Regarding the Fiscal Office’s argument that the forbearance language in the first sentence of section 2809(e) gave it the power to assess EGSs, Judge Solomon noted that this was a “strained reverse inference” as the authority to forbear is simply “the power to refrain from exercising an existing authority; it is not the granting of that authority.” Judge Solomon’s Decision, at 5. In sum, Judge Solomon explained that he could not find any “plain and unmistakable taxing language as to [EGSs]” in the Code and he refused to imply that the Fiscal Office had the power to tax EGSs in the absence of direct language to that effect. <em>Id. </em>at 8.

The Commission then looked at section 2809(e) and, unlike Judge Solomon, was persuaded by the Fiscal Office’s argument that the forbearance language in that section gave the Fiscal Office the power to apply section 510 assessments to EGSs. While recognizing that the language was “a bit awkward,” the Commission nonetheless found that the General Assembly’s intent was clear. Comm’n Opinion and Order, 9/7/2001, at 15. As it explained, “[b]y granting the [Fiscal Office] the power to ‘forbear from applying the requirements of this part which it deems are unnecessary due to competition among [EGSs],’ the [General Assembly] grants the [Fiscal Office] broad discretion to determine what, if any, other section of the Code is to be enforced relative to EGSs, notwithstanding the existence of competition among EGSs.” <em>Id. </em>(quoting 66 Pa.C.S. § 2810).

We note that at first blush, it may seem arguable that section 510 assessments are necessary to maintain high quality electric service because such assessments fund the Commission and the Commission is needed to keep electric utilities up to present standards.
