The Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”) court determined that appellee was not entitled to credit. The Superior Court vacated that determination and remanded for an evidentiary hearing. For the reasons set forth below, we find that appellee is not entitled to sentencing credit toward his prison sentence for time he spent at home on bail subject to electronic monitoring.

On December 1, 2000, the Commonwealth filed a petition to revoke bail because appellee had been drinking alcoholic beverages, in violation of his bail terms. On December 5, 2000, following a conference on the petition and an agreement between the Commonwealth and appellee, appellee was placed on the Lycoming County Intensive Supervised Bail Program utilizing home confinement with electronic monitoring.

The trial court stated that, “[n]o one anticipated that [the intensive supervised bail with electronic monitoring] program would be considered ‘custody’ for purposes of credit for time served. If the court realized the defendant could be entitled to credit, it simply would have revoked the defendant’s bail based on the defendant’s consumption of alcohol in violation of his conditions of bail.” R., Doc. 24, at 2. The trial court determined that allowing appellee sentencing credit for time he spent at his home subject to bail and electronic monitoring would reward him for his initial bail violation. The trial court also noted that appellee’s only remaining avenue of relief from his sentence was to file a petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541, <em>et seq.</em>

The petition was denied on November 27, 2001. At that time, the trial court also denied bail pending PCRA appeal and ordered appellee to begin serving his sentence on December 10, 2001. On November 28, 2001, appellee appealed to the Superior Court and filed an application for bail. On December 10, 2001, appellee reported to the Warden of the Lycoming County Prison to begin serving his sentence, but on December 21, 2001, the Superior Court ordered that he be released on reasonable bail pending his PCRA appeal.

Appellee argued that this Court had <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>announced in <em>Chiappini </em>that a defendant is entitled to credit against his sentence for time served on a home electronic monitoring program, because such a program constitutes custody. Appellee further argued that the electronic monitoring program he participated in was “virtually identical” to the program addressed in <em>Chiappini. </em>The Commonwealth countered that the “custody” reasoning of the lead opinion in <em>Chiappini </em>was embraced by only three Justices, while four Justices disagreed on that point and concluded that home confinement does not constitute custody.

The Superior Court therefore vacated the PCRA court’s order denying relief and remanded for an evidentiary hearing, regarding the nature of the Lycoming County program, to determine whether it constituted custody for purposes of Section 9760.</p>

The Commonwealth posits that one who is “released” on bail simply cannot be deemed to be in “custody.” The Commonwealth asserts that the Superi- or Court’s determination that home monitoring is equivalent to custody for sentencing credit purposes will erroneously result in two individuals on home monitoring being treated differently, depending on whether electronic monitoring is a condition of probation or a part of intermediate punishment. The Commonwealth argues that it would be anomalous to conclude that the General Assembly intended one to be deemed in custody for purposes of credit against his sentence when the home monitoring was imposed as a condition of bail. Finally, the Commonwealth highlights the practical difficulties of the Superior Court’s decision, namely that it requires a case-by-case, county-by-county determination, which is likely to lead to inconsistent results. A bright-line rule prohibiting the award of sentencing credit for time spent in home confinement, the Commonwealth suggests, would avoid such difficulties.</p>

      <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>The issue of whether an individual is entitled to sentencing credit against a term of incarceration for time spent on bail release subject to electronic home monitoring is primarily one of statutory construction. Therefore, this Court’s review is plenary and we owe no deference to the lower courts’ legal conclusions. <em>See, e.g., Department of Trans. v.

The easiest application of this statutory provision is when an individual is held in prison pending trial, or pending appeal, and faces a sentence of incarceration: in such a case, credit clearly would be awarded. However, the statute provides little explicit guidance in resolving the issue before us now, where appellee spent time released on bail, but subject to electronic home monitoring, rather than in prison. This difficulty results in part from the fact that neither Section 9760, nor any other provision of the Sentencing Code, defines the phrase “time spent in custody.” The difficulty is also a function of the fact that there are many forms of sentence, and many forms of pre-sentencing release, which involve restrictions far short of incarceration in a prison. To better understand how these forms of control fit into the Code’s “custody” rubric, we turn to past decisions of this Court for guidance.</p>

This Court held that the trial court did have such discretionary power. <em>Id. </em>at 1110.

      <em>Chiappini </em>posed two distinct issues, one involving the common law spousal privilege, and the other involving credit for time spent on electronic home monitoring.

The lead opinion, which was joined by then-Chief Justice Flaherty and Madame Justice Newman, would have found, as a matter of statutory construction, that Chiappini was entitled to credit for the time spent subject to home confinement. The remaining four Justices, however, were of the view that an individual who has spent time in home confinement with electronic monitoring is generally not entitled to credit toward a prison sentence because an individual in such a program is not in custody. <em><a href="/pa/566/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="782 A.2d 490" data-case-ids="706318,9471474" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0507-01,/a2d/782/0490-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/566/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="782 A.2d 490" data-case-ids="706318,9471474" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0507-01,/a2d/782/0490-01">at 502</a> (Nigro, J., concurring); 502-03 (Cappy, J., concurring and dissenting); 503-07 (Castille, J., concurring and dissenting, joined by Saylor, J.); 507-08 (Saylor, J., concurring and dissenting). Mr. Justice Nigro, however, provided a fourth vote to award sentencing credit for the time spent in home confinement in that particular case, but solely based on equitable reasons. <em>See <a href="/pa/566/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="782 A.2d 490" data-case-ids="706318,9471474" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0507-01,/a2d/782/0490-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/566/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="782 A.2d 490" data-case-ids="706318,9471474" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0507-01,/a2d/782/0490-01">at 502</a> (Nigro, J., concurring).

Subsequent to the second guilty verdict, the Commonwealth sought to remove electronic monitoring from Chiappini’s bail conditions, apparently in order to prevent Chiappini from receiving sentencing credit for any more time spent on electronic monitoring, which the Commonwealth believed would be credited to him. Upon Chiappini’s motion for credit for time served, the trial court initially allowed credit for the 518 days he spent on electronic monitoring.

[Such confinement] in no way approaches being ordered to pack a few belongings, leave that home, and report to a prison cell.”). To equate the electronic monitoring restriction with custody, especially in a case such as this one where <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>appellee agreed to the restriction, presumably as a means of avoiding incarceration, ignores the very nature of bail, whereby some type of restriction is almost always imposed.

Incarceration in an institutional setting is different in kind, not in mere degree, from “confinement” to the comforts of one’s home. Sentences, and particularly relatively short sentences such as is at issue here, can be designed to punish, to rehabilitate, and to teach lessons and personal responsibility. In this case, it is clear that the trial court intended appellee to spend at least forty five days in a prison. As the trial court noted, to require the court to reduce appellee’s punishment by eliminating the mandatory minimum prison sentence for DUI would unjustly reward appellee for his initial bail violation. Trial courts are vested with considerable discretion concerning release before trial and pending appeal. Once trial courts recognize the unintended windfall that would result from permitting conditional release on bail in an instance such as this one, they might be less likely to grant such requests. One of the benefits of home monitoring is the flexibility it affords the defendant and the court. If a court is to be required to pretend that such release is a period of incarceration, it may determine that actual incarceration, rather than bail release, is the only way to ensure service of an appropriate punishment.</p>

    <p id="b1025-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1025.5",1025,[157,656,1153,1372]]]'>Because of the varying home confinement programs in place throughout the counties of the Commonwealth, the necessity of a case-by-case approach as delineated in <em>Chiappini, </em>which carefully examines the particulars and nuances of each electronic monitoring program, is readily apparent. In <em>Chiappini, </em>a plurality of this Court determined that the technology employed by the Lackawanna County Home Confinement/Electronic Monitoring Program had sufficiently restrained and limited Chiappini’s freedom so as to constitute “custody” pursuant to Section 9760. Specifically, participants in the Lackawanna County program were closely monitored by Lackawanna County prison authorities throughout the course of the day via a non-detachable ankle or wrist bracelet, which each participant was required to wear at all times. Moreover, an additional monitoring device was attached to each participant’s home telephone. Lackawanna County prison authorities also ensured strict compliance with the restrictions of the program through random telephone calls and occasional visits from detention personnel. In addition, the program permitted county detention staff members, whether corrections or maintenance personnel, to enter a participant’s residence upon request at any time. Essentially, a participant in the Lackawanna County home confinement program was an inmate of the county prison system and his or her residence was “considered a jail without bars.” <em>Chiappini, </em><a href="/pa/566/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="782 A.2d 490" data-case-ids="706318,9471474" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0507-01,/a2d/782/0490-01">782 A.2d at 497</a>.</p>

The evidentiary record detailing the Lycoming County home confinement program is insufficient to conclude that <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>Appellee’s residence was, ultimately, a “jail without bars.” Hence, the Superior Court did not specifically hold that Appellee was entitled to credit for time served in this particular home confinement program. Instead, the court remanded the matter for an evidentiary hearing to investigate the nature and extent of control exercised by the Lycoming County authorities in administering and enforcing its home confinement program.</p>
    <p id="b1026-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1026.5",1026,[243,773,1154,524]]]'>Absent a full and complete evidentiary record detailing the particulars of the Lycoming County home confinement program, I believe that such a remand is necessary before categorically deciding that Appellee was not in “custody” and not entitled to sentencing credit. Accordingly, pursuant to the case-by-case approach outlined in <em>Chiappini, </em>I would affirm the Order of the Superior Court remanding this matter for an evidentiary hearing to scrutinize the nature and enforcement protocol of the Lycoming County home confinement program before reaching a final determination.</p>
