In the month preceding Linda Rowden’s death, her boyfriend, Appellant was angry with her because he believed that she had gone to the police to implicate him in the drug-related murder of a man named Nigel Anderson.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant’s anger grew over <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>Ms. Rowden’s willingness to cooperate with authorities, and in turn, Ms. Rowden complained to the Norristown police that Appellant had assaulted and was harassing her. The police took a report, prepared a complaint against Appellant, and advised him to stay away from her.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.6",659,[162,604,1156,903]]]'>Unfortunately, the couple was together one final time on July 10, 1980. According to witnesses, on that date Ms. Rowden was driving her car down Dekalb Street in Montgomery County with Richard Mayo riding in the front passenger seat and Appellant riding in the back seat. It was daylight and the windows of the car were down. Mr. Mayo testified that Appellant and Ms. Rowden were arguing about her cooperation with the police investigation of the Anderson murder case when Appellant leaned forward and shot Ms. Rowden twice with a revolver. Ms. Rowden slumped forward and lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle swerved to the right, and crashed into parked cars lining Dekalb Street. Appellant jumped out of the backseat and walked quickly down a side street with the gun still in his hand. Mr. Mayo immediately got out and yelled for help. He then ran to an emergency phone, and called the police. A subsequent autopsy confirmed that Ms. Rowden died as a result of the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b659-6" data-blocks='[["BL_659.7",659,[161,1535,1157,416]]]'>In the meantime, Appellant fled the scene. He went to the apartment of Denise Walker where he told Ms. Walker that he had just shot Ms. Rowden because she “was running her face to the detectives” about the Anderson murder. Appellant then changed his clothes, told Ms. Walker he was leaving town, and fled the area shortly thereafter. A search of Ms. Walker’s apartment uncovered a set of Appellant’s clothes and an opened box of Remington-Peters bullets.</p>

Additionally, Frieda Sambrick testified that she was sitting on the steps of a nursing clinic located approximately 20 to 25 feet from the spot where Ms. Rowden’s vehicle crashed. Ms. Sambrick told the jury that she had known Appellant for eleven years, and when she saw Ms. Rowden driving by, she recognized Appellant, who was sitting in the back seat. Ms. Sambrick said she saw Appellant lean forward and she heard the gunshots followed by Ms. Rowden’s scream. She then saw the car crash, and watched as Appellant got out of the car and ran from the scene.</p>

Agent Riley testified that he conducted comparative bullet lead anal<a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>ysis (CBLA) of eight bullets from the open box of bullets found at Ms. Walker’s apartment with the bullet fragments recovered from the victim’s body.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> He concluded that six of the eight bullets found at Ms. Walker’s apartment were analytically indistinguishable from the bullets retrieved from Ms. Rowden’s body, while the remaining two of the eight tested had minor compositional differences. Agent Riley opined that bullets that are analytically indistinguishable or of close compositional association typically come from the same box of ammunition. He qualified his finding by saying that these bullets could have also come from another box of ammunition, but that box, most likely would have had to be manufactured by Remington Peters and packaged on or about the same date as the box recovered by police in this case. On cross-examination, defense counsel challenged Agent Riley’s conclusions and pointed out that other bullets manufactured by Remington Peters and sold in the area had the same composition, raising the possibility that anyone who bought them could equally be associated with the bullets recovered from the victim’s body.</p>

As noted above, however, defense counsel was successful in haring Agent Riley admit that any number of bullets could match those recovered from the victim. Thus, even if Appellant could have completely discredited the CBLA theory, and Appellant could have proven that the bullets recovered from the victim’s body did not come from the box of ammunition found in Ms. Walker’s apartment, it is still uncontroverted that the victim died as a result of two bullet wounds inflicted by Appellant.

The lead fragments are spectrographically analyzed for comparison of trace elements associated with lead smelting with those in ammunition seized from a suspect. Agent Riley explained that he was attempting to compare the elemental composition of the bullets he examined by looking for trace elements in the lead, such as antimony, copper arsenic, silver, tin and bismuth, unique to a particular manufacturer.
