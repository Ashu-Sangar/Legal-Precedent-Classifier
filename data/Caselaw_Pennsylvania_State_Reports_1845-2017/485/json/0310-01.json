Post-verdict motions were denied and this appeal follows.\nIn this appeal, appellant raises the following issues, all of which are either without merit or are waived:\n1) That the district magistrate erred when, during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Commonwealth witness Joseph Ziemba at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing, he (the district magistrate) did not allow defense counsel to ask several questions;\n2) That the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to sequester the jury;\n3) That the trial court erred in permitting Commonwealth witness Agnes Halgash to testify that she consented to taking a polygraph examination;\n4) That the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s pretrial application for a psychiatric examination of Commonwealth witness Joseph Ziemba;\n5) That the trial court erred in denying his pretrial application for discovery and inspection;\n6) That the trial court erred in failing to strike Commonwealth witness Dr. Halbert Fillinger\u2019s answer to a hypothetical question that was propounded by the prosecutor;\n7) That the trial court erred in permitting Dr. Halbert Fillinger to testify that skeleton number one\u2019s cause of death was not \u201cinconsistent\u201d with manual strangulation;\n8) That \u201cthe Commonwealth violated . . . [appellant\u2019s] constitutional rights by failing to disclose bargains . [that the Commonwealth] may have made\u201d with Commonwealth witnesses.\n9) That the Northumberland County Court of Common Pleas erred in increasing the amount of appellant\u2019s bail;\n10) That the Northumberland County Court of Common Pleas erred in refusing appellant\u2019s first motion for a change of venue;\n11) That the trial court erred in not permitting defense counsel to cross-examine Commonwealth witness Joseph Ziemba concerning the facts surrounding his involuntary sexual deviate intercourse conviction;\n12) That \u201cthe Commonwealth violated . . . [appellant\u2019s] constitutional right by failing to dispose of criminal charges pending\u201d against Commonwealth witnesses Michael Lehman and Albert Patti prior to appellant\u2019s trial; and\n13) \u201cThat the Commonwealth violated . . . [his] constitutional rights by refusing to disclose evidence presumably exculpatory\u201d to appellant. [Emphasis provided].\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. In response to the dissenting opinion, the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

        "text": "MANDERINO, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent. The district magistrate erred in unduly restricting the cross-examination of a witness for the prosecution at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing. Rule 141 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure entitles one to be present at the preliminary hearing, be represented by counsel, cross-examine witnesses, present witnesses and make notes of the proceedings. Our rules are so structured because of the belief that the preliminary hearing is a \u201ccritical stage\u201d in the criminal processes. The United States Supreme Court has declared a preliminary hearing is such a \u201ccritical stage\u201d and recognized that information may be learned at a preliminary hearing that is vital to the defense of the accused at a later trial. The United States Supreme Court said:\n\u201c. . . the skilled interrogation of witnesses by an experienced lawyer can fashion a vital impeachment tool for use in cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses at the trial, or preserve testimony favorable to the accused of a witness who does not appear at the trial. Third, trained counsel can more effectively discover the case the State has against his client and make possible the preparation of a proper defense to meet that case at the trial.\u201d\nColeman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 9, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 2003, 26 L.Ed.2d 387, 397 (1970).\nAt appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing, the district magistrate refused to permit counsel to thoroughly cross-examine an alleged co-conspirator. This improper restriction of cross-examination requires that appellant be granted both a new preliminary hearing and a new trial.",
