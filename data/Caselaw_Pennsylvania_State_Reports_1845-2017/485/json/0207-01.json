Appellant has raised the following issues:\n(1) the evidence is\u00bf insufficient to sustain the conviction;\n(2) the trial court erred in admitting photographs of the victim\u2019s home and the alleged murder weapon;\n(3) the prosecution violated Rule 1100 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure;\n(4) the trial court erred in permitting testimony concerning a picture of appellant taken after his arrest;\n(5) the arresting officer lacked probable cause to arrest appellant;\n(6) the bloodstained money introduced into evidence was improperly obtained;\n(7) probable cause did not exist for the issuance of search warrants for appellant\u2019s clothing or blood samples;\n(8) the written and oral confessions of appellant were illegally obtained and prejudicially cumulative.\nWe have reviewed each issue and find that they do not warrant the granting of a new trial nor the vacation of the judgment of sentence.\nThe judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas, is affirmed.",
