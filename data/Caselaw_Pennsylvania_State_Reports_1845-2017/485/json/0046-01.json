We therefore vacate the December 12, 1977, decree of the orphans\u2019 court and remand for a further evidentiary hearing. This Court shall retain jurisdiction. Within fourteen days of the filing of the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s adjudication, either side may file supplemental briefs with this Court.",
