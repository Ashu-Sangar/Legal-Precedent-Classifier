        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nEdward A. Gallagher died on December 18, 1969. Appellee, Provident National Bank (Provident), presented for probate a document which was handwritten on a printed will form. The trial court in the matter before us described this document as one written \u201cin a confused and haphazard manner.\u201d The document contained writing after the signature and contained writing in a vertical direction in the margins. When the handwritten document was presented for probate, Provident also submitted a typed \u201ccopy\u201d of the document. Unlike the handwritten document, all the provisions in the typed copy appeared in an orderly fashion with the decedent\u2019s signature at the end thereof. This typed copy is referred to in the record as a \u201ccopy fair.\u201d Provident was granted letters of administration and proceeded to administer the estate. On May 9, 1975, the trial court\u2019s adjudication confirming Provident\u2019s first and final account was made absolute and distribution proceeded in accordance with the court\u2019s decree.\nApproximately eleven months later, on April 5, 1976, appellant, Daniel Gallagher, a brother and legal heir of the decedent, filed a \u201cPetition for Citation to Show Cause Why Audit Should not be Set Aside and Letters of Administration Revoked.\u201d Appellee, Provident, responded by filing \u201cPreliminary Objections,\u201d following which, the trial court without holding any hearing dismissed appellant\u2019s petition.\nAppellant contends in this appeal that the trial court erred in dismissing the petition without a hearing. We agree.\nAppellant does not dispute the fact that when he filed his petition on April 5, 1976, the normal appeal time had expired. He argues, however, that his petition collaterally attacking probate and the trial court\u2019s final adjudication and decree of distribution, was not subject to the ordinary appeal periods because the petition alleged fraud. The trial court considered the fraud argument but dismissed the petition nonetheless stating that \u201ca mere allegation is not sufficient\u201d and further stating \u201cthe charge of fraud is merely an unsupported declaration.\u201d\nWe agree with appellant that his petition alleging fraud was timely filed and we disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the petition contained \u201ca nebulous claim of fraud.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s petition read as follows:\n\u201cThe petition of Daniel Gallagher, respectfully represents that:\n1. Your Petitioner resides at 70 Darby Road, Paoli, Chester County, Pennsylvania and is a brother of the decedent, Edward A. Gallagher.\n2. Edward A. Gallagher died December 18, 1969 in Letterkenny County Donegal, Republic of Ireland having first made and published his handwritten last will and testament dated September 28, 1965 which was witnessed by two persons. A copy of said document with subsequent alterations, is attached hereto as Exhibit \u2018A\u2019.\n3. Thereafter, on September 15, 1972, Letters of Administration, C.T.A. were granted to Provident National Bank which presented with the Petition therefore an alleged \u2018fair copy\u2019 of the handwritten will of decedent.\n4. The said \u2018fair copy\u2019 indicated the location of testator\u2019s signature at a place on the will different from that on the original handwritten will (see Exhibit \u2018A\u2019).\n5. The original will, at the time it was executed, was signed at the end thereof but, subsequent to its execution, was altered by the addition of writing after the signature.\n6. At the time said will was offered for probate, Provident National Bank knew, or should have known, that the \u2018fair copy\u2019 submitted did not accurately represent the handwritten will but, notwithstanding such knowledge, Provident fraudulently represented to the Register of Wills that the \u2018fair copy\u2019 of said will as prepared by Provident was a true copy of the will as executed when, in fact, the bequests set forth in the \u2018fair copy\u2019 were added to the will after it had been signed and witnessed.\n7. As a result of fraudulently obtaining Letters of Administration, Provident illegally obtained possession of the assets of the Estate of Edward A. Gallagher resulting in a disposition of those assets to those not legally entitled.\n8. On January 17, and May 6, 1974, Provident presented its First and Final Account for Audit and in continued reliance upon its \u2018fair copy\u2019, fraudulently represented to your Honorable Court that the decedent died testate with respect to all his property, that the will was properly executed and that the residuary estate was to be divided equally among Hanneman Hospital, Jefferson Hospital, Temple University Hospital, University Hospital and Presbyterian Hospital of New York. The account of this estate was approved by the Court on the basis of a will substantially different from that submitted for probate by Provident and upon which letters were granted to Provident.\n9. In the alternative, the probate of the will as aforesaid has resulted in a mistake on the part of the Court in the distribution of the residuary of the Estate of Edward A. Gallagher.\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner asks that a Citation issue upon Provident National Bank to show cause why the audit should not be set aside, the Letters of Administration granted to Respondent revoked and the compensation paid to the Administrator returned.\u201d\nIt is true that a petition alleging fraud without specificity is insufficient. On the other hand, neither a petition nor any other pleading alleging fraud is required to contain in detail all of the evidence in advance of its development during a hearing. The above petition contains more than a mere allegation of fraud. The petition and the reasonable inferences contained therein allege that the appellee when it presented the handwritten document to the register also presented \u201cfair copy\u201d (typed copy) which was different from the original. The petition alleges that the original was not signed at the end thereof but the submitted \u201cfair copy\u201d indicated a signature at the end thereof. The petition further alleges that fraudulent representations were made to the trial court which resulted in the court\u2019s approval of the account on the basis of the \u201cfair copy\u201d which was different from the original.\nThese allegations are specific and are sufficient to allow the petition to successfully withstand the claim that it is \u201cnebulous\u201d or only contains \u201ca mere allegation of fraud\u201d or that the charge of fraud in the petition is \u201cmerely an unsupported declaration.\u201d\nIt may be that at a hearing appellant will be unable to convince the fact finder that fraud existed in the probate of the will or in the administration of the estate. This is not the issue now before us. Appellant is entitled to his day in court on the issue of fraud. From the record before us, there is no evidence concerning the practice of using a \u201ccopy fair.\u201d (The parties interchangeably use \u201ccopy fair\u201d and \u201cfair copy.\u201d) Although this Court was given some information during oral argument about the local practice, this cannot be a substitute for testimony taken under oath during a hearing. Moreover, the record is silent concerning the specific use made of the \u201ccopy fair.\u201d We do not know whether the probate records would reasonably alert a searcher. We do not know whether the trial court had before it the original will or only the typed copy. We do not know whether persons entitled to legal notice during the administration of the estate had any way of knowing that the original existed or that it was different from the typed copy. These matters are only illustrative of what we do not know from the record before us. Appellant is entitled to an opportunity to prove whether or not there was fraud.\nSince appellant\u2019s petition contains a sufficient allegation of fraud, its consideration is not barred by the ordinary time limits for appeals. See In re Estate of Bell, 463 Pa. 109, 114, 343 A.2d 679, 681 (1975) (\u201c[irrespective of the statute, the [orphans\u2019 court division of the Court of Common Pleas] possesses an inherent discretionary right, recognized at common law, to correct its own records and decrees in the interest of justice. . . .

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nToday the majority, without cause and impermissibly acting as a factfinder, ignores the duly entered unappealed probate of decedent\u2019s will by the Philadelphia Register of Wills and finds that there was writing after the signature on the decedent\u2019s handwritten will form. Then, sub silentio, it introduces a new principle of fraud to overturn the decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas on the basis of the majority\u2019s newly created rule. I must dissent.\nEdward A. Gallagher died testate on December 18, 1969. Appellee, Provident National Bank (Provident), administrator c.t.a. of the Gallagher estate, proffered for probate to the Philadelphia Register of Wills both the decedent\u2019s will, which was handwritten on a printed will form, and a proposed \u201ccopy fair\u201d of that instrument, prepared by Provident. Appellant, Daniel Gallagher, is a beneficiary and legal heir of the decedent.\nThe register of wills issued letters of administration c.t.a. to Provident on September 15, 1972. Provident properly advertised the issuance of the letters on September 26, October 3, and October 10, 1972, in both the Philadelphia Daily News and The Legal Intelligencer. 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3162. Thereafter, Provident filed a first and final account and a schedule of proposed distribution in compliance with Sup.Ct.O.C. Rule 6. By letter of November 19, 1974, appellant was given written notice of the December 2, 1974, audit of the account, and of appellant\u2019s interest under Provident\u2019s schedule of proposed distribution. On May 9, 1975, a nisi adjudication was entered by the Orphans\u2019 Court confirming Provident\u2019s account and directing distribution. Appellant filed no objections to Provident\u2019s account or proposed distributions and no exceptions were taken to the May 9, 1975 nisi adjudication. The adjudication became absolute, no appeal was taken, and distribution proceeded in accordance with the court\u2019s decree.\nOn April 5, 1976, eleven months after the unappealed decree became final, and after distribution, appellant filed a \u201cPetition for Citation to Show Cause Why Audit Should Not be Set Aside and Letters of Administration Revoked.\u201d This petition was viewed by the Orphans\u2019 Court as a petition seeking a rehearing under 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3521. Appellee responded by filing \u201cPreliminary Objections.\u201d In its opinion sur petition and preliminary objections, the Orphans\u2019 Court concluded that the appeal was \u201ca thinly veiled, collateral attack on the probate of the will and copy fair,\u201d and that, as such it was barred by the statute of limitations on appeals from probate. 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 908, 3133(b). The Orphans\u2019 Court dismissed appellant\u2019s petition.\nA party who has been given proper notice of all prior proceedings is not entitled to a Section 3521 rehearing. Compare Bach Estate, 426 Pa. 350, 231 A.2d 125 (1967) with Stewart Estate, 413 Pa. 190, 196 A.2d 330 (1964). Appellant argues that appellee\u2019s copy of the decedent\u2019s will so misconstrues the handwritten instrument, however, that its proposal for probate by appellee constituted a fraud against appellant from which appellant is entitled to equitable relief. See Estate of Bell, 463 Pa. 109, 343 A.2d 679 (1975); Osterling Estate, 337 Pa. 225, 10 A.2d 17 (1940). The majority, disregarding the time requirements, disagrees with the Philadelphia Register of Wills and affords appellant relief which is, as the Orphans\u2019 Court observed, a collateral attack on the May 9, 1975 probate.\nAppellant\u2019s claim of fraud is based on his argument that decedent\u2019s signature on the handwritten instrument appears between the specific pecuniary bequests and the residuary clause and that therefore it could not have been mere error on the copy fair to show decedent\u2019s signature at the end of the instrument.\n\u201cFraud,\u201d as that term was used in the predecessor to \u00a7 3521, has been defined to mean \u201csuch fraud as operates to prevent the fiduciary or \u2018any person interested\u2019 from taking action within the . . . period to secure review of the account. ... A plaintiff who charges fraud \u2018is not only chargeable with what he knew but also with what he could have discovered [with] reasonable diligence.\u2019 \u201d Thorne\u2019s Estate, 344 Pa. 503, 510, 25 A.2d 811, 815-6 (1942). \u201c \u2018Fraud\u2019 consists of any \u2018false representation of a matter of fact ... by false or misleading allegations or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed which deceives or is intended to deceive . . . Baker v. Rangos, 229 Pa.Super. 333, 348, 324 A.2d 498, 505 (1974). See also Hamilton Estate, 351 Pa. 419, 41 A.2d 567 (1945) (respondent\u2019s averment cannot constitute fraud where averment did not hinder or prevent petitioner from obtaining the information about the estate which she was at liberty to seek). Here, where the copy fair and the original will have been matters of public record and available to appellant since the 1972 probate, of which appellant had due notice, there can be no fraud.\nThus, to properly state a claim of fraud, appellant\u2019s petition must allege that in spite of his due diligence appellee\u2019s actions operated to preclude his taking any earlier action. Here, on the contrary, however, appellant admits, as he must, that he had notice of probate and hence that it was available for his inspection and review in 1972, four years prior to the filing of his rehearing petition. The alleged misconstrual of the copy fair was discoverable not only before audit and distribution, but also before the decree of probate became final and before the time for filing an appeal expired. Thus, no act of the appellee in any way hindered appellant from timely raising any claim.\nTo achieve finality and the timely, orderly and efficient administration of decedent\u2019s estate, our statutory and case law require adherence to the plain, well and long established rules of timeliness. The Court has held:\n\u201cIt is the affirmative duty of all competent beneficiaries, upon receiving notice of the filing of an account, to make diligent inquiry concerning the fiduciary\u2019s conduct and management of the affairs of the estate. All beneficiaries are chargeable not only with such information as was known to them at the time of the audit but also with what they could have discovered by exercising reasonable diligence.\u201d\nMershon Estate, 364 Pa. 549, 551, 73 A.2d 686, 687 (1950). Where, as here, appellant has had timely notice and every opportunity prior to distribution, to inspect the probate record in its entirety, and compare all the relevant documents, and to challenge both the decree of probate and the schedule of proposed distribution at both the trial and appellate levels, appellant\u2019s allegation of fraud cannot be sustained.\nOn this record there is no basis whatsoever on which to charge the Orphans\u2019 Court with an abuse of its discretion in denying a Section 3521 rehearing on this deficient allegation of \u201cfraud.\u201d I would, contrary to the majority, affirm the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court.\nEAGEN, C. J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n. It is the statutory duty of the Register of Wills to determine which documents, and portions of documents, constitute a decedent\u2019s testamentary writing. 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901 et seq.; Rockett Will, 348 Pa. 445, 35 A.2d 303 (1944). At argument, this Court was advised that in Philadelphia, it is the procedure of the Register of Wills to direct preparation of a copy of a handwritten testamentary instrument, which copy includes the writing which the Register deems constitutes decedent\u2019s will. Such a copy, adopted by the Register, is probated along with the handwritten instrument and, once admitted to probate, is called a \u201ccopy fair.\u201d The Register routinely requests a party offering a handwritten instrument for probate to submit a proposed \u201ccopy fair\u201d of that instrument. See generally, Walsh, Copy Fair & The Register of Wills, 36 Temp.L.Q. 311 (1963), Aker, Pennsylvania Probate & Interpretation of Wills \u00a7 3.14A. Here, the administrator submitted its proposed \u201ccopy fair,\u201d to the Register at the time it offered the handwritten instrument for probate. Appellant had notice and the opportunity to challenge the probate and accounting at the trial and appellate levels, but did not do so until nearly one year after final distribution.\n. Section 3521 now provides:\n\u201c\u00a7 3521. Rehearing; relief granted\nIf any party in interest shall, within five years after the final confirmation of any account of a personal representative, file a petition to review any part of the account or of an auditor\u2019s report, or of the adjudication, or of any decree of distribution, setting forth specifically alleged errors therein, the court shall give such relief as equity and justice shall require: Provided, that no such review shall impose liability on the personal representative as to any property which was distributed by him in accordance with a decree of court before the filing of the petition. The court or master considering the petition may include in his adjudication or report findings of fact and of law as to the entire controversy, in pursuance of which a final order may be made.\u201d\n1972, June 30, P.L. 508, No. 164, \u00a7 2, eff. July 1, 1972. Section 3521 removes a previous statutory bar to a Section 3521 rehearing after distribution of the estate. See, Act of April 18, 1949, P.L. 512, art. VII, \u00a7 721.\n. Although Section 908 now provides for a one-year period in which one may file a timely appeal from a probate decree, the controlling statute at the time the probate decree was entered in the Gallagher estate, allowed two years for the filing of such an appeal.\n. The bulk of decedent\u2019s estate was bequeathed to five hospitals. Appellant received only 1 pound under decedent\u2019s will. Were the charitable gifts declared void, appellant, as a legal heir, would receive a substantially greater portion of decedent\u2019s estate.",
