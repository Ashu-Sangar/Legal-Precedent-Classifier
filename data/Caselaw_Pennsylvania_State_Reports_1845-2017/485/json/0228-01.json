        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nNIX, Justice.\nIn Commonwealth v. Morales, 452 Pa. 53, 305 A.2d 11 (1973), we decided on direct appeal the same question advanced by the same appellant in this appeal, whether the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Appellant slightly rephrases this issue in this appeal from the denial of his petition for relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. Specifically, we are asked to decide whether appellant should be permitted to withdraw his pleas of guilty on the alleged ground that the pleas were not voluntary, knowing and intelligent pleas. This is a classic example of an attempted use of post-conviction proceedings to relitigate an issue which was decided on the merits in a prior direct appeal to this Court. We, therefore, affirm the dismissal of appellant\u2019s petition for relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act.\nIn our previous decision, we found:\nSince the record in the instant case fully supports the court\u2019s finding that appellant originally decided to plead guilty because \u201che felt that the Commonwealth\u2019s testimony proved his guilt\u201d (opinion of the trial court) and that this decision was a knowing and voluntary one, we do not find that the court abused its discretion in refusing to allow the withdrawal of the plea.\nCommonwealth v. Morales, supra, 452 Pa. at 56, 305 A.2d at 13-14.\nThe above language should satisfy any doubt that the issue of whether appellant\u2019s guilty pleas were made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily was finally litigated in his former direct appeal to this Court.\nFor the purposes of this act, an issue is finally litigated if: ******\n(3) The Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has ruled on the merits of the issue\u201d.\nAct of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, \u00a7 4, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(a)(3) (supp.1979).\nSee, e. g., Commonwealth v. McNeal, 479 Pa. 112, 387 A.2d 860 (1978); Commonwealth v. Fox, 476 Pa. 475, 383 A.2d 199 (1978); Commonwealth v. Bennett, 472 Pa. 314, 372 A.2d 713 (1977); Commonwealth v. Milliken, 456 Pa. 527, 321 A.2d 652 (1974).\nIn the post conviction proceeding, appellant simply attempted to refine those factors which he urges prevented him from entering a voluntarily, knowing and intelligent plea to the charges. Nevertheless, the basic question is the same that was presented in the direct appeal, and we will not again entertain it.\nOrder affirmed.\n. Appellant was indicted for the murders of two women in Berks County. His trial began on March 13, 1972, and on March 20, 1972, at the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant, while represented by counsel, entered guilty pleas to both counts of murder. After a colloquy between appellant and the court, the pleas were accepted. On June 22, 1972, appellant was called for sentencing, at which time appellant stated that he was not guilty of the crimes charged and that he wished to withdraw his guilty plea. After taking testimony from appellant that because of language difficulties and \u201cemotional pressure\u201d caused by so many accusations of guilt against him, appellant\u2019s plea was not knowing and voluntary, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion and sentenced him to two consecutive terms of four to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment and eight to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment respectively.\nCommonwealth v. Morales, 452 Pa. 53, 54, 305 A.2d 11, 12 (1973).\n. Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. 1580 (1965), \u00a7 1 et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1, et seq.",
