        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nThe issue before us is whether an appeal filed in the Superior Court by appellant, Amos Howard Yeaple, a resident of Arizona, was properly quashed by the Superior Court because it was untimely filed. Appellant contends in this Court that his appeal was timely filed and should be reinstated. We agree and therefore remand the matter to the Superior Court for a consideration of the merits of the appellant\u2019s appeal.\nAppellee, Margaret S. Yeaple, commenced a divorce action in York County against appellant, a resident of Arizona. Service was effected upon appellant in Arizona by registered mail. Approximately six months later, appellee filed a petition for alimony pendente lite and counsel fees. A rule to show cause issued, but was not served upon appellant. Service was attempted but the return indicated that the petition and rule were unclaimed by appellant in Arizona. Appellee did serve a copy of the petition and rule upon the attorney representing appellant in the divorce action.\nAppellant\u2019s attorney filed an answer to the petition. That answer was not verified by appellant. Pa.R.Civ.P. 1024. It was, however, verified by appellant\u2019s attorney, who stated that appellant was outside the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Pa.R.Civ.P. 1024(c). The attorney verified the answer upon information received. Pa.R.Civ.P. 1024(c). At a hearing held on the petition on April 5, 1978, appellant\u2019s attorney appeared and challenged the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter of alimony and counsel fees contending that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the person of the appellant as to those matters. At that hearing appellant\u2019s attorney also addressed himself to the merits of the petition contending that appellant had no obligation to pay because appellee\u2019s income was equal to appellant\u2019s income. The trial court ruled that it had jurisdiction over the person because the petition for alimony and counsel fees was ancillary to the divorce action in which a complaint had been served upon appellant in Arizona. The trial court deferred ruling on the merits of the petition pending further discovery concerning appellant\u2019s finances. On May 22, 1978, appellant\u2019s attorney filed a written motion to dismiss the petition for alimony and counsel fees again raising the issue that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the person of the appellant. On July 12, 1978, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss stating that his earlier ruling regarding jurisdiction was correct. Within thirty days of the trial court\u2019s order of July 12, 1978, appellant filed an appeal in the Superior Court. An adverse ruling involving jurisdiction over the person, although interlocutory, is an appealable order. Pa.R.A.P. 311; Act of 1925, March 5, 1925, P.L. 23 \u00a7 1 et seq., 12 P.S. \u00a7 672 et seq., as amended.\nIn the Superior Court, the appellee moved to quash the appeal contending that it was not a timely appeal. According to appellee, in its motion before the Superior Court, appellant should have appealed within thirty days of the court\u2019s first ruling on jurisdiction over the person which was made on April 5, 1978, more than thirty days before appellant filed his appeal in the Superior Court. The Superior Court granted appellee\u2019s motion to quash. Appellant then filed a petition for allowance of appeal in this Court which was granted.\nAppellant contends that his appeal in the Superior Court which was filed within thirty days of the trial court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the person was a timely appeal and the Superior Court improperly granted appellee\u2019s motion to quash.\nAlthough not for the reasons presented by appellant we agree that his appeal from the July 12, 1978 order was timely filed.\nThe trial court\u2019s first order was not an appealable order under the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. These rules are quite specific in outlining that which constitutes an appealable order. The specificity provided in the rules seeks to avoid the kind of problem presented in this case.\nPa.R.A.P. 301(a) provides that:\n\u201c. . .no order of a court shall be appealable until it has been entered upon the appropriate docket in the lower court. . . . \u201d\nPa.R.A.P. 108(b) further provides that:\n\u201cThe date of entry of an order in a matter subject to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure shall be the day on which the clerk makes the notation in the docket that notice of entry of the order has been given as required by Pa.R.Civ.P. 236(b).\u201d\nUnder the above two rules an order is appealable only when it is \u201centered upon the appropriate docket\u201d and the \u201cdate of entry\u201d is the day that a notation is made in the docket that there has been compliance with Pa.R.Civ.P. 236(b) requiring notice. Pa.R.Civ.P. 236 states that:\n\u201c(a) The prothonotary shall immediately give written notice by ordinary mail of the entry of any order, decree or judgment: ... to each party who has appeared in the action or to the party\u2019s attorney of record.\n(b) The prothonotary shall note in the docket the giving of the notice and, when a judgment by confession is entered, the mailing of the required notice and documents.\u201d\nThus, an order is not appealable until (1) the order has been entered upon the appropriate docket, and (2) a notation appears in the docket that proper notice has been given concerning the entry of the order.\nIn the case before us, the following constitutes the only docket entry for the April 5, 1978 order by the trial judge:\n\u201cApril 21, 1978 \u2014 Order filed by the Court, Emanuel A. Cassematis, Judge (Vide Counsel Fees Order filed).\u201d\nThe above docket entry makes no reference to the issue of jurisdiction and even if it did, the docket does not contain any notation that notice of entry of the order was given as required by Pa.R.A.P. 108(b) and Pa.R.Civ.P. 236. We must therefore conclude that no appealable order existed on April 5, or April 21, and thus no appeal time began to run against the appellant.\nWe do not now decide whether the trial court correctly concluded that ancillary jurisdiction existed over appellant\u2019s person nor do we address the issues of whether appellant submitted to the jurisdiction of the court by answering on January 9, 1978, the merits of the petition for alimony pendente lite and counsel fees. These questions go to the merits of this appeal and must be determined in the first instance by the Superior Court.\nThe order of the Superior Court granting appellee\u2019s motion to quash is hereby vacated and this appeal is remanded to the Superior Court for consideration of the merits.\nROBERTS, J., concurs in the result.",
