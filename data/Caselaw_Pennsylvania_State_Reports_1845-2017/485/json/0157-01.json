        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nSince February, 1977, Mr. and Mrs. G. have raised D.H., now age five, and Mr. and Mrs. W. have raised R.H., now four. Each couple has filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County a petition to adopt the child in its custody for the past two years. In October, 1977, at the time hearings on the petitions to adopt were scheduled to begin, appellant, the natural mother of the proposed adoptees, filed petitions to vacate decrees entered in May, 1977 terminating her parental rights. Appellees, the Gs and the Ws, opposed the petitions. After evidentiary hearings, the orphans\u2019 court dismissed appellant\u2019s petitions to vacate. On these appeals, appellant argues that the evidence in support of her petitions is \u201cuncontroverted\u201d and that the orphans\u2019 court was required to grant relief. Our review satisfies us that appellant\u2019s claim is without merit and we affirm.\nI\nD.H. was born in July, 1973 and R.H. was born in September of the following year. Appellant, now 22, and her former husband, the natural father of both children, separated shortly after R.\u2019s birth. For over two years, neither appellant nor her former husband lived with or took care of the children. Instead, both children were raised by appellant\u2019s mother. Appellant\u2019s mother experienced difficulty raising the children, the Gs and the Ws expressed interest in adopting the children and, in February, 1977, appellant\u2019s mother, with appellant\u2019s knowledge, placed the children with appellees. Since placement, each couple has filed a report of intention to adopt under Section 331 of the Adoption Act of 1970.\nIn April, 1977, the Gs petitioned the orphans\u2019 court, under Section 311(1) of the Act, for a decree involuntarily terminating both natural parents\u2019 rights to D.H. There is no dispute that appellant and the natural father were served with notice of the proceedings. The natural father appeared at the hearing but appellant did not, and neither parent contested termination. Appellant\u2019s mother testified on behalf of the Gs. The orphans\u2019 court on May 3, 1977 entered the requested decree. No appeal was taken. The Gs, in accordance with Section 401 of the Act, subsequently filed their petition to adopt D.H.\nOn May 5, two days after the orphans\u2019 court entered its decree terminating appellant\u2019s rights to D.H., appellant filed a petition under section 302 of the Act for voluntary relinquishment of her parental rights to the other child, R.H. The orphans\u2019 court held a hearing and engaged appellant in a colloquy to determine appellant\u2019s understanding of the petition. Appellant acknowledged to the court that she was asking for termination of all of her parental rights to R.H., and that she made the request \u201cof [her] own free will and accord,\u201d without \u201cpressure,\u201d and \u201cvoluntarily.\u201d On May 25, 1977, the court entered a decree of termination granting appellant\u2019s petition for voluntary relinquishment and awarding custody of R.H. to the Ws. This decree also was not appealed. The Ws then filed their petition to adopt R.H., and included a request to terminate the parental rights of appellant\u2019s former husband under section 311(1).\nIn October, 1977, five months after the orphans\u2019 court entered its decrees of terminations, appellant filed her petitions to vacate the May decrees. Both petitions allege that appellant\u2019s physical and mental condition made her susceptible to the influence of her mother, that her testimony at the proceedings was not \u201ctrue and correct,\u201d and that she could not understand either the uncontested termination proceedings in which her rights to D.H. were terminated or the proceedings in which she voluntarily relinquished her rights to R.H. The. same court which conducted the voluntary relinquishment proceedings held several hearings on the petitions. Appellant, appellant\u2019s mother, and a psychologist testified in support of appellant\u2019s allegations. The court concluded that appellant \u201cchanged her mind\u201d and dismissed the petitions. The orphans\u2019 court en banc unanimously dismissed appellant\u2019s exceptions and these appeals followed.\nII\nAppellant contends that the evidence in support of her petitions to vacate obliged the orphans\u2019 court to grant relief. She now claims that the evidence establishes that her \u201cability to exercise independent judgment was vitiated.\u201d Appellant states that her mother \u201cdistorted] all of the information ... in order to promote the adoption and relieve herself of the problems of caring for [appellant] and [appellant\u2019s] children.\u201d Her mother\u2019s total dominance was, according to appellant, \u201cclearly stated by the psychologist and is apparent throughout the record.\u201d\nAppellant and the natural father had notice of the proceedings which led to termination of their parental rights to D.H., only the father appeared at the hearing, and neither natural parent contested termination. Moreover, appellant initiated and participated in the voluntary relinquishment proceedings leading to termination of her rights to R.H. Both decrees are final and, unless appellant first establishes her claim that she was subject to her mother\u2019s influence, she cannot obtain equitable relief. See e. g., Chambers Appeal, 452 Pa. 149, 305 A.2d 360 (1973); Restatement (Second) of Judgments Ch. 5, Intro, note (Tent. Draft No. 6, February 10, 1979).\nAppellant filed her petitions to vacate in October, 1977, at the time hearings on the prospective parents\u2019 petitions to adopt were to begin, and five months after the orphans\u2019 court entered its decrees of termination. Prospective parents who have, as here, initiated petitions to adopt, after natural parents have failed to appeal decrees of termination, are fully justified in relying upon the finality of the decrees. Upon entry of a final decree of termination, the prospective parent \u201cshall stand in loco parentis to the child and in such capacity shall have the authority, inter alia, to consent to marriage, to enlistment in the armed forces and to major medical, psychiatric and surgical treatment, and to exercise such other authority concerning the child as a natural parent could exercise.\u201d Adoption Act of 1970, \u00a7 321. See also id., \u00a7 501 (decree of adoption generally may not be entered unless adoptee has resided \u201cfor at least six months\u201d with party seeking to adopt); Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra at \u00a7 122 Comment f.\nThe orphans\u2019 court heard testimony that appellant was under stress and, in the view of a psychologist, would have in the alleged circumstances been likely to turn to \u201csomeone she is closely involved with.\u201d But the court also heard testimony that, during the period appellant claimed she was subject to her mother\u2019s influence and unable to exercise independent judgment, appellant was employed, was in good health, lived apart from her mother, procured a divorce, and did not submit to her mother\u2019s requests to care for the children. The orphans\u2019 court also had before it the transcript of the colloquy in which the same court, in May, 1977, heard appellant request voluntary relinquishment of her parental rights to R.H. \u201cof [her] own free will and accord,\u201d without \u201cpressure,\u201d and \u201cvoluntarily.\u201d\nIt is established that \u201cin reviewing the decision of the orphans\u2019 court, our task is to assure that the record is free from legal error and to determine if the chancellor\u2019s findings are supported by competent and adequate evidence, and are not predicated upon capricious disbelief of competent and credible evidence.\u201d Cohen Will, 445 Pa. 549, 550, 284 A.2d 754, 755 (1971). Accord, P. Adoption, 480 Pa. 79, 389 A.2d 94 (1978). In its capacity as finder of fact, the orphans\u2019 court found, based upon evidence it believed to be reliable and credible, that the evidence offered in support of appellant\u2019s petitions to vacate the final decrees of termination did not establish appellant\u2019s claim, but instead demonstrated only that five months after entry of the final decrees appellant \u201cchanged her mind.\u201d We must conclude, as did the Orphans\u2019 Court Division, that appellant has not met her substantial burden of proving the invalidity of the challenged decrees. As Reed v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 434 Pa. 212, 217, 253 A.2d 101, 104 (1969), stated, \u201c[t]his Court does not sit as a trier of issues of fact, expecting to be persuaded that one or the other side is more credible. That is only a task for a trial court and we would never invade that area of the judicial process.\u201d There is on this record no basis for disturbing the integrity of the May, 1977 decrees of termination.\nDecrees affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result.\n. Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, 1 P.S. \u00a7 331 (Supp.1978).\n. Section 311(1), 1 P.S. \u00a7 311(1), provides:\n\u201cThe rights of a parent in regard to a child may be terminated after a petition pursuant to section 312, and a hearing held pursuant to section 313, on the ground that:\n(1) The parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least six months either has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to a child, or has refused or failed to perform parental duties . . .\u201d\n. An officer testified that he served appellant one month before the scheduled hearing. Appellant claimed at the hearing on her petitions to vacate that she could not remember service. The orphans\u2019 court found service was made and appellant does not now dispute this finding.\nThe natural father is not a party to these proceedings.\n. Hearings on the Gs\u2019 and the Ws\u2019 petitions to adopt, scheduled to begin eighteen months ago, were postponed when appellant filed her petitions to vacate and have not been held.\n. Appellant may not, after the decrees of termination have become final, utilize her petitions to vacate merely to relitigate the propriety of termination. Under Section 321 of the Adoption Act of 1970, entry of a final decree of termination marks the end of a natural parent\u2019s involvement in adoption proceedings. Section 321 provides that \u201c[a] decree terminating all rights of a parent or a decree terminating all rights and duties of a parent entered by a court of competent jurisdiction shall extinguish the power or the right of such parent to object to or receive notice of adoption proceedings.\u201d No provision of the Adoption Act authorizes relitigation of the issues addressed in termination proceedings.\n. Comment f to Restatement (Second) \u00a7 122 observes:\n\u201cA judgment determining interests in property or status or establishing rights and obligations concerning future conduct . . is usually a base of reference for specific future plans and acts by the parties. In proportion as the plans and acts in reliance on the judgment are substantial in moment and prolonged in duration, they become considerations that ought to give stability to the judgment.\u201d",
