The seventh issue was not properly preserved in the trial court.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.",

        "text": "MANDERINO, Justice,\ndissenting.\nAppellant, Raul Correa, was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter stemming from the death of James Rogers on April 24, 1975. The testimony established that James Rogers offered to give appellant a ride from a liquor store in New Jersey to Philadelphia. Appellant ended up going to the victim\u2019s home to drink some beer. When the victim began a homosexual assault upon appellant, appellant beat the victim on the face and head and strangled him.\nThe majority affirms appellant\u2019s conviction in spite of the fact that appellant\u2019s request that he be tried by a judge in lieu of a jury was denied without any reasons being given. Before a jury was selected, appellant stated clearly and unequivocally that he wanted to be tried by a judge. The trial judge replied, \u201cI will not accept that.\u201d The trial judge gave no reasons for his denial at that time.\nLater, in his opinion written after appellant moved for a new trial, the trial judge did state reasons for his denial. None of the reasons given however has ever been recognized as a valid reason for denying appellant a choice given to other defendants. Whether an accused can proceed non-jury should not depend upon the trial judge deciding the request. Appellant was entitled to be tried non-jury.\nThe judgment of sentence should be reversed and appellant granted a new trial.",
