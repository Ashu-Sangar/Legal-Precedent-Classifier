On July 16, 1974, the Dolls filed an answer and counterclaim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The answer to the complaint <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>contended the right of way was a footpath of a width of not more than three feet and, therefore, not of sufficient width to accommodate motor vehicle use. Following the denial of preliminary motions, the chancellor conducted an evidentiary hearing and subsequently issued an adjudication and decree nisi. This decree nisi, dated July 3, 1975, was favorable to the Leases. The Dolls petitioned for a rehearing, and the chancellor opened the first decree nisi and conducted a second evidentiary hearing. On February 13, 1976, the chancellor issued a second adjudication and decree nisi which declared the right of way “to be of sufficient width to provide for reasonable and convenient travel by foot, but not of sufficient width to provide for access by motor vehicle.”</p>

The court en banc dismissed the exceptions and adopted the second decree nisi as a final decree. An appeal was taken to the Superior Court which affirmed the final decree. <em>Lease v.

Shortly thereafter, the original owner of the dominant tenement transferred her interest in the property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Although motor vehicles were in general use in 1952, the original owner of the Leases’ property did not own an automobile.

Further, since the sever<a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>anee of title, the owner of the servient land has occasionally cultivated the property in a manner which reserved only a footpath along the bank of the stream.</p>

This area was along the public road and west of the right of way. The owner’s actions resulted in an embankment defining the eastern edge of the parking area and limiting the area adjacent to the stream to a width of twelve to fourteen feet. The chancellor found this parking area was not constructed with the purpose of defining or limiting the right of way. At certain times of the year, wood pilings or “brush” were piled on the embankment to the parking area, and a portion of the area which could be used to travel to the dominant tenement was reduced to a footpath. The embankment and the “brush” were present and visible when the Leases and the Dolls acquired their respective tracts of land.</p>

The stones, which were intended to prepare the soft and damp ground for vehicular use, were dumped in the area adjacent to the stream and to a width sufficient for a motor vehicle to pass over. The Dolls halted the addition of the stones and constructed a fence on their property which effectively limited the right of way to a footpath.</p>

In ascertaining the scope of an easement created by an express grant, the intention of the parties to the grant must be advanced. See <em>Sigal v. Mfgrs.

The common owner of the two tracts of land and the original owner of the dominant tenement did not appear as witnesses in this case. However, persons who lived in the area at the time of the severance of title and who were familiar with the area did appear as witnesses. The only relevant facts<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> offered by these witnesses and considered by the chancellor are that, prior to and at the time of the severance of title, residents of the area used the western bank of the stream as a footpath for traveling between the public road bordering the Dolls’ property and a <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>public road located somewhat north of the Leases’ land; that the ground immediately adjacent to the stream is soft and damp; and, that the original owner of the dominant tenement did not own an automobile.

However, the grant of the easement fails to mention this prior use. It is reasonable to conclude that, had the parties intended to limit the easement to this prior use, they would have specified this limitation. See e. g., <em>Taylor v. Heffner, </em><a href="/pa/359/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="359 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="473148" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0157-01">359 Pa. 157</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%20450" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="58 A.2d 450">58 A.2d 450</a> (1948) (the words “as now used” were included in the grant and referred to the location of the easement). Also, the nature of the ground adjacent to the stream<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> and the original grantee’s lack of an automobile<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> do not limit the granted easement to pedestrian use. Although the two preceding facts were within the parties’ knowledge at the time of the grant, the parties also knew motor vehicles were in common use in 1952. The grant of the easement does not specifically exclude motor vehicle use. Clearly, an exclusion of such a commonly used means of transportation would be an unusual limitation. If the parties had intended such an unusual limitation, a reasonable inference is that they would have expressly stated the limitation in the grant creating the easement. Thus, the general and ambiguous language of the express grant is not clarified by reference to the attending circumstances known to the parties at the time of the grant. Therefore, while construing the instant easement in favor of the grantee, see <em>Hammond v. Hammond, </em>

Although the easement was rarely used for vehicular use in the past, such use would not unreasonably interfere with the use of the servient tenement by the Dolls. The easement, which runs parallel to one side of the Dolls’ land, provides the <em>only </em>means of ingress and egress onto the landlocked property of the Leases. Thus, without the right to use the easement for vehicular traffic, the Leases’ land, for all practical purposes, would be rendered useless. See <em>Piper. </em>Cf. <em>Soltis v.

Although we view the crucial issue in this case as the intended “use” of the right of way, we cannot ignore the chancellor’s emphasis on the “width.” The chancellor phrased the issue in this case as “whether the right-of-way is limited to the width required for a <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>footpath or is of sufficient width for vehicular traffic.” We conclude that the chancellor’s manner of phrasing the issue is of no moment and that we have properly stated the issue in terms of the intended “use” of the right of way. Although the chancellor emphasized the “width,” a review of the second adjudication and decree demonstrates that in determining the “width” the chancellor considered evidence relating to the “use.” Only after determining the intended “use” could the chancellor establish the “width” of the right of way. This approach complies with the general line of authorities.

The chancellor considered not only the facts available to the parties at the time the grant was made, i. e. those discussed in the text, but also erroneously considered the actions of the persons who held title to or resided on the respective properties after the common owner and the original owner of the dominant tenement. Based on the facts discussed in the text <em>and these subsequent actions, </em>the chancellor concluded the “ambiguity in the [grant of the easement] has been resolved by long standing use” and “the parties to the original transaction intended to' create a footpath when the 1952 deed was written and recorded.” In effect, the chancellor attributed to the parties to the original grant knowledge of facts and circumstances occurring after these same parties had conveyed their interests in the properties to other persons. Thus, the chancellor improperly determined the intention of the original parties. Only the attending circumstances known to the parties <em>at the time of the grant are </em>relevant when construing a grant of an easement. See <em>Merrill v. Mfgrs. Light and Heat Co., </em>supra.</p>

The majority of the Superior Court acknowledged the <em>Piper </em>decision, but ruled the decision was inapposite to the instant case. The majority reasoned the rationale of <em>Piper </em>is only applicable so long as the permitted use does not change the size or location of the easement. Here, although the grant did not specify the width of the easement, the majority, citing our decisions in <em>Taylor v. Heffner, </em>supra, and <em>Krauts’ Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/71/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="71 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="1031235" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0064-01">71 Pa. 64</a> (1872), concluded subsequent use of the easement established the width to be sufficient to accommodate only pedestrian use. Thus, the court ruled that permitting vehicular use would change the established width of the easement. We need not decide whether, when the width of an easement will be altered, the rationale of <em>Piper </em>is inapplicable.</p>

In the two cited cases, the limits of the easement were established by reference to the actions of the original parties. See <em>Taylor v. Heffner, </em>supra (reference to actions of common owner’s trustee); <em>Krauts’ Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/71/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="71 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="1031235" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0064-01">supra</a> (reference to actions of common owner and original grantee). Instantly, the Superior Court heavily relied upon the actions of persons who held title to or resided on the two properties after the original parties and concluded the established width of the easement was a footpath. The only relevant fact relating to the original parties and considered by the Superior Court was that the “original grantee did not own an automobile.” This fact, by itself, does not establish the width of the easement. Thus, the width of the easement is not specified in the grant nor is it determined by the actions of the parties.</p>
      <p id="b657-7" data-blocks='[["BL_657.2",657,[203,2084,1117,229]]]'>Since the width of the easement is unspecified, our application of the rationale in <em>Piper </em>does not change the pre-established width of the easement. Furthermore, when, as in the instant case, the width is unspecified, the easement is of such width as is suitable and convenient for its reasonable use, including vehicular use.
