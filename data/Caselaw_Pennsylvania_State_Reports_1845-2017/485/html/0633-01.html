To answer these questions we must first consider the factual setting in which the trial court concluded that the sanction of Rule 218 was properly invoked. On December 22, 1972, appellee, Dublin Sportswear, commenced suit in assumpsit in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County against Vincent Charlett and his business, the Arthur Robert School of Beauty Culture, for goods sold and delivered. The case was first placed on the jury trial list for April 3, 1975 but was not reached on that date.</p>

At the call of the list on Friday, November 7, both counsel responded that they were ready to proceed to trial on Monday at 10 a. m. On Monday morning, counsel agreed to expedite the jury selection by accepting the first twelve jurors. Counsel for appellant advised appellee’s counsel that he had to return to the Federal Court and the Juvenile Division of the Common Pleas Court on November 12 to honor prior commitments (November 11 was a legal holiday) and that if trial in the instant matter did not begin on November 10, that he would not be available until mid-morning on Thursday, November 13.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Upon being informed that appellant’s case would not be presented, Judge Barry took it upon himself to call appellant’s counsel at approximately 9:45 a. m. In that telephone conversation, appellant’s counsel advised Judge Barry of his commitments in Federal Court that day; following this conversation, Judge Barry informed plaintiff’s counsel of defense counsel’s position. After consulting with his client, appellee’s counsel told the court of his client’s wish to proceed with the trial. Shortly thereafter, trial proceeded ex parte. The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff. Judge Barry’s decision to proceed to trial on November 12, in the absence of appellant, his witnesses (if any) and his counsel, was first discovered by appellant’s counsel on Thursday morning when he appeared ready for trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The rule provides that we must assess the exercise of the discretion by deciding whether the delinquent party’s unavailability was with or without “satisfactory excuse being made known to the court.” As a general rule a previous court commitment of. an attorney which requires his presence before another tribunal, if made known to the court before which a continuance or an extension is sought, would constitute a “satisfactory excuse” within the meaning of Rule 218. <em>See Budget Laundry Co. v.

Thus, it was reversible error for the trial court to proceed ex parte.</p>
