She had brought with her various clothing for William Hinson in an airline-type bag. Also in the bag was a .38 caliber revolver brought pursuant to William’s directions. William Hinson had demonstrated a fear for his personal safety while in the hospital and had requested the appellee to bring the weapon to his hospital room almost daily during his stay. On at least one occasion the decedent had kept the revolver in his room overnight. Upon entering the hospital room at approximately 7:30 p. m., the decedent verbally abused the appellee, grabbed her around the throat and punched her once in the face. After being struck the appellee pulled the gun out of the bag of clothing and fired six rounds into the decedent. William Hinson was pronounced dead within the half-hour, suffering wounds of the head, neck, chest and arm. The appellee left the room within minutes of firing the shots and fainted in the hospital hallway. Expert testimony established that the appellee fired the gun. The gun had a pull test pressure of 11 to IIV2 pounds when fired as a double action weapon and was probably fired exactly six times.</p>

Where the proof goes to the higher inclusive offense and would not justify any other verdict except a conviction of that offense or an acquittal, it would be improper to instruct the jury with respect to included offenses. See e. g. <em>State v. Sandoval, </em><a href="/nm/59/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="59 N.M. 85" data-case-ids="1589290" data-case-paths="/nm/59/0085-01">59 N.M. 85</a>, <a href="/nm/59/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="59 N.M. 85" data-case-ids="1589290" data-case-paths="/nm/59/0085-01">279 P.2d 850</a> (1955). Instructions with respect to included offenses in such cases might well be an invitation to the jury to return a compromise or otherwise unwarranted verdict. Cf. <em>People v. Mussenden, </em><a href="/ny/308/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="308 N.Y. 558" data-case-ids="2236587" data-case-paths="/ny/308/0558-01">308 N.Y. 558</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20N.E.2d%20551" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="127 N.E.2d 551">127 N.E.2d 551</a> (1955); <em>Commonwealth v.

The submission of an included crime is justified only where there is some basis in the evidence for finding the defendant innocent of the crime charged and yet guilty of the included crime. <em>People v. Mussenden, supra. </em>The presence of such evidence is the determinative factor. For example, if the prosecutor’s evidence tends to show a completed robbery and there is no conflicting evidence relating to elements of the crime charged, a contention that the jury might accept the prosecution’s evidence in part and might reject it in part ought not to be sufficient. See <em>State v.
