    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[190,408,1150,515]]]'>Appellant, Leroy Taylor, was convicted of possession of an instrument of crime and of murder of the third degree on October 28, 1976, after a nonjury trial for the fatal shooting of his neighbor, Gerald Harmon. Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than one nor more than five years on the possession charge. Appellant was sentenced to a consecutive term of not less than five nor more than twenty years in prison on the murder charge. Post-verdict motions were denied, and this direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b279-6" data-blocks='[["BL_279.6",279,[191,940,1150,251]]]'>Appellant raises only one issue, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Specifically, appellant contends that the prosecution failed to prove that appellant did not act in self-defense. We have reviewed the record and conclude that appellant’s claim is without merit.</p>
    <p id="b279-7" data-blocks='[["BL_279.7",279,[233,1211,613,41]]]'>Judgment of sentence affirmed.</p>
