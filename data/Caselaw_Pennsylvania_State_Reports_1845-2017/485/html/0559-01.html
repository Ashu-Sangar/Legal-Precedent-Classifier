Indeed, Section 523 applies not merely to the Department of Property and Supplies, but to “any administrative department, board, or commission.” It must also be recognized that application of Section 523 has a direct impact upon parties from another state lawfully seeking to engage in interstate commerce. Special care must be taken to assure that Section 523 as administered does not unreasonably infringe upon lawful interstate conduct. See e. g., <em>Hicklin v.

In <em>Winter, </em>the City of Philadelphia twice rejected the lowest bids on a public contract and re-advertised for new bids. Each disappointed bidder moved in equity to bar further bidding, each was denied relief, and this Court affirmed. <em>Winter </em>held the bidders lacked standing, but also observed that “if the officials of the City, in the exercise of their discretion, decide that it is in the best interest of the City to reject all bids and to re-advertise for new bids, the City has the power to do so, absent any fraud [or] collusion motivating such action.” 414 Pa. at 345, 200 A.2d at 302. <em>Weber v.

Even if the observation of <em>Winter </em>were to be accepted, <em>Schuck, Pearlman, </em>and <em>Kratz </em>demonstrate that it is one thing, as in <em>Winter, </em>to refuse all bids and a vastly different thing, as here, to award the contract to a party other than the lowest responsible bidder. Indeed, <em>Winter </em>reaffirms <em>Kratz </em>and <em>Pearlman. </em>414 Pa. at 345, 200 A.2d at 303. Accordingly, it must be apparent that a procedure which permits judicial review of the Department’s interpretation of Section 523 is to be preferred over the appellees’ claim that only “fraud or collusion” may be reviewed and that all other departmental interpretations, even if inconsistent or erroneous, may not be disturbed.</p>

Moreover, it cannot be forgotten that Section 523 imposes a sanction against parties from another state lawfully seeking to engage in interstate trade. We know of no federal legislation, and none has been cited, which would curtail the Legislature’s power to impose “reciprocal limitations” and thus limit the scope of Section 523. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(3).

The interpretation of Section 523 we adopt is in greater harmony with the above considerations than an interpretation that Section 523 was designed to prohibit all commerce between the Commonwealth and bidders from states which bar some out-of-state bidders. Unlike the latter interpretation, the interpretation we adopt limits the possibility of retaliation, imposes far less a sanction upon those lawfully engaged in interstate commerce, and does not hinder this Commonwealth’s commitment to the policy of awarding contracts to <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>the “lowest responsible bidder.” Lutz’s present claim states a cause of action and the demurrer may not be sustained.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Nothing in Section 2410 or any other provision of the Administrative Code of 1929 provides “otherwise.” Section 2410 merely directs the Auditor General’s “approval” of the award. It is the same “approval” the Governor and Treasurer are to give the <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>award and there is nothing to indicate that this “approval” requires an inquiry into the financial nature of the transaction.
