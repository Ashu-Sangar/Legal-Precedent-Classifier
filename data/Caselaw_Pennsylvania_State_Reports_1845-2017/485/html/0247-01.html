An appeal on the merits from a summary conviction before a minor court could be taken only to the court of quarter sessions where the case would be heard <em>de novo, </em>but conversely, that court was without power to review any matter within the scope of a writ of certiorari, i. e., the technical regularity of the proceedings below. <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus whether a party aggrieved by a minor court’s summary conviction wishes to proceed either by petitioning for certiorari or by taking a general appeal, he seeks his remedy in the court of common pleas; jurisdictional restraints upon the former common pleas court under the old system no longer exist. The court of common pleas, as reconstituted, possesses the jurisdictions of the former courts of common pleas, courts of quarter sessions, courts of oyer and terminer, orphans’ courts, and juvenile courts. One of the purposes of the unified court is, of course, to simplify procedure and remove archaisms from the judicial system. A case may not be dismissed because brought in the wrong court; if the matter is justiciable, there is jurisdiction in the court of common pleas to hear it, and in a multi-division court the remedy for bringing the <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>case in the wrong division is not a dismissal, but a transfer of the matter to the correct division.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>
