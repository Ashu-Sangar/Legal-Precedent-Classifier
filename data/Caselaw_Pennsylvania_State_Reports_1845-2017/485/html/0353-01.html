Although Mr. Felix testified that in certain instances he might have tried the case differently than trial counsel, after reviewing the testimony he concluded that, in the totality of the case, trial counsel had not been ineffective in not objecting to the closing remarks (n.t. 12). He noted that trial counsel had objected to other portions of the summation (n.t. 9-10); that constant objection may lead to resentment of defense counsel by the jury, to the detriment of the defendant (n.t. 13); that objection might highlight the remarks (n.t. 13); that trial counsel’s tactics could be grasped by review of the record (n.t. 16); and that trial counsel’s failure to object at that stage appeared to be a chosen strategy (n.t. 22, 27).</blockquote>

He further testified that if he had asked for and received a mistrial, “we would have lost the best chance we ever had at that point in time of ever getting whatever favorable verdict a jury might give us, and that a second go-around would have been a disaster in view of the entire case as it finally developed.” (n.t. 40). Mr. Fierro elaborated on this statement later when he said that in view of the Commonwealth’s rebuttal testimony “the Commonwealth could have fairly destroyed the defense even before it made an offer of defense in the next go-around”, and that defendant still had enough credibility left before this jury to get “a more favorable response” from it (n.t. 43).

This case should be remanded for a new trial, just as it should have been twenty-nine months ago.</p>
