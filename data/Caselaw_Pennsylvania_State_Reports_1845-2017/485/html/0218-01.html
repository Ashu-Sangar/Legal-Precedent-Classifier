We find no abuse of discretion and, therefore, affirm the decree.</p>

Baker. The trust was to be administered by The Union National Bank of Pittsburgh (the corpo<a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>rate trustee) and an individual named Edward L. Stockdale.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The trust was to continue during the lifetime of Mrs. Baker, who died on May 4, 1963, and then for the life of her son by a previous marriage, Garrett B. LeVan. At Mr. LeVan’s death on February 16, 1976, the trust corpus was to be distributed to his issue, per stirpes, (namely his four children, all of whom survived him).</p>
    <p id="b252-4" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[233,672,1157,466]]]'>At the time that assets were transferred from Mr. Baker’s estate to the trustee on December 18, 1950 (the starting date of the trust’s administration), their value was approximately $1,041,000.00. At the termination of said trust, on February 16, 1976, the assets were valued at approximately $2,090,-000.00, or an increase in market value of approximately $1,050,000.00. Over the approximately twenty-five years of the trust’s administration, it generated over two million dollars in income.</p>

Shown in this account as chargeable against the trust’s principal was a fee balance due the trustees’ attorney, appellee, in the amount of $34,800.00. The remaindermen appellants, (children of Garrett B. LeVan) filed exceptions to the proposed schedule of distribution stating that the attorney’s fees were excessively high, and further amended exceptions were filed alleging, inter alia, that the attorney for the trustees had been compensated previously for services rendered. After an evidentiary hearing, the entry of a decree nisi, and consideration and denial of exceptions to that decree, the chancellor entered a final decree awarding $32,255.47 to appellee for legal services rendered to the trust during its duration.</p>

From this contention, appellants then argue that because this securities matter was by far the most difficult issue confronted by appellee during its representation of the trust, the remaining services rendered by appellee were routine and thus not significant enough to support an award of over thirty thousand dollars in counsel fees. The simple response to this argument is that appellants have misread the record and the opinion sur exception, which, taken together, make it clear that the 1958 disbursement to appellee (as well as similar disbursements in 1970 and 1976) was an interim <em>partial </em>payment, in no way intended to constitute <em>full </em>compensation for legal services rendered to the date of the disbursements.
