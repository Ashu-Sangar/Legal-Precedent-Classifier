Appellee, Provident National Bank (Provident), presented for probate a document which was handwritten on a printed will form. The trial court in the matter before us described this document as one written “in a confused and haphazard manner.” The document contained writing after the signa<a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>ture and contained writing in a vertical direction in the margins. When the handwritten document was presented for probate, Provident also submitted a typed “copy” of the document. Unlike the handwritten document, all the provisions in the typed copy appeared in an orderly fashion with the decedent’s signature at the end thereof. This typed copy is referred to in the record as a “copy fair.” Provident was granted letters of administration and proceeded to administer the estate. On May 9, 1975, the trial court’s adjudication confirming Provident’s first and final account was made absolute and distribution proceeded in accordance with the court’s decree.</p>

The trial court considered the fraud argument but dismissed the petition nonetheless stating that “a mere allegation is not sufficient” and further stating “the charge of fraud is merely an unsupported declaration.”</p>

On the other hand, neither a petition nor any other pleading alleging fraud is required to contain in detail all of the evidence in advance of its development during a hearing. The above petition contains more than a mere allegation of fraud. The petition and the reasonable inferences contained therein allege that the appellee when it presented the handwritten document to the register also presented “fair copy” (typed copy) which was different from the original. The petition alleges that the original was not signed at the end thereof but the submitted “fair copy” indicated a signature at the end thereof. The petition further alleges that fraudulent representations were made to the trial court which resulted in the court’s approval of the account on the basis of the “fair copy” which was different from the original.</p>

This is not the issue now before us. Appellant is entitled to his day in court on the issue of fraud. From the record before us, there is no evidence concerning the practice of using a “copy fair.” (The parties interchangeably use “copy fair” and “fair copy.”) Although this Court was given some information during oral argument about the local practice, this cannot be a substitute for testimony taken under oath during a hearing. Moreover, the record is silent concerning the specific use made of the “copy fair.” We do not know whether the probate records would reasonably alert a searcher. We do not know whether the trial court had before it the original will or only the typed copy. We do not know whether persons entitled to legal notice during the administration of the estate had any way of knowing that the original existed or that it was different from the typed copy.

Where, as here, appellant has had timely notice and every opportunity prior to distribution, to inspect the probate record in its entirety, and compare all the relevant documents, and to challenge both the decree of probate and the schedule of proposed distribution at both the trial and appellate levels, appellant’s allegation of fraud cannot be sustained.</p>

It is the statutory duty of the Register of Wills to determine which documents, and portions of documents, constitute a decedent’s testamentary writing. 20 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 901 et seq.; <em>Rockett Will, </em><a href="/pa/348/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="348 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="1220310" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0445-01">348 Pa. 445</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%20303" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="35 A.2d 303">35 A.2d 303</a> (1944). At argument, this Court was advised that in Philadelphia, it is the procedure of the Register of Wills to direct preparation of a copy of a handwritten testamentary instrument, which copy includes the writing which the Register deems constitutes decedent’s will. Such a copy, adopted by the Register, is probated along with the handwritten instrument and, once admitted to probate, is called a “copy fair.” The Register routinely requests a party offering a handwritten instrument for probate to submit a proposed “copy fair” of that instrument. See generally, Walsh, <em>Copy Fair &amp; The Register of Wills, </em>36 Temp.L.Q. 311 (1963), Aker, Pennsylvania Probate &amp; Interpretation of Wills § 3.14A. Here, the administrator submitted its proposed “copy fair,” to the Register at the time it offered the handwritten instrument for probate. Appellant had notice and the opportunity to challenge the probate and accounting at the trial and appellate levels, but did not do so until nearly one year after final distribution.</p>
