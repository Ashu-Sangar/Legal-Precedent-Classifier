Prior to trial, the court denied appellant’s motion to suppress a signed statement in which appellant admitted responsibility for the incident. Appellant was tried before a jury and was convicted of conspiracy, robbery, and murder of the third degree. Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to three terms of imprisonment of ten to twenty years. The robbery term was to run consecutive with the murder term, and the conspiracy term was to run concurrent with the robbery term. This direct appeal followed. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. II, § 202(1), 17 P.S. § 211.202(1). For the reasons stated, we affirm.</p>

Furthermore, the post-mortem examination revealed that the victim had “ ‘evidence of long-standing disease of the coronary arteries’ and ‘evidence of old scarring in the heart from previous heart attacks, previous myocardial infarctions.’ ” By contrast, in the instant case, the medical witness testified that even though pneumonia was the terminal event, that did not alter his opinion that the “cause of death [was] due to multiple injuries, complicated by the pneumonia, but for the injuries, the patient wouldn’t have been hospitalized and wouldn’t have developed the pneumonia and would not have died.” The evidence was sufficient in this case to prove <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>causation beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The other three friends trailed along at some distance behind. One of the three left the group before anything happened. The other two, however, testified that they witnessed the incident. Their combined testimony established that appellant and his companion acting together snatched the victim’s pocketbook, knocked her down, hit her in the face and kicked her.

    <p id="b626-7" data-blocks='[["BL_626.7",626,[251,1921,1153,88]]]'>Applying this standard, the following facts are established:</p>
    <p id="b626-8" data-blocks='[["BL_626.8",626,[250,2040,1154,259]],["BL_627.1",627,[177,276,1148,1165]]]'>Appellant was arrested on March 17, 1976, at approximately 4:35 a. m., at his parents’ home without a warrant for an assault and robbery involving the victim. At that time, appellant was eighteen years of age. Appellant was advised of the charges against him and also was advised of <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Appellant was then transported to the police administration building where he arrived ten minutes later. Upon appellant’s arrival at this building, he was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and of his constitutional rights by Detective Michael Chitwood. Appellant then told Detective Chitwood that he had been informed of his constitutional rights and also that he understood them. Appellant added that he did not want to exercise his constitutional rights. Appellant then said that he wanted to give a statement to the police. Detective Chitwood was relieved at 5:23 a. m., by Detective Brian Muldoon who interviewed appellant. Detective Muldoon was told by Detective Chitwood that appellant was advised of his constitutional rights and was shown the interview sheet which appellant signed waiving those rights before he resumed the questioning. From 5:23 a. m. to 6:50 a. m., that same morning, appellant gave the statement which he has challenged. During appellant’s interview, appellant did not display any signs of physical impairment nor did appellant appear to be under the influence of drugs or medicine. Appellant was not subjected to physical or psychological coercion or overbearing by the police.</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.4",627,[174,1462,1149,577]]]'>Appellant was rearrested and charged with Genevieve Meier’s murder after the victim died. However, the second statement elicited from appellant at this time, which was with some minor exceptions the same as appellant’s first statement, was ordered suppressed by the court. From the record, it appears that the suppression court suppressed the second statement because the police did not notify appellant’s attorney that he was being questioned after appellant’s initial arrest. This appeal, however, only involves the admissibility of the first statement. At no time has appellant challenged the lawfulness of his arrest.</p>
    <p id="b627-6" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[173,2065,1148,248]]]'>Appellant contends that the content of the statement was not his. The prosecution’s evidence however established that the statement was given by appellant. The issue is one of credibility and there is no basis to disturb the factfinder’s resolution of the issue.</p>
    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.3",628,[250,267,1153,466]]]'>
      <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>The same can be said concerning appellant’s argument that one of the detectives broke a tooth in his mouth, as a result of which he was seen by a dentist several weeks later at the detention center. The prosecution’s evidence was in direct contradiction to appellant’s. Moreover, defense counsel and the prosecution stipulated that the records of the detention center did not indicate that any treatment had been given to appellant. The credibility matter was for the factfinder to resolve.</p>
    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[250,775,1154,314]]]'>At the time of his arrest appellant had completed the eleventh grade, was eighteen years of age, and was in sound physical and mental condition. Under these circumstances, there is no basis for concluding, as a matter of law, that appellant’s waiver and his statement were not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily given.</p>
    <p id="b628-6" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[293,1111,614,43]]]'>Judgment of sentence affirmed.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b628-7" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[251,1214,1152,90]]]'>EAGEN, C. J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>
