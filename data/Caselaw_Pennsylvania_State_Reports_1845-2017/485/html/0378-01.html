After Emily Lesko’s death, the executors sold the homestead to Robert Burch on November 22, 1974 for $8,500. On February 25, 1975, the surviving heirs of Joseph B. Katkowski, a devisee under decedent’s will, filed objections to the final accounting of decedent’s estate claiming that the executors were negligent in failing to perform their duties imposed under the will, i. e., to inspect the premises and order necessary repairs which would be paid for by the tenant, Emily Lesko; said repairs inuring to the benefit of the estate. Following a hearing on the matter, the lower court found that the executors had been negligent, surcharged appellant (surviving executor) $6,500 and denied appellant his executor’s commission <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>($300.00).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant’s exceptions to this adjudication were dismissed and he now appeals to this court.</p>

More importantly, however, there is no evidence that Laubach or his wife directed the occupants to make repairs, although the need therefore was quite apparent. Laubach admitted that the house needed rewiring and that the bathroom floor, which he never inspected, was rotted. Burch, the purchaser, on the other hand detailed (N.T. pp. 59 through 70) many of the house’s deficiencies ranging from a garage roof which had collapsed because the joists <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>had rotted through to chimney bricks which needed repainting, window frames which had rotted, warped and became incapable of holding paint, metal roofing which needed paint, exterior woodwork in need of paint, ceilings in dining room and front bedroom which needed repair, the bathroom floor which needed to be replaced, cellar drains which needed unblocking and interior electrical wiring which needed to be replaced in its entirety. Failure to bring these conditions to the attention of the occupants or to sell the house within thirty days after such notice certainly represented a failure on the part of the fiduciaries to perform the duties imposed upon them by the provisions of decedent’s will as well as a failure to conform to the standard of conduct required of fiduciaries by the law of this Commonwealth.</blockquote>
