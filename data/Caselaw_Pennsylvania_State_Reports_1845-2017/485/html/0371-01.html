May further testified that he did not question the trial judge during the guilty plea colloquy when he was informed <em>on the record </em>that a judgment of sentence of life imprisonment on the murder conviction and a concurrent judgment of sentence of ten to twenty years imprisonment on the robbery conviction would be imposed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> because “. . . everytime before [he] answered [he] looked at [his] counselor . . . and ... received a nod to say, yes, or . . .to say, no.
