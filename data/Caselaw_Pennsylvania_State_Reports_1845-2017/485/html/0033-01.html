On April 10, 1968, Butchkosky and his wife submitted a written offer to the brokers to purchase the Motel for $900,000 in installments of $5,000 or more per month for a minimum of $100,000 per year. The balance of the purchase price, including interest, was to be paid on or before May 1, 1978. The bank rejected this offer.</p>

This time they proposed to <em>rent </em>the property for ten years, paying a total rental of $480,000 in monthly installments of $4,000. The Lease Agreement executed by the Bank and the Butchkoskys on January 24, 1969 included these terms and gave the Butchkoskys an option to purchase the property for $900,000 which allowed some credit on the rental payments towards this purchase price.</p>

The brokers argue that since the Lease Agreement was entered into during the time they were the exclusive brokers of the property and, since the lessees did eventually purchase the property pursuant to <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>the option in the lease, the brokers are entitled to their commission.</p>
    <p id="b69-5" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[186,420,1147,840]]]'>The fundamental error in the brokers’ argument is their characterization of the 1977 sale of the property as the exercise of the option to purchase on the part of the Butchkoskys. The lower court, after hearing all the evidence, found as a matter of fact that the 1977 sales agreement was an entirely new agreement between the Bank and the Butchkoskys, one that did not partake of the previous Lease Agreement. In reviewing a decree of the Orphans’ Court Division, the appellate court must accord great weight to the findings of fact made by the trial court, which saw and heard the witnesses. “Those findings of fact are conclusive if there is sufficient evidence to support them and if they are not based on a capricious disbelief of the witnesses.” <em>In re Estate of Hain, </em><a href="/pa/464/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="464 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1710375" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0349-01">464 Pa. 349</a>, 354, <a href="/pa/464/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="464 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1710375" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0349-01">346 A.2d 774</a>, 776 (1975) (citations omitted); <em>Billinger Estate, </em><a href="/pa/451/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="451 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="1948596" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0077-01">451 Pa. 77</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20795" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="301 A.2d 795">301 A.2d 795</a> (1973).</p>
    <p id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[183,1285,1148,523]]]'>The Butchkoskys clearly despaired of operating the property profitably and attempted to give up the business. The Bank was not interested in operating a failing motel, so when it failed to find a replacement for the Butchkoskys, it decided to rid itself of its “white elephant” and sell it outright to the Butchkoskys at the best offer available. Under these circumstances, we agree with the lower court that the brokers had failed to prove that the purchase was made under the option between the parties that was drawn up while the Listing Contract was in effect.</p>

In that case, a tenant under a written lease providing for an option to purchase the leased premises bought an outstanding mortgage antedating the lease, issued execution thereon upon default, and purchased the property at a sheriff’s sale at a lesser price than that set forth in the purchase option. We rejected the lessor’s claim that the lessee had in effect exercised its option to purchase <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>the property, citing favorably <em>Miller v. Hays &amp; McCrea, </em><a href="/pa-super/71/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="71 Pa. Super. 523" data-case-ids="638124" data-case-paths="/pa-super/71/0523-01">71 Pa.Super. 523</a> (1919). In <em>Miller, </em>a real estate broker who had effected a lease of certain property with an option to purchase on the part of the lessee, was held not entitled to a commission for the subsequent sale of the same property to the same lessee because the purchase was not consumated under the terms of the option. In a factual setting quite similar to that now before us, the court in <em>Miller </em>said it was immaterial that the lessee later purchased the property at the same price as that set forth in the option, because the final sale was the result of an entirely new agreement and not the exercise of the original option.</p>
    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[250,957,1156,842]]]'>The brokers in the instant case seize upon the fact that the ultimate purchase price was lesser than that set forth in the option, as the controlling factor in the trial court’s decision. In this they are mistaken. From a reading of the trial court’s opinion, it is clear that it thought the controlling factor was the fact that the Lease Agreement had been terminated and voided and a new, independent sales agreement executed in 1977. The fact that the ultimate sale was at a lesser price was a proper consideration in determining whether the 1977 sales agreement was in fact independent of the Lease Agreement, but the price reduction alone was not controlling. Other factors considered by the court were, for example, the unwillingness of the bank to operate the Motel; the bank’s inability to find a tenant, buyer, or manager to replace the Butchkoskys; and the general economic condition of the geographic area.</p>
    <p id="b70-6" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[247,1822,1156,525]],["BL_71.1",71,[196,319,1148,411]]]'>The brokers spend a good portion of their brief raising the specter of innocent real estate brokers being victimized by unscrupulous land owners who have given tenants options to purchase the rented property, and who then enter into new agreements in order to cheat the broker out of his commission upon the sale of the property to the lessee. Yet, as the court below noted, the brokers before us failed to allege any bad faith or intent to defraud on the part of either the Bank or the Butchkoskys in scrapping the Lease Agreement and executing a new and independent <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>sales agreement in 1977. In the brief submitted to this Court, the brokers specifically decline to intimate that there was any collusion between the Bank and the Butchkoskys to avoid the option agreement so as to deprive the brokers of their commission. Absent an allegation of such bad faith and facts indicating an intent to defraud the brokers of their commission, we are satisfied that the decree of the lower court was correct.</p>

Since the parties entered into a <em>new </em>agreement, the majority holds, the brokers are no longer entitled to their commission. This result puts a burden of proof upon brokers which is impossible to sustain. Anytime sellers and buyers agree on a price, other than the original selling price, a “new” agreement must be drawn up. This “new” agreement does not remove any rights of a broker to his or her commission.

The disparity between the purchase price of two agreements is not so great as to create a presumption against the broker.
