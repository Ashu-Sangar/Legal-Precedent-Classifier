On April 5, 1977, appellant filed an application for continuance, alleging that further medical and psychological testing was necessary to prepare his defense.

He was committed to Mayview State Hospital for a period not to exceed sixty days for further psychological testing.</p>

Prior to commencement of trial on September 12, appellant orally moved for a dismissal of the charges because of an alleged violation of Rule 1100. The trial court denied the motion and the case proceeded to trial.</p>
    <p id="b489-6" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[187,1013,1145,95]]]'>We believe appellant was properly tried in accordance with Rule 1100. As a portion of the rule states:</p>

Such application shall be granted only if trial cannot be commenced within the prescribed period despite due diligence by the Commonwealth. <em>Any order granting such application shall specify the date or period within which trial shall be commenced.” </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(c) (Emphasis added.)</p>

The court below agreed with the Commonwealth and ordered that trial be held on July 11, 1977, but not later than September 12, 1977. Appellant’s trial did, in fact, commence on September 12. Thus, if the court properly granted the Commonwealth’s petition for extension of time, appellant was tried in compliance with Rule 1100.</p>

After the continuance was granted, it was impossible to bring appellant to trial within 180 days, so the court below properly granted the petition for extension of time. In the order, the court held that trial was to commence “no later than September 12, 1977.” As appellant’s trial was commenced within the time called for in the order extending time for trial, we find no violation of appellant’s Rule 1100 rights.</p>

He first argues that the Juvenile Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> by excluding the crime of murder from the original jurisdiction of juvenile court, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He further contends that the act, by failing to include adequate standards as to when a juvenile murder case may be transferred to juvenile court, denies him due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellant finally argues that he presented sufficient evidence to require the court to transfer the case to juvenile court. We find no merit in any of these arguments.</p>

[H]is father wouldn’t go in the room with the kid. I mean I couldn’t understand it.”</p>

The detective was forced to shuttle back and forth between the interrogation room and the room where appellant’s father was throughout the questioning. The detective testified to the following sequence of events. At 7:28, when appellant was advised of his constitutional rights by the detective, appellant’s father was not present. The detective left appellant at 7:39 and advised the father that appellant was a suspect. At 7:41, appellant’s father returned with the detective and told appellant to tell the truth. This instruction was given by the father to his son, without any attempt to ascertain his son’s version of the events and without ascertaining in what manner the son might be implicated by discussing the case at this point. Appellant’s father then again left his son alone with the detective. Appellant told the detective there were things he didn’t want his father to know and tried to get the detective <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>to promise not to tell him. At 7:48, the detective left the room and told appellant’s father that his son didn’t want him to know certain things. The father replied by saying that it would all come out in court anyway. The detective returned to the interrogation room at 7:51 and continued his questioning. At 7:54, he left the room and asked appellant’s father if appellant would cover up for someone, to which the father replied either “no” or that he didn’t know. At 7:56, the detective returned to the interrogation room, and, during his questioning, appellant orally admitted to committing the murder. The detective left the room at 8:06 and told the father that appellant had confessed. Upon the detective’s return to the interrogation room at 8:15, he found appellant writing a poem on a piece of paper. The detective asked him to write his version of the murder, to which appellant agreed. The detective again left the room and when he returned, appellant had written out his confession. This confession was later entered against him.</p>
    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[247,1303,1157,1017]]]'>The detective’s testimony clearly shows that appellant’s father was insufficiently interested in appellant’s legal interests and that appellant was denied the kind of consultation with an adult that is a prerequisite to a' valid waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. It is difficult to understand how the juvenile’s rights could be properly safeguarded by an adult who refused to be in the same room with the juvenile during the interrogation and where the rapport between the two was obviously strained. <em>While it is always an appropriate admonition to tell the truth to one who has made an informed decision to give a statement, that was not the question that the consultation was designed to consider. Rather, the question was the advisability of the accused’s participation in a custodial interrogation. </em>It is clear that the father in this instance made no attempt to seek from his son the necessary information required to make an intelligent judgment as to this question. Absent such information, he was clearly not equipped to provide the guidance that the rule envisions.</p>
