    <p id="b401-11" data-blocks='[["BL_401.11",401,[186,1568,1149,473]]]'>In late 1977 and early 1978, appellant, then sixteen years old, was charged in two separate juvenile petitions, one charging aggravated assault and the other charging robbery, aggravated assault and various weapons offenses. Following notification by the Commonwealth that it intended to try appellant as an adult, a certification hearing was held in family division of the court of common pleas pursuant to § 28 of the Juvenile Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Following the hearing, the court certified that appellant be tried as an adult.</p>

Subsequently appellant filed a <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>motion to reconsider the application to quash. The court failed to reach the merits of appellant’s claim, holding that it had no authority to review a decision of a judge from another division of the same court of common pleas. Believing the case involved a controlling question of law, the court certified the case for interlocutory appeal. While the Superior Court denied permission to appeal, this court, on November 28, 1978, granted permission to appeal and retained jurisdiction of the case.</p>

Later, a second judge took new testimony on the suppression issue, which the <em>Wheeler </em>court determined to be a proper exercise of discretion. However, the court ruled that where the evidence was substantially the same as that originally ruled upon, the second judge was in effect reviewing the original order when he issued a subsequent one. That, the court held, was an abuse of discretion. Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa/428/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="428 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="1912410" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0131-01">428 Pa. 131</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20772" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="236 A.2d 772">236 A.2d 772</a> (1968), the court noted, ‘We impliedly held in <em>Commonwealth v.

The underlying basis of the rule is no less applicable in the instant situation, wherein the interlocutory order concerns Rule 1100 rather than suppression. Absent some new evidence, it is improper for a trial judge to overrule an interlocutory order by another judge of the same court in the same case. There must be some degree of finality to determinations of all pre-trial applications so that judicial economy and efficiency can be maintained.”</blockquote>
