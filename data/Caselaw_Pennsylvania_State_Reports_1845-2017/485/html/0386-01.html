Prior to argument of that appeal, appellant filed a post-conviction petition, challenging the effectiveness of trial counsel. At request of counsel, this court remanded the matter for an evidentiary hearing on the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. After a hearing, the court of common pleas determined that trial counsel provided effective representation and the record was returned to this court to dispose of all claims of error, including the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. This court, in <em>Commonwealth v.

On May 11, the court of common pleas denied the petition without an evidentiary hearing. This appeal followed.</p>
