    <p id="b631-6" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[151,405,1148,456]]]'>Appellant, Donald Irving, was convicted of murder of the third degree, conspiracy and possessing instruments of crime in a nonjury trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. The charges against Irving arose from the shooting death of Hattie Jones inside her residence on February 13, 1975. In this appeal, Irving challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding of guilt of murder and the evidentiary use of an incriminating statement he gave to the police following his arrest.</p>
    <p id="b631-7" data-blocks='[["BL_631.6",631,[145,880,1153,1440]]]'>Irving maintains his statement should have been suppressed since it was tainted by his illegal arrest made pursuant to a defective state warrant. The Commonwealth’s evidence established the following facts pertinent to this claim: Donald Irving and Roy Holloway went to the residence of Hattie Jones on February 12, 1975 to purchase marijuana. They were met at the door and admitted by a roomer, Judson Washington. Washington also let Irving and Holloway out of the house on that date. The next day, February 13, 1976, the same two men returned to collect money Holloway claimed Hattie Jones owed him, and they were again admitted by Washington. They followed Washington up the stairs and entered the room of Hattie Jones. Washington returned to his own room next door. About a half hour later, Washington heard scuffling noises in Jones’ room and heard one of the men say: “Where is it at?” Washington went to Jones’ room to investigate. He was met at the door by Irving who held a pistol. Irving told Washington not to get involved and, while Irving held Washington at bay with his gun drawn, Irving and Washington retreated to Washington’s room. More scuffling sounds came from Jones’ room and were followed by two shots. Irving and Holloway ran from the house while Washington went to Jones’ room and discovered she had been shot. Washington called the police. He was questioned at the scene and gave descriptions of the assailants. He later identified Irving as one of two perpetrators of the crime from an array of eleven photographs.</p>

The Philadelphia police were contacted and, on December 5, 1975, Irving waived extradition and was returned to Philadelphia where he gave the incriminating statement involved in this appeal.</p>

Since the Commonwealth intended to introduce only the incriminating statement' given to the Philadelphia police concerning the homicide of Hattie Jones and since Irving did not specifically allege that this statement was improperly induced by events in New York, the Commonwealth presented no testimony at the suppression hearing concerning the period of Irving’s custody in New York from November 24 to December 5, 1975.

At the request of the Commonwealth, the court permitted the prosecution to reopen its case and present evidence with respect to what occurred in New York prior to Irving’s extradition to Philadelphia. Thereafter, on May 18, 1976, the Commonwealth offered the testimony of F.B.I. and New York law enforcement agents to prove Irving was not unfairly treated while in custody in <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>New York and to explain the reason for the two-week delay between the arrest and the extradition hearing.</p>

Prior to the second visit, Holloway gave Irving a gun saying: “You may not have to use it but if something jumps off you will have it.” Irving was aware that Holloway was also armed. Although Irving was not present in Jones’ room at the time of the shooting, he used his gun to bar another person from interfering with Holloway’s efforts to get money from Jones by force. In the course of these events, Hattie Jones was shot twice in the head and abdomen by Holloway which caused her death. Irving and Holloway fled the scene and traveled to New York.</p>

This, in addition to the fact that Holloway went to Jones’ residence armed with a loaded weapon to collect money owed him which Jones was either. unable or unwilling to pay, allows an inference of malice which would support a verdict of murder of the third degree against Holloway.
