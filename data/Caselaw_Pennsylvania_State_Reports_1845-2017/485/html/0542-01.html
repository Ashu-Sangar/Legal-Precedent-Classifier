The convictions stem from the November 5, 1975 fatal shooting of Herschell Williams. Post-verdict motions were denied, and judgment of sentence of life imprisonment was imposed on the murder conviction. Judgments of sentence of not less than two and one-half to five years imprisonment and not less than five to ten years imprisonment were imposed on the weapons convictions and the criminal conspiracy conviction. The trial court directed these judgments of sentence to run concurrently with the judgment of sentence of life imprisonment. Hoskins appealed to this Court from the judgment of sentence imposed on the murder conviction. An appeal from the judgments of sentence on the remaining convictions was filed in the Superior Court and later certified to this Court.</p>

Another male, wearing a print shirt and brown “jeff” cap, was seated on the steps leading to 8605 Bayard Street. A few minutes later, Hoskins joined the male sitting on the steps and asked Frederick Robb, who was exiting his home located at 8603 Bayard Street, for the correct time. Robb, who testified at trial, informed Hoskins that he “didn’t know” the time and left the vicinity of Bayard Street and Roumfort Road in an automobile driven by a friend, Daniel Parks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Thus, the leading question regarding the drug activities of Robert Blair, the alleged common-law husband of Hoskins’ <em>only </em>alibi witness, was the culmination of a strategy calculated to try the instant case on issues not properly before the jury. When viewed in the factual context present at trial, the question, which resulted in the mistrial request, suggested to the jury that, through their association with Blair, the victim, and Williams’ mother, Hoskins and his only alibi witness, Miss Williams, were both involved in drug trafficking. Furthermore, this inference of illegal drug trafficking on the part of Hoskins and his only alibi witness was coupled with the suggestion that Hoskins, Miss Williams, and the victim were all associated with a religion which had a reputation for criminal activity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Such inferences are clearly improper and inflammatory.</p>
