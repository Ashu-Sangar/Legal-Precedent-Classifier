Appellant and Dafner brought a trespass action alleging negligence against appellee, who then joined appellant as an additional defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The case was assigned to the Arbitration Division of the Allegheny County Court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and on March 22, 1976, a panel of arbitrators made the following finding and award: “for 1) Plaintiff Leo Dafner in the amount of (2,000.00) two thousand dollars against the original defendant and the additional defendant. 2) Defendant Mark Puliafico on the claim of Scott Berkey”.</p>

Thereafter, appellee filed a motion for an order to compel entry of judgment against himself and appellant-Scott Berkey as additional defendant on the Dafner claim contending that appellant had appealed in his capacity as plaintiff, only.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Relying solely upon <em>Ottaviano v.

After receiving adverse awards in both these capacities, Ottaviano filed an appeal “on behalf of plaintiff, Joseph Ottaviano only , . . Ottaviano then satisfied the judgment against him as additional defendant. The Superior Court concluded that Ottaviano had appealed as a plaintiff only and that the unappealed award was a final determination of the issue of his negligence which would bar any future litigation of the same issue, namely, the appeal de novo on his plaintiff-claim. The <em>Ottaviano </em>court justified their conclusion that Ottaviano had appealed as a plaintiff only by stating that:</p>

It is difficult to believe that it was ever appellant’s intention to appeal the award in favor of co-plaintiff Zangari and against him as additional defendant when he proceeded to satisfy the judgment against him, as well as expressly state his intent to appeal as plaintiff only. . . . Appellant cannot satisfy the judgment, thereby acquiescing.in the arbitrators’ determination, and then claim that he may appeal from the very judgment he already paid. <em>... <a href="/citations/?q=361%20A.2d%20810" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="361 A.2d 810">Id.</a> </em><a href="/pa-super/239/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="239 Pa.

Additionally, appellee contends that appellant, who was represented by separate attorneys in each capacity, did not appeal as additional defendant since only the attorney representing him as plaintiff filed the appeal. He further argues that the attorney representing appellant as plaintiff could not have filed an appeal on behalf of the additional defendant because this would have been an unethical representation of conflicting interests on the part of the plaintiff-attorney. <em>See Jedwabny v. Philadelphia Transportation Company, </em><a href="/pa/390/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="390 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="1275695" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0231-01">390 Pa. 231</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.2d%20252" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="135 A.2d 252">135 A.2d 252</a> (1957); <em>see also, </em>Canon 6 of the Canons of Professional Ethics. This argument is without merit. It improperly focuses on the intention of the attorneys involved rather than on the intention of the appellant. The fact that ethical considerations might, on appeal, preclude an attorney’s representation of appellant in both his capacities is no indication that <em>appellant </em>intended to limit his appeal to his claim as plaintiff.</p>
