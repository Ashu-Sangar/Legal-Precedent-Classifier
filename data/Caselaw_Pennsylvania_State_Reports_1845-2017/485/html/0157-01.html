Each couple has filed in the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County a petition to adopt the child in its custody for the past two years. In October, 1977, at the time hearings on the petitions to adopt were scheduled to begin, appellant, the natural mother of the proposed adoptees, filed petitions to vacate decrees entered in May, 1977 terminating her parental rights. Appellees, the Gs and the Ws, opposed the petitions. After evidentiary hearings, the orphans’ court dismissed appellant’s petitions to vacate. On these appeals, appellant argues that the evidence in support of her petitions is “uncontroverted” and that the orphans’ court was required to grant relief. Our review satisfies us that appellant’s claim is without merit and we affirm.</p>

Appellant, now 22, and her former husband, the natural father of both children, separated shortly after R.’s birth. For over two years, neither appellant nor her former husband lived with or took care of the children. Instead, both children were raised by appellant’s mother. Appellant’s mother experienced difficulty raising the children, the Gs and the Ws expressed interest in adopting the children and, in February, 1977, appellant’s mother, with appellant’s knowledge, placed the children with appellees. Since placement, each couple has filed a report of intention to adopt under Section 331 of the Adoption Act of 1970.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The orphans’ court held a hearing and engaged appellant in a colloquy to determine appellant’s understanding of the petition. Appellant acknowledged to the court that she was asking for termination of all of her parental rights to R.H., and that she made the request “of [her] own free will and accord,” without “pressure,” and “voluntarily.” On May 25, 1977, the court entered a decree of termination granting appellant’s petition for voluntary relinquishment and awarding custody of R.H. to the Ws. This decree also was not appealed. The Ws then filed their petition to adopt R.H., and included a request to terminate the parental rights of appellant’s former husband under section 311(1).</p>

Both petitions allege that appellant’s physical and mental condition made her susceptible to the influence of her mother, that her testimony at the proceedings was not “true and correct,” and that she could not understand either the uncontested termination proceedings in which her rights to D.H. were terminated or the proceedings in which she voluntarily relinquished her rights to R.H. The. same court which conducted the voluntary relinquishment proceedings held several hearings on the petitions. Appellant, appellant’s mother, and a psychologist testified in support of appellant’s allegations. The court concluded that appellant “changed her mind” and dismissed the petitions. The orphans’ court en banc unanimously dismissed appellant’s exceptions and these appeals followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The orphans’ court also had before it the transcript of the colloquy in which the same court, in May, 1977, heard appellant request voluntary relinquishment of her parental rights to R.H. “of [her] own free will and accord,” without “pressure,” and “voluntarily.”</p>
