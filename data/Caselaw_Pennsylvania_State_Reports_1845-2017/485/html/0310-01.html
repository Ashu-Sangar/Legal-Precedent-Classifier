The district magistrate erred in unduly restricting the cross-examination of a witness for the prosecution at appellant’s preliminary hearing. Rule 141 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure entitles one to be present at the preliminary hearing, be represented by counsel, <em>cross-examine </em>witnesses, present witnesses and make notes of the proceedings. Our rules are so structured because of the belief that the preliminary hearing is a “critical stage” in the criminal processes. The United States Supreme Court <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>has declared a preliminary hearing is such a “critical stage” and recognized that information may be learned at a preliminary hearing that is vital to the defense of the accused at a later trial. The United States Supreme Court said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[241,523,1106,418]]]'>“. . . the skilled interrogation of witnesses by an experienced lawyer can fashion a vital impeachment tool for use in cross-examination of the State’s witnesses at the trial, or preserve testimony favorable to the accused of a witness who does not appear at the trial. Third, trained counsel can more effectively discover the case the State has against his client and make possible the preparation of a proper defense to meet that case at the trial.”</blockquote>
