Appellant, David Ransome, was arrested on January 6, 1976, and charged with murder, aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime, and criminal conspiracy. He was tried before a judge, sitting without a jury, and was convicted of murder in the third degree, aggravated assault, and criminal conspiracy. He was found not guilty of possession of an instrument of crime. Post-verdict motions were denied, and sentence of seven and one-half to twenty years imprisonment was imposed for the murder conviction, with concurrent sentences of three to six <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>years and five to ten years imprisonment being imposed for the aggravated assault conviction and the conspiracy conviction. Appropriate appeals were then taken to this Court from the murder judgment, and to the Superior Court from the non-homicide judgments. The Superior Court transferred the latter appeals to us. This consolidated appeal followed, with appellant now being represented by counsel other than trial counsel.</p>

The facts surrounding the crimes for which appellant was convicted, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, established that the decedent and two others were walking down a street in North Philadelphia when they were attacked by appellant and eleven other assailants. Several of the attackers were armed with knives. The decedent died of a stab wound received in the assault. The evidence also showed that appellant was one of the organizers of the attack as well as a participant in the actual assault.</p>

Specifically, appellant points to the testimony of a prosecution witness indicating that some time prior to the incident in question, appellant had been stabbed in another apparent gang altercation; that one of the assailants had declared, just prior to the incident, that “they . . . was going down there to get the boys who stabbed [appellant],” and that appellant had instructed his fellow attackers that, “when he tell everybody move back because he going to start swinging.” The inference appellant would draw from these statements is that appellant intended only to engage in a fist fight. Appellant overlooks other testimony by a prosecution witness which indicates that the conspiracy went beyond a mere agreement to engage in a fist fight. This witness was asked if he had heard any conversation regarding <em>weapons </em>as the group was discussing plans just prior to the group’s departure. <em>The witness replied “yes,” </em>and when asked what he had heard said one of the group asked in appellant’s presence, “if everybody got their stuff.” The factfinder could reasonably have inferred from this remark made in appellant’s presence that some in the group were carrying weapons and appellant was aware of this fact. Appellant’s contention that the evidence was insufficient must therefore fail; his guilt of the crimes of murder in the third degree, aggravated assault, and conspiracy was established beyond a reasonable doubt regardless of whether or not he personally stabbed the decedent.</p>

The failure to file a suppression motion may be evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Cf., Commonwealth v.

He identified appellant as one of the participants in the attack which caused the death of Steven Johnson. On cross-examination, Parsons stated that he first told police that appellant was one of the assailants when he saw appellant at appellant’s preliminary hearing of these charges. Parsons was present in the preliminary hearing room waiting to be called as a witness. He testified that he recognized appellant as one of the attackers when he saw appellant seated in the courtroom together with other males. Appellant, who was represented by counsel at the time, chose to waive the preliminary hearing. Consequently, Parsons did not have an opportunity to testify or formally identify appellant at that time. After the hearing was waived a police detective asked Parsons if he had recognized anyone.

While Parsons was sitting in the courtroom waiting to testify at the preliminary hearing, nothing occurred or was done to point out appellant to Parsons or to distinguish appellant from any of the other males in the courtroom. Because the preliminary hearing was waived, this is not an instance where “the accused is clearly designated by his role in the proceeding as the suspected perpetrator prior to the identification.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Under these circumstances it is hard to understand a claim of suggestiveness. Even if we were to accept appellant’s contention that this identification occurred in suggestive circumstances, we cannot accept his claim that the identification was unreliable. The crime took place January 5 at 7 p. m., two houses from a well illuminated street intersection. Parsons was involved in the melee and was himself stabbed, giving him good reason and opportunity to view the assailants with great attention. Parsons correctly described the clothing worn by the appellant and he was sure of his identification of appellant as one of the attackers. The preliminary hearing occurred 17 days after the attack. Under the totality of these circumstances, there was no danger of an irreparable misidentification.

Because appellant had already been arrested prior to the preliminary hearing, Parsons’ identification of appellant at the preliminary hearing without the knowledge of appellant’s counsel was violative of appellant’s sixth amendment rights.

Moreover, I would remand for an evidentiary hearing on whether the in-court identification was tainted by the same, uncounselled pre-trial identification procedure.</p>

Nonetheless, the majority reviews the record and, without a prior fact-finding adjudication, summarily concludes that the in-court identification had a source independent of the illegal identification. I cannot agree. “This Court does not sit as a trier of issues of fact, expecting to be persuaded that one or <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>the other side is more credible.

Surely on the basis of this record it cannot be concluded that the witness’ in-court identification had an independent basis from the unlawful pre-trial procedure. Thus, the majority erroneously concludes that a motion to suppress the identification would have been wholly without merit and that counsel was not ineffective.</p>

Parsons identified appellant as one of the participants in the January 5, 1976, attack which caused the death of Steven Johnson. On cross-examination, Parsons stated that he first told police that appellant was one of the assailants when he saw appellant at appellant’s preliminary hearing on these charges. Parsons, who was present as a witness in the room in which the preliminary hearing was to be held, testified that he recognized appellant when he saw appellant seated in the courtroom together with other males. Appellant, who was represented by counsel at the time, chose to waive the preliminary hearing, and, therefore, Parsons was not summoned to testify, and made no formal identification at that time. After the hearing was waived, a police detective asked Parsons if <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>he had recognized anyone, and Parsons replied that he had, identifying appellant.</p>
    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[239,391,1151,683]]]'>Identification evidence should not be received at trial if the circumstances of the pretrial confrontation were so infected by suggestiveness as to give rise to a likelihood of misidentification. <em>Commonwealth v. Turner, </em><a href="/pa/454/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="454 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="579876" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0520-01">454 Pa. 520</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20496" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="314 A.2d 496">314 A.2d 496</a> (1974) (citing cases). A pretrial confrontation between a witness and the accused at a preliminary hearing is fraught with suggestiveness. Any identification which results from such an occurrence is suspect, and is properly the subject of a pretrial motion to suppress. Trial counsel’s failure to make such a motion in the instant case could have had no “reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interests.” <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967).</p>
    <p id="b532-6" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[236,1093,1152,1004]]]'>The prosecution argues, nevertheless, that appellant’s judgment of sentence should be affirmed because, even had trial counsel filed such a motion, it would have properly been denied. The prosecution bases this argument on Parsons’ testimony at trial which, according to the prosecution, establishes a sufficient “independent basis” for the in-court identification so that any “taint” caused by the pretrial procedure has been removed. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Cox, </em><a href="/pa/466/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="466 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1715004" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0582-01">466 Pa. 582</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="466 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1715004" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0582-01">353 A.2d 844</a> (1976). I would decline to pass upon this question at this state of the proceedings. Other than the brief factual outline given above, there is no indication in this record as to the circumstances surrounding Parsons’ confrontation with appellant at the scheduled .preliminary hearing. For example, this Court does not know whether appellant’s counsel was aware that there were potential identification witnesses present in the preliminary hearing courtroom, or whether counsel’s statements, or other circumstances indicated to those present — including Parsons — that appellant was, in fact, accused of Johnson’s murder.</p>

I would therefore remand the matter to the trial court with <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>instructions that appellant be allowed to file a motion to suppress the identification testimony. If the trial court concludes that appellant’s motion should be granted, then a new trial must be held. If the suppression court denies appellant’s motion, he should then be allowed to refile his appeal to this Court.</p>
