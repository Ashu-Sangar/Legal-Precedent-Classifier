His trial began on March 13, 1972, and on March 20, 1972, at the end of the Commonwealth’s case, appellant, while represented by counsel, entered guilty pleas to both counts of murder. After a colloquy between appellant and the court, the pleas were accepted. On June 22, 1972, appellant was called for sentencing, at which time appellant stated that he was not guilty of the crimes charged and that he wished to withdraw his guilty plea. After taking testimony from appellant that because of language difficulties and “emotional pressure” caused by so many accusations of guilt against him, appellant’s plea was not knowing and voluntary, the court denied appellant’s motion and sentenced him to two consecutive terms of four to twenty years’ imprisonment and eight to twenty years’ imprisonment respectively.</p>
