A pretrial motion to suppress evidence of these incriminations was denied after an evidentiary hearing. Subsequently, Wilson was brought to trial before a jury and was found guilty of <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>murder of the first degree, attempted robbery, criminal conspiracy, and crimes committed with firearms. Post-verdict motions were denied, and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed on the murder conviction. Additional prison sentences were imposed on the robbery and conspiracy convictions. An appeal from the life imprisonment sentence was filed directly in this Court. An appeal filed in the Superior Court from the other judgments of sentence was later certified here.</p>

The trial judge immediately assumed command, and advised counsel, “I have tried to handle the situation [by giving the cautionary instructions] as best as can be under the circumstances.” Defense counsel expressed satisfaction with the instructions insofar as they dealt with a reference to a “statement” Wilson gave to police, but then reiterated his objection if the assistant district attorney referred to a “confession” which, in fact, he did.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Further discussion occurred during which defense counsel expressed agreement with the court that a “confession” did exist; that the Commonwealth could have, but did not, introduce it; and, that some advantage to Wilson might result from the “confession” not having been put into evidence.

The reference was accurate, the evidence was available and, as indicated, had been previously ruled admissible.
