Post trial motions were denied, and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. A direct appeal was filed in this Court, and we affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

At all times up to and including his direct appeal, Weathers El was represented by members of the public defender’s office. On November 12, 1976, represented by new counsel, Weathers El commenced an action under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, §§ 1 <em>et seq., </em>19 P.S. §§ 1180-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp.1978-79) [Hereinafter: PCHA, 19 P.S. § -].

In defense, Weathers El testified, in part, that he was addicted to heroin at the time of the crime.
