The trial court found appellant guilty of voluntarily manslaughter. Post-verdict motions were denied, and a sentence of eighteen months to three years imprisonment was imposed.

Dee, my daughter, came in and was sitting next to [Harvey] in the kitchen eating a steak. He took a couple bites of her steak and she told him he wasn’t going to eat it all. I told him he could wait for the chicken because it was almost ready. Then he started accusing me of things and then I asked for my keys and told him to get his things. He said, ‘Oh, did Goobie tell you to get your keys?’ He started insinuating things that wasn’t true and started hitting me and knocking me down on the kitchen floor. He pulled my hair and hit my head on the floor. I told him to get the hell off of me, get his clothes and go back to where he used to stay. I went in the bedroom and we had some more words and he knocked me down and hit me in my face. My daughter told him it didn’t make sense for him to hit me and I was carrying his baby. He said how he know it was his. I said, ‘Is that what you really mean?’ He didn’t answer. I said, ‘Give me my keys and you can go ahead.’ He asked me, ‘Is that what your friend said, get your keys?’ I said, ‘No, didn’t nobody tell me to get anything cause don’t nobody tell me what to do. I just want you to stop hitting me.’ He threw my keys to the kitchen back door and I was going to get them and he grabbed me. I pushed his hand away and my daughter said, ‘You’re not going to hit my mother anymore.’ I was looking in the drawer for a knife cause I wasn’t going to get hit anymore. He was standing by the sink on the left-hand side. I was on the right-hand side and Dee was in the middle. I grabbed the knife.

Appellant said that the argument started over two men, George and Goobie. She said that Harvey knocked her away from the stove to the floor while she was frying chicken and that she got up and ran into the bedroom where he followed her. She asked for the apartment keys. According to her testimony, Harvey knocked her to the bedroom floor and began choking her and hit her head against the floor. She said she got up and went back to the kitchen. Harvey followed, although her daughter was between them. Appellant asked for the keys again and Harvey threw them on the floor. Appellant testified that her daughter then said, “You’re not going to hit my mother again.” With that, according to appellant, the victim “went to lunge” at her; the drawer was open and she grabbed the steak knife. She continued, “Well, I didn’t even know I had stabbed him because it seemed to me I just brushed past him. Then I seen the blood and the knife just <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>jumped out of my hand.” Appellant also testified that Harvey carried a switchblade knife and that she was afraid for her health and safety and that of her unborn child. She did not say that she saw the switchblade knife that afternoon, however.</p>

She corroborated her mother’s testimony that the argument started over two men, George and Goobie, and her testimony was in basic agreement with her mother’s as to what transpired. Only one difference existed between appellant’s testimony and that of her daughter: appellant testified that she did not see the knife during the fight although she knew he normally carried one, while her daughter testified that at one point during the fight, when her mother was on the floor, the victim tried to stab her mother with a knife with a Chinese design on it, but that the knife got stuck in a chair.</p>

Specifically, appellant contends that she should have been acquitted because the evidence raised the issue of whether or not she was acting in self-defense at the time she stabbed Harvey, and that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant did not act in self-defense. We have viewed the evidence in the instant case in the light most favorable to the prosecution, as we must when asked to review the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, and have accepted as true all the evidence, and all reasonable inferences deducible from it, upon which, if believed, the fact-finder could have based its verdict. <em>Commonwealth v.

We disagree. The victim’s provocation was serious enough to cause a <em>reasonable belief </em>by appellant that she was in danger of death or serious bodily harm. The <em>uncontradicted evidence </em>revealed that the stabbing occurred during an argument in which the victim pursued appellant throughout the apartment, beat her, knocked her down several times, choked her, and repeatedly hit her head against the floor — all of this at a time when appellant was six months pregnant. This evidence is all that was presented at trial. At no time did appellant state that she did not think herself in danger of serious injury or death from <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>Harvey’s unprovoked attack upon her.

    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[180,510,1148,1642]]]'>The prosecution points out that appellant and Harvey were approximately the same size. Assuming that this would be significant given the above circumstances, there is simply no evidence to sustain the prosecution’s contention. There was some testimony that the victim was slightly taller than the appellant, but that is all. There was no evidence concerning the relative weights, or strengths, of the parties, and the basic facts leave no doubt that appellant was getting the worst of the fight. The prosecution also states that there was testimony that appellant had previously “pulled a knife on the victim.” Assuming the truth of this statement for the moment, it might be relevant to establish that appellant was the aggressor at the time of the stabbing; there is, however, no evidence to that effect, and the trial court correctly found that it was the victim who provoked the incident. In any event, the prosecution’s statement that there was testimony that the appellant had previously pulled a knife on the victim is incorrect. After stating on page three of its brief that there was such testimony, the prosecution tells us — more accurately — ten pages later that there was no such evidence. First the prosecution says, “There was testimony that [appellant] pulled a knife on the victim previously.” Later, the prosecution states, “. there was no <em>evidence </em>that [appellant] had tried to stab the victim or pull a knife on him previously.” The latter portion of the prosecution’s brief is the accurate portion. While cross-examining appellant’s daughter, the prosecuting attorney asked a leading question that implied appellant had previously pulled a knife on the victim. This implication was denied by appellant’s daughter and no other inquires were ever made about the matter.</p>

We have reviewed the trial court’s opinion and can find only one area in which the trial court refers to facts which could conceivably indicate a conflict between appellant’s testimony and her daughter’s testimony. The trial court stated: “Appellant said that the argument started over two men, George and Goobie.” Later, the trial court said appellant’s daughter testified that the argument was over turning the TV off and on.

    <p id="b358-11" data-blocks='[["BL_358.11",358,[231,1178,1157,777]]]'>The prosecution also suggests that a contradiction existed between appellant’s testimony regarding whether or not Harvey was armed with a knife during the incident. Appellant testified that, she knew the victim carried a switchblade knife, but that she did not see it during the incident; appellant’s daughter testified that she did see the knife. As we have noted earlier, even if the victim did not use a knife when he assaulted appellant, the circumstances preceding the stabbing were sufficient to cause appellant to reasonably believe that she was in danger of death or serious bodily harm. Furthermore, we see no such conflict between appellant’s testimony and that of her daughter. Appellant testified that she did not see the knife; her daughter testified that when she saw the knife, appellant had been pushed to the floor by Harvey. The matter was not pursued further.</p>

It is for this reason that our system of justice places the burden on the prosecution to establish all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
