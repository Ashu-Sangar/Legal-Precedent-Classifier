A <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>three-judge panel held a degree-of-guilt hearing and found him guilty of murder of the first degree. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life for murder and ten to twenty years on each count of rape, the sentences to run consecutively. No direct appeal was filed.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[266,558,1156,306]]]'>In 1971, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in which he sought to withdraw his guilty plea and made various allegations of ineffectiveness of counsel. The post conviction hearing court denied relief. We affirmed. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b162-7" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[265,1209,1156,308]]]'>In 1977, appellant, with new counsel, filed a third PCHA petition, alleging incompetence on the part of prior counsel for failing to raise certain matters. The trial court denied the petition without holding an evidentiary hearing. Appellant has appealed the court’s order, alleging that he was entitled to a hearing.</p>
    <p id="b162-8" data-blocks='[["BL_162.7",162,[263,1540,1157,678]],["BL_163.1",163,[162,292,1148,86]]]'>Appellant contends that he was not advised of his rights at the time of his arrest. If this is so, appellant was not prejudiced because he was not questioned and did not make any statement. Appellant could not have been helped by counsel contending that he was not advised of his rights. Counsel is effective if his or her chosen course of action had a reasonable, basis designed to effectuate the client’s interest. <em>Com. ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967). Moreover, counsel is not deemed ineffective for not pursuing meritless claims. <em>Commonwealth v. Rice, </em><a href="/pa/456/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="456 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="584461" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0090-01">456 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20705" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="318 A.2d 705">318 A.2d 705</a> (1974). Since counsel could not have helped appellant by claiming that he had not been advised of his rights, the decision not to do so was consistent <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>with a reasonable course of action, as the claim was merit-less.</p>
    <p id="b163-4" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[161,410,1150,519]]]'>Appellant also alleges that his rights were violated in that he was not given a copy of the complaint against him and that his fingerprints were taken without his having been formally arrested. He presents no authority to support the contention that his rights were necessarily violated thereby, nor do we see any merit to the contention. Consequently, the failure of counsel to advance it previously did not constitute ineffectiveness. Counsel is not deemed ineffective for not pursuing meritless claims. <em>Commonwealth v. Rice, supra.</em>

    <p id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[159,954,1151,518]]]'>Finally, appellant renews the challenge to the legality of his sentence of life imprisonment. The court stated no minimum sentence. Appellant argues that the lack of a stated minimum unconstitutionally denies him the opportunity for parole. He claims that the attorney who represented him in his second PCHA petition was ineffective in failing to explain why the issue was not raised previously. This claim need not be dealt with because appellant was not harmed. In <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s judgments of sentence imposed after his guilty plea were not limited by the Act of 1941, and he was eligible for parole after serving the minimum sentence.
