On March 31, 1975, appellant filed an application to suppress inculpatory statements which he made to the police following his arrest. On that same date, the lower court scheduled a suppression hearing to be held on May 15; the Commonwealth filed an answer to said application on May 12. At the suppression hearing, the appellant objected to the Commonwealth’s answer on the grounds that it was filed late in violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 308.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Had the suppression <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>court applied the terms of Rule 308(a), the appellant’s application to suppress would have been granted. However, the suppression court admitted the Commonwealth’s answer as filed and following the hearing, the appellant’s application to suppress was denied.</p>

Additionally, appellant contends that he was incompetent to stand trial; that his two inculpatory statements given prior to arraignment were the product of an unnecessary delay in violation of Pa.R. Crim.P. 130; that the lower court erred in admitting a post-mortem slide depicting the decedent with a sheet covering all but his head; that the Commonwealth failed to prove appellant’s legal sanity beyond a reasonable doubt; that the lower court erred by instructing the jury only on the “McNaughten” standard of insanity; that trial counsel was appointed late and therefore lacked the time necessary to prepare for trial. We have reviewed the record and found each of these contentions to be without merit. Appellant’s final contention is that the lower court erred in refusing to declare a mistrial when a witness referred to appellant’s ability to testify at trial. Appellant waived this issue by failing to raise it in his written post-verdict motions. <em>Commonwealth v.
