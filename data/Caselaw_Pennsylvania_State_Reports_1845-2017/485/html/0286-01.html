On the evening of July 14, 1976, Ronald Fisher, the victim, and six or seven of his friends were drinking beer on the front porch of the Fisher home. As a carload of female acquaintances drove by, someone threw an empty beer bottle, which shattered on the street. The girls pulled over and one of the victim’s friends, Eddie Nemeth, left the porch to talk to the girls.</p>

A fight broke <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>out and eventually shots were fired. Appellant and his friends got back in their cars and sped away. Ronald Fisher was pronounced dead on arrival at Allegheny General Hospital from a gunshot wound of the head.</p>

Appellant did testify that he approached the porch with the intention of hurting someone for striking his auto with the bat.

No charge on an accomplice theory was requested. Following closing argument by the Commonwealth, the court was recessed until the next morning, when the jury was to be charged. Before the trial judge went home for the day, the Commonwealth’s attorney dropped off photocopies of two cases which indicated that an accomplice charge would be proper.

Whether these actions constitute the submission of points for charge is moot, because, assuming receipt of untimely points or appellate authority, we perceive no abuse of [discretion]. The possibility of defendant's guilt as an accomplice was clearly an issue in the case, at least to the trial judge, due to defendant’s activities and statements subsequent to the initial confrontation on Southside Avenue.

The following day, the court included accomplice liability in its charge. Appellant took a timely objection.</p>
    <p id="b328-13" data-blocks='[["BL_328.11",328,[212,1334,1157,704]]]'>The prejudice to appellant from the Commonwealth’s addition of a theory of accomplice liability lies not so much in the <em>ex parte </em>nature of the Commonwealth’s request, but in the introduction of a theory of liability the Commonwealth expressly represented it would not and did not pursue at trial. Appellant, on this record, could and did rely upon the Commonwealth’s representation. He had no reasonable notice of possible accomplice liability, and no reason to anticipate, present evidence, or argue to the jury against accomplice liability. The Commonwealth for all practical purposes foreclosed appellant from making any argument against this additional, unanticipated and entirely new theory, advanced only after the presentation of evidence and final argument.</p>

The court held that the trial court properly charged on both theories of liability. We are unable to see how the colloquy pointed to by the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts, which occurred after closing arguments by both parties, in any way justifies a finding that appellant relied on representations that the Commonwealth was attempting to predicate a finding of guilt solely on a principal theory of liability. Further, if appellant was misled by this colloquy, there were no actions taken by appellant which were in response to the alleged representation.</p>
