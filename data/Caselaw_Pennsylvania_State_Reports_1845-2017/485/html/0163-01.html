Appellants contend that a different legislative intent is evidenced by the amendment of the Workmen’s Compensation Act in 1972 to provide for an alternative remedy for occupational diseases. We disagree. These statutory provisions that were added to the Workmen’s Compensation Act to provide compensation for victims of occupational diseases are very similar to the portions of the Occupational Disease Act that were construed in <em>Greer </em>and, hence, the analysis we performed in the <em>Greer </em>case would apply here as well.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Accord<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>ingly, appellants’ contention that the Workmen’s Compensation and Occupational Disease Acts are totally exclusive and deprive common pleas courts of jurisdiction over claims arising from diseases not covered by those acts is rejected.</p>
