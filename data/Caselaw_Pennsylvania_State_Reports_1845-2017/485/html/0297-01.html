This meeting was attended by appellant Treftz, John Gilkey (Mary Gilkey’s husband), and six other individuals including the deceased, who was a prospective member of the organization.

Mrs. Gilkey went back into the living room. Approximately five minutes later, upon hearing the screaming (again) of her young son and the back door of her house open, Mrs. Gilkey returned to the kitchen and observed the deceased lying outside the back door. Mrs. Gilkey testified that one of the Breed members said to the deceased, “You’re as good as dead” and then challengingly questioned appellant, “You’re the President of this club, what are you going to do about it, the Ohio Club.”</p>
    <p id="b334-7" data-blocks='[["BL_334.6",334,[225,1656,1157,308]]]'>Mrs. Gilkey testified that she saw appellant walk out the back door with a gun in his hand.

    <p id="b335-4" data-blocks='[["BL_335.3",335,[227,294,1151,998]]]'>
      <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>At the PCHA hearing, trial counsel testified that even though Barbara Gobel told him that Mrs. Gilkey never went into the kitchen while the aforementioned meeting was taking place, he (trial counsel) did not call Barbara Gobel as a witness because she (Barbara Gobel) told him that she observed appellant in the Gilkey house on the night of the crime; trial counsel feared that if a defense witness (Barbara Gobel) placed appellant at the scene of the crime, it might have been necessary for appellant to take the stand (which appellant did not want to do) to explain his conduct on the night in question (in order to avoid the drawing of “adverse inference[s]” by the jurors). Since trial counsel’s decision to refrain from calling Barbara Gobel as a witness had a reasonable basis (namely, to avoid the necessity of calling appellant to the stand or alternatively to avoid a possible adverse inference by the jury because of appellant’s failure to take the stand), we affirm the PCHA court’s finding that appellant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[227,1325,1149,522]]]'>Appellant’s second contention is that his trial counsel was ineffective on the grounds that he did not call witnesses who (allegedly) would have testified that appellant and John Gilkey took the Gilkeys’ four-year old son to a bar subsequent to the shooting of the deceased. Appellant argues that evidence that the Gilkey child was with appellant and John Gilkey in a bar following the shooting is inconsistent with Mary Gilkey’s testimony that just prior to the shooting, she removed the child from the kitchen and took him into the living room.</p>
    <p id="b335-6" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[227,1866,1149,475]],["BL_336.1",336,[230,295,1156,198]]]'>A review of the record indicates that evidence that appellant and John Gilkey took the Gilkey child to a bar following the shooting would not have been inconsistent with Mrs. Gilkey’s testimony. Mrs. Gilkey’s testimony related to events prior to and including the shooting while the other testimony related to events after the shooting. Thus, trial counsel had a reasonable basis for not calling witnesses who (allegedly) would have testified that the Gilkey child went to a bar with appellant and John Gilkey following the shooting <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>(namely, that this evidence would not have been inconsistent with Mrs. Gilkey’s testimony) and therefore, we affirm the PCHA court’s finding that appellant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b336-5" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[220,542,1163,1327]]]'>Appellant’s third contention is that his trial counsel was ineffective on the grounds that he did not investigate (or call witnesses concerning) whether Mary Gilkey was on medication (or medication combined with alcoholic beverages) on the night of the crime. Appellant argues that such evidence would have impeached Mrs. Gilkey’s testimony wherein she described the events that occurred on the night in question. At the PCHA hearing, trial counsel testified that in preparing for trial, he was aware that Mrs. Gilkey was taking some form of medication in order to treat cancer. Trial counsel testified that he did not investigate whether she took medication on the night of the crime since he feared that if he brought forth evidence at trial that Mrs. Gilkey took medication on said night, it might also be elicited that Mrs. Gilkey had cancer (which this medication was treating). Trial counsel concluded that any testimony that Mrs. Gilkey had cancer “would create sympathy for . . [Mrs. Gilkey] in the jury’s mind and might adversely affect our argument concerning [her] credibility.” Thus, trial counsel had a reasonable basis for not investigating (or calling witnesses concerning) whether Mrs. Gilkey was on medication (or medication combined with alcoholic beverages) on the night of the crime and therefore, we affirm the PCHA court’s finding that appellant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b336-8" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[218,1917,1157,421]]]'>Appellant’s fourth contention is that his trial counsel was ineffective on the grounds that he did not petition for a jury viewing of the Gilkey home. Appellant argues that a viewing could have impeached Commonwealth witness Mary Gilkey’s testimony that on the night of the crime, she observed (from the Gilkey kitchen) 1) the deceased lying outside the back door of the house and 2) appellant walking outside the back door of said house with a gun in his hand.</p>
    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.3",337,[209,300,1148,456]]]'>
      <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>At the PCHA hearing, trial counsel testified that prior to trial, he went to the Gilkey house and examined the Gilkey kitchen (by looking through the windows from the outside). From this examination, trial counsel concluded that Mrs. Gilkey was able to make the aforementioned observations. Thus, trial counsel’s decision to not request a jury viewing had a reasonable basis and therefore, we affirm the PCHA court’s finding that appellant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[207,787,1150,783]]]'>Appellant’s fifth contention is that his trial counsel was ineffective on the grounds that an oversight by trial counsel allegedly “prohibited” appellant from testifying. At the PCHA hearing, trial counsel testified 1) that when appellant was deciding whether he would testify, trial counsel informed him that he (trial counsel) had (earlier) failed to move for the suppression of a statement which appellant made to his probation officer and 2) that trial counsel told appellant that if he testified, appellant’s aforementioned statement to his probation officer could be used to impeach his testimony if his testimony was inconsistent with the statement. Appellant argues that trial counsel’s failure to seek the suppression of the statement “prohibited” him from testifying since he [appellant] was afraid that his testimony would be impeached by the statement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b337-6" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[205,1589,1150,352]]]'>A review of the PCHA record indicates that the fact that appellant (if he testified) could possibly be impeached by his earlier statement was not appellant’s overriding concern when he decided not to take the stand. Rather, the main reason that appellant did not testify was his fear of reprisals from the Breed Motorcycle Gang. At the PCHA hearing, trial counsel testified:</p>
    <blockquote id="b337-7" data-blocks='[["BL_337.6",337,[247,1965,1107,307]],["BL_338.1",338,[278,290,1115,842]]]'>I think the main reason why he [appellant] didn’t want to testify was that he feared that if he told his version of what happened that he would face possible reprisals from the other men in the group not just those men who were present at the time but other men who belonged to the Breed Motorcycle Club. All the time, from the very first <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>time that I talked with Mr. Treftz [appellant], this I broached to him, the possibility of testifying, telling him that he had a right to testify to what he said happened, and he was always reluctant or unwilling to say that he wanted to testify because of the fear that he had for the consequences from the other members of the group if he did testify. And, in my opinion that was, if not the biggest or if not the only reason why he did not testify or elect to testify, it was certainly one of the most important reasons why he elected not to testify. And I had told Mr. Treftz that when he stated that he was afraid of reprisals, I had told him that if his testimony established a defense that, that should be his primary motivation; that that should be, that should take precedence over whether or not he feared reprisals or retaliation from other members of the Breed.</blockquote>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[235,1165,1155,251]]]'>From these facts, it is clear that the failure of trial counsel to file a motion to suppress did not “prohibit” appellant from testifying.

Appellant also argues that prior to trial, he told trial counsel that he “suspected” that Mary Gilkey testified as a Commonwealth witness because she allegedly reached an agreement with the Commonwealth wherein the latter promised her that the Child Welfare Department of Mercer County would not remove Mrs. Gilkey’s children from her custody. In this appeal, appellant requests that “an additional hearing [be held] on this matter <em>if and when </em>evidence of a deal is discovered” to determine whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue this matter. (Emphasis added) This request is premature and need not be addressed in this appeal.</p>
