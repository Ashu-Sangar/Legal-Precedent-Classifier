The three men had agreed to “rob something” and then “split the proceeds”. After cruising the Northside and finding no target of opportunity, the three men drove to Duquesne, Pennsylvania. The Avenue News Store in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, was suggested by Stanley as a target and the threesome agreed to rob that store. Stanley and appellant waited in the parked car while Nixon took a gun from the glove compartment and headed toward the store. Nixon found the Avenue News Store was closed. On his way back to the car, Nixon accosted the victim, Richard Calkusic, in an alley behind the store and decided to rob him. The victim struggled and was shot and killed by Nixon. Nixon returned to the car, explained what had happened and the threesome drove back to the Northside.</p>

    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[252,750,1158,584]]]'>Appellant’s second contention is that there was insufficient evidence to support his felony murder and robbery convictions. These convictions were based upon appellant’s criminal responsibility, as a member of the conspiracy, for acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. Appellant argues that assuming the conspiracy did exist, the conspiracy terminated when co-conspirator Nixon found that the Avenue News Store was closed, and, therefore, the subsequent criminal acts (murder and robbery of the victim) were “independent, impulsive, random” acts beyond the scope of the conspiracy. This contention is without merit.</p>

When Nixon shifted the target for accomplishing that objective from the Avenue News Store to the victim, the essence of the conspiracy — the agreement to commit a robbery — remained unaffected. Nixon’s rob<a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>bery of the victim was within the scope of the conspiracy. Therefore, as a co-conspirator, appellant became criminally responsible for the commission of the robbery, and, for all natural and probable consequences occurring during the commission of that felony, namely, the murder of the victim. <em>Commonwealth v.
