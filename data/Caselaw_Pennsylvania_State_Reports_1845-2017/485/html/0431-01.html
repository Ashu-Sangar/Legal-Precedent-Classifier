Misc. Dkt. 1979. Respondent, Secretary of the Commonwealth, following the filing of the cited order and pursuant to 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 3133 (1978), notified the county boards of election that each political party was to nominate two candidates for the three judicial offices of the Commonwealth Court to be filled in the municipal election and that each elector was to vote for two candidates in the municipal election. In response to that notification, petitioner, Dennis E. Thiemann, filed a petition for review challenging the constitutionality of 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 3133 (1978). The Secretary, upon the advice of the Attorney General, then revised her interpretation and notified the <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>State chairperson of each of the two major political parties in the Commonwealth that her interpretation of 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 3133 (1978) as revised would result in each elector being permitted to vote for three persons in the primary with each political party nominating three candidates. This notification did not alter the Secretary’s earlier directive that in the municipal election each elector could vote for no more than two candidates to fill the three offices. The Secretary stands ready to notify the county boards of election of the revised interpretation, but has refrained from doing so pending the outcome of this action. Petitioner, David W. Craig, a judge of the Commonwealth Court who has filed nomination petitions, then filed a petition for review seeking alternative rulings, viz. that each party may nominate three candidates in the primary and each elector may vote for three candidates in the municipal election if the statute is declared unconstitutional or that each party may nominate two candidates and each elector may vote for two candidates in the municipal election if the statute is upheld. Amicus Curiae argues that the statute is constitutional; that each party may nominate two candidates; and, that each elector may vote for two candidates in the municipal election.</p>

Since historically the number of candidates each political party nominated under such circumstances was limited to the number an elector could vote for in the general or municipal election, the Legislature must have intended limited voting to apply to the primary. In light of this historical approach to limited voting, the Legislature in enacting 42 Pa.

More particularly, he concedes such a method of election is permissible when mandated by the Constitution as in Pa. Const. art. 5, § 16 (1874) (mandating limited voting for the office of justice of the Supreme Court — repealed 1968) and when mandated by the Legislature in certain circumstances as in the Act of June 24, 1895, P.L. 212, No. 128, § 1 (mandating limited voting for judges of the Superior Court).

Petitioner reasons: (1) that constitutionally created offices may, indeed must, be filled by elections utilizing limited voting when provided for in the Constitution as in Pa. Const. art. 5, § 16 (1873) (repealed 1968); (2) that, in the case of a statewide court statutorily created, the Legislature has discretion to choose the method of selection, including limited voting, see <em>McCormick; </em>but (3) that, in the case of a constitutionally created court such as the Commonwealth Court, where no provision in the Constitution mandates limited voting, the Legislature is impliedly prohibited from mandating limited voting. Hence, petitioner urges our ruling in <em>McCormick </em>is inapposite here because in that case the office was statutorily created and instantly the office is constitutionally created.</p>

We did not then reason that, since the Legislature could have provided for the judges to be selected by appointment or election, an election involving limited voting was really a method of appointment by the electorate which satisfied the mandate of Pa.

Const. art. 12, § 1 (1874) differed from that term as used in other portions of the Constitution because of the choice between methods of selection given to the Legislature by Pa.

Clearly, we viewed the issue in <em>McCormick </em>as whether, when an election is required either constitutionally or statutorily pursuant to a legislative choice of alternatives allowed by the Constitution, the Legislature as the representative of the will of the people, <em>Sharpless v. Mayor of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/21/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="21 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="411603" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0147-01">21 Pa. 147</a> (1853), may mandate limited voting in an election, and to this we responded affirmatively.

Finally, we reasoned Pa.

Const. art. 5, § 16 (1874), providing for limited voting in elections for the office of justice of the Supreme Court, shows an intent to create an implied prohibition against limited voting is predicated upon his view of <em>McCormick. </em>But, as has been shown, when <em>McCormick </em>is analyzed properly, the repeal of Pa.

Const. art. 5, § 13(a)(1968) to the discretion of the Legislature, i. e. it indicates an intention to remove the constitutional mandate as to the Supreme Court, and the method of election may constitutionally include limited voting. Given the language in <em>McCormick </em>specifically indicating we were dealing with a legislatively chosen election as allowed by Pa. Const. art. 12, § 1 (1874) and, hence, with an election within the terms of the Constitution, and given our ruling that no implied prohibition existed, as well as the dissenting opinion on precisely that point, the delegates to the 1967-68 Constitutional Convention must have known only an express prohibition could remove the legislative discretion expressly recognized in <em>McCormick </em>and could hardly be deemed to have intended an implied prohibition by repealing Pa.

To the extent petitioner’s position is based upon Pa. Const. art. 5, § 13(a)(1968) mandating an election, no implied prohibition can arise from this provision because an election involving limited voting satisfies the provision’s mandate. Limited voting in an election was held in <em>McCormick </em>to be an adequate method of satisfying a. statutorily mandated election and the election was constitutional in scope because the statute merely chose the election process allowed by Pa. Const. art. 12, § 1 (1874). No reason has been advanced to distinguish between the term election in Pa. Const. art. 12, § 1 (1874) and in Pa. Const. art. 5, § 13(a), and we know of none.

But petitioner concedes the purpose of the statute is not to insure minority representation, but to encourage it; without doubt, even if the effectiveness is diminished by cross-filing, the statute does have a purpose and to some extent advances that purpose, i. e., it encourages minority representation.

Reeder, </em><a href="/pa/171/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="171 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="985582" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0505-01">171 Pa. 505</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20A.%2067" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="33 A. 67">33 A. 67</a> (1895) to support its conclusion. I believe that a proper analysis of that decision indicates that it not only fails to support the majority’s position but rather is in conflict with it. In <em>Reeder, </em>we upheld by a five to two vote, a limited voting scheme for the election of judges to the then newly created Superior Court. Crucial to that decision was the fact that the Superior Court had been legislatively created (and not constitutionally mandated) and that the Constitution at that time had expressly provided for limited voting for the election of Supreme Court justices. Pa.Const. art. 5, section 16 (1874). The opinion was clear in expressing that the Court was persuaded that since there was a provision for limited voting for the only constitutionally mandated statewide court at that time, the Constitution could not be viewed as prohibiting limited voting in a legislatively created court of statewide jurisdiction. Moreover, the result of the <em>Reeder </em>Court was further supported by art. 12, section 1 which provided “All officers <em>whose selection is not provided for in this constitution </em>shall be elected or appointed, as may be directed by law.” (emphasis added). <em>See </em>present art. 6, section 1 (1968). The <em>Reeder </em>Court was satisfied that for<a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>mer art. 12, section 1, was controlling since nothing else in the former Constitution prevented such a result.</p>
    <p id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[179,430,1150,1172]]]'>The situation under the 1968 Amendment is entirely different. The Commonwealth Court was constitutionally mandated, art. 5, section 1, and was not simply a creature of legislative fiat. The former provision for limited voting for Supreme Court justices was deleted in the 1968 Constitutional Amendment. Unlike the situation presented in <em>Reeder, </em>as conceded by the majority, the selection of the judges to fill the seats under scrutiny is governed by Section 13(a) of the Constitution, thus art. 6, section 1 (the counterpart of former art. 12, section 1) is not available as support for the majority’s result reached in this appeal. Most significant, and ignored by the majority, is that the <em>Reeder </em>Court was able to avoid a determination as to whether the language requiring “election by qualified electors” was incompatible with a scheme of limited voting. Under the 1874 Constitution this requirement was expressly limited to the election of district judges of the common pleas, art. 5, section 15, thus the <em>Reeder </em>Court could legitimately say that it was not applicable to the election of judges of a court of statewide jurisdiction, <em>Com. ex rel.
