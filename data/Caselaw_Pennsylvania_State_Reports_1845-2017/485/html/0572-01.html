A subsequent examination by the Philadelphia Firearms Identification Unit revealed that the .32 caliber spent shell recovered from Boylan’s store was fired from the .32 caliber automatic pistol recovered from the rear of Harper’s residence and that the .32 caliber live round recovered from the store was, at one time, chambered in the .32 caliber automatic pistol recovered near Harper’s residence.</p>

The seizure of the bicycle is supported by the “plain view” doctrine. Harper concedes that o items appearing within the “plain view of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be introduced in evidence.” <em>Harris v.

However, he argues that, since the officers were executing an arrest not based on probable cause, they observed the bicycle only as a result of their illegal action and did not have “a right to be in the position” to view the bicycle.

Here, the .82 caliber automatic pistol was not abandoned as a result of any unlawful and coercive action by the police. The police had probable cause to arrest Harper and were properly on the premises to execute the arrest. Clearly, this is a situation where the party spontaneously abandoned the property on learning of the presence of the police. See <em>Jeffries, </em>supra.

Harper, in his brief to this Court, raises the claim that certain photographs of him, which were allegedly seized from his residence at the time of his alleged illegal arrest, were “used to aid witness identification of [Harper] as the person riding the red bicycle.” However, Harper does not present any argument or explanation concerning this claim. Harper merely states the claim and nothing more. Furthermore, after reviewing the seven volumes of trial testimony in this case, we cannot find one instance when the Commonwealth introduced into evidence any photographs seized from Harper’s residence. Most importantly, since Harper failed to raise this specific claim in his application to suppress the statement and the physical evidence, since no testimony regarding this claim was offered during the suppression hearing, and since the claim was not considered in the suppression court’s extensive findings of fact, any complaint concerning the photographs is waived.
