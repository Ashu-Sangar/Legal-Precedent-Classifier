The testimony established that James Rogers offered to give appellant a ride from a liquor store in New Jersey to Philadelphia. Appellant ended up going to <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>the victim’s home to drink some beer. When the victim began a homosexual assault upon appellant, appellant beat the victim on the face and head and strangled him.</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[240,451,1156,366]]]'>The majority affirms appellant’s conviction in spite of the fact that appellant’s request that he be tried by a judge in lieu of a jury was denied without any reasons being given. Before a jury was selected, appellant stated clearly and unequivocally that he wanted to be tried by a judge. The trial judge replied, “I will not accept that.” The trial judge gave no reasons for his denial at that time.</p>
    <p id="b410-6" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[241,841,1155,366]]]'>Later, in his opinion written after appellant moved for a new trial, the trial judge did state reasons for his denial. None of the reasons given however has ever been recognized as a valid reason for denying appellant a choice given to other defendants. Whether an accused can proceed non-jury should not depend upon the trial judge deciding the request. Appellant was entitled to be tried non-jury.</p>
    <p id="b410-7" data-blocks='[["BL_410.6",410,[241,1230,1154,96]]]'>The judgment of sentence should be reversed and appellant granted a new trial.</p>
