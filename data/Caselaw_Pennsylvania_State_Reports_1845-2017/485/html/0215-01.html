Brandon, pursuant to an agreement with the district attorney,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> entered a plea on September 14, 1976, of guilty of murder of the third degree. As a result of the guilty plea, judgment of sentence of not less than ten nor more than twenty years imprisonment was imposed on October 27, 1976.</p>
    <p id="b248-7" data-blocks='[["BL_248.7",248,[256,1161,1159,545]]]'>Brandon filed an appeal from the judgment of sentence in this Court. Thereafter, on July 13, 1977, appellant filed a “Petition to Remand” with the consent of the district attorney. His final request for relief was to “remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to that court to conduct a hearing to determine whether the appellant has waived his right to file a petition to withdraw guilty plea and/or to file post trial motions, and to grant additional relief if appropriate.” We subsequently issued the following order on August 5, 1977: “Petition Granted. By the Court.”</p>

Subsequently, the court ruled Brandon had waived his right to file a petition to withdraw his guilty plea. For the reasons stated herein, we reverse and remand the matter to the trial court to allow Brandon to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea nunc pro tunc.</p>

This, the court concluded, constituted a waiver by Brandon of his right to file a petition to withdraw the guilty plea. We disagree.</p>
