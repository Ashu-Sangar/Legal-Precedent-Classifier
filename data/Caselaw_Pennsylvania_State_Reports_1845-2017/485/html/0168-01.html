C.W. has another child, D.M.B., born out of wedlock on October 15, 1975. R.L.W. is not the father of D.M.B. R.W.B. was given his mother’s maiden name and, thus, the same last name as D.M.B.</p>

The prospective adopting parents took custody of the child at C.W.’s home in Maryland and returned with him to their home in Uniontown, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. Six days later, on February 17, 1977, C.W. traveled <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>to Uniontown and consented in writing to the adoption of R.W.B. in the office of counsel for the adopting parents.

She was not present when the actual transfer of custody took place, but six days later she traveled to Pennsylvania to give her written consent to his adoption. However, these events occurred shortly after R.W.B.’s birth when she was physically ill and emotionally upset as a result of incidents of harassment by her estranged husband and his girl friend including shots fired at her home, an arson fire at her home, and an attempted kidnapping of R.W.B. During this period, C.W., who was under a doctor’s care, left R.W.B. with a friend for six days in an attempt to restore her health and regain emotional stability. When problems continued, C.W. decided the child would be safer and better cared for by <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>someone else and, thus, contacted the prospective adopting parents.</p>

She was to see him “once in awhile” when she could travel to Pennsylvania. Further, C.W. acknowledged signing a consent form but stated she did not read it and was told it was a consent to custody by the adopting parents until the adoption. In an interview with Child Welfare Services, C.W. stated it was agreed that she would be present at court proceedings legalizing the adoption and that she reserved the right to change her mind. C.W. testified she began to change her mind about giving up the child as soon as she saw him on February 17, 1977 in Pennsylvania. C.W. and the adopting parents remained in contact by telephone throughout the spring and summer. These calls were sometimes initiated by C.W. and sometimes by the adopting parents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Although C.W. missed the child progressively more, she had no money for a trip to Pennsylvania.

C.W. did not appear at the first and at one other scheduled hearing due to her mother’s illness and the death of her father.

Hence, on this record, we cannot agree the court’s conclusion of a “settled purpose” to relinquish parental claim is supported by the facts.</p>

After approximately six months, when the harassment stopped and C.W. regained emotional control, she reevaluated the situation and determined she could, after all, care for the child.

R.W.B.’s father, R.L.W., and mother, C.W., had separated some six months prior to their son’s birth. <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>For the first forty-nine days of R.W.B.’s life, appellant cared for her son.

    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[229,578,1155,475]]]'>Shortly after R.W.B.’s birth, appellant contacted appellees and inquired whether they were still interested in adopting a child. On February 11, 1977, at the direction of appellant, appellees drove from their home in Pennsylvania to Maryland where they obtained custody of R.W.B. Six days later, appellant travelled from Maryland to Pennsylvania for the specific purpose of formally consenting to the adoption of R.W.B. by appellees. While in Pennsylvania she executed such a consent.</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[226,1098,1157,648]]]'>During the next nine months, appellant occasionally spoke to appellees on the telephone. Apparently, calls were initiated by both appellees and appellant. Appellant did not visit her son during this period. Nor did she contribute financially or in any other way toward the physical and emotional well-being of R.W.B. Nonetheless, in August 1977, six months after appellant had surrendered custody of her son for adoption and had executed a consent to his adoption, appellant stated she was willing to regain custody of R.W.B. The orphans’ court specifically found, however, that appellant “performed no affirmative act in accordance with this expressed desire.”</p>

The orphans’ court’s determination that appellant failed to provide her son with essential parental care for at least six months is clearly supported by the record and may not be disturbed by this Court. To reach its conclusion to the contrary, the majority exceeds the bounds of proper appellate review by completely disregarding the findings of the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>orphans’ court. Instead it reads the record de novo as though it and not the orphans’ court were the trier of fact and draws its own entirely independent findings from the notes of testimony.</p>
    <p id="b211-4" data-blocks='[["BL_211.4",211,[204,532,1157,1487]]]'>Moreover, the majority ignores this Court’s repeated admonition that a parent has an affirmative duty to provide his or her child with love, protection, guidance and support.

Temporary hardship does not justify a parent’s failure to fulfill this affirmative obligation. “Parental rights may not be preserved by complete indifference to the daily needs of a child or by merely waiting for some more suitable financial circumstance or convenient time for the performance of parental duties and responsibilities (while others adequately provide the child with her immediate and continuing physical and emotional needs).” <em>Smith Adoption Case, </em><a href="/pa/412/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="412 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1887237" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0501-01">412 Pa. 501</a>, 505, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.2d%20919" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="194 A.2d 919">194 A.2d 919</a>, 922 (1963). “Mere expressions of interest in the child and a desire to eventually be reunited with the child, unaccompanied by affirmative steps to bring that result about, are insufficient to preserve parental rights.” <em>In re Adoption of P., </em><a href="/pa/475/0197-02" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="475 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1734072,1734115" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0197-02,/pa/475/0197-01">475 Pa. 197</a>, 223, <a href="/pa/475/0197-02" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="380 A.2d 311" data-case-ids="1734072" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0197-02">380 A.2d 311</a>, 317 (1977) (Dissenting Opinion of Roberts, J., joined by Eagen, C. J.). Rather than assuming her parental duty to take and maintain a position of importance in R.W.B.’s life and provide her son with love, protection, guidance, and support, appellant simply yielded to what she perceived as obstacles and temporary difficulties. Appellant was satisfied to allow appellees to fulfill the needs of her infant son even after the difficulties she may have encountered in the first weeks of R.W.B.’s life had ended.</p>
