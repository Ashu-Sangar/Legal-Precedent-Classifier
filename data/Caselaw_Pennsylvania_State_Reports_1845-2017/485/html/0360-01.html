The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia denied appellant’s written post-verdict motions and sentenced appellant.

    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[235,495,1156,846]]]'>On August 7, 1975, a complaint charging appellant with criminal homicide and several weapons offenses was filed and an arrest warrant issued. Later the same day federal agents located appellant in North Carolina and arrested him on charges of violating interstate fugitive laws. Federal charges were nol prossed, but appellant remained in custody in North Carolina. The record does not establish when Philadelphia police learned of appellant’s location, what effort was made to secure appellant’s return to Pennsylvania, or if and when appellant opposed his return. It establishes only that on October 13, sixty-seven days after the complaint was filed, appellant signed a form stating he waived extradition, on October 16 Philadelphia police went to North Carolina and arrested him, and on October 17 Philadelphia police returned appellant to Philadelphia for preliminary arraignment.</p>

At no time has the Commonwealth sought an extension of time pursuant to Rule 1100(c). On April 1, 1976, appellant moved under Rule 1100(a)(2) to dismiss all charges with prejudice. Rule 1100(a)(2) directs that “[t]rial in a court case in which a written complaint is filed against the defendant after June <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>30, 1974 shall commence no later than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date on which the complaint is filed.” Appellant claimed the mandatory 180 day period under Rule 1100(a)(2) began to run on August 7, 1975, the date the complaint was filed, and expired February 3, 1976. In the view of the Commonwealth, the mandatory period began October 17, 1975, the date of appellant’s preliminary arraignment in Philadelphia, and did not expire until April 13, 1976. Alternatively, the Commonwealth claimed appellant opposed extradition from August 7 to October 13, 1975, a period of sixty-seven days, and was “unavailable” within the meaning of Rule 1100(d)(1) during this period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[205,892,1147,359]]]'>The hearing court agreed with the Commonwealth’s first contention that, as a matter of law, the mandatory 180 period did not commence until appellant’s preliminary arraignment on October 17. The court did not address the Commonwealth’s alternative contention that appellant was “unavailable” under Rule 1100(d)(1).

Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/472/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="472 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1727722" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0553-01">472 Pa. 553</a>, 559, <a href="/pa/472/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="472 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1727722" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0553-01">372 A.2d 826</a>, 829 (1977) (footnote omitted). Instead, the Common<a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>wealth relies upon its alternative claim raised but not adjudicated in the hearing court that appellant was “unavailable” under Rule 1100(d)(1) for the sixty-seven days between August 7, 1975 and October 13, 1975. The Commonwealth now submits that this period of sixty-seven days should be excluded from the 246 days between complaint and trial.</p>
    <p id="b396-5" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[242,581,1156,1254]]]'>The Commonwealth’s claim that appellant was “unavailable” cannot be resolved on the present record. The Comment to Rule 1100 provides that “the defendant should be deemed unavailable for any period of time during which he could not be apprehended because his whereabouts were unknown and could not be determined by due diligence.” In <em>Commonwealth v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/472/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="472 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1727722" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0553-01">supra,</a> this Court relied upon the Comment to conclude that the Commonwealth is not entitled to the “unavailability” exclusion unless it establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that police acted with due diligence in executing an arrest warrant. <a href="/pa/472/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="472 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1727722" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0553-01">472 Pa. at 562</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="472 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1727722" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0553-01">372 A.2d at 830</a>.

On the other hand, the Comment further provides that the defendant should be deemed “unavailable” for any period “during which he contested extradition, or a responding jurisdiction delayed or refused to grant extradition.” Here, because of its ruling on the date the mandatory 180 day period commenced, the hearing court did not resolve whether police exercised “due diligence” to execute the arrest warrant and secure appellant’s return, or if and when appellant opposed extradition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
