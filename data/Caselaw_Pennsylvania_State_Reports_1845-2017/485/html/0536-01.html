Katz was injured in a fall while employed at the plant of appellee <em>The Evening Bulletin, </em>a Philadelphia newspaper. A Workmen’s Compensation referee held appellant entitled to compensation under The Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The award was affirmed unanimously by the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board. On appeal by the <em>Bulletin </em>and its Workmen’s Compensation insurer, appellee The Employers Mutual Liability Company of Wisconsin, the Commonwealth Court held that appellant had failed to give notice in compliance with Section 312 of the Act, 77 P.S. § 632, and therefore overruled the award of compensation to appellant. We granted allocatur and now vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.6",570,[239,1164,1151,467]]]'>Appellant Katz worked part-time as a substitute “mailer” and “stuffer.” In this capacity, he collected newspapers off the presses and, by machine or by hand, stuffed supplements into the papers and stacked them for distribution. Appellant’s union, the Mailer’s Union, acts as the hiring agent for both the Philadelphia <em>Inquirer </em>and <em>The Evening Bulletin. </em>The newspapers inform the union of the number of substitute part-time mailers they will need on a particular night and the union assigns the jobs to its members.</p>
    <p id="b570-6" data-blocks='[["BL_570.7",570,[236,1650,1152,515]]]'>On May 29, 1970, appellant was directed at the union hall to go that evening to the plant of the <em>Bulletin. </em>Until then, appellant had worked only at the <em>Inquirer. </em>Once at the plant appellant spoke only to the man who showed him to his work area. At the end of his work shift, approximately 2:30 a. m. on the morning of the 30th, appellant left the plant building. In an unlighted area of the employee parking lot, he fell over a broken manhole cover and injured himself. Appellant’s workmen’s compensation claim arose out of this accident.</p>

On the morning of the fall, appellant telephoned the <em>Bulletin </em>and attempted to report his injury. An unidentified clerk told him to report the injury to the union. He tried to do so, but when he found the line busy, did not call again. He did, however, report the injury to his foreman of the <em>Inquirer </em>who, according to appellant’s testimony, “to my knowledge notified the union or the shop steward.” Appellant’s former counsel on June 15, 1970 wrote to the <em>Bulletin </em>that his client had been injured on plant premises at 2:30 a. m. on May 30, 1970.</p>
