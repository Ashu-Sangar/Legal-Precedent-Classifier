    <p id="b451-8" data-blocks='[["BL_451.8",451,[170,839,1149,627]]]'>On July 22, 1976, appellant was convicted of murder of the first degree and possession of instruments of crime. On July 26, 1976, appellant filed post-trial motions and reserved the right to file additional and supplemental motions. No additional or supplemental motions were filed and appellant’s post-trial motions were denied. Appellant was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment for his murder conviction and a consecutive term of one and one-half to three years for the weapon convictions. Appellant now directly appeals from his murder conviction<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and raises as his sole issue for review the admissibility of a dying declaration introduced at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
