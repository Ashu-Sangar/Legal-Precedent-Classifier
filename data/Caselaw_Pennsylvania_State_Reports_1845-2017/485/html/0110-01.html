Subsequently, appellant, Robert Lee Montgomery, was indicted for both killings. On September 13, 1977, Montgomery, while assisted by counsel, plead guilty<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to “two counts of murder of the second degree.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Following a degree-of-guilt hearing, the court “accepted” the pleas of guilt to “murder of the second degree” and immediately imposed the recommended sentences. On September 21, 1977, Montgomery filed a motion requesting the court to reconsider the judgments of sentence. This motion was denied and this appeal followed.</p>
