Though the Tax Act defines “sale at retail,” “use,” “purchase at retail,” and “resale,” it does not establish the tax consequences of all commercial transactions. Instead, the Legislature in Section 580(a) of the Act left to the Department of Revenue the authority “to prescribe, adopt, promulgate and enforce, rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this act.” The Department, in an exercise of this authority, promulgated Regulation 150. This regulation prescribes when, under the Tax Act, a “construction contractor” is a “user” of goods subject to tax, and when the contractor is a “vendor” entitled to claim the “resale” exclusion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Regulation 150 provides:</p>

Since 1956, the Department of Revenue has licensed Beck a “vendor” entitled to claim the “resale” exclusion in transactions with suppliers. Between January 1, 1968 and December 31, 1970, Beck purchased from its suppliers quantities of electrical machinery and equipment, including transformers, a rectifier and switchgear along with electronic clock and master sound systems. Beck claimed the resale exclusion and did not pay to the suppliers any sales tax. Pursuant to several “electrical construction contracts” with the Commonwealth’s General Services Administration (GSA), Beck then sold the electrical equipment to GSA and installed it in several public facilities throughout the Commonwealth. Beck’s contracts with GSA passed along to the GSA Beck’s tax savings. And the GSA paid no sales or use tax to the Commonwealth. (Section 203 of the Tax Act provides that “[t]he tax imposed by section 201 shall not be imposed upon . (i) The sale at retail to, or use by . this Commonwealth or its instrumentalities.”) The contracts between Beck and GSA were not subject to modification to permit Beck to charge for sales or use tax not previously imposed.</p>

Beck and the Commonwealth entered into a stipulation of facts, which included photographs of the items in dispute. A panel of the Commonwealth Court (per Crumlish, Jr., J.) was persuaded by the fact that the parties entered into “electrical construction contracts” and agreed that use tax was properly imposed under Regulation 150 on Beck’s sale and installation of the transformers, rectifier, and switchgear. “They were installed pursuant to an electrical construction contract, and as is amply demonstrated by the photographs and documents in the record, were an integral part of the building’s electrical system.” 32 Pa.Cmwlth. 229, 240, <a href="/citations/?q=379%20A.2d%20626" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="379 A.2d 626">379 A.2d 626</a>, 631 (1977). But the Commonwealth Court disagreed with the Board’s imposition of use tax on the sale and installation of sound and master clock systems. “Aside from the fact that [the sound and master clock systems] were installed pursuant to an electrical construction contract, we find no evidence that they became or were intended to become a permanent part of the real estate as is required by Regulation 150.” 32 Pa.Cmwlth. at 240-41, <a href="/citations/?q=379%20A.2d%20626" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="379 A.2d 626">379 A.2d at 631</a>. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court reduced the assessment by $455.30, the use tax on the clock and sound systems, and directed judgment of $1,031.97, the use tax on the transformers, rectifier, and switchgear. Beck appeals to this Court from the order directing judgment of $1,031.97; the Commonwealth appeals from the order insofar as it reduces judgment by $455.30.</p>

But the Regulation’s inclusion, by way of example (4), of “machinery and equipment not permanently affixed to the real estate and not becoming a part thereof,” makes clear that the kind of connection made to electrical sources is not controlling.
