    <p id="b43-6" data-blocks='[["BL_43.5",43,[194,684,1146,903]]]'>Two police officers patrolling downtown Reading in separate vehicles observed Fisher and two companions walking down the street at about 3:30 a. m. Officer Paul Brown approached the three men and asked for their identification. When the three replied they had none, the officer asked their names and addresses. During this questioning, Fisher walked to the far side of Officer Brown’s vehicle and bent down. The second police officer, Sergeant Arndt, who arrived during the questioning of the men, observed Fisher take an object from his pocket and bend over next to Officer Brown’s car, and he heard a click as Fisher appeared to throw some object under the car. The men were put into a police wagon to be taken to police headquarters for further identification. The object Sergeant Arndt retrieved from beneath his vehicle consisted of a metal handle, with two finger holes, which incorporates two cutting blades, one facing outward,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the other inward.</p>
    <p id="b43-7" data-blocks='[["BL_43.6",43,[195,1607,1145,150]],["BL_44.1",44,[259,249,1156,643]]]'>Fisher maintains the object which he allegedly possessed, a “Wyoming Knife,” is not a prohibited offensive weapon according to the terms of Section 908 of the Crimes Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
      <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>At trial, he introduced into evidence an advertisement from a sporting goods magazine which depicts an implement called a “Wyoming Knife” and describes it as an “all purpose cutting tool for skinning wild game — ideal for cleaning all game and fish.” The knife is displayed as part of an array of hunting knives. The object allegedly possessed by Fisher bears the marking “WK” and is apparently identical to the advertised implement. Thus, Fisher reasons, because a Wyoming Knife is not enumerated in the definition of an offensive weapon and because he established the knife has a common lawful purpose, it cannot be considered an offensive weapon prohibited by Section 908.</p>
    <p id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.5",44,[251,957,1161,1065]]]'>Fisher is correct in his assertion that a Wyoming Knife is not among the items specifically enumerated in Section 908(c). While cutting instruments are specially listed, along with daggers, knives and razors, the portion of Section 908(c) which enumerates these objects with blades is limited by the phrase “the blade of which is exposed in an automatic way by switch, push-button, spring mechanism, or otherwise.” See <em>Commonwealth v. Cartagena, </em><a href="/pa/482/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="482 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="1749677" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0006-01">482 Pa. 6</a>, 28, <a href="/pa/482/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="482 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="1749677" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0006-01">393 A.2d 350</a>, 361 (1978) (plurality opinion). Any other reading of this phrase of the statute would render possession of almost any instrument with a blade a punishable offense, no matter how commonplace the object. Our purpose in interpreting statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and we may presume the legislature did not intend á result that is absurd or unreasonable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> We conclude a Wyoming Knife is not among the objects specifically enumerated by Section 908(c) because, although it is a cutting instrument, its blades are not exposed in an automatic way by switch, push-button, spring mechanism, or otherwise.</p>

      <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>Fisher’s contention that a Wyoming Knife also does not constitute an implement for the infliction of serious bodily injury which serves no common lawful purpose presents a more difficult question. In resolving this issue, the Superior Court relied upon the reasoning of <em>Commonwealth v. Gatto, </em><a href="/pa-super/236/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="236 Pa. Super. 92" data-case-ids="6770487" data-case-paths="/pa-super/236/0092-01">236 Pa.Super. 92</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=344%20A.2d%20566" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="344 A.2d 566">344 A.2d 566</a> (1975). In <em>Gatto, </em>the Superi- or Court held a knife with a thirty-inch blade was an implement for the infliction of serious bodily injury which served no common lawful purpose, and possession of it was therefore punishable under Section 908. The court reasoned that every knife, as well as every enumerated offensive weapon, has some conceivable lawful purpose, but that a knife with a thirty-inch blade had no common lawful purpose under the circumstances, viz. possession in the downtown area of a large city in the middle of the night. In order to reach a “reasonable” construction, the court interpreted the words “no common lawful purpose” to read “no common lawful purpose <em>under the circumstances.”</em>

Section 908 does not impose this requirement. This is attributable to the divergent purposes of the two provisions. The items proscribed by Section 908, bombs and grenades for example, generally have no common lawful purpose; possession of these implements is prohibited in all but the most limited circumstances, i. e., when authorized by law. Since the items comprehended by Section 907 have both lawful and unlawful uses, proof of criminal intent is required.</p>
