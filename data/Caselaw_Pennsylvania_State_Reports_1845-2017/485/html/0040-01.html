    <p id="b74-6" data-blocks='[["BL_74.6",74,[240,560,1160,1279]]]'>On July 9,1974, the City of Pittsburgh filed a complaint in equity in Commonwealth Court. The City sought to enjoin the Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections’ use, without a zoning permit, of 535 South Aiken Avenue as a pre-release center for female convicts. 535 South Aiken Avenue was zoned “residential.” Commonwealth Court held that the Bureau, as an agent of the Commonwealth, was not required to comply with municipal zoning ordinances and regulations and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, this Court held that in exercising the power to zone, municipalities are agents of the Commonwealth, just as is the Bureau of Corrections. We further concluded that where there is an apparent conflict in the use of powers conferred upon Commonwealth agents by the Legislature, “we must look to the intent o¥ the Legislature to determine which exercise of authority is to prevail.” <a href="/pa/468/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="468 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1719702" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0174-01">468 Pa. 174</a>, 182, <a href="/pa/468/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="468 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1719702" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0174-01">360 A.2d 607</a>, 612 (1976).

The Bureau concedes that Section 7 of the Act of 1927, 53 P.S. § 25057<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> creates the standard procedure by which to challenge the constitutionality or lawfulness of local zoning ordinances and regulations. The Bureau argues, however, <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>that it has no statutory remedy and, thus, no adequate remedy at law because the court of common pleas has stayed, pending the outcome of this litigation, the Bureau’s appeal of a denial of a zoning permit with respect to one of the properties in this dispute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In this exceptional circumstance, the Bureau contends, equity must consider the constitutionality of the ordinance it is enforcing.</p>
    <p id="b76-5" data-blocks='[["BL_76.8",76,[265,626,1153,354]]]'>But this argument is self-defeating. The very fact that there is a legal proceeding pending at which the constitutional claim may be litigated undermines any claim that there is no statutory remedy.

See Pa.R.C.P. 1035(b). The Affidavit of William J.

In my view, the rule requiring the pursuit of exclusive statutory remedies is proper only when applied to a <em>plaintiff </em>who has selected the wrong forum in which to raise a challenge to a zoning ordinance. In such a case it is appropriate to put plaintiff out of court and compel him to pursue the statutory remedy, because, at least at that stage, plaintiff is in exclusive control of the lawsuit. In fact, the case cited by the majority as direct authority for its holding, <em>Pittsburgh Outdoor Advertising Co. v. Clairton, </em><a href="/pa/390/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="390 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1275665" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0001-01">390 Pa. 1</a>, 9-10, <a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20542" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="133 A.2d 542">133 A.2d 542</a> (1957), applied the rule to exactly that procedural posture. <em>But see Honey Brook Twp. v.

In the instant case, the Bureau had no control over the choice of forums. It was hailed into the court of equity by the City to defend itself against the claim for injunctive relief. The effect of the majority’s present application of the rule requiring pursuit of statutory remedies prevents defendants from asserting all available defenses in an equitable proceeding. I do not think the rule was intended to have such an effect, nor do I consider such a result to be proper.</p>
