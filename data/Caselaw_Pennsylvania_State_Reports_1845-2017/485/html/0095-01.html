Appellants both argue that the trial court abused its discretion in discharging a principal juror and substituting an alternate juror. During the trial, the judge called all counsel into chambers and advised that the Court Administrator had received a message from juror No. 4’s father. This letter stated that juror No. 4 was to arrange a job interview for a teaching position. Since apparently an interview could not be arranged prior to the deadline established by the School District, the trial judge discharged the juror notwithstanding appellants’ objections.</p>
    <p id="b130-10" data-blocks='[["BL_130.10",130,[263,1700,1156,152]]]'>Pa.R.Crim.P. § 1108(a) establishes when a principal juror may be replaced by an alternative juror. Rule 1108(a) states in pertinent part:</p>

Black, </em><a href="/pa/474/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="474 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1732162" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0047-01">474 Pa. 47</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="474 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1732162" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0047-01">376 A.2d 627</a> (1977) although some members dissented on other grounds, this Court upheld <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>the replacement of a juror by an alternate. However, that juror was “disqualified” since the first defense witness was the sister of the juror.</p>

The terms of Rule 1108(a), are unambiguous and must be given their natural meaning. <em>Cf. Commonwealth ex rel. Walton v. Aytch, </em><a href="/pa/466/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="466 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1714993" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0172-01">466 Pa. 172</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="466 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1714993" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0172-01">352 A.2d 4</a> (1976) (retrial barred where trial court improperly discharged a juror who was unsuccessful in hiring a babysitter for her children). The need of scheduling a job interview does not make a juror “unable” to serve and appellants are entitled to a new trial.</p>

There is no evidence to support a finding of deliberate and premeditated killing. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2502(d). Use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body, standing alone, is not enough to support a finding of “premeditation.” <em>Commonwealth v.
