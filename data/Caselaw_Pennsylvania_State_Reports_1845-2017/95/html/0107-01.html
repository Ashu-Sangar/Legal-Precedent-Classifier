This contention is no doubt correct to the extent that separate judgments cannot be entered against the same party at the instance of different parties. Nor can two judgments be entered either against all of the parties'jointly nor against any one separately. In other words there can be but one suit and one judgment, for the penalty against any of the obligors. The cases Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Straub, 11 Casey 187, Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Cope, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20161" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Wright 161">9 Wright 161</a>, decide that the pendency of a prior suit upon an official bond may be pleaded in bar of a second action.

In no case has it been held that suit may not be brought and judgment recovered against a party to a bond according to the terms of his bond. Estates of deceased co-obligors are not discharged by their death. But their representatives cannot be sued jointly with the survivors : 1 Chitty PI. 50 ; Beeson <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <em><a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20161" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Wright 161">supra.</a> </em>Here then is one case where the action must be separate. The Act of 1836 cannot, I apprehend, be construed, as implied, by changing the common law in this respect, and requiring a joint action on such a case ; no case has been cited on the argument, nor can any be found which hold that an action brought against them and the survivors would lie. But a separate action may be maintained against them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.6",109,[181,982,1159,258]]]'>“ It follows that the Act of 1836 was not intended to change the law further than to prevent repeated actions against the same person, and at the same time to afford ample .remedy to all persons interested. In doing this there is manifested no intention to prevent the parties upon official bonds being subject to a recovery of the penalty by action according to their contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b109-7" data-blocks='[["BL_109.7",109,[180,1241,1160,805]]]'>“ It is admitted by the demurrer that at the time it was filed no judgment had been rendered in favor of the Commonwealth in any other suit on the bond. There had been a verdict, but no judgment entered thereon. But if there had been a judgment, the right to maintain a suit against a several obligor would have been preserved to the plaintiff by the Act of 11th April 1848, Purd. Dig. 1121, which provides that a recovery .against one or more joint and several’obligors without any plea in abatement that all were not joined, shall not be a bar to any subsequent suit against any person who might have been joined in the action in which judgment was obtained. This act is general in its terms, and is applicable as well to official bonds as to other obligations. It has never been the law in this state that the bringing of separate suit against a joint and several obligor operates as a discharge of another obligor or of the estate of a deceased obligor. Formerly where suit was brought against all the obligors jointly and severally bound, and one died, his estate was discharged: Miller <em>v. </em>Reed, 3 Casey 244. This was remedied by the third section of the Act of 1848.</p>

Haupt, as prothonotary of the county of Northumberland, in the sum of five thousand dollars,” as appears in both praecipe and summons; and the declaration, filed before the end of seven years from the date of the cause of action, was drawn in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania suggesting Beula Mettler as plaintiff. The ground of the suit and the name of the plaintiff in interest were explicitly set forth in the original writ and pleadings, and have not been changed; the omission of the. uninterested but necessary legal plaintiff has been supplied. Surely no real injury was done to the defendant, he was served with process, appeared to the action, and knew the law permitted amendment. This is not <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>the case of a change in the subject of the action, nor of the name of the actor in bringing the suit, nor of the addition of a defendant, but of adding a mere legal plaintiff who had nothing to do in the commencement or conduct of the suit. Therefore, the principle stated in Kaul <em>v. </em>Lawrence, 23 P. F. Smith 410, relied on by the defendant, will not avail him. Had the name of Beula Mettler been struck out and the name of another inserted, or another plaintiff in interest added, or the description of the subject of the suit changed, then, indeed, the defendant could have well insisted on the principle that no amendment should deprive him-of the benefit of the Statute of Limitations or other meritorious defence, as against the actor added, or the subject newly described.</p>
    <p id="b112-6" data-blocks='[["BL_112.6",112,[252,980,1160,1412]]]'>The second question presented is, whether separate actions may be brought against the obligors on the official bond of a prothonotary, which is joint and several, as it is required to be by statute. This is clearly answered in the opinion of the learned judge of the Common Pleas. The rule is, that when the obligation is joint and several, the obligee is at liberty to sue all the obligors jointly or each of them separately. Unable to gainsay the general application of the rule, the defendant contends it is abrogated by the Act of June 14th 1836, Pamph. L. 639, as respects actions on official bonds. Prior to this statute, as many suits might have been brought on an official bond, as there were persons holding several interests, as often as damages were sustained, and that was the mischief it was intended to remedy by permitting but one suit to be so conducted as to give every person having a claim the advantage of a trial as fully as if he had a separate action. The act defines and regulates the remedy on official bonds so as to require every person interested to join in the suit commenced, instead of bringing one for himself. The pendency of a suit on such bond is a bar to a subsequent action on the same instrument against the same parties, and may be so pleaded: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Straub et al., 11 Casey 137; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Cope et al., <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20161" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 Wright 161">9 Wright 161</a>. In those cases the actions were against the same parties as in the former suits, and there was no question as to the right to bring a separate action against each obligor. Had the legislature intended to take away such right, it would have been easy to say so and also highly proper to have defined the procedure where one or more of the obligors had died. A right at common law is not abrogated by statute, unless there be clear repugnancy. The act contains no prohibition of separate suits against the officer and each of his sureties. It provides that the obligors may plead performance of the condition of the bond so far as respects the person or persons conducting the suit; and that may be done as readily when sued separately as jointly</p>
