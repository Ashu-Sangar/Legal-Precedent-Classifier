Innis, wife of William Innis, by virtue of a contract with Calvin T. Chamberlain, and was in her actual possession, being part of a larger tract held by her under said Chamberlain contract. That said Lois M. Innis and William Innis leased to E. H. Watkins ‘for, the term of fifteen years for the purpose of obtaining oil,’ a part of the land then in her possession, described as follows, viz.: ‘Fifty acres of my, the first party’s, homestead,’ without designation of boundaries or other description than as given above. That there was a contemporaneous parol agreement by which Mrs. Innis, then having fifty-six acres to lease, was to <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>be at liberty to locate the six acres so as to cover the buildings occupied by her, and such other land adjacent as she pleased, and the remainder of the fifty-six acres should be covered by the written lease. That said Lois M. Innis never has located the said six acres, so as to be held by her. That said lease of fifty acres was dated 11th November 1877, was duly signed and acknowledged by Lois M. Innis and her husband, and delivered to the said Watkins. That it contained, inter alia, the following agreement: “Said E. H. Watkins agrees ‘to commence and complete a well in four months from date of the lease, and the second well on same land in eight months after the completion of the first,’ &amp;c. Also, ‘if the party of the second part fail to comply with this contract, then it is null and void and of no effect.’ The work done under the lease by E. II. Watkins was, to begin work on a rig on the 27th of March 1878, more than four months after the date of the contract. Work was suspended within a few days and nothing more done until July. On .the 17th of July he began to drill, and on the 22d of August completed the first well. The following extensions of time for completing the first well were made in Avriting and endorsed on or attached to the lease, viz.: 14th March 1878, extension to 5th of August, signed by Mrs. Innis and her husband. 18th July 1878, extension for twenty days from the first of August next, signed Lois M. Innis. It also appears that on the 6th of July about $20 in money was paid by E. H. Watkins to Innis and Avife for compensation for delay. Neither of the agreements for an extension of time were acknowledged by Mrs. Innis. The title of E. H. Watkins is now vested in the plaintiff by agreements in writing of date 22d September 1878. The title of the defendant was obtained from Mrs. Innis and husband, who sold their title to him and assigned their contract from O. T. Chamberlain on the 28th of August 1878. This action is brought for that portion of the land leased to E. H. Watkins, Avhich may be called the south half. The other half having been transferred by him to John Knott as the consideration in full for the Avork done upon the first well prior to his sale to the plaintiff. That neither Lois M. Innis nor W. Innis, her husband, gaye any notice of, or did any act indicating their intention to repudiate the agreements, extending the time of performance until about the time the Avell Avas completed in August 1878.”</p>

No work having been done within the four months from November 11th 1877, the lease became null and void at the expiration of that time in accordance with its terms. 3. Mrs. Innis, being under disability, could renew, resuscitate or remake the lease by the same formalities necessary to its creation, and in no other way. 4. That upon defendant’s second request therefore, the court find that the agreement of March 14th is inoperative, because unacknowledged by- Mrs. Innis. 5. That the agreement of July 18th 1878, is also inoperative and for the same reason. 6. That, however, the receipt of July 6th 1878, might operate by way of estoppel against one <em>sui juris, </em>it cannot estop Mrs. Innis because under disability. 7. That inasmuch as the plaintiff shows neither performance of his agreement, or such a renewal thereof as is binding upon Mrs. Innis, the proposition contained in the fourth request of defendant’s counsel is affirmed. The court find that the plaintiff has shown no right to a recovery in this case. Upon the whole case, therefore, the court find in favor of the defendant; accordingly let judgment be entered in favor of the defendant.”</p>

Innis. By agreement filed the parties waived a trial by jury, and submitted the case to the decision of the court. The facts found and admitted show, inter alia, that Mrs. Innis, a married woman, held a title to, and was in the actual possession of, a tract of land called her “homestead.” While thus holding and in the possession thereof, she and her husband of the one part, and one Watkins of the other part, entered into an <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>article of agreement, dated the 11th November 1877, whereby the party of the first part agreed to lease to Watkins fifty acres of said land for the term of fifteen years, for the purpose of obtaining oil; said Watkins agreed to pay one-eighth part of the oil found on the premises, and to commence and complete one oil well in four months from the date of the lease or contract. It was further stipulated if he failed “ to comply with this contract, then it is null and void and of no effect.” The boundaries of the land on which Watkins might experiment for the discovery of oil were not designated in the writing. There was a cotemporaneous parol agreement by which Mrs. Innis might locate six acres so as to cover the buildings occupied by her, and such other lands adjoining as she pleased, and the written lease cover the residue of the fifty-six acres. The court found in fact that she never located the six acres. The land let to Watkins was “ wild timber land and unenclosed.”</p>
    <p id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[236,1098,1170,730]]]'>Watkins did not complete nor even commence a well, Avithin four months after the date of his agreement. On the 27th March 1878, he began work on a rig : but it Avas suspended within a few days and nothing done until July. On the 17th July he began to drill, and on the 22d August completed the first Avell. The Avritten agreement of the 11th November 1877 Avas duly acknowledged by Mrs. Innis and husband. On the 28th August 1878, they sold and assigned the land to the defendant. The plaintiff seeks to recover on a title acquired from Watkins on the 22d of September following. As the latter did not perform the act necessary to continue the term, Avithin the time stipulated in the Avritten contract, it thereby, by its terms, became “null and void and of no effect.” The plaintiff claims such effect shall not be given to the failure of Watkins to fulfil his contract for tAvo reasons : one, that there was no sufficient re-entry by Mrs. Innis to make the agreement of forfeiture effective; the other, that a right to declare the forfeiture was waived by a subsequent agreement of the parties to the contract.</p>
    <p id="b266-7" data-blocks='[["BL_266.7",266,[236,1828,1168,603]]]'>In considering what weight should be given to the first reason, due regard must be had to the condition of the land and the purpose of the written contract. The land was wholly unimproved. The. object was to compel the sinking of wells for the purpose of ascertaining whether it contained oil. The precise limits Avithin which the experiment should be made were not designated. Watkins was not allowed any indefinite time in which to complete a Avell. It Avas to be done within the time specified. If not then done, all rights under the contract were to be void. If the Avell was completed, and no oil Avas found, no payment was to be made. Although the instrument contained some words incident to a lease, yet its main purpose Avas more in the nature of a contract to search for oil. No <em>certain </em>profit Avas reserved or agreed to be paid. It was wholly contingent on the finding of oil.</p>

With us much depends on the terms of the instrument. If no formal re-entry be thereby contemplated, none is required. We have shown that substantially the instrument gave only a license to search for oil within no distinctly defined boundaries. The court found, as a fact, that the land in controversy was in the actual possession of Mrs. Innis, from a date prior to the 11th November 1877, until she sold to the defendant. We discover no sufficient evidence to convict the court of error in so finding. Then she having been continually in lawful possession, no re-entry was necessary to revest the estate. The breach of condition operated as a forfeiture of all right in Watkins, and the whole estate revested in her by operation of law: Hamilton <em>v. </em>Elliott, 5 S. &amp; R. 375 ; Kenrick <em>v. </em>Smick, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 41" data-case-ids="481810" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0041-01">7 W. &amp; S. 41</a>; Sheaffer <em>v. </em>Sheaffer, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20525" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Wright 525">1 Wright 525</a>; Davis <em>v. </em>Moss, 2 Id. 346.</p>
