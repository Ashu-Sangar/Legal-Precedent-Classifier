It was held that no one could use the ferry franchises unless by purchase or assignment from M. or his heirs. It appeared that defendants erected the ferry with the consent of the heirs, some of whom were associated with defendants in the operation of the ferry: <em>Held, </em>that it was of no consequence that the heirs of M. had not parted with all their rights in the ferry franchises; that it was of no concern to plaintiffs whether defendants had a conveyance of the franchises or only a license to use them, as either would be a sufficient protection.</p>

The Act of 1813 confers the ferry franchises upon “John Myers, his heirs and assigns.” The main object of the legislature in granting this franchise, as aforesaid, was to provide the people with a safe, convenient and economical means of crossing the river at the place designated, and to have the same kept up there. The five heirs concerned in the erection and use of the ferry had a right to enter upon and use the same, being only accountable, in a proper action at law, to their co-tenants; and there is no principle of law which would prevent them from associating the defendants below with them in the same, and thus effecting the purpose and intention of the legislature in the passage of the Act of 1813.</p>

The learned master further finds, however, that the appellants have no right to erect and maintain the ferry, for the reason that they have “ entirely failed to establish by evidence that they hold the grant made by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to John Myers, either by purchase or assignment, and that therefore they are without right or title to any franchise under which they can justify the erection and operation of said ferry.” This finding is a conclusion of law. The facts upon which it is based are not found. The evidence, however, is before us, and if it shows the learned master has drawn an inaccurate conclusion from the facts, there is no reason why we may not correct it.</p>

The case went to a master, and the evidence taken fully sustains every averment as above set forth. Indeed, the facts as averred are not disputed. The contention is that because there was no formal assignment or conveyance of the rights of the Myers heirs to the franchises in question, they could not, in conjunction with the other defendants, erect and maintain 'this ferry. But no formal assignment was necessary. The heirs having the right to set up the ferry could authorize any one else to do so. That they did so authorize the defendants clearly appears. James Myers, one of the heirs, testified: “ We consented that they should have the ferry there before it was erected, provided that they would put in the pier. They have never refused to build this pier. As soon as they got under way they intended to go to work at the pier, but the sheriff came down and stopped them. By ‘we’ I mean John and mother and myself, who were all that were there; we saw the rest of the family and got their consent. The posts were erected on each side of the river, and a wire rope stretched across; on this pulleys were fixed that were attached to ropes fastened to the flat, and it was thus propelled. We understood it so when we gave our consent.”</p>
