To impair the general confidence in the purity and efficiency of the administration of distributive justice is a vital injury to it, and the attorney who abuses the public credulity, with a view to that effect, cannot complain if the faculties from which his capacity for mischief is mainly derived be taken away from him. The power of the judiciary in this country rests upon the faith of the people in its integrity. Take away this faith and the moral influence of the courts is gone and popular respect for law impaired. Law with us is an obstruction. It is personified in the courts as its ministers, but its efficacy depends upon the moral convictions of the people. When confidence in the courts is gone, respect for the law itself will speedily disappear, and society will become the prey of fraud, violence and crime.”</p>

The remedy by writ of error, which properly requires two parties, is certainly not the best which could have been devised, and what is meant by reviewing the case <em>de novo </em>is not very intelligible unless it be from what follows that the court is to hear any new testimony which may be offered by the complainant, but not by the court below or any other parties, if there can be any others. On the whole it is a curious piece of legislative patchwork^ How far the provision that this court shall hear new testimony and decide the case as if it was a new one consists with that article of the Constitution which prohibits the Supreme Court from the exercise of any original jurisdiction, except in a few specified cases, is a question which does not arise, as the controversy here is presented fully on the record, and we áre not asked to look out of it.</p>

It charged that the acquittal “was secured by a prostitution of the machinery of justice to serve the exigencies of the Republican party,” and added that as the judges belonged to that party it was “ unanimous — for once — that it need take no cognisance of the imposition practised upon it and the disgrace attaching to it.” We may safely assume that it meant to charge and did charge that the judge had decided the case wrongfully from motives of political partisanship.

By the seventy-third section of the Act of April 14th 1834, Pamph. L. 354, it is expressly enacted that “if any attorney-at-law shall misbehave himself in his office of attorney he shall bo liable to suspension, removal from office or to such other penalties as have heretofore been allowed in such cases by the laws of this Commonwealth.” We do not mean to say — for the case does not call for such an opinion — that there may not be eases of misconduct not strictly professional which would clearly show a person not to be fit to be an attorney nor fit to associate with honest men. Thus if he was proved to be a thief, a forger, a perjurer or guilty of other offences of the <em>crimen falsi. </em>But no one, we suppose, will contend that for such an offence he can be summarily convicted and disbarred by the court without a formal indictment, trial and conviction by a jury, or upon confession in open court. Whether a libel is an offence of such a character may be a question, but certain it is that if the libel in this case had been upon a private individual, upon a public officer, such even as the district-attorney, the court could not have summarily convicted the defendants and disbarred them. The office of an attorney is his property, and he cannot be deprived of it unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land, this last phrase meaning, as we have been taught by Lord Coke, “ due process of law.” By the seventh section of the first article of the Constitution of 1874 — the Bill of Rights — it is declared that “ no conviction shall be had in any prosecution for the publication of papers relating to the official conduct of officers or men in public capacity, or to any other matter proper for public investigation or information where the fact that such publication was not maliciously or negligently made, shall be established to the satisfaction of the jury.” This is a new and very important provision introduced into the Bill of Rights by the Constitution of 1873. It-would be a clear infraction of the spirit if not the letter of this article to hold that an attorney can be summarily disbarred <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>for the publication of a libel on a man in a public capacity or where the matter was proper for public investigation or information ; for as he certainly does not forfeit his constitutional rights as a freeman by becoming an attorney, it guarantees to him immunity from all liability to punishment in the case of “ the publication of 'papers relating to the official conduct of officers or men in public capacity where the fact that such publication was not maliciously or negligently made shall be established to the satisfaction of the jury-”</p>
    <p id="b238-7" data-blocks='[["BL_238.6",238,[256,806,1160,214]]]'>But the gravamen of the offence of the complainants was that the publication was a libel on the court of which they were attorneys, and this, it is earnestly contended, was “ misbehavior in their office,” which gave the court power to exercise summary jurisdiction by removing them.</p>

Fidelity to the court’includes many particulars, but they all evidently concern his official relations. <em>“ </em>The sum of the matter,” says Chief Justice Gibson, in Austin’s Case, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Rawle%20205" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="5 Rawle 205">5 Rawle 205</a>, “is that an attorney-at-law holds his office during good behavior, and that he is not professionally answerable for a scrutiny into the official conduct of the judges which would not expose him to legal animadversion as a citizen.”</p>

But there are two considerations bearing upon the question which now exist, but did not at the time that decision was rendered. The first is, the new provision on the subject of the liberty of the press which has been introduced into the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of 1874, and the second is that at that time the judiciary was not elective. Judges, in 1835, were appointed by the governor, and their tenure of office was during good behavior. There might then be some reason for holding that an appeal to the tribunal of popular opinion was in all cases of judicial misconduct a mistaken course and unjustifiable’ in an attorney. The proceedings by impeachment or address were the course and the only course which could be resorted to effectually to remedy the supposed evil. To petition the legislature was then the proper step. To appeal to the people was to diminish confidence in the court and bring them into contempt without any good result. We need not say that the case is altered and that it is now the right and the duty of a lawyer to bring to the notice of the people who elect the judges every instance of what he believes to be corruption or partisanship. No class of the community ought to be allowed freer scope in the expression or <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>publication of opinions as to the capacity, impartiality or integrity of judges than members of the bar. They have the best opportunities of observing and forming a correct judgment. They are in constant attendance on the courts. Hundreds of those who are called on to vote never enter a court-house, or if they do, it is only at intervals as jurors, witnesses or parties. To say that an attorney can only act or speak on this subject under liability to be called to account and to be deprived of his profession and livelihood by the very judge or judges whom he may consider it his duty to attack and expose, is a position too monstrous to be entertained for a moment under our present system.</p>
    <p id="b239-6" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[198,881,1162,990]]]'>In admitting, as he seems to do, that a libel on the court may be a breach of professional' duty in an attorney, Chief Justice HIB-SON adds a most material qualification. “ The motiea should be clearly shown to have been the acquirement of an influence over the judge in the exercise of his 'judicial functions by the instrumentality of popular prejudice.” No such motive has been or can be imputed to these complainants. The learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court below imputes no such motive to them. He says : “ Their motive, though not openly or at all avowed in the publication, is too obvious to admit of doubt. The least reprehensible motive by which their'professional misconduct can be supposed to have been animated is a desire for prominence or notoriety in the editorial corps. The real or true motive could be no other than partisan malice or a wilful headlong zeal to promote partisan interests in the face of their official fidelity to this court and regardless of all consequences.” Suppose the motives here assigned to be the true motives which actuated the complainants — a desire for notoriety, partisan malice, and a wilful headlong zeal to promote partisan interests — what had they to do with- professional conduct or fitness to practice law ? The complainants, in their sworn answers to the rule, aver that in making the publication in question, they were “ acting in good faith, without malice, and for the public good.”</p>

If this were a mere question of discretion, we are of opinion their order was a mistake. The Act of 1879 gives this court jurisdiction to review the discretion of the court below, and we think it was not in this case wisely exercised.</p>
