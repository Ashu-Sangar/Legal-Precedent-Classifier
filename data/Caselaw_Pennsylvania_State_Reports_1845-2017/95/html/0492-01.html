The undisputed facts being that at the time the plaintiff’s dwelling-house was destroyed by fire, no one was living in it and no one had been living in it for four days prior to that time, and no notice of that fact having been given to the defendant and its consent obtained to such non-occupancy, the house was vacant within the meaning of the contract between the parties, as contained in the policy on which this suit is brought, and there can be no recovery.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b493-9" data-blocks='[["BL_493.9",493,[152,1133,1166,294]]]'>2. The occupancy of a dwelling-house consists in living in it, and if the plaintiff' absented himself from the said house from Wednesday prior to the fire, and was still absent when the fire occurred, which was Sunday morning, during, which time no one occupied the house, it constituted such a vacation as was contemplated in the contract between the parties, and the verdict should be for the defendant.</p>
