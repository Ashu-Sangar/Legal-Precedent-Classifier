The board of managers consists of five citizens of the county of Allegheny, annually appointed by the inspectors of the Allegheny county prison. At the time of the alleged employment of the plaintiff by the said corporation, the board of managers consisted of the following-named citizens, viz., Hugh McNeil, president, James P. Fleming, George W. Hailman, O. J. Schultz and Ur. Thomas Shaw. John L. Kennedy was superintendent.</p>

The defendant denied the employment of the plaintiff. The latter, to support his claim, testified that Hugh McNeil, the president of the board of managers, and John L. Kennedy, superintendent of the defendant, authorized him to sell the barrels, and, in pursuance of the authority thus given, he went to Charles Lockhart, president of the Standard Oil Company, and tried to get him to purchase the barrels for the <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>year 1878 at $1.30; Lockhart said it was too high, and that he would not give that price; Moore then asked him what he would say at $1.25: he said he would consider it, and consult others about it. This Lockhart communicated to the superintendent by letter of November 13th 1877, requesting him to submit it to the board, which he did, but the board took no notice of or action on it; no answer was sent to plaintiff.</p>

D. Moore, in relation to a contract for supplying him with barrels during the coming year. It was on motion referred to monthly committee, with power to act.” The monthly committee consisted -of Hailman, Schultz and Fleming. No answer was made to the letter, or further notice taken of it than what appears in the above minutes. The board met on December 4th 1877, and the committee in regard to making contract for barrels was continued, with power to act. This committee, on December 18th 1877, reported to the board of managers as follows, viz.: “ The committee in regard to contracting with the Standard Oil Company for barrels, say “that-they had agreed to contract with them to furnish 4000 barrels per week, during the coming year, at $1.20 per barrel, without any commission, the Standard Company to have the privilege of furnishing iron, if at as low a price as can be had elsewhere. The iron to be of Pittsburgh manufacture. All the conditions about deliverihg to be the same as last year, except the barrels at Standard, 1 and 3, and at Eagle and Petrolia refineries, to be delivered in building, instead of on wharf.” The report was accepted, approved, and the superintendent, with the committee, was instructed to enter into a contract with the Standard Company in accordance with the above report. In pursuance of the authority of the board, the above committee, in connection with the superintendent, entered into a contract with the Standard Company for the sale of all barrels made during the year 1878, at $1.20 per barrel. The defendant below had been, through barrel brokers, selling its barrels to the Standard Company (every year) for several years prior to 1877, knew of its existence and the fact that it was yearly in need of barrels, so that what the plaintiff did the defendant alleged was not instrumental in introducing the Standard Company to the defendant, and what he did was done without authority from the defendant, as those whom he alleged employed him had no authority to do so. Both McNeil and Kennedy denied positively that they had <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>eve* employed him to sell the barrels of 1878, or told him that they were authorized by the board to do so.</p>

    <p id="b411-7" data-blocks='[["BL_411.10",411,[201,920,1160,770]]]'>It must be conceded that the plaintiff below had no right to recover without proving to the satisfaction of the jury, by competent and sufficient testimony, that he was employed by the corporation defendant to sell or procure a purchaser for the barrels it would manufacture during the year 1878, and that, in pursuance of such employment, he either sold the barrels or procured a purchaser for them. His action was grounded solely on these allegations of fact, all of which were denied by the defendant; and, of course, the burden of making out his case was on him. He endeavored to establish the fact of his employment by proving what had been said by the president of the board of managers, by one of the members of the board and by the superintendent of the workhouse, each separately and on different occasions. He utterly failed to show that any corporate action was had by the board, by virtue of which he was employed or by which the power to employ him was delegated to any member of the board or to the superintendent. The testimony on this point tended rather to negative the fact of any such action on the part of the board.</p>
    <p id="b411-8" data-blocks='[["BL_411.11",411,[204,1686,1160,736]],["BL_412.1",412,[243,406,1166,1457]]]'>By the Act of March 23d 1872, the board of managers, composed of five citizens of the county, was made a public corporation by the name of “ The Allegheny County Workhouse .and Inebriate Asylum,” with full power and authority to establish, erect and manage the institution, to make contracts, sue and be sued, and generally to do whatever is necessary in conducting its operations and providing profitable employment for its inmates. The board of managers was thus invested with important corporate powers, some of which, in their exercise, require consideration, deliberation and judgment. Where such is the case, “all should be convened, because the advice and opinions of all may be useful, though they do not unite in opinion:” In re Turnpike Road, <a href="/binn/5/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Binn. 481" data-case-ids="1793584" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0481-01">5 Binn. 481</a>; Commissioners of Allegheny <em>v. </em>Leckey, 6 S. &amp; R. 166. It is not to be presumed that a matter so important as the sale of an entire year’s product of the barrel factory connected with the institution amounting to over two hundred thousand barrels, would not be acted on by the managers in their corporate capacity, or be dele<a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>gated, in unmistakable terms, to some one else with authority to act for them. There was no competent and sufficient evidence of such action in this case resulting in the employment of the plaintiff below. It is true, he testified, in substance, that the president of the board said they wanted him to sell their barrels for the year 1878 ; that the superintendent said he was instructed by the board to see him and request him to get the best offer he could for their barrels, and communicate the result in writing to the board; and that another member of the board, since deceased, told him on another occasion “ that they had considered the matter, and if he could get $ 1.25 per barrel, to close the matter at once.” He was contradicted by each of the surviving parties to the two first-mentioned conversations; but assuming that these individual declarations and statements were made as testified to by him, what do they amount to without proof of authority to make them ? Such authority was denied, and there was no evidence that either of the parties referred to was empowered by the board to employ the plaintiffior make any sueh statements. Unless they are authorized, the individual members of a corporation cannot bind it by an express promise, nor can corporate engagements be implied from their unauthorized and unsanctioned acts or declarations. The acts or declarations of a director in a corporation will not bind or in any manner affect it unless they are shown to be within the scope of his ordinary powers or of some special agency: Angell and Ames on Corp., sect. 239; Soper <em>v. </em>The Buffalo &amp; Rochester Railroad Co., <a href="/barb/19/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="19 Barb. 310" data-case-ids="4961055" data-case-paths="/barb/19/0310-01">19 Barb. 310</a>. As we had occasion to say in a recent case, corporate rights are not to be frittered away by loose and unauthorized declarations made by persons who at the time had no authority to bind the corporation; and this principle applies as well to individual directors and employees of a corporation as to strangers. Nor is there any hardship in this, because, as is said in Cooper <em>v. </em>Lampeter Township, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20128" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Watts 128">8 Watts 128</a>, “every person is supposed to know the restrictions on the power'of the officers of a corporation of a public nature and the extent of their authority.”</p>

The first assignment of error is not sustained. The deceased manager, whose declarations were proved, was not a party to the alleged contract within the meaning of the Act of 1869. His relation to the corporation was rather in the nature of an agency, and if it had been shown that he was authorized by, the board of which he was a member to employ the plaintiff, his declarations, while acting within the scope of his authority, would have been competent evidence ; but as we have already said, there was nothing in the testi<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>mony from which the jury could fairly and reasonably find that either of the parties with whom the plaintiff testified he had conversations, was authorized by the board to employ him. It is true, a committee of three was appointed by the board on November 20th 1877, but there was no testimony as to any action having been taken by that committee in relation to employment of the plaintiff. The remaining assignments are- not sustained; but for reasons already given, the judgment should be reversed on the second, third and seventh specifications of error.</p>
