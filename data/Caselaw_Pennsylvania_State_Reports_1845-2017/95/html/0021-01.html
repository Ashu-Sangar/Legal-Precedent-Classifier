Eor this reason and on the ground that no certificate to the Oyer and Terminer had been filed, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment and for a new trial. A rule to show cause was granted, and after argument discharged, the court holding that although the venire was irregular, yet after a trial on the merits, without objection, the defect was cured by virtue of the Act of March 31st 1860, section 53. After citing Jewell <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 2 S. &amp; R. 300, and Fife <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 Casey 429, the court, in discharging the rule, said :—</p>

The defect or error in the present case is in the venire. It should have issued for at least forty-eight jurors.If the defendant had declined to go to trial or moved to quash the array, the trial -would probably have been postponed or the array quashed. But going to trial by the forms and with the challenges allowed in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, we are constrained to the conclusion from the letter of the statute and judicial construction given to the same, that after verdict, it is too late for this objection to prevail.”</p>

The venire was issued under a general order or precept, and for a Quarter Sessions jury, and no venire was ordered or issued for the number of jurors required in the Oyer and Terminer. None of the cases of irregularity cited by the court below apply. The case of People <em>v. </em>McKay, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Johns.%20218" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 Johns. 218">18 Johns. 218</a>, is analogous, where no venire had ever been issued, and it was held that there was an entire absence of authority in the sheriff and not any default of his which could be termed an irregularity.</p>

No consent can give jurisdiction: Dougherty <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 19 P. F. Smith 286; Mills <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Harris 631. The rule in England seems to be that in a charge of rape there is not sufficient proof of penetration to constitute the offence, unless there be positive medical evidence of some sort of violence to the person: 2 Wh. &amp; Stil. Med. J., sect. 279, 3d. The fact that a physician did examine the prosecutrix the day following the offence was committed, in the presence of and at the instance of her mother, after she accused the defendant of the act, and the physician was present in court during the trial, and was not called by the court, under the English rule ought to have acquitted the defendant, and the court should have affirmed the point.</p>

If it was a “defect in or relative to or appertaining to the venire” then the trial was a waiver of it. If the defect in the venire and shortage of jurors is not within the spirit and meaning and even the letter of the fifty-third section of the Criminal Procedure Act, it has failed to accomplish what it aimed at.</p>

The omission to call him was notice that his testimony was not considered valuable for the Commonwealth. Yet after full opportunity to ascertain just what it would be, we came to the same conclusion as to its value on our side. Have not we as much reason to say that their omission to call him was evidence of their client’s guilt as they have to say that our not calling him was evidence of'his innocence. The English rule never did obtain in’ this country, and it is believed no where else, since rape ceased to he a capital crime.</p>

The defendant was tried in the Court of Quarter Sessions for an offence of which that court had no jurisdiction. This alone, however, would not have constituted a sufficient objection to the validity of the trial and sentence, after a verdict and after a certificate of the cause into the Oyer and Terminer. Had there been a legal and actual Court of Oyer and Terminer in session at the time the case was tried, we should have held the subsequent certificate of the cause into that court <em>nunc pro tuno </em>as sufficient, upon the authority of Brown <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 28 P. F. Smith 122. But in point of fact there was no legally constituted Court of Oyer and Terminer in session, or capable of sitting at the time of the trial. The Act of 14th April 1834, sect. 113, provides that “the number of persons who shall be summoned and returned, as aforesaid, to serve as petit jurors in any Court of Oyer and Terminer, shall not be less than forty-eight nor more than eighty, and in any other court of criminal jurisdiction not less than twenty-four nor more than sixty.” Now to summon thirty-eight jurors to serve in a Court of Oyer and Terminer is not a mere defect or irregularity in the venire. Without a panel of forty-eight jurors, summoned and returned for service, an essential constituent of that court is wanting. If a panel of thirty-eight would be a sufficient compliance with the law we see no reason why a number still less would not suffice. The defect, or omission rather, is fatal to the constitution of the court, and hence the certificate of a cause from the Quarter Sessions into a court so composed, is inoperative to effect the transfer. This consideration distinguishes the present case from all those cited by the learned judge of the court below. We hold, therefore, that there' was no valid trial and sentence, and must reverse the judgment for that reason. This decision makes it unnecessary to consider the other errors assigned. We cannot forbear, however, remarking that, in our opinion, the physician who, on the day after the occurrence, examined the person of the girl upon whom the offence was <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>alleged to have been committed, should have been called as a witness and required to testify by the district attorney. Whether his evidence tended to acquit or convict, it was demanded equally by the cause of humanity on the one hand, or of justice on the other. We say this more especially because there was no direct evidence of the factum of the crime, and no proof of actual penetration, the prosecutrix having testified that she was insensible and had no knowledge of what took place. We do not reverse for this reason, and do not sustain the fifth assignment of error, which raises the question, but merely express our opinion as to what should have been done in the peculiar circumstances of this case.</p>
