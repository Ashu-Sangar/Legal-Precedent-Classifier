That it was done is evidenced by the fact that, under the contract the possession of the property was changed. The billiard tables and fixtures were sent, in pursuance of this contract, to Oil City. This contract, in our opinion, is the contract between the parties, although it provides upon its face for certain matters to be performed thereafter, to wit: The execution of a lease which the plaintiffs here claim was the final contract between the parties. We cannot agree with them in that; we think that this was the contract between the parties, and that the lease was executed in pursuance of this contract therefor, as well as the delivery of the possession <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>of the property.

The settlement was made at Oil City, the terms of the lease fixed and executed by Russell, and it was the final act of the parties, and the other then became <em>functus officio. </em>The word “lease” in the original paper had, unquestionably, a well-understood meaning in the trade, and shows that a bailment for use was contemplated, and that no title was to pass, and that the lease and terms were to be fixed before delivery of' possession to Russell.

N. C. 363</a>. If the vendor and vendee agree that the possession shall pass to the vendee, but the property remain in the vendor until the purchase-money is paid, such agreement, as respects creditors and the sheriff, is fraudulent. The lease, standing by itself, does not constitute a bailment. It differs from the lease in the case of Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp, in that no provision is made for the return of the property at the end of the term. The obligation to return the property is an essential quality to the bailment. “ A delivery of chattels upon a sale made on condition that the title shall pass on the payment of the purchase-money at a future day, is something more than a bailment; it gives the buyer a conditional title:” Krause <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 12 Norris 418.</p>

F. Smith 488, was considered and commented upon. We need not repeat what was there said.</p>

The transaction was a conditional sale. The attempt to disguise it under the cloak of a bailment was too clumsy to have the merit of being clever. The contract of January 28th 1878 was a sale of the billiard tables upon a credit, with a stipulation that payment should be secured by a lease of the tables and an insurance thereon. When the tables were delivered the subsequent agreement of 22d of February 1878 was executed. This paper is in form a lease, and it was not denied that it was executed in pursuance of and in strict compliance with the contract' of sale of the preceding January. The feeble attempt to prove that the tables were delivered under the lease and not under the contract, will not avail, for the reason, among others, that the two papers must be regarded as one transaction. Taken together they amount to a sale of the billiard tables upon credit accompanied with a lease thereof as a security for the payment of the price. Such a contract, while good between the parties, will not keep creditors at bay. It is worthless as to them. There is no principle of law better settled in Pennsylvania than that a sale and delivery of personal property, with an agreement that the ownership shall remain in the vendor until the purchase-money is paid, <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>enables creditors of the vendee to seize and sell the. same for the payment of his debts. ’ It would be a needless labor to cite the numerous cases in which this doctrine has been asserted.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[158,537,1165,719]]]'>It was urged, however, that the case in hand is upon all fours with Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp, 1 P. F. Smith 27, and that we cannot affirm this judgment without overruling that case. Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp, like Enlow <em>v. </em>Klein, was a close ease and stands upon the border. It differs from the present one in two important particulars. While in Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp there was evidence of a sale of the billiard tables by Sharp to Goff a few days prior to the lease, there was no agreement for a lease as security. And again, in Rowe <em>v. </em>Sharp there was an express stipulation for a return of the property at the end of the bailment. This important part of a contract of bailment is wholly omitted in the lease between the parties to this contention. The lessors may re-enter and take possession of the property upon a breach by the lessee of the covenants contained in the lease. Rut if the lessee fulfils his covenants, that is to say if he pays the several instalments as they mature, the lessors cannot reclaim the property, nor is the lessee bound to restore it after the bailment is over.</p>
