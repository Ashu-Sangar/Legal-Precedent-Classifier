In 1840, she married John H. Millar, and in 1852, lie deserted his wife and family without making provision for their support, and was absent ten years. In 1864 Orvaline died, and in 1877 her husband, Millar, died.

The Act of 1855, however, provides for an exception to this recognised .general rule, and the question for the decision of the jury in this case is, whether, under the evidence here submitted, the deed here relied upon by defendant conveyed title or not.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b472-18" data-blocks='[["BL_472.17",472,[246,1910,1160,388]]]'>Ans. “ This point is refused. If, in point of fact the grantor, Orvaline Jane Millar, was, at the time of the making of the deed by her to the defendant, within the terms of the second section of the Act of May 4th 1855; that is to say, if the- jury believe from the evidence that at that time Millar had' neglected or refused to provide for his -wife, or had deserted her, such neglect or refusal to provide for her, or such desertion having continued for some years before the execution of the deed in question, then the decree was not necessary to give such deed validity.”</p>

But by the provisions of that act the wife, deserted by the husband, or whose husband neglects or refuses to provide for her, may sell her land and make a valid conveyance-without the joinder of her husband. By the fourth section of that act it is provided that creditors, purchasers, and others may with certainty and safety transact business with a married woman under, the circumstances aforesaid; she may, on application to the Court of Common Pleas of the proper county be decreed á feme sole trader, and a certificate granted to her of such fact, and such certificate, it was provided, should be ‘conclusive evidence of her authority.’ [This decree, as we construe the act, was not an indispensable preliminary to her acting for herself in the disposition of her property. It merely leaves the burden of proof upon the party desiring under her deed to show affirmatively the existence of the facts necessary to bring her within the terms of the law. In the present case, therefore, it is for the jury to find whether the defendant has established affirmatively, as against the proof given by plaintiff, that at the date of the deed here in question, Mrs. Millar had been and then was deserted by her husband, or that he had neglected or refused, and was at that time still neglecting or refusing to provide for her.”]</p>
