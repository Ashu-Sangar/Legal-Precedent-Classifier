This presumption, as we have seen, does not create a bar to the recovery of the debt unless it is rebutted by proof, but it extends no further than to require that the plaintiff who has taken no steps to execute his judgment during a year and a day at the common law, or the five years now allowed by statute, to call upon the defendant by legal process to show cause why he should not have the fruits of his judgment.

New officers are annually coming in to take charge of the financial affairs of the township.
