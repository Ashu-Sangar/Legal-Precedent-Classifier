There was the unlawful assemblage of three or more persons combined together to perpetrate an outrageous and violent crime. The commission of the crime was immediately preceded by numerous discharges of firearms. Two peaceable citizens engaged in watching and protecting the premises, placed there for that purpose, were compelled to flee therefrom in terror of their lives. The crime was arson, one of the most odious known to the criminal law. It was committed at a late hour of the night, when the great majority of persons are in their beds and asleep and least prepared to defend themselves or their property. It is an offence having a more natural and necessary tendency to put whole communities in fea'r and terror than almost any other. In this instance it was accompanied by the voices of men calling for wood and oil with which to apply the fire, by the loud and appalling noise of exploding weapons of destruction, and the criminals themselves were a band of men whose numbers could not'be determined on account of the darkness of the night. For a court in charging a jury to speak of such an occurrence as anything less than a riot of the most marked and distinct character would be simply to mislead them. We think the learned judge of the court below, in his comments to the jury, dealt quite too leniently with the plain and undisputed facts of the case. lie said to them that to prove a riot there must be a previous unlawful assembling, accompanied with circumstances of force or violence, and “ that if the assembling of persons be not accompanied with such circumstances as these it cannot be deemed a riot, however unlawful the acts which they actually committed.” From this the jury would naturally infer that unless the proof went back to the time when the men first met together, and established that such original meeting was attended with circumstances of actual force and violence, a case of riot could not be made out, no matter what acts of outrage and violence were subsequently perpetrated. Such is not the law as we understand it, and we consider it error to say or to intimate that it is to a jury charged with the trial of such a case. We think, too, that the court rather overstated the necessity of proving “ a violent turbulent, disorderly and noisy disturbance of the public peace” in order to make out a case of riot. There was no controversy as to what were the facts; not a witness was called to give any other account of the occurrence than that testified to by Adams and Alfred Ford. Their credibility was not assailed or impeached in any manner. It was a case in which it would have been entirely proper for the court to characterize directly the criminal aspect of the facts testified to by the witnesses named. Instead of doing this the learned judge told the jury they must decide whether they believed the witnesses when there was not a shadow of doubt thrown upon their credibility; and if they believe them they are to “ determine the <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>facts and circumstances.” Whether the facts and circumstances constituted a riot he did not tell them, although expressly requested to do so in two points. In our opinion he should have affirmed the defendant’s sixth and seventh points without qualification. For not doing so he was in error, as also in the general charge for the reasons heretofore stated. We sustain the second, tenth, eleventh and twelfth assignments of error, and on these the case is reversed.</p>
