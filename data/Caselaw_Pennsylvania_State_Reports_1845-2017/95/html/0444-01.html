He was accompanied by his driver, and was driving as usual to the railroad station, when from some unknown cause his horse suddenly shied, and ran off the road and down the hillside, dragging with him the buggy and its occupants, and permanently injuring the plaintiff. The road at the place where the accident occurred runs along a ridge. On one side there is a fence enclosing a cultivated field, but; on the other side, down which the horse ran, is a precipitous decline of about forty feet, upon which side there was no fence or barrier.

L. 555. There is no obligation thereunder to guard or barricade public roads. The statute does not require it as an element of original construction, and it is not required as repairs. In cases in which townships have been held liable, the facts show that the road bed itself was out of repair and not clear of impediments as the statute required. A very different measure of duty is imposed upon townships from that which is imposed upon cities and boroughs; the one being only a <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>
      <em>quasi </em>corporation with very limited powers and duties, and the others being corporations of vastly larger though differing powers, and having jurisdiction and control over their streets, enabling them to construct and supervise them much more efficiently and completely, and containing population and possessing means which impose larger responsibilities: Dillon on Mun.

But apart from the question of liability in actions of negligence for mental suffering as distinguished from bodily suffering, the court below in its answer to the seventh point instructed the jury that they should allow in estimating the damages, * * * not only for the mental pain and suffering which the plaintiff had already endured, but also for that which he was likely to experience during the remainder of his life. This was giving the jury no rule of damages whatever, but leaving the whole matter of damages, without evidence, or possibility of evidence, on this subject to guide them, to their imagination.</p>

Cities and boroughs are required to keep their streets and bridges in like manner.
