The court will search out the actual plaintiff and fix on him the responsibility of a party by subjecting him to a set off, where that may be necessary, to protect the defendant from loss: Armstrong <em>v. </em>Lancaster, <a href="/watts/5/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Watts 68" data-case-ids="1843977" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0068-01">5 Watts 68</a>. It is plainly taught by the authorities referred to that the true owner of a fund deposited by and in the name of his agent may maintain an action at law for the recovery of such property or fund, but in such suit the depositary has the right to detain because of lien or set off. And we submit when the suit chances to be in the name of the agent instead of the principal, that no valid reason can be assigned why, if the principal, the true owner of the fund, is the debtor of the depositary, the latter shall not be allowed to defeat such action by showing such ownership and indebtedness; and, moreover, with a denial of the 'right to make such proof, if the principal in such case be insolvent, thé depositary must suffer irreparable loss. The possession of the agent being the possession of his principal; his acts being not his own, but the acts of his principal, it is equally difficult to see how the agent can recover by suit in his own name where his principal for the same cause of action cannot recover. A set off of Thomas &amp; Mason’s indebtedness lying in the way of a suit in their name, the suit is in the name of James D. Mason, their agent, but what will prevent a recovery by the former must defeat the action when it is, as here, by the latter; for there exists because of the system of rules and usages relating to banking, national, state or private, no “ estoppel in law” that will help out such an enterprise.</p>

But certainly there is no authority for the position that in the absence of notice or claim by a third party the bank can set up an absolute title in a stranger to the plaintiff’s deposit for the purpose of appropriating it to a note due by said stranger to the bank. The bank contracts with the depositor only, and to permit it to question his title to the fund deposited would destroy all banking and commercial- transactions.

The defendant offered to prove that the money deposited in the name of James D. Mason, the plaintiff, was, in fact, the money of the firm of Thomas &amp; Mason, of which firm the plaintiff was a clerk; that the plaintiff had admitted at the time the deposits were made that the money belonged to said firm, and were placed in his name as a matter of convenience in paying small bills; and that the said Thomas &amp; Mason were indebted to the said bank in excess of the amount standing on its books to the credit of the plaintiff. The bank claimed to set-off the indebtedness of Thomas &amp; Mason against the claim of plaintiff in this suit. This evidence was rejected by the court below, and forms the subject of the first assignment of error.</p>

The credit on the books of the bank is but prima facie evidence of ownership: Harrisburg Bank <em>v. </em>Tyler, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 373" data-case-ids="1854636" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0373-01">3 W. &amp; S. 373</a>; Frazier <em>v. </em>Erie Bank, 8 <a href="/watts-serg/3/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 373" data-case-ids="1854636" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0373-01">Id.</a> 18 ; Jackson <em>v. </em>The Bank of the United States, 10 Barr 61; Bank of Northern Liberties <em>v. </em>Jones, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20541" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Wright 541">6 Wright 541</a>; Stair <em>v. </em>York National Bank, 5 P. F. Smith 368; Arnold <em>v. </em>Macungie Savings Bank, 21 Id. 290. These were cases, however, in which the true owner set up a claim to the fund. We have here a very different question. The bank, the depositary, sets up an adverse title to defeat the suit of its own depositor. The bank held its claim against Thomas &amp; Mason when the plaintiff made his deposits, and they knew, or at least they allege they knew when the deposits were made that the money so deposited in plaintiff’s name belonged to said firm. Yet under these circumstances and with this knowledge they permitted the plaintiff to make the deposit in his own name. Having received it as the money of the plaintiff and given him credit therefor, the bank is estopped, in the absence of any notice from, or claim by the real owner, from disputing the plaintiff’s title. Having received the money as the money of the plaintiff, they are bound to pay it to him or upon his order. Such a contract is implied from the fact of the deposit. In Jackson <em>v. </em>The Bank, <em><a href="/watts-serg/3/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 373" data-case-ids="1854636" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0373-01">supra,</a> </em>the funds in the bank to the credit of Warwick were attached. The bank paid the money to Warwick notwithstanding the attachment, and was held liable <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>therefor. It was said by Mr. Justice Coulter, in delivering the opinion of the court: “ The first question that occurs is this: could the bank, if the attachment had not been served, have resisted the claim of Warwick to the money he had deposited with them ? They received it and the bills as his, entered them on their books as his, and were bound, in the absence of any attachment, to have paid the funds to him. How then were they placed in any better position by the service of the attachment ? The attaching-creditor stands in the place of Warwick. If they could not allege as against Warwick that the funds were not his, neither can they allege as against the attaching creditor that they are not his, and yet turn round and pay the money to Warwick to enable him to defeat his creditor.”</p>
