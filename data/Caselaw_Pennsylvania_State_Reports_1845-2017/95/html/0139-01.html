The Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad Company, which had been incorporated in the name of the Sunbury &amp; Erie Railroad Company, by an Act of Assembly approved April 3d 1837 (Pamph.L. 470), had constructed their railroad from Sunbury to Erie, and been in daily use” of the road for many years before these houses were built, owned a tract of about forty-two acres of land situate on the east of the above mentioned twenty-five feet street, through which the tracks of their railroad were laid, and upon which their workshops were built. In 1870 the company, requiring an additional siding, constructed-it upon and along this twenty-five foot street, by making an embankment upon it from four to seven feet high, where the east side of the square owned by the defendant in error fronts upon the street, and thereby completely obstructed the street and prevented all passage along it, or to or from the said lots.

L. 1865, 944). 3. That no authority was given by the charter of the ■ company for the appointment of viewers to assess damages to land not occupied by the company — that the damages asked for are purely consequential, being in consequence of constructing railroad tracks in said public street, and praying for a rule to show cause why the order appointing the viewers should not be set aside and stricken off, and that all proceedings under the same be stayed in the meantime.

I have already stated that I find the fact that the damages are excessive, but after much thought I have come to the conclusion, that under the circumstances, it is not the duty of the court, nor is it now in its power to set aside the report of viewers for this reason. I might, for the sake- of seeing justice done at all hazards, take a different view of this matter if I did not believe the defendant had a full and complete remedy in the Supreme Court if I am wrong. If that court believes injustice has been done, and that this court has refused to interfere on improper principles and mistaken views of the law or of its power, it will do what this court ought to have done.

To revise and attempt to correct the location, is to interrupt and destroy the franchise itself, and clearly this does not belong to individual right.

The construction in this case is a mere siding — a part it is true of the railroad to which it is annexed, but still simply an addition thereto, made for the convenience of the company and not within the reason of the law which requires that the advantages and disadvantages of the railroad shall be taken into consideration when land is taken for the construction of the railroad in the first instance: New Castle &amp; Franklin Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>McChesney, 4 Norris 522.

It sets forth that the court below erred in disallowing the seventh exception filed <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>by the defendant. Said exception is as follows.; “ That the viewers do not state that in estimating and determining the damages, they had any regard to or made any just allowance for the advantages which may have resulted, or which may seem likely to result, to the said Henry L. Cake in consequence of the making or opening of said railroad, and of the construction of works connected therewith, nor that they made any fair or just comparison of the advantages' and disadvantages.” That this is a radical defect and an adequate ground for setting aside the report, has been repeatedly decided. It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to Ohio &amp; Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Wallace, 2 Harris 245; Reitenhaugh <em>v. </em>The Chester Valley Railroad Co., 9 <a href="/citations/?q=29%20Leg.%20Int.%2085" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="29 Leg.

It is no answer to say that it would be useless to set forth such matters in the report. The law requires it and for sufficient reasons. As was said in Zack <em>v. </em>The Railroad Co., supra, “ The report is to be reviewed by the court; and this can be of no value if no facts be set out in it, unless the court choose to hear the evidence over again. If the facts be not set out and are not required to be, then a review in this court is worth nothing. Besides it is important in reviewing a case tried out of the general course of the law to see what matters have been inquired of, that it may be known that the cause has been fully and rightly considered.”</p>

It is proper to say, however, that it was the plain duty of the learned judge of the court below, upon his own statement of the case, to have set aside this report. He says in his opinion : “ The evidence shows and I find as a fact that the damages found by the viewer's are grossly excessive.” Notwithstanding this finding, he entered judgment upon the report upon a mistaken idea that he had no power to set it aside, and sent the case up to this court with what amounts to an invitation to us to do what he omitted to do. All this, however, appears only in the opinion of the court which forms no part of the record. How far we would be justified in looking at it when the court below has declined to exercise its discretion from an erroneous view of its power, and has sent up its opinion for the very purpose of showing us its reasons for declining to act, and to invite our review of its ruling, it is not essential riow to decide.
