Water Company was incorporated'the west line of the borough of W. had been fixed, by the Act of 1853 as L. street. In 1862, the borough was enlarged and S. street made the west line. By the Act of 1865, the L. Gas and Wafcer Company was incorporated to supply “ the inhabitants residing within the limits of the plot or territory here described, and parts adjacent thereto, a sufficient supply of pure water,” á part of which territory is bounded by certain lines, the one on the east being the western boundary line of the borough of W., as established in 1853, and the other portions being certain outlying villages and vicinity. The act contained a proviso that the said company shall not extend their pipes into the parts of streets in said borough in which the W. company had laid their pipes previously to the passage of the bill. The L. company was proceeding to lay its pipes into the portion of the borough lying east of L. street, contending that they were authorised to do so by the terms of their charter which allowed them to supply the inhabitants within the limits described in their charter “and parts adjacent thereto,” as well as by the terms of the proviso. In proceedings to restrain them the court sustained the contention of the L. company: <em>Held, </em>that this was error ; that the Act of 1865 vested no right in the L. company to supply water to the inhabitants of that portion of the borough which lies east of L. street; that this territory was covered 'by the charter of the W. company, and it was clear that the legislature intended to confer rights in the charter of the L. company exclusive of interference with, or abridgment of the grants previously made.</p>

One, of these rules is that'in the construction of a statute effetet is to be given, if possible, to every clause and section of it. ‘ Statutes are to be interpreted so as to give effect to all the words therein, if such interpretation be reasonable and be neither repugnant to the provisions nor inconsistent with the objects of the statute.’ United States <em>v. </em>Bassell, 2 St. 389.</p>

As was salid by Justice Woodward, in Dugan <em>v. </em>Bridge Company, 3 Casey 309, ‘in measuring corporate rights we are to look at all the 'terms employed in the fundamental law or compact. We can no more cut out some of them or mitigate their legal effect because they are in a proviso, than we could qualify the terms of a private agreement because found in one part of the instrument instead of another. The whole instrument is to be taken together as expressing the final intentions and purposes of the parties.’ ‘ The office of a proviso, generally, is either to except something from the enacting clause or to qualify or restrain its generality, or to exclude some possible ground in its misinterpretation of its extending to cases not intended to be brought within its purview:’ Winis <em>v. </em>United States, <a href="/us/40/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="15 Pet. 423" data-case-ids="3331608" data-case-paths="/us/40/0423-01">15 Pet. 423</a>.</p>

Adopting this rule of construction, we think that the true intention and meaning of the section can be determined. The borough of Williamsport, lying east of the boundary line as established prior to 1853, was just as much ‘ adjacent’ to the territory described in the charter of the Lycoming Gas and Water Company as was the township or townships which the master finds to be included under the description of ‘parts adjacent thereto,’ and that the corporate rights of the Williamsport Water Company might not be infringed upon by the rival company entering such adjacent territory, the prohibition in the proviso was inserted to protect said Williamsport Water Company in the enjoyment of their chartered rights to the extent that they had exercised them, viz. •: by the occupancy of the streets in the said borough in the laying of their pipes; and that it was the intention of the legislature to <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>confer this right upon the Lycoming Gas and Water Company, to enter upon the territory of the Williamsport Water Company, may be inferred from the fact that the latter' company was incorporated-in 1853, was organized in 1856, and up to 1865 had not occupied all the streets in said borough, and had not supplied the residents upon said streets with water. The master was, therefore, in error in concluding as a matter of law that the Lycoming Gas and Water Company are prohibited, by their charter, from entering into the limits of that part of the city embraced in the borough limits as established prior to 1853. As we have already indicated, the master should have decided that the said company was authorized to lay their pipes in those streets of the said borough where the said Williamsport Water Company had not laid their pipes previously to March 24th 1865.</p>

Here is a grant of right to supply water in all the territory of the borough and much outside, which was not within the borough lines as established at the time of the grant to the plaintiff, with two provisoes prohibiting interference with property of the latter.

That no corporate privileges are granted unless they are expressed in plain and unequivocal words, or by necessary implication; 2. That a statute is to be interpreted so as to give effect to all the words therein, if such interpretation be reasonable, and be neither repugnant to its provisions nor inconsistent with its objects; giving effect, if possible, to every clause and section of it. Manifestly, the main object in the defendant’s charter is provision for a supply of water and gas to the inhabitants in the territory described. West of the portion included in the certain bounds are two villages as uncertain in extent as their future growth, and here effect may be given to the words “parts adjacent,” though a similar meaning must be given to the word vicinity. Whether they are empty words with respect to all the designated landmarks, is not a point in the case; but the question is whether they embrace the territory of another corporation which is only mentioned in defendant’s charter to exclude inference that the defendant may, take any of its property. If it was the intention to give the defendant a right to supply water in all unoccupied parts of the borough, a very few words would have covered the ground,and reserved to the plaintiff its pipes previously laid. Nothing could be more absurd than to define a line of division, if it was not the intendment to make one. Such line is sharply defined in the seventh section, and the grant is clearly expressed, with a proviso that the pipes of the plaintiff then laid shall not be disturbed. That proviso plainly relates to the grant; the grant was within a certain limit which included the new part of the borough, and its generality is restrained by the proviso excluding the parts of streets already occupied by the older company. The whole instrument must be taken together, the affirmative grant and negative proviso — one gives, the other withholds — the office of the one is to except out a part of what is embraced in the general terms of the other. The word borough in the proviso is defined by the context and limited to the part within the grant; to give it its ordinary meaning would be inconsistent with the object of the statute and also repugnant to the express provisions bounding the territory of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b43-7" data-blocks='[["BL_43.7",43,[169,2234,1173,218]],["BL_44.1",44,[283,432,1175,559]]]'>It is contended on behalf of defendant, that the intendment of its charter is to vest the right to lay pipes and furnish water to the inhabitants of that part of the old borough lying between Hepburn and Locust streets, because of the plaintiff’s bad treatment of said ithabitants. If this be doubtful, the doubt is certain against the <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>right. Neither master nor court found a limit at Hepburn street, and it is a mistake to say that either the opinion of the court or decree stops there. Starting on the premise that the words “ parts adjacent” give the defendant a'right to cross the west line of the borough as it existed in 1853, the conclusion of the learned judge is logical and inevitable, that the east line of the borough is the <em>limit; </em>and if that be repugnant to <em>the </em>obvious <em>sense </em>of the statute, the error is in the premise and not in the reasoning. It may be that it would have been wise and beneficial to the inhabitants to have placed the district between Hepburn and Locust streets within the grant to the new company, but the legislature was not convinced of that, for had they been, Hepburn street would have been made the dividing line instead of Locust.</p>
    <p id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.5",44,[284,992,1170,343]]]'>We are of opinion that the statute vests no right in defendant to provide means and supply water to the inhabitants of the territory which constituted the borough of Williamsport in 1853, and which lies east of the western boundary of the borough as established prior to said date. That. territory is covered by the plaintiff’s charter, and it is clear that the legislature intended to cpnfer rights in <em>the </em>defendant’s charter, exclusive of interference with, or abridgment of, the grants previously made.</p>
    <p id="b44-5" data-blocks='[["BL_44.6",44,[284,1335,1168,777]]]'>This action was commenced in 1869, and the bill charges that the defendant has done and intends to do acts without authority of law, and in violation of the plaintiff’s chartered rights. It was sufficient notice to defendant that if it exceeded its authority, to the plaintiff’s injury, it would be at its peril. Either party could have urged the cause to an earlier hearing, and the delay is as little benefit or prejudice to the one as the other. A preliminary injunction settles no question of right, and when not necessary for the preservation of property, pending the suit, the plaintiff may well await final decision. That the plaintiff may have violated its charter in trespassing on territory of defendant, is not a question in this issue, nor is the act of such nature as defeats its right to demand redress for the alleged injuries. These parties are corporations, with no other rights than is granted by their respective charters, with no privity, or contract relations, between them, and either may demand protection in what the statute gives, without denial, because of the maxim that, who does iniquity shall not have equity.</p>
