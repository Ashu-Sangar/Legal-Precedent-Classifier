In pursuance of the power vested in them by the will, the three executors sold all the real estate.- They executed joint deéds therefor to the purchasers. They received a portion of the purchase-money in cash, and, receipted jointly therefor in the deeds. They took purchase-money mortgages to secure the balance in their joint -names. After they had thus disposed of the whole estate, they filed a joint account at December Term 1866, charging themselves, among other things, with the proceeds of the real estate sold, viz.: $23,790, and crediting themselves, inter alia, with the <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>amount of the mortgages not yet collected, viz.: $14,018.33, their commissions, viz.: $1281.91, and showing a balance in cash in their hands amounting to $4170.37. After nthe filing of this account, it appeared that Robinson and Lightcap, Jr., turned over to Gill all the assets of the estate, and without surrendering the letters granted to them, ceased to pay any attention to the estate, or, in the words of Lightcap, Jr., the other executor, “ Mr. Robinson never officiated unless he was called upon to sign his name to any paper he might be called to sign ; that was the only part he took, when he was called upon to sign his name, and, of course, when we wanted to consult him on other business sometimes.”</p>

Robinson died on August 5th 1870, intestate. His widow, the accountant, became his administratrix. Gill absconded in September 1877, carrying with him all of the cash and other available funds of the estate. By proceedings he was removed from the trust. In May 1878, Samuel Lightcap, the youngest child, arrived at age, and two-thirds of the estate was then distributable according to the will. Upon petition, the Orphans’ Court directed Lightcap, Jr., the sole remaining executor, and Mrs. Maria Dempsey (formerly Robinson), administratrix of Robinson, deceased, to file separate accounts, but this not to affect the joint liability of the executors. Mrs. Dempsey, for her intestate, filed an account, setting forth that nothing had come into her hands, and crediting herself with the expense of filing the account. Upon exceptions filed thereto; after argument, Hawkins, P. J., made a decree surcharging Robinson’s estate with the cash balance shown by account filed at No. 63, Dec.

      <em>“ </em>It is an established rule that executors <em>‘ </em>are liable personally and individually no further than assets have come into their hands, and where they have done some act which the law considers as equivalent to an admission that the assets were in their hands and power, and culpably and negligently parted withHall <em>v. </em>Boyd, 6 Barr 270; Irwin’s Appeal, 11 Casey 294. It has accordingly been held that where a co-trustee who does not receive the money, consents that the others shall misapply it, particularly where he has the power to secure it, he is responsible: Pain v. Downing, 11 S. &amp; R. 71; and that an executor who receives money of the estate and pays it over to a co-executor, who afterwards becomes insolvent, is not chargeable with it in favor of legatees : Verner’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20253" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts 253">6 Watts 253</a>. So, on the same principle, in Jones’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20141" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 141">8 W. &amp; S. 141</a>, it was held that where joint guardians in good circumstances and standing, apportion the custody and management of the trust property to suit the peculiar qualifications of each, but without surrendering the right of either to intermeddle with the whole, each is chargeable with no more than he actually received, unless he knowingly permitted or promoted a <em>devastavit </em>of the estate by his colleague.</p>

Mr. Gill had been the attorney and trusted adviser of the testator, who had, <em>by </em>appointing him co-trustee with, recommended him to the confidence of Mr. Robinson: Irwin’s Appeal, <em>supra; </em>heW'as believed to have special skill and advantages in making investments; he was in good standing in the community until after he had absconded; he was the acting executor, with the knowledge and without objection on the part of the legatees; and no one appears to have called on Mr. Robinson for the exercise of any of the duties of the trust, from the date of the death of the testator onward. Nothing could have been more natural under the circumstances, than that the exercise of the duties of the trust should have been left to Mr. Gill. In trusting him the assets were surely not ‘ culpably and negligently parted with.’ Any rule which would make his co-trustees jointly liable with him would be harsh and unreasonable: Hall <em>v. </em>Boyd, <em>supra. </em>But the evidence does not show that Mr. Robinson in fact knew and authorized specially the satisfaction of any one of the mortgages. He certainly did not join in the satisfaction of record. Had there even been a general authority to satisfy mortgages, it seems that it would have been insufficient: Bohlen’s Estate, 25 P. E. Smith 304. If the law gave Mr. Gill power to satisfy without and notwithstanding his co-trustees, it is but just that he alone should be made responsible; if he had not the power (Dellaven <em>v. </em>Williams, 30 P. E. Smith 480,) the estate has not lost anything by the act of Mr. Robinson. The assertion of the duty of the executors to unite in the execution of the trust, is a denial of the power of any one of the executors to act alone.</p>

Jones’s Appeal, <em>supra, </em>was decided as it was, notwithstanding the <em>eestuis que trustent </em>were minors, and, therefore, incapable of giving consent at the time at which their guardians made the agreement to sever in <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>the management of the estate and divide the assets between them.</p>
