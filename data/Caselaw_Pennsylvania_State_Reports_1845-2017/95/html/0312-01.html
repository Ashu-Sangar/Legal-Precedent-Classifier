This claim, it was contended, was supported by the testimony. Mrs. Maloney testified, “ I did not want any of the real estate; there was very little for the children at the time : I was very well satisfied. I decided at the time,” (of her husband’s death) “ and when Mr. Fetterman read the will to me, I told him I would take the money; he said that if I so decided I would not have anything under the will; 1 told him I did not want anything else under the will.” Also, “ I was perfectly satisfied ; I had knowledge of the will before my husband’s death : he told me what he was going to do; I was perfectly satisfied.” The question having been asked her, “ Bid you ever change that decision afterwards and claim any part of the estate ?” She replied, “No, sir; never! never claimed any.” She, in fact, never received anything from the executors or trustee, as widow, under the intestate law, and during the lapse of years between the death of her husband and the bankruptcy proceedings never claimed anything. On the contrary, she frequently asserted that she desired nothing else from her husband’s estate. “ I decided to take nothing at all of the real estate; it (the insurance money) was enough for me at the time ; I considered I had a .very good share at that time; it was enough for me at the time — even more than my share.”</p>

I told her if she took the $10,000 she was cut out from taking anything else under the will, and my impression is I told her at the same time what her rights were under the intestate laws, and she determined to take the $10,000.” And on this point John Mullin testified, as follows: “Yes, sir; she took the $10,000 ; she took it in the place of her dower; she had nothing to do with the estate; she communicated that fact to me, what she would take ; she decided she would take the $10,000.”</p>

He said nothing about intestate laws directly or indirectly. He simply made it a condition of acceptance by his widow of benefits under his will, relinquishment by her of individual title to the insurance money, and consent that it become part of his estate. No one denies that he had a perfect right to impose this condition, and she to refuse the will and to take under the intestate laws. Refusal of the one necessarily involved acceptance of the other. That she did refuse acceptance of the benefits of the will, the testimony shows. Her refusal, by mere operation of law, invested her with the interest of widow in his estate. The insurance money was hers, notwithstanding and without the will. It is immaterial that she was ignorant of her right to take both the insurance money and her interest under the intestate laws. Knowledge on her part was unnecessary to vest title in her. Descent is daily cast without the knowledge of heirs, and no one doubts the validity of the title so derived. So, valid deeds may be made without the actual knowledge of the vendee: Reed <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20329" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 329">8 W. &amp; S. 329</a>. Acceptance of title in such cases is presumed. Once invested with title, Mrs. Maloney could not divest it by parol without consideration as against creditors. Not having parted with it prior to her bankruptcy, it passed to her assignee: Thomas <em>v. </em>Simpson, 3 Barr 60. In what position, then, stands the trustee ? He made distribution without the authority of this court at his peril. He did not even make inquiry of the widow in w'hat relation she stood to the estate, but assumed-that she was entitled to the whole net income as testamentary guardian, and is, therefore, entitled to the less sympathy for the <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>loss which must result to himself therefrom.

Mrs. Bridget Maloney, immediately on the death of William Maloney, her husband, had vested in her an estate for life in the one-third of the realty of which he died seised, which, in due course of law, passed to the assignee in bankruptcy of the firm of Mullin &amp; Maloney, of which firm she was a member, unless previously to the bankruptcy of that company she had, by some means, been divested of that estate.But this effect could not be produced by her oral declarations to Mr. Fetterman and others, that she had no interest in her husband’s estate, and that she desired the whole of it to go to her children. The Statute of Frauds and Perjuries rendered such declarations of no account whatever.
