An abandoned title is not transferred to an adverse claimant, or person who first seizes the land, but it falls back to the state, and, by its extinction, sometimes makes a younger and conflicting title good. The doctrine of abandonment does not apply to a perfect title, but only to imperfect titles. In favor of a junior warrant or settlement right, after long lapse of time, an imperfect title by warrant and survey may be presumed to be abandoned. But such presumption cannot be made of a perfect title ; that is never reinvested in the state on such principle. After the land has been located and patented, it will not fall back because it is derelict, nor for the owner’s neglect to pay the taxes.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b72-15" data-blocks='[["BL_72.10",72,[252,2101,1158,310]]]'>2. A stranger will not acquire title by payment of taxes on unoccupied land. Actual possession is necessary to acquire title under the Statute of Limitations. The presumption arising from the owner’s neglect to exercise every act of ownership, often called abandonment of his waiver of irregularities in sales of land for taxes, or on judicial process, is a very different thing from the statutory title by adver-se and continuous possession. In case of conflicting titles the older and better will not be lost by reason of the Statute of Limitations, nor presumption of waiver, upon the mere payment of taxes by the holder of the younger title.</p>

From 1844, down to the present time, that tract has never been assessed. No taxes have ever been paid upon it by any person, and no possession was ever taken. No acts of ownership by the warrantee or the patentee, or any other party, has been shown for a period of perhaps thirty-eight years.

These cases are clearly distinguishable. It would be a dangerous doctrine to hold that the owner of a junior survey which interfered with the senior, could acquire title to the interference by mere payment of taxes assessed upon his surveys. The owner’s non-payment of taxes cannot be considered as an abandonment of his title. The doctrine of abandonment does not apply to lands held by a perfect title, but only to imperfect titles, by warrant and survey. There are imperfect titles by warrant and survey, abandonment of which may be presumed in favor of a junior warrant or settlement right, or a purchaser of an irregular tax title: Chambers <em>v. </em>Mifflin, <a href="/pen-w/1/0074-02" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Pen. &amp; W. 74" data-case-ids="1826246,1826253" data-case-paths="/pen-w/1/0074-02,/pen-w/1/0074-01">1 P. &amp; W. 74</a>; Addleman <em>v. </em>Masterson, Id. 454; Star <em>v. </em>Bradford, 2 Id. 384; Read <em>v. </em>Goodyear, 17 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 350; Zerbe <em>v. </em>Schall, <a href="/watts/4/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts 138" data-case-ids="1842784" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0138-01">4 Watts 138</a>; Foust <em>v. </em>Ross, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20506" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 506">1 W. &amp; S. 506</a>. But a warrant and survey, returned and accepted on which the purchase-money has been paid, confers a perfect title against all the world but the Commonwealth, which has itself the legal title only as security for the patenting fees. If the payment of taxes by the owner of a junior interfering survey can confer no title upon him, and the non-payment by the owner of- the senior survey can work no forfeiture of title, it necessarily follows that there is a valid and subsisting title in the owners of the Jacob Bright survey, and if a better title than the plaintiffs can be set up by the <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>defendant, as an outstanding title: Watson <em>v. </em>Gilday, 11 S. &amp; R. 337.</p>

It was admitted that Bellas is dead and that he left living descendants. Under the evidence there could be no question of the validity of the title vested in the heirs of Bellas, and the court so held ; but refused to instruct the jury that their “ verdict must exclude so much of the land embraced in the writ of ejectment in this case as is covered by the Jacob Bright survey,” and on the ground that the defendant was a mere intruder, ruled that the “ outstanding title must be a valid subsisting title, not one abandoned, derelict or barred by the Statute of Limitations,” and directed a verdict for the plaintiff. In support of his instruction, the learned judge referred to the cases of Foust <em>v. </em>Ross, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 501" data-case-ids="1852582" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0501-01">1 W. &amp; S. 501</a>; Hunter <em>v. </em>Cochran, 3 Barr 105; Riland <em>v. </em>Eckert, 11 Harris 215, and McBarron et al. <em>v. </em>Gilbert et al., <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20268" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Wright 268">6 Wright 268</a>. The scope of the decision in Foust <em>v. </em>Ross is, that when land has been assessed, sold for taxes and deed duly executed by the proper officer, and the taxes subsequently paid by the holder of the tax title for more than twenty-one years, he has such title as enables him to recover against a mere intruder who will not be permitted to insist on irregularities which the former owner may be presumed to have waived by his abandonment. A man may be presumed to have waived irregularities in a tax sale or judicial sale, or in other words, to have abandoned his right to the purchaser after long lapse of time, as is fully explained in Bunting <em>v. </em>Young, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 188" data-case-ids="477882" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0188-01">5 W. &amp; S. 188</a>. In Hunter <em>v. </em>Cochran, a purchaser at a tax sale attempted to hold land on which the taxes had been paid, and he failed. Biland <em>v. </em>Eckert enforces like principle, as applied in Foust <em>v. </em>Boss. The land was sold on execution upon a judgment against the administrators without notice to the heirs of the decedent, and it was held the title was good against all persons except the heirs, and after twenty-one years the defendant would not be permitted-to set up a defence, the heirs could waive. In McBarron et al. <em>v. </em>Gilbert et al., the facts were as follows: The land in suit, as settled by the verdict, was included in chamber surveys on the Mertz and Flowers warrants which were returned in 1784. In 1794 actual surveys were made on the Morris warrants and patents issued, and these overran the land embraced in the Mertz and Flowers surveys. The title of the defendants originated in 1815, more than thirty years after the return of the surveys on the Mertz and Flowers warrants. Sixty-five years had elapsed from the date of the Morris surveys, and no owner of that title had ever asserted it, and the defendants had no connection with it. It was held that after twenty-one years the law treats all surveys duly returned into the land-office as actual surveys ; that before the warrants issued under which the defendants claimed, time had ripened the presumption which started with the return of the Mertz and Flowers surveys, which could not be impaired by the defendants showing that at some former day the Morris title was outstanding; <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>and that under the circumstances the Morris title must be treated as null. In -fact, the title of the plaintiff was on the .oldest warrants and surveys and perfect as against the title of defendants, and the alleged outstanding junior title was a nullity.</p>
    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.6",78,[232,589,1173,900]]]'>An abandoned title is not transferred to an adverse claimant or person who first seizes the land, but it falls back to'the state, and by its extinction sometimes makes a younger and conflicting title good. The doctrine of abandonment does not apply to a perfect title but only to imperfect .titles. In favor of a junior warrant or settlement right after long lapse of time, an imperfect title by warrant and survey may be presumed to be abandoned. But such presumption cannot be made of a perfect title; that is never reinvested in the state on such principle. After the land has been located and patented, it will not fall back because it is a derelict nor for the owner’s neglect to pay the taxes: Hoffman <em>v. </em>Bell, 11 P. F. Smith 444. A stranger will not acquire title by payment of taxes on unoccupied land. Actual possession is necessary to acquire title under the Statute of Limitations. The presumption arising from the owner’s neglect to exercise every act of ownership, often called abandonment, of his waiver of irregularities in sales of land for taxes or on judicial process, is a very different thing from the statutory title by adverse and continuous possession. In case of conflicting titles, the older and better will not be lost by reason of the Statute of Limitations, nor presumption of waiver upon the mere payment of taxes .by the holder of the younger title.</p>
