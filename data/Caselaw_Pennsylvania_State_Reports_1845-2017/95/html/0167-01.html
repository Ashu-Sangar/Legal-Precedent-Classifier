The defence was that the Christian Lower tract, of which the land in dispute was a part, was seated, and, therefore, not subject to assessment and sale as unseated land. It was claimed that it was seated in consequence of its connection with the Overdorf tract, on which there were improvements, and that in 1852 both tracts were purchased by the same party, with the view of holding and using them together as one tract, for the purpose of carrying on the lumbering business ; that they were so held, used and assessed, and thus the whole became one tract of seated land ; and consequently the subsequent assessment and sale of the Christian Lower tract as unseated was unauthorized and void. It was alleged that the two tracts adjoined, but it appeared that they were so located as to corner together at a certain hickory tree, and that a portion of another tract, in the form of an acute angle terminating at this common hickory corner, separated the two tracts so that they had no boundary line in common, and, therefore, they could not be considered adjoining tracts, but had simply a corner or point without any line common to both. Held, that they were not such adjoining tracts as would justify their being treated as one tract, so that the one would be seated by reason of the improvements on the other tract.</p>

There is no valid reason why either the owner of land sold for taxes, or a stranger to the title, may not, within the time allowed for redemption, take from the purchaser at treasurer’s sale a conveyance of his inceptive title and hold the same until it ripens into a complete tax title. Where, as in this case, the consideration paid is more than would be required to redeem the land, and a regular assignment of the tax title is executed, it would be unreasonable to infer that the transaction is a redemption and not a purchase.</p>

Arthurs, the plaintiff, claimed the land by virtue of a purchase from Zimmerman’s executor, in" June 1860. And also, under two tax sales, one made in August 1858 to Richard Shaw, and the other in June 1862 to himself. Each sale was made for taxes of the two preceding years.</p>

Second, that the two tax titles were invalid because the land was seated. It was alleged to be seated in two ways: first, by reason of a small improvement, called the Reisinger improvement, along the southern line of tract No. 110; and secondly, on the ground that a tract of about forty-two acres, called the Overdorf tract, which included an old improvement of about five or six acres with a log house thereon, constituted, with No. 110, but one tract, and that the improvement on the Overdorf part rendered the whole seated.

The owner of the Casper Stiver, an intervening tract, supposed and believed the same thing. The owners of the Lower and Overdorf tracts cut across the point of the Stiver and hauled timber across there as though it was their land. The question is not how the tracts were originally located, but how they were occupied and used. If they were so occupied and used, it would have the effect to make the two tracts one, as much as though they actually adjoined for some distance. All the parties supposed the Overdorf to lie alongside of the Lower, as appears by the deeds given in evidence, both by plaintiff and defendants. The deed to Zimmerman; the one from Zimmerman to Bascom, and the one from Kitzmiller, executor, to Arthurs, each recite that the Lower starts at the hickory and runs south along the Overdorf tract. All the owners and claimants of these lands supposing that these two tracts adjoined, for some distance having used and occupied them as though they did, it can now make no difference that it is discovered that according to the official survey they only adjoin at a corner, an acute angle of the ‘ Casper Stiver ’ coming in between them.”</p>

It will not be pretended, if there was a piece of wild land owned by one person, and another person had a farm on one side and a wild tract on the other, that he could in any way connect one to the other, so as to make 'one tract out of two, with another owner between them, even by his consent to use, occupy or cross over his land. The middle owner could turn him out at pleasure, the outside owner would be a tenant at will of the middle man. So in this case, this line runs to a point at the hickory corner. Point has no extension, length or breadth. The Casper Stiver lot stood as a middle man in this case.

After a unity of ownership, it has been common for the owner to subdivide and utterly ignore the old warrant lines. The same farm is not unfrequently composed of parts of different tracts, the cultivation being on one part, and the woodland on another. The principle as enunciated by the court is sustained by the case of Harper <em>v. </em>Mechanics’ Bank, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 204" data-case-ids="481809" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0204-01">7 W. &amp; S. 204</a>, in which ten tracts were assessed together as seated.

The same principle by its converse is asserted in the cases of Harper <em>v. </em>McKeehan, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 238" data-case-ids="1854662" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0238-01">3 W. &amp; S. 238</a>, and Russell <em>v. </em>Wentz, 12 Harris 338.

But the plaintiff in error claims that the two parts of this tract only touched at a common point, and therefore they could not be properly assessed together. This alleged fact was fully rebutted by the testimony of John DuBois, the owner of the Casper Stiver tract, whose land it is claimed cut off a portion from the Overdorff lot on its southeast side, and thereby forced its lines to a point at a hickory, a common corner of the Overdorff and Lower lots.</p>

One of these was derived from Henry Zimmerman through the deed of his executor, made in June 1860 pursuant to a power of sale contained in his last will and testament ; the other two were tax titles, founded on treasurer’s sales made respectively in 1858 and 1862.</p>
    <p id="b172-8" data-blocks='[["BL_172.11",172,[218,1239,1162,1159]]]'>It was conceded that in 1850 the title to the land was vested in Mr. Zimmerman. This admission, coupled with the power of sale and conveyance by the executor in pursuance thereof, made a clear prima facie case for the plaintiff, but the defendants claimed and introduced testimony to prove that Zimmerman, long before his decease, sold the land to Dr. Boyer, from whom they derived title, and that plaintiff purchased from the executor with full notice of the previous sale. The principles of law involved in this contention were correctly applied by the court, and the questions of fact connected therewith were fairly submitted to the jury. The learned judge, after specially directing attention of the jury to the testimony, instructed them that if the facts were as alleged by defendants no title remained in Zimmerman at the time of his death which his executor could transfer to the plaintiff; that it was therefore an important fact for them to determine whether or not the deed was delivered in the lifetime of Zimmerman; that if he simply made and retained the deed without delivering it to Boyer, or any one for him, it would not have the effect of divesting his title, and either he or his executor might sell the land and make a good title to the purchaser. It appears by their verdict that the finding of the jury on the question thus submitted to them must have been adverse to the plaintiff. It is unnecessary to notice in detail the several assignments of error on this branch of the subject. They neither involve any essential principle that was not sufficiently considered when the case was here on former writs of error, nor do they disclose any just ground of complaint on the part of the plaintiff.</p>

They also insisted that it was seated in consequence of its connection with the Overdorf tract, on which there were improvenjents. They claimed that in 1852 or thereabouts, both tracts were purchased by the same party with the view of holding aud using them together as one tract, for the purpose of carrying on the lumber business; that they were so held, used and assessed, and thus the whole became one tract of seated land; and consequently the subsequent assessment and sale of the Christian Lower tract as unseated was unauthorized and void. The learned judge instructed the jury, in substance, that this was so if they found the facts to be as claimed by the defendants. In this we think there was error. It was clearly shown that the tracts were not adjoining, and there was no competent or sufficient testimony to justify the jury in finding otherwise. When the case was here on former writ of error, it appeared to be a question of fact under the testimony then before the court, whether the Lower and Overdorf tracts' did not adjoin at least for a short distance southerly from the hickory, which was admitted to be the common corner of both; but, from the connected drafts of the original surveys of the two tracts and the Casper Stiver tract, together with the testimony of witnesses introduced on the last trial, it clearly and conclusively appears that the three tracts are so located as to corner together at the hickory; that a portion of the Casper Stiver tract, in the form of an acute angle, terminating at the common hickory corner, separates the other two tracts so that they have no boundary-line in common, and therefore cannot be considered adjoining tracts. They have simply a corner or point without any line common to both. The learned judge, in his charge, says: “ It would appear that the old surveys were made in March 1785. The Christian Lower and Casper Stiver cornered at a common point, a hickory. These two tracts were located the same year; the Lower some days earlier than the Stiver. The Edward Overdorf was not located until 1841. It seems to have cornered upon the same hickory, so that, according to the original survey, the Lower and Overdorf tracts only united at a common corner at the point where the hickory stood.” The facts thus stated fully accord with the uncontradicted testimony in the case, and clearly entitled the plaintiff to at least an unqualified affirmance of his eighth, thirteenth and sixteenth points. There was no conflicting testimony as to the original location and relative position of lines of the three original surveys, as shown on the corrected drafts, nor was there any competent testimony to show that these lines were ever changed, <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>or that the owners of either the Lower or Overdorf tracts ever acquired title by purchase, possession or in any other legitimate way, to the point of the Stiver tract which separates the two first-named tracts. The third, sixth, eleventh, thirteenth and twenty-first assignments of error are sustained.</p>
    <p id="A8B" data-blocks='[["BL_174.6",174,[241,639,1159,813]]]'>In view of the testimony, there was also error in that part of the charge embraced in the second assignment; and in the answer to the defendant’s fourth point, which is the subject of complaint in the twentieth specification of error. The deed from Zimmerman’s executor to the plaintiff is dated and acknowledged June 11th 1860, and the evidence is, that on the same day he procured from Richard Shaw an assignment of his inchoate tax title. There is nothing in the testimony to indicate that this was intended as a redemption of the land from the tax sale, nor does it follow as a matter of law that it was a redemption and not an acquisition of the tax title. There is no valid reason why either the owner of land sold for taxes, or a stranger to the title, may not, within the time allowed for redemption, take from the purchaser at treasurer’s sale a conveyance of his inceptive title, and hold the same until it ripens into a complete tax title. Where, as in this case, the consideration paid is more than would be required to redeem the land, and a regular assignment of the tax title is executed, it would be unreasonable to infer that the transaction is a redemption and not a purchase.</p>
