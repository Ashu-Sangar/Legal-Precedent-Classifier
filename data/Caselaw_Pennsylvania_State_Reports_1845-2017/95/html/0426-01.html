In the language of the court, can the damages actually done be “set-off” by imaginary benefits? In estimating <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>the advantages, such only as are special and peculiar to the property in question are to be considered, and not such as are common to the public. The special and peculiar advantages must be such, in fact, as result directly from the construction of the road, and are at once appreciable and not dependent upon the future conduct of the owner of the land in using the railroad. As no compensation can be recovered for consequential or speculative damages, so no offset can be claimed by the company taking the land for speculative advantages: Hornstein <em>v. </em>Atlantic and Great Western Railroad Co., 1 P. F. Smith 90; Sunbury and Erie Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Hummell, 3 Casey 99 ; Patten <em>v. </em>Northern Central Railroad Co., 9 Id. 426; Robbins <em>v. </em>Milwaukee and Horicon Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wis.%20610" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Wis. 610">6 Wis. 610</a>. The benefits proposed to be shown were not special to the works of the plaintiffs, but such as the public generally might enjoy from using the road. But the offer was further clearly obnoxious to the objection that the benefits were made to depend solely upon the fact whether the plaintiffs used the road. The idea of reducing the damages upon such a contingency can certainly have no weight. The only proper test of damages is the opinion of witnesses as to the value of the land taken, in view of its location and productiveness, its market value or the general selling price of land in the neighborhood ; evidence of particular sales, under special circumstances, is inadmissible: East Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Heister, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2053" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Wright 53">4 Wright 53</a>; Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Rose, 24 P.

    <p id="b430-7" data-blocks='[["BL_430.10",430,[261,1615,1163,685]]]'>Where a jury, as in the case in hand, are called upon to assess damages on account of the taking of lands by a corporation, they are, as is said by Gibson, J., in the case of The Schuylkill Navigation Company v. Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 441, to value the property without reference to the person of the owner, or the actual state of his business; and in doing that the only safe rule is, to inquire what the property, unaffected by the obstruction, would have sold for at the time the injury was committed, and what it would sell for as affected by the injury, arid the difference is the true measure of compensation. In Hornstein <em>v. </em>Atlantic &amp; Great Western Railroad Co., 1 P. F. Smith 87, the doctrine above stated is repeated, and it is said, per curiam: “ In estimating the damages resulting from the road, consequential or speculative damages are to be rejected, and in estimating the advantages such only as are special or peculiar to the property in question are to be considered, and not such as are common to the public.”</p>
    <p id="b430-8" data-blocks='[["BL_430.11",430,[263,2300,1157,131]],["BL_431.1",431,[168,407,1176,1122]]]'>Without going further for authority, these cases furnish all the elements necessary for the determination of the present controversy. Considering only the advantages and disadvantages, special <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>and peculiar, resulting to the plaintiffs’ property, by reason of the introduction of the defendants’ road upon it, what was the difference in its value in the real estate market, before and after the building of that road ? The resolution of this question solves the proposed problem. The property in question is used for manufacturing, and, ordinarily, the market values of such properties are advanced by the introduction of railroads; this fact is one upon which the jury must pass, for much depends upon the situation of the property and the accessibility of the road which traverses it. If that road is carried through it on an embankment so high, or in a cut so low that it cannot be reached by a switch, it is useless to the property; on the other hand, if the road is on grade, or nearly so, that by a siding, or switch it may be made useful and convenient for the purposes for which the property is used, the value of that property may be greatly enhanced thereby. How, then, can any -one reasonably contend that either of the above supposed conditions may not be given in evidence? We have no hesitation in saying that the court below was wrong in refusing to permit the defendant to prove that a siding could be conveniently constructed upon the property of the plaintiffs, and to show how such a construction might be made useful to the premises. That the plaintiffs refused to avail themselves of the advantages which may have been afforded them by the road, is, as we have seen, of no moment, for the question is not as to the disposition of the owners of the property, but whether or not the facilities afforded by the improvement have advanced the market values of the property.</p>
    <p id="b431-6" data-blocks='[["BL_431.6",431,[170,1529,1167,475]]]'>As immediately connected with the above stated proposition, we are also of opinion that the plaintiffs’ third point should have been affirmed. It is conceded that, under our Acts of Assembly, the owners of mills and manufactories may of right connect their private sidings with the railroads in their vicinity, and though, as the counsel for the defendants in error says, it does not follow that such owners may ever avail themselves of such right, nevertheless the fact that such a right exists in them may largely advance the market value of their several properties. Certainly privileges which may be used .to facilitate transportation to and from large factories must have some effect upon their values.</p>
    <p id="b431-7" data-blocks='[["BL_431.7",431,[170,2002,1168,431]],["BL_432.1",432,[279,409,1163,215]]]'>Again, the court refused the offer of the defendant to show that it had so built its depot as to be convenient to the plaintiffs’ works. In this we think there was error. Let us put the case from the other side and suppose the depot to be placed at such a distance from the plaintiffs’ land, or at such a place as to render it useless to their works, it follows that unless they have some other means of access, the railroad, as to them and their property, is utterly worthless, and from it no advantage could accrue that would form an offset to the damages suffered. Now who will undertake to say that a landowner could not show a condition of things such as this <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>before a jury summoned to Inquire into and assess the damages he may have suffered ? But if he may show these things the railroad company may show the converse; that it has furnished suitable and convenient depots and other conveniences, and that the lands which are traversed by its road are thereby benefited and improved.</p>
    <p id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[278,624,1164,513]]]'>True, a depot is designed for the public benefit, but <em>non constat </em>that the plaintiffs’ lands may not be specially benefited thereby. The very same thing may be said of the whole road, of which the depot is part, and yet it is the whole road, and not merely that part which happens to lie on the private property alleged to be damaged, which gives to it that peculiar or special value which is the subject of set off. It hence follows that while the general advantage, resulting as well to the public as to the property which is the subject of assessment, is not to be considered in estimating the benefits to that property, yet any and everything connected with the general improvement, which tends to increase its value or usefulness to such property, may be considered.</p>
