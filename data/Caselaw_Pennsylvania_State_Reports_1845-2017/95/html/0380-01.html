It was sold at April term of that year by the sheriff, on a judgment against William Sill to Elisha Beale for $9300, to whom a deed was made. Beale and wife conveyed to Jake Hill, on the 30th of March 1864, for an alleged consideration'of $10,000, and the deed was recorded June 18th 1864. The sheriff’s deed to Beale was acknowledged July 4th 1863. Suit was brought by the plaintiffs February 15th 1875, against Jake Hill, and served March 16th 1875 on him and on Ewing Cunningham, who was the alleged tenant of P. R. Bohlen.

At the sheriff’s sale to the bank, notice was given simply that the property was not Hill’s, but belonged to Sill’s heirs.

That statute punishes him for his fraud; it declared his title ‘ to be clearly and utterly void, frustrate and of none effect,’ as to Hill and his creditors; it is the same as if no sale had taken place.

And the distinction certainly is an unsubstantial one where, as in this case, the question to be decided is as to the operation of 'the sixth section of the Act of 1856. In courts of equity in cases of fraud the mode of administering relief is to declare the fraudulent grantee to be a trustee for the injured party, and thus to imply a trust: Rolfe <em>v. </em>Gregory, 4 De Gex, Jones &amp; Smith 576; Perry on Trusts, sect. 106; Bisp. Eq. 92; Willard’s Eq. Jur., p. 416. If it be true, then, that courts of equity in general treat fraudulent grantees as trustees, why shall not the facts in this cause be deemed an instance of such implied trusts within the sixth section of the Act of 1856, coming as they do within its spirit, if not within its letter.

This cause comes within the ruling of the cases cited by the court below. The distinction between a sale void for fraud under the statute of fraudulent conveyances and one where the purchaser, though he becomes a trustee for one to whom he stood in some confidential relation, by reason of fraud, yet takes a good title, is clearly pointed out in Sharp <em>v. </em>Long, 4 Casey 433, McKennan <em>v. </em>Pry, <a href="/watts/6/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Watts 137" data-case-ids="1846132" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0137-01">6 Watts 137</a>; Dick <em>v. </em>Cooper, 12 Harris 217; Dunn <em>v. </em>Truitt, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%2027" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 Phila. 27">8 Phila. 27</a>. Another distinction repeatedly made is, that in cases of a trust <em>ex maleficio </em>there must be a tender of the purchase-money before bringing suit. In cases of a sale, void under statute of fraudulent conveyances, no such tender is necessary ; the purchaser forfeits the money he paid on account of his fraud.</p>

It is “ an act for the greater certainty of title and more secure enjoyment of real estate,” the preamble of which declares its object to be that “the people should acquire, hold and improve their homesteads and estates in the confidence that they will not be lost by secret and unknown claims, or by fraud and perjury.” The court below was clearly right in saying that the case comes within its spirit. It is also within the mischief intended to be remedied. We have here an ejectment brought in 3875 for a valuable property and a recovery upon the ground of a fraud committed in 1863 by the purchaser at a sheriff’s sale. Said fraud consisted chiefly in obtaining the property at less than its value by falsely pretending that he was bidding it in for the family of the defendant in the execution, and by this and other devices deterring other persons from bidding. There must be some point of time when a purchaser of real estate at a judicial sale shall not have his title cut up by the roots by mere parol evidence of what took place at such sale.; or by a secret trust, disentombed after the lapse of years and set up by the uncertain recollection of witnesses as to remote transactions.

If such title is absolutely void, nothing passes to the fraudulent grantee. Yet he takes sufficient title to pass a good title to an innocent purchaser, and this is so by the terms of the act. And I apprehend the party defrauded could ratify and confirm a conveyance void under the Statute of Elizabeth, which he could not do if it were void in the broad sense of the term. This subject is very fully discussed by Chief Justice Lowrie in Pearsoll <em>v. </em>Chapin, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%209" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Wright 9">8 Wright 9</a>, and the authorities are there collected. In a later case (Seylar <em>v. </em>Carson, 19 P. F. Smith 81), the late Justice Williams, after citing Pearsoll <em>v. </em>Chapin with approval, proceeds to point out with great clearness the distinction between contracts which are void and those which are merely voidable. He says at page 87: “ The principle on which the distinction rests seems to be this: that is absolutely void which the law or the nature of things forbids to be enforced at all; as contracts to do an illegal act or omit a legal public duty; contracts in a form forbidden by law or made by persons having no legal power or capacity to contract; as bonds of married women. That is relatively void or voidable which the law condemns as a wrong to individuals and refuses to enforce against them; as contracts tainted with fraud or any other wrong against persons. A contract that is absolutely void cannot be ratified or confirmed, for that would be <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>giving sanction and validity to an agreement which the law declares to be illegal and refuses to enforce. But a contract relatively void, though it cannot be enforced against the defrauded party, is not so void as to vitiate a title under it as against a bona fide purchaser for value and without noticeor to prevent the party intended to be injured by it from renouncing the privilege which the law allows him of rejecting it altogether, or from ratifying it and thus making it his own.”</p>

The reason of it is this: having perpetrated a fraud and by means thereof obtained the property of another, equity will not permit him to enjoy the fruits of his fraud, but will hold him to be but a trustee for the rightful owner. He is not trustee for- the title, for that he never acquired, but of the thing which he has in manual possession. These and similar cases are not technical' trusts, but constructive trusts, or trusts <em>ex maleficio. </em>If, as was contended by the defendants in error, the effect of Hill’s fraud was to render his title void under the Statute of Elizabeth and as though no conveyance had been made, then Hill was in possession of Sill’s property. For whom did Hill hold it ? Not for himself, for he had no title. Being in possession of the property of another by an admitted fraud, can it be doubted .that it would have been within the recognised powers of a court of equity to have declared him a trustee by his own wrong of the property ? The very ground of relief in such cases is fraud, not trust. Equity declares the trust in order that it may lay its hand upon the thing and wrest it from the possession of the wrongdoer. This principle is distinctly recognised by our leading text writers. It is said by Mr. Bispham in his excellent treatise on the Principles of Equity at section 92 : “ Equity, as we shall see, makes use of the machinery of a trust for the purpose of affording redress in cases of fraud ; as when a party has acquired the legal title to property by unfair means, he will be deemed to hold it in trust for the injured party who may call for a conveyance thereof. The party guilty of the fraud is said in such cases to be a trustee <em>ex maleficio. </em>But in such cases the interference of courts of equity is called into play by fraud as a distinct head of equitable jurisdiction ; and the complainant’s right to relief is based upon that ground, the defendant being treated as a trustee merely for the purpose of working out the equity of the complainant.” Jn Perry on Trusts the same doctrine is laid down. I quote from section 106: “ If a person obtains the legal title to property by such ftrts or acts or circumstances of circumvention, imposition or fraud, or if he obtains it by virtue of a confidential relation and influence jjtpder such circumstances that he ought not, according to the pities <em>of </em>polity and good conscience, as administered in chan<a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>eery, to nold and enjoy the beneficial interest of the property; courts of equity, in order to administer complete justice between the parties, will raise a trust by construction out of such circumstances or relations. When it is said that the person who fraudulently receives or possesses himself of trust property, or who has defrauded another of his estate by misrepresentation, concealment or other fraudulent practices, is converted by the court into a trustee and ordered to account for or reconvey the property, the expression is used for the purpose of describing the nature and extent of the remedy against him, and it denotes that the parties defrauded or beneficially entitled, have the same rights and remedies against him as they would be entitled to against an express trustee who had fraudulently committed a breach of trust.” We might multiply citations from the text-books were it necessary.</p>
    <p id="b387-6" data-blocks='[["BL_387.6",387,[191,997,1155,246]]]'>A confidential relation is not necessary, to establish a constructive trust. Such trusts frequently grow out of confidential relations, as our books abundantly show, but that they are essential to a trust <em>ex maleficio, </em>I apprehend cannot be shown. I know of no Pennsylvania case which so holds, nor has any such case been called to our attention.</p>
    <p id="b387-7" data-blocks='[["BL_387.7",387,[185,1254,1160,946]]]'>Our own decisions show that trusts arising from actual fraud are within the act: Maul <em>v. </em>Rider, 1 P. F. Smith 377, and 9 Id. 167; Rider <em>v. </em>Maul, 20 Id. 15. And while the point is not expressly ruled, it has been laid down as a general proposition in several cases that there is a constructive or implied trust in all cases of fraud, and where transactions have been carried on mala fide. Thus it was said by Justice Duncan in Peebles <em>v. </em>Reading, 8 S. &amp; R. at page 492 : “If, by the artifice of the purchaser declaring that he was to buy for the owner, others were prevented from bidding, and the land was sold at a great under value, this would make him a trustee.” Thedearned judge meant, of course, a trustee <em>ex maleficio. </em>And again, in Haines <em>v. </em>O’Connor, <a href="/watts/10/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 Watts 313" data-case-ids="1850947" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0313-01">10 Watts 313</a>, it was said by Justice Posers that “ a purchaser at a sheriff’s sale, who has paid the money, can only be held a trustee <em>ex maleficio </em>on the ground of fraud; and where he is guilty of fraud, he is a trustee for the creditors and for the debtor also, unless the debtor be <em>particeps criminis.” </em>Of course, there must be something more than the violation of a parol agreement in relation to land in order to raise a trust <em>ex maleficio. </em>The violation of such an agreement is no more than the violation of any other contract, and the party must be left to his legal remedy. Besides, such agreements are in contravention of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries.</p>
