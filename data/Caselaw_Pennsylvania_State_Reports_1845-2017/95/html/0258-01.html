Welch, commenced an action of ejectment against Enos Emerson for the land in dispute and caused a writ of estrepement to issue against him and others holding under him in actual possession. F. A. Roter and Charles Spreter, tenants in possession of five acres of the land, gave bail in the sum of $1000, and had the writ of estrepement dissolved as to the five acres and completed the well they were boring. The plaintiff, afterwards, on the 25th of July 1879, procured an <em>alias </em>writ of estrepement,</p>

The defendant, Emersop, at the hearing had the same day, contended that he had the equitable title and right of possession. The court, in consideration of the situation of the property and what they believed was necessary for its preservation to those really entitled, decided to appoint a receiver of five-sixteenths of the oil as royalty, pending the litigation between the parties, and adjudged the remainder to the working interest.</p>

Emerson then paid the money into court, but the plaintiff in that case took a writ of error to the Supreme Court, and after-wards Emerson and Wall took this appeal.</p>

      <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>In the present equity proceeding, the court, Williams, P. J., delivered the following opinion: — “ The bill and affidavits in this case disclose a peculiar state of facts. An action of ejectment is pending between these parties, which was brought on 4th April 1879 ; on the same day an estrepement to stay waste was issued; the land is valuable as oil land, and is surrounded on all sides by productive oil territory; the map attached to the affidavit of A. I. Wilcox shows that no less than twenty-eight wells have been put down, or are in process of drilling near enough to the lines of this lot to draw oil from it; within a short time its value will be greatly impaired if not wholly destroyed by the natural drainage from it by means of this large number of wells along its lines on adjoining lands.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b259-7" data-blocks='[["BL_259.7",259,[204,1124,1161,430]]]'>“ The defendant, Emerson, claims on the other hand to hold the equitable title under a contract made on the 23d of November 1872, which he insists has not been extinguished. The determination of the action of ejectment depends on this question. If the attempt to extinguish the equity by re-entry and sale under a provision in the contract of November -23d 1872, was authorized by and valid and effectual under the terms of that contract, the plaintiff m.ust recover without condition; if not, then his recovery must be conditional and such as to save the equitable title and rights acquired under it.</p>

On the 23d of April 1879, Wall sub-let to Doty. On the 26th of April 1879, Doty assigned to Roter &amp; Spreter, who at once began work upon their mase. They gave bond and secured an order modifying the estrepement so far as to permit them to put down one well; this well is finished and is producing at least one hundred and fifty barrels of petroleum daily; they cannot operate further without giving additional bonds and securing another modification of the writ of estrepement; they have a lease of oil land now known to be of great value. By the terms of their lease, they are bound to render one-fourth of the oil to Wall. What is needed for the interest of owners and lessees is to operate the territory before it is drained by adjoining owners who are crowding the lines on every side; the writ of estrepement prevents this; Wall does not give security and dissolve the writ, but insists on his one-fourth of the oil produced. The tenants cannot afford to furnish security necessary to secure the dissolution of the writ and take the chances of a recovery by Welch for the land and the mesne profits which they have accounted for and must in that case con<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>tinue to account for to Wall. Upon consideration of the situation of this property and what is necessary for its preservation to those really entitled, we have decided to appoint a receiver in accordance with the prayer of the bill, for five-sixteenths of the oil as royalty. The remainder appears by the affidavits to be a sufficient provision for the working interest, and the tenants express their willingness to operate the íand actively upon this basis.</p>

    <p id="AYq" data-blocks='[["BL_261.13",261,[184,1021,1166,1031]]]'>—This is not merely a case of conflicting titles, like Schlecht’s Appeal, in which the effect was, practically, to turn the defendants out of possession by a bill in equity. Sharswood, J., in that case says : “ An injunction and-receiver are resorted to in any case only to preserve property in statu quo pending a contest. For any waste the law has provided a remedy by estrepement, or an injunction may be obtained if preferred, but anything like an averment of waste is not to be found in this bill.” The appointment of a receiver rests in the sound discretion of the court: Milwaukee Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Soutter, 2 Wallace 521. A court of equity will interfere, even in cases of disputed titles, when the peculiar circumstances seem to require it, even where the cause is pending in another court: Daniels’s Chancery, vol. 2, 1725, 4th ed: Kerr on Receivers 13. If the remedy afforded by the courts of ordinary jurisdiction is inadequate for the purposes of justice, the Court of Chancery will, on a proper case being made out, <em>ex debito Justitice, </em>appoint a receiver: Kerr on Receivers 1, 2. The jurisdiction to appoint receivers in similar cases, was fully recognised in Chicago &amp; Allegheny Oil &amp; Min. Co. <em>v. </em>U. S. Petroleum Co., 12 P. F. Smith 83, though in that case the decree was refused on the merits of the ease. Equity will restrain a purchaser who has obtained possession without paying the purchase-money from committing waste: Crawford <em>v. </em>Alexander, 15 Vesey 138; Kerr on Injunctions 263, 288.</p>

But will that consideration give a court of equity jurisdiction of a mere ejectment bill, and the power to take possession of the land in controversy ? We think not. The legislature may, perhaps, be competent to give some remedy, taking care to preserve to the defendant his constitutional right of trial by jury. The mere granting of an issue in the discretion of the chancellor is not enough. Eor the courts to assume such a jurisdiction would, we think, be a clear case of judicial legislation.</p>
