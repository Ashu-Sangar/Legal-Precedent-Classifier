Walter being, so far as such satisfaction goes, the bank, plaintiff, as well as one of the defendants in the judgment, found it easy to control the execution and direct a levy on the real estate of his co-defendants, the appellants, and that being done, they applied to the court for the equitable relief provided by the act. To meet just such a case it is apparent that the legislature made provision relieving copartners from the grip of the common law, as was done by the Act of 1838, providing that partners who were members of two firms might maintain .a suit at common law against themselves and their copartners.</p>
