If the instruction to the jury, that the question of interest was in their discretion, or if the third point of defendant be a correct statement of the law, the verdict must stand without modification. In the recent edition (1880) of Sedgwick on the Measure of Damages, vol. 2, p. 158, in relation to cases where interest can be recovered, it is said: ‘ The subject is susceptible of a very clearly defined division, 1st. Where it can be claimed as a right, either because there is an express contract to pay it, or because it is recoverable as damages, which the party is legally bound to pay, or for money or property improperly withheld. 2d. Where it is imposed to punish negligent, tortious or fraudulent conduct. In the first case, it is recoverable as a matter of law. In the second case, it rests entirely in the pleasure of the jury. To the same effect is Lincoln <em>v. </em>Claflin, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wall.%20138" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Wall. 138">7 Wall. 138</a>. There is, however, a third class of cases not included in either of the above, where interest is not allowable, either as matter of law or in the pleasure of the jury. In the <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>English courts interest is disallowed in many cases where it would be allowed in this country. The American cases differ widely, some following closely the rulings in England, while others adopt a more liberal rule on the allowance of interest. In the cases oi Hermits of St. Augustine <em>v. </em>The County of Philadelphia, and St. Michael’s Church <em>v. </em>Same, Bright. Rep. 116,121, arising on the same statute as does our case, Judge Rogers, at nisi prius, instructed the jury that they might, in their discretion, allow interest. In the charge there is no reference to the terms of the Act of Assembly on this point, nor to the decisions governing the question. It seems to have been assumed that, because the county was made liable, it was to be held liable, in all respects, as the wrongdoer, except that punitive damages could not be allowed. The question does not appear to have ever been raised in the Supreme Court, nor so far as we have been able to ascertain has the question before been raised and discussed in any court of the state, although similar cases have been decided in other states. In Mowry <em>v. </em>Whitney, 14 Wallace 434, the United States Supreme Court decides that interest is not allowable on the profits as damages, for the infringement of a patent right, and they say further, ‘ interest is not gen- , erally allowable on unliquidated damages.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b415-6" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[174,1323,1171,1035]]]'>“In Passenger Railway Company <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 1 P. F. Smith 468, it is held that interest should not be allowed on overdue taxes, where the non-payment arose from the mutual mistake of plaintiff’s agents and defendant. To the same general effect is <a href="/cal/44/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="44 Cal. 239" data-case-ids="2316040" data-case-paths="/cal/44/0239-01">44 Cal. 239</a> ; <a href="/ill/72/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="72 Ill. 148" data-case-ids="2711054" data-case-paths="/ill/72/0148-01">72 Ill. 148</a> ; <a href="/mo/63/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="63 Mo. 98" data-case-ids="969976" data-case-paths="/mo/63/0098-01">63 Mo. 98</a>. In general, it appears to be the rule of the courts that have gone farthest in the allowance of interest, that where the defendant has not wrongfully trespassed upon or withheld the property or money of the plaintiff, or has not obtained any advantage by any wrong done, and has not been guilty of fraud, and especially where the liability arises wholly by virtue of a statute, and no provision for interest is made therein, interest cannot be allowed as a part of the damages, either as a matter of law or at the pleasure of the jury. Aside from the Philadelphia cases above cited, we find no cases which, in their decision, or in the principles laid down therein, will sustain the ruling of the court in this case,, submitting the question of interest to the jury, and no case whatever that even indirectly sustains the plaintiff’s prayer for instruction that the jury must allow interest. In the recent cases decided against Allegheny county, in which the more important questions of the liability of the county were decided, we are informed that counsel agreed on the amount of the verdicts, and that no question was raised as to interest either in the court below or in the Supreme Court. In Sergeant <em>v. </em>The Inhabitants of Hampden, <a href="/me/38/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="38 Me. 581" data-case-ids="648246" data-case-paths="/me/38/0581-01">38 Me. 581</a>, our precise question appears to have been raised and decided.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b415-7" data-blocks='[["BL_415.7",415,[177,2352,1167,90]],["BL_416.1",416,[261,433,1175,859]]]'>“ The Act of Assembly provided for ‘ the recovery for injuries Buffered to the person or property, through defects of the highway, <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>to the amount of the damages sustained thereby. The action was to recover damages for such injuries. The court below instructed the jury that they might»add interest as part of the damages. The Supreme Court held this to be error, and reversed therefor, on the ground that the liability arose on the statute which did-not provide for .interest, and that it was not allowable, and distinguishing it from such actions as trover and conversion. Examining the provisions of our Act of Assembly we find that no interest is provided for in the act. The liability does not arise from the act of the county. No liability is imposed on the county authorities to pay until the plaintiff has brought suit and proceeded to verdict and final judgment; then for the first time it becomes the duty of the county to pay. There has been no wrongful or unlawful detention of the property or money of the plaintiff by the county or any of its agents. All the conditions, and each of them which render a defendant liable for interest, are wanting in this case. The court is unanimously of the opinion that the third point, submitted by the defendant’s counsel, correctly states the law of interest as applicable to this case. As the jury in making up their verdict excluded interest, the verdict requires no modification.</p>

We assert that an examination of the authorities will show that from the first reported case under the Act, that of the Hermits of St. Augustine <em>v. </em>Philadelphia County, Bright. 116, 4 Clark 120, down to the case decided last year, Gibson <em>v. </em>Allegheny County, Norris 397, &amp;c., that the value of the property destroyed, with interest from the date of destruction, was the rule of damages adopted. But it is said that the question of interest was not raised in the Gibson case; that there was no assignment of error to the charge of the court below on that question. Judge Hice in that case followed the rule adopted in all previous reported cases, and his ruling was affirmed. And the fact that no objection was made to his ruling is a strong argument that he was right.</p>

The defendant claimed that as the right of action was given by a statute penal íd its nature, and as the statute did not give interest but in terms created the duty to pay on the part of the defendant, only after the amount of the loss had been fixed by a trial, the jury were not authorized to allow interest. Points expressive of these respective views were presented. The court formally refused all these points, instructed the jury to find a special verdict indicating the amount of the loss at the time of the destruction of the property, and to allow interest or not, as they thought fit; and reserved the questions raised by the respective points. The jury, by their verdict, found the amount of the loss at the time of the riot, and as a matter of discretion, refused to allow interest.</p>

In the two Philadelphia cases under the same statute, Judge Rogers instructed the jury that interest was a matter within their discretion.
