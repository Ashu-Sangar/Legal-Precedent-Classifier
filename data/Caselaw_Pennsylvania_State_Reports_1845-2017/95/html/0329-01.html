    <p id="b331-5" data-blocks='[["BL_331.7",331,[205,410,1167,908]]]'>The Act of 1848 gave a married woman power to bind her estate for necessaries purchased by her for the support of herself or her family. The criterion fixed by the act, however, is necessarily for the support of herself and family, not speculative advantages to her real estate. A clearer case of the evils of such a construction of the law cannot be produced. A contract for the erection of a house to cost $5250, the building erected and the price almost paid in full (the testimony shows that the contractor had been paid all but about $900), yet liens are filed for over $3000, being more than the property realized at the sale. It is true some of these liens were held to be invalid, because informal, but that was an accident not to be expected in every case. If, however, such liens are tobe sustained, some evidence of the necessity, or at least occasion of the work, should be shown beyond the mere statement of it in the claim filed. In' the claim filed by Harrison it is alleged that the building was erected by Kate Hale “ for the use and occupany of herself and family, and was a necessary improvement of the lot of ground;” and in the claim filed by Brown, that the work done .was “necessary and convenient to the preservation and enjoyment of the said estate;” but in the claim filed by McAdams there is no allegation of any necessity whatever.</p>

In these cases it is held that the power to encumber her property by a married woman is not given by or dependent upon the Married Woman’s Act of 1848, but by virtue of the law creating mechanic’s liens.</p>

F. Smith 320, as to the power of a married woman to contract for the improvement or repair of her property. He, however, admits that this doubt has been partially, if not wholly, resolved in Lippincott <em>v. </em>Leeds, 27 P. F. Smith 420, wherein it was ruled that a married woman is liable for repairs to her separate estate, made at her request, and necessary for its preservation and enjoyment. This power arises not from the direct grant of it by the statute, but from implication. The statute confers upon her the right to control and enjoy her own property, but in order to this she must have the power to protect it from dilapidation and decay, but to improve is often as great a necessity as to repair. For the enjoyment of wild lands, clearing, fencing and buildings are necessary; for the use and' enjoyment of a city lot a dwelling is necessary ; so where a building falls or burns down, it must be rebuilt, and to say that a married woman shall not have the power to contract for such <em>necessary </em>improvements, is to say that she shall not have the ordinary means of controlling and enjoying her separate estate, and thus, is the very spirit and intention of the Act of 1848 destroyed. It, therefore, certainly follows that her power to contract for improvements as well as for repairs is inseparably incident to her right to take and hold real estate for her own separate use. But in support of this point we have an abundance of authority. The very question now before us was decided in the cases of Forrester <em>v. </em>Preston, and Hutchinson <em>v. </em>Preston, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pitts.%20Rpts.%20298" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Pitts. Rpts. 298">2 Pitts. R. 298</a>, 304. These cases were tried in the District Court of Allegheny county in 1861, and affirmed by this court without dissent in 1862. In these cases the only question raised and determined was the validity of mechanics’ liens filed against a married woman’s separate estate for work done and materials furnished in and about a dwelling erected for her. In Murray <em>v. </em>Keys, 11 Casey 384, Mr. Justice Woodward says, that the power of a married woman to contract debts to improve her separate estate, remove liens, &amp;c., is conferred by the sixth section of the Act of 1848. In Lippincott <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 7 P. F. Smith 328, a judgment founded upon a <em>narr. </em>charging that a married woman “ then and there having and enjoying her own separate estate, hired and employed plaintiff to furnish work, labor and materials on and for the same, being necessary for said estate,” was sustained. In Kuhns <em>v. </em>Turney, 6 Norris 497, it was held that a feme covert’s power to contract for the improvement and repair of <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>her- separate property arises <em>ex necessitate ; </em>that it is impossible to see how, under a strict application of the common-law rule, a married woman could properly enjoy her estate, and hence, it is necessary, in order to give the Act of 1848 its intended force, to allow her to contract for necessary improvements and repairs. In like manner it is conceded by Mr. Justice Mercur, in Shannon <em>v. </em>Shultz, 6 Norris 481, that such power does exist in the feme covert, though it arises rather by implication than from the express terms of the act. As sustaining the same opinion, we may cite Findley’s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith 456; Heugh <em>v. </em>Jones, 8 Casey 432 ; Dearie <em>v. </em>Martin, 28 P. F. Smith 56, and Schriffer <em>v. </em>Saum, 31 <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pitts.%20Rpts.%20298" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Pitts. Rpts. 298">Id. 385</a>.</p>
