Davison for a loan of $4000 for the purpose of lifting some encumbrances on the land, and offered as security for said loan a mortgage on her land aforesaid. Mr. Davison referred the matter to his attorney for examination of title, who prepared a paper for Mrs. Stotler and her husband to sign, releasing her interest in the premises in controversy. Mrs. Stotler objected to signing the paper because it was a general release of her dower or claim upon the land. She said, however, that she would make no claim against the mortgage that was about to be negotiated to Mr. Davison. Mr. Stotler, her husband, was present and assented to this arrangement.</p>

No clearer case of an equitable estoppel could be imagined as against a person <em>sui juris. </em>The question then presents itself: Does the fact of coverture alter the case so as to enable Mrs. Stotler, with the assistance of her husband, to commit a fraud which she would not be allowed to do if she had remained a widow? The benefit which her daughter received in this loan, at her solicitation, was a consideration which really inured to the mother’s advantage. And why, then, should she not be held to the arrangement, on the same principle which led to the decision of this court in Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Casey 81, where a judgment confessed by a married woman for purchase-money was determined to be good, as against the land sold to her. It was said in that case that the disability of coverture was intended to be a shield not a weapon for mischief.

In the second paragraph of his will he directs that his widow shall receive one-third of the proceeds of his entire estate as long as she lives, and that the residue of his estate should be equally divided among his four children. If he had died intestate she would have taken, under the law, “ one-third part of the real estate for the term of her life.” The devise of “ one-third of the proceeds,” &amp;c., gave her precisely the same interest in the land: Carlisle <em>v. </em>Cannon, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Rawle%20488" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 Rawle 488">3 Rawle 488</a>. Inasmuch then, as her interest in the real estate was the same, whether she took under the will or under the intestate law, it was wholly unnecessary for her to make any election in regard to it; and the principle applies that, where the interest under both is the same the devisee takes under the intestate law rather than under the will. Mrs. Stotler was, therefore, invested with that interest in the land which the law gives to the widow of an intestate who dies leaving issue. Was that interest divested? The master found that when the money was loaned by appellant to Mrs. Landwehr, and the mortgage taken to secure the same, Mrs. Stotler agreed verbally that she would not assert any claim prejudicial to the mortgagee. Based upon this fact, the contention of appellant was, that inasmuch. as he had purchased the land at sheriff’s sale under the mortgage, Mrs. Stotler was bound by her agreement, or at least was estopped thereby from setting up <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>any claim to the land as against him. This proposition was rightly held to be untenable ; that, being a married woman, Mrs. Stotler’s interest in the real estate could not be thus divested ; that she was not bound by her agreement, nor was she thereby estopped from claiming her interest in the land. This conclusion was undoubtedly correct, and is abundantly fortified by authority. While a different rule has been recognised in some of our sister states, it has been settled in this state by an unbroken line of decisions, that the interest of a married woman in real estate cannot be divested except in the mode pointed out by our statute, and that she cannot be estopped by acts or declarations, which in the case of a feme sole would operate as an estoppel: Peck <em>v. </em>Ward, 6 Harris 506 ; Ulp <em>v. </em>Campbell, 7 Id. 361; Glidden <em>v. </em>Strupler, 2 P. F. Smith 400. It follows, therefore, that she was entitled to a decree; but, should it have included the arrears due her at the date of the sheriff’s sale ? We think not. Appellant’s mortgage, on which the property was sold, appears to have been the first lien on the land after the widow’s interest was acquired, and the effect of the sale was to divest the amount due her and in arrear at that time. In Wertz’s Appeal, 15 P. F. Smith 306, it was decided that where the owner of land charged with a widow’s thirds mortgaged it, and afterwards a judgment was recovered against him, under which the land was sold, there being then arrears of interest due the widow, the purchaser took subject to the arrears of interest as well as to the mortgage. The reason for the rule announced in that and kindred cases is, that a mortgage intervened between the estate, or charge out of which the arrears were payable, and the judgment under which the sheriff’s sale was made. But, where, as in the present case, no mortgage intervenes, the arrears of dower, capable of ascertainment, are divested and thrown upon the fund produced by the sale; and it is the duty of those interested to see that the property sells for sufficient to cover such arrearages. This principle is distinctly recognised in Dickinson <em>v. </em>Beyer, 6 Norris 274, in which the authorities are collected, and the distinction existing between the different classes of cases clearly pointed out. It is unnecessary to do more than to refer to the opinion in that case for a full and lucid exposition of the law on the subject. Land charged with dower had been sold on a judgment immediately subsequent to the charge, and it was held that the arrears due at the time of the sheriff’s sale were discharged thereby.</p>
