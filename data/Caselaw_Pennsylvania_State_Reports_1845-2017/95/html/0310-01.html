      <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>This was an action upon one of ten judgment notes brought by Elizabeth A. Ainsworth, for the use of her children, against Henry Kiern. Judgment was entered upon the notes, but upon application of Kiern they were opened and he let into a defence. The notes were given by Kiern to the husband of the plaintiff on an occasion when Kiern was detected by Ainsworth in illicit relations with the plaintiff, his wife. Ainsworth subsequently brought an action of <em>crim. con. </em>against Kiern, and obtained a judgment thereon for $62.50.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b311-7" data-blocks='[["BL_311.7",311,[227,1006,1155,257]]]'>The record in said suit did not show that there was a plea of accord and satisfaction therein, but the plaintiff was permitted to offer testimony to show that by leave of court such a plea had been allowed but not reduced to writing. And also to prove the charge of the court to show that the defendant had set up the notes as a settlement of the alleged damages.</p>

If the defendant in the <em>crim. con. </em>case did not give the judgment notes in evidence on the trial, then he is not estopped from setting up the record of that case in bar in a future trial for the same cause of action, and he offered to prove this by a witness present. It cannot be urged that because the notes were offered in evidence on behalf of the plaintiff in that case, to show that the defendant acknowledged his guilt, that therefore the defendant, Kiern, was estopped from setting up the record of that case as a bar in the note cases. Yet in this one proposition lies this whole case.</p>

The material and only material question in the case is, whether the defendant below having relied in his action of <em>crim. con. </em>upon the ten notes given in favor of Mrs. Ainsworth as a settlement of plaintiff’s claim, and having filed a plea of accord and satisfaction in that case setting up these notes as received in full payment and satisfaction, wasestopped thereby from taking defence in this case that they were given under coercion, and were invalid.
