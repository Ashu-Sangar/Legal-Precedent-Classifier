        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThe sheriff\u2019s return was in the form prescribed by the statute, and therefore by its terms showed a good service. But if it were traversable it was good on the facts so far as they appear. The defendant had gone away leaving his family in his residence, and there was no evidence of his intention to acquire a new domicile, certainty none that he had acquired one. The only negation of intention to return is by an inference from the circumstances, drawn by his wife, who expressly admits that she had no information from him on the subject.\nOn the other branch of the case, the plaintiff\u2019s statement contained the averment that tho defendant \u201ctook for his own use out of the moneys of and belonging to the said bank \u201d the sum etc. and that no part of the said sum \u201c has ever been paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, and that the same is owing, unpaid and due from the defendant to the plaintiff.\u201d This states a good prima facie cause of action. The plaintiff was not bound to go further and negative possible defenses.\nThe averments in the statement as to the tickets or memoranda deposited by the defendant in the place of the money he took, and the copies of such tickets attached to the statement, are in compliance with the act of 1887. The tickets do not of themselves import any liability on the part of the defendant, and would certainty not comply with the rule under the old affidavit of defense law that required the instrument sued on to be such as could go to the jury to establish, unaided by other evidene.e, the liability of the defendant. But this rule and the cases of Harbison v. Hawkins, 81* Pa. 142, and Wall v. Dovey, 60 Pa. 212, cited by appellant, were under the former statutes by which the affidavit was made to the instrument sued on. All the cause of action that the court had before it on the rule for judgment was the copy filed. Under the practice act of 1887 however the affidavit is to a defense against the statement, and the copy of instrument attached to the latter is merely a matter of evidence, in aid of that precision in setting forth the cause of action, which it was probably perceived would be likely to be wanting in the rambling story which the act invited plaintiffs to substitute for a declaration in the scientific and approved form.\nThe circumstances are such that there may be a hardship in the case, and if defendant or his counsel can produce any evidence to cast a doubt on the amount, or on the merits in any way, he will have a good standing to have the judgment opened, but on this record we find no error in entering it.\nJudgment affirmed.\nSteerett, C. J., dissents.",

P. Blair Co., Jan. T., 1895, No. 23, refusing to set aside service of summons, and entering judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit by a bank to recover moneys alleged to have been fraudulently appropriated by the defendant, the cashier of the bank.\nFrom the record it appeared that the sheriff\u2019s return of service of summons was as follows : \u201c Served by leaving a copy thereof at the dwelling house of defendant with wife of the defendant, Mrs. Julia O. Gardner, an adult member of the defendant\u2019s family, and that the defendant could not be conveniently found.\u201d Defendant\u2019s wife obtained a rule to set aside the service, filing .the following affidavit:\n\u201cShe is the wife of Harry A. Gardner, the defendant in this suit, and she is the person with whom the sheriff of the county left a paper purporting to be a writ of summons against her husband in the above entitled suit; that at the time the said writ was left with her, to wit: 15th October, 1894, Harry A. Gardner was not a resident of the count}', and was not an occupant nor inmate of her dwelling house; that he had left his home and said dwelling house on the 6th August, 1894, or thereabout, and had not since returned ; that when he left he did not inform her where he was going, but at the time of his leaving he had for a number of years been the cashier of the plaintiff bank, and from what she has since learned from statements and charges made against him in connection with his office, by those connected with the bank, she believes, when he left it was to abandon his then place of residence, and that it was not his purpose to return to it; that at present, and on. the said 15th October, 1894, he was no longer a resident of the county, and he could not have been \u2018 found \u2019 at all \u2018 conveniently \u2019 or otherwise by the officer who came with the writ, nor could she for him make answer to the complaint in this writ, as she has no knowledge touching the law.\u201d\nThe court discharged the rule.\nPlaintiff\u2019s statement was as follows :\nThe plaintiff, the Second National Bank, of Altoona, Pa., a corporation, chartered under the laws of the United States, doing business in the city of Altoona, in said county, claims of the defendant, Harry A. Gardner, the sum of \u00a72,098.18, with interest thereon from the 6th day of August, A. D. 1894, which is justly due and payable to the said plaintiff, by the said defendant, upon the cause of action whereof the following is a statement. The defendant was elected cashier in the said plaintiff bank in the month of August, 1882, and then and there entered upon and assumed and discharged the duties of cashier of the said bank from that time until tbe 6tb day of August, 1894, continuously; that from the 1st day of January, 1889, to the 6th day of August, 1894, the said Harry A. Gardner, as cashier of said bank, took for his own use out of the moneys of and belonging to the said bank the said sum of $2,098.18, and in lieu of the said sum of money, deposited in the cash item account, which he, as cashier of said bank kept, tickets and memoranda, copies of which are annexed to this statement of claim and made a part of it, showing and charging himself with the amount and amounts taken from time to time, as aforesaid; that the sum or amount of these tickets and memoranda deposited by the said defendant in the said cash item account kept by himself, as aforesaid, as cashier of the said bank, is $2,098.18, on which interest is owing from the 6th day of August, A. D. 1894 ; that no part of the said principal sum has ever been paid by tire defendant to the plaintiff, and that the same is owing, unpaid and due from the defendant to the plaintiff.\nAnd that the whole amount of said indebtedness was eon trac ted by the said defendant with the said plaintiff since the 1st day of January, 1889, and prior to the 6th day of August, 1894.\nCopy.

Gardner, wife of defendant, who being duly sworn according to law says she makes defense for her husband in above action as follows:\n\u201c She is informed by counsel there can be no recovery upon the plaintiff\u2019s statement, filed for the following reasons :\n\u201c1. Whilst it is alleged in plaintiff\u2019s statement, during the time from 1st of January, 1889, to 6th August 1894, more than 5i\u00a1 years, that defendant took for his own use at different times sums equal in the aggregate to <f2,098.18, it is not alleged that he wrongfully or improperly took the same, nor that the same was not accountable on, or due for his salary and compensation which during that period he had earned, and which would amount to a sum very much more than $2,098.18, nor that he was not authorized in some way to take and use the said sum as he was the cashier, and in the legal control of the funds and assets of the bank.\n\u201c This the sole averment of the plaintiff\u2019s statement, she is informed, does not of itself form the foundation of an action.\n\u201c 2. This averment of the plaintiff is not helped by the production of so-called memoranda, copies of which are annexed to the statement. The memoranda are merely blank pieces of paper (unused checks), with no words of writing and which indicate nothing. They bear no date; they do not say he nor any one promises to pay the same, nor any of them; they do not say he was to pay them to the bank, nor to any one else; nor is there on them the slightest evidence of an}' undertaking or promise on the part of him or any one, either for his own benefit, or against him, as to any matter.\n\u201c They are not such evidence of debt by him to the bank, as she is informed, upon which an action can rest, and certainly not such prima facie evidence of debt, upon which plaintiff would be entitled to a judgment under the rules, without the addition of more.\u201d\nThe court made absolute a rule, for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nErrors assigned were (1) discharging rule to set aside service; (2) making absolute a rule for judgment.\nAug. S. Landis, Thomas II. Greevy with him, for appellant.\nThe service was insufficient. There was no possibility of finding the defendant. He had fled, and the dwelling house, the home, the residence and the family were all deserted, and there was no longer any connection between him and them.\nIn this suit there is no bond, bill, or note, nor any instrument of writing promising to pay, nor any contract for money loaned or advanced, nor any book account, and hence no affidavit of defense was required: Hamill v. O\u2019Donnell, 2 Miles, 101; Harbison v. Hawkins, 81* Pa. 142; Wall v. Dovey, 60 Pa. 212.\nDaniel J.'Neff, William S. Hammond with him, for appellee.\nThe summons was served in accordance with the act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 587: Jennison v. Hapgood, 10 Pick. 77.\nThe fundamental idea of domicile is home, and as a man does not lose his home in fact by mere absence, so he cannot lose his home in law from the sa\u00edne cause: Jacobs\u2019 Law of Domicil, sec. 151; Cobb v. Rice, 130 Mass. 231.\nAn absconding debtor\u2019s last place of residence in this state and where his family remains continues his residence or dwelling house in law, although his whereabouts are unknown : Scott v. Hilgert, 14 W. N. C. 305; Pfoutz v. Comford, 36 Pa. 420.\nRemoval out of the state, without an intention permanently to reside elsewhere, will not lose residence : Fry\u2019s Election Case, 71 Pa. 302; Reed\u2019s App., 71 Pa. 378; Ayer & Co. v. Weeks, 6 Lawyer\u2019s Rep. Annotated, 716.\nThe case of Hamill v. O\u2019Donnell, 2 Miles, 101, was for a \u201c book debt,\u201d and the statement was under the old act of March 28,1835, P. L. 89, applicable to the city of Philadelphia, providing for the recovery of \u201c book debts \u201d therein specified. The case was decided on the ground that the book entries were not entries in the original book of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim in Harbison v. Hawkins, 81* Pa. 142, was under the same act of 1835, and it was held that the entries were not the proper subject of book account: Wall v. Dovey, 60 Pa. 212, was decided upon the ground that \u201c the book entries contain no charge against the defendant,\u201d and they were not original entries.\nAs to the requisites of a statement under the act of 1887, we refer to the case of Blanchard v. Hunter, 7 Pa. C. C. R. 552, wherein it is held that an affidavit of defense must be filed, under the act of May 25,1887, in all actions of assumpsit where a sufficient statement has been filed, although the demand was not founded upon a note, book account, or contract in writing.\nWhen the plaintiff\u2019s statement of demand under the act of May 25,1887, is sufficiently specific in other respects, the plaintiff will not be required to add thereto dates which are wholly within the knowledge of the defendant, and of which the plaintiff cannot be cognizant: Lincoln v. Martin, 5 Pa. C. C. R. 333.\nOctober 7, 1895 :"
