        "text": "Per Curiam,\nIf the deed of March 4, 1882, from John S. Gish to his son Henry B. Gish, the plaintiff, for the land in controversy, had been admitted without competent evidence of its execution and delivery, there would be some merit in the first specification of error, but such was not the fact. The execution of the deed was not seriously questioned, and the testimony as to its delivery, as claimed by the plaintiff, was quite sufficient to justify the submission of that question to the jury. There was, therefore no error in admitting the deed in connection with the testimony as to those facts. Nor was there any error in admitting the testimony complained of in the second to fourth specifications inclusive. It requires no argument to show that it was both competent and relevant to the issue. It tended to show title in the plaintiff.\nWithout reciting or summarizing the testimony referred to, it is sufficient to say that it was fairly submitted to the jury, with full, correct and adequate instructions as to its effect, etc., and the verdict has, by necessary implication, established the facts that the deed in question was duly executed and properly delivered.\nThere is no error in the learned judge\u2019s answer to defendant\u2019s third point for charge, referred to in the fifth and sixth specifications; nor, in that part of his charge recited in the seventh specification. The eighth specification is not according to rule and is therefore dismissed.\nWe find nothing in either of the assignments of error that requires extended comment.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "H. B. Gish v. Jacob Brown, Appellant.\nEjectment\u2014Deed\u2014Delivery\u2014Evidence.\nA deed to the plaintiff by his father is properly admissible in evidence in an action of ejectment, where it has been proved that it was properly executed and delivered by the father in his lifetime to a friend, with words indicating an intent to convey the land to his son, and that after the father\u2019s death the person having the custody of the deed gave it to his attorney,1 who delivered it to plaintiff.\nWhere the grantor delivers a deed to a third person with absolute direction to hold until the grantor\u2019s death, and then to deliver the deed to the grantee, who is grantor\u2019s son, a delivery to the son by the custodian of the deed after the grantor\u2019s death will pass title to the son.\nPractice, S. 0.\u2014Assignments of error\u2014Evidence.\nAn assignment of error to the exclusion of testimony will not be considered where the assignment fails to set forth the offer, the objections thereto, and the ruling of the court thereon.\nArgued June 4, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 404, Jan. T., 1895, by defendant, from judgmentof C. P. Lancaster Co., May T., 1892, No. 20, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEjectment for two hundred and seven acres of land in West Donegal township. Before Livingston, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the land in dispute was formerly owned by John S. Gish, father of Henry B. Gish, the plaintiff. John S. Gish died on March 15, 1889, intestate, leaving six children to survive him.\nFrom the uncontradicted testimony it appeared that on March 4, 1882, John S. Gish, Henry B. Gish, Christian Butt and Christian H. Coble met at the house of Henry B. Gish. Coble was a scrivener and drew a deed for the land in controversy from John S. Gish to Henry B. Gish, an agreement and reservation between John S. and Henry B., and a bond by Henry B. to John S. for $15,000. John S. Gish executed the deed and Henry signed the agreement and bond. Coble had indorsed an envelope in which to place these papers, \u201c Property of John S. Gish.\u201d This was done without instructions from any one. John S. Gish put the papers imthe envelope, sealed it and handed it to Rutt, saying, according to testimony of Rutt, \u201c I will make a deed for the place to Henry; \u201d \u201cI will give this to you (Rutt) to hold.\u201d He said that the farm should be Henry\u2019s, and after he handed the papers to Rutt he said, \u201c Now, the farm is gone.\u201d He instructed Rutt to hold the papers until after his death and then to give them to his son Henry.\nAfter the death of John S. Gish, Christian Rutt produced to the Gish heirs and opened in their presence this sealed package left with him by their father. The seal was broken and it was found to contain the three papers above referred to. The bond had on it an indorsement of cancellation. Mr. Rutt was at that time a client of Hon. H. G. Brubaker, then a practicing attorney, now associate law judge of the courts of Lancaster county Rutt brought the envelope with the papers to Mr. Brubaker, who afterwards became counsel for Henry B. Gish, although he was not counsel for him at that time. Mr. Brubaker sent for Gish and gave him the deed, which Gish returned to Mr. Brubaker to keep for him. In the meantime the heirs of John S. Gish, under whom the defendant here claims, took possession of the farm in dispute, and they and their tenants have had it ever since.\nThe court, under objection and exception, admitted in evidence the deed from John S. Gish to Henry B. Gish. [1]\nThe court admitted, under objection and exception, the testimony of Christian Rutt, deceased, taken on a bill in equity by Henry B. Gish against the administrator of his father\u2019s estate for the specific performance of the contract for the sale of the land in controversy. [2]\nHis testimony related to what took place at the meeting of March 4, 1882, when the papers above referred to were left in his possession.\nHe further testified as follows:\nQ. If anything was said by John S. Gish about having had a settlement with his son, Henry B. Gish, at the time, please state what it was.\nObjected to by defendant. Admitted, and defendant excepts. Bill sealed.\nA. He said he had a settlement with Henry and that he lived with Henry a number of years\u2014as near as I can recollect, ten years\u2014and that Henry had been good to him, and also spoke about some debts that Henry was to pay. [3]\nHon. H. C. Brubaker was asked the question:\nQ. Judge, you have already been on the stand, called by the other side, and have testified you received this deed from Christian S. Rutt; did you receive from him any instructions what to do with it?\nObjected to by defendant, on the ground that no matter what Rutt may have communicated to Judge Brubaker, the instructions would amount to nothing, unless there was proof in the first instance that Christian S. Rutt had authoritj1- to. give instructions or directions from John S. Gish as to what should be done with it. Admitted, and defendant excepts. Bill sealed.\nQ. Please state what you were instructed by Mr. Rutt to do with it. A. I was instructed by Mr. Rutt to deliver the deed to Henry B. Gish. I didn\u2019t know Henry B. Gish; he was an entire stranger to me.\nThe Court: Did you do so ? A. I did so. [4J\nDefendant\u2019s point was, among others, as follows :\n3. If the jury believe, from all the evidence in this case, that the delivery of the deed was conditioned upon the payment, by Henry B. Gish of the fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) judgment and the charges mentioned in the agreement or reservation, and the said judgment was never paid or canceled, then if the jury also find that there was a delivery of the deed, there can only be a verdict for plaintiff conditioned upon his paying:\n(a) Fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), with interest at five per cent from April 1, 1882, to this date, to the administrator of John S. Gish, deceased.\n(5) One thousand dollars ($1,000) to the said administrator for funeral expenses, tombstone, and the further payment of two thousand dollars ($2,000) to Catherine Boyer on or before March 15, 1897, and twenty-one hundred dollars ($2,100) unto the seven children of Anna Breneman, deceased, and of three hundred dollars ($300) unto Catherine Wagner, and of three hundred ($300) to Adaline Wagner on or before March 15, 1897. Answer : The part marked \u2018 a \u2019 we refuse for the reason that the bond given for the payment of the $15,000, named in the paragraph, dated as of even date, and although with the deed and agreement, March 4, 1882, delivered to Christian Rutt: and delivered to Christian Rutt with the other papers and left in his possession until after the death of John S. Gish, has this written upon the back of it: \u201c This obligation is hereby cancelled, and made null and void, for valuable consideration, to me in hand, paid by the said within named Henry B. Gish, this first day of April, 1882. (Signed) John S. Gish.\u201d And the testimony shows that the signature was the authentic sig nature of John S. Gish. So that portion of it we will have to refuse. [5, 6]\nThe court charged in part as follows:\n[So, that if the jury believe there was a delivery of the deed by John S. Gish to Christian Rutt with absolute direction to hold until his death and then to be delivered to his son, Henry B. 'Gish; in such a case a delivery actually made, as we have said, 'by Christian Rutt to Henry B. Gish would relate back to its \u2022date of execution and make it equivalent to a delivery by John S. Gish at that time for ordinary purposes.] [7]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1\u20144) rulings on evidence; (5-7) above instructions, quoting; (8) \u201cin excluding Jacob G. Oweiler, as a witness offered by the defendant, to testify to matters occurring during the lifetime of John S. Gish.\u201d\nJ. Hay Brown and W. TJ. Hensel, for appellant.\nThe case for the plaintiff and appellee gains little from the fact that after Gish handed the papers to their depository, he said, \u201c now the farm is gone,\u201d \u201cthe place is gone:\u201d Bash v. Bash, 9 Pa. 260.\nDelivery is essential to the validity of a deed. The question of delivery is for the jury : Critchfield v. Critchfield, 24 Pa. 100.\nThe presumption of the delivery of a deed, arising from the fact of its being recorded, is one that may be rebutted and destroyed by counter-evidence : Boardman v. Dean, 34 Pa. 252 ; Thompson v. Lloyd, 49 Pa. 127; Duraind\u2019s App., 116 Pa. 93.\nH. M. North and O. I. Landis, for appellees.\nThe admission of the deed was objected to \u201c on the ground that there is no proof of delivery.\u201d There was no objection to the execution of the deed. In Keichline v. Keichline, 54 Pa. 75, it was held that a deed duly proved or acknowledged is entitled to be received, although never recorded: Hamilton v. Galloway, 1 Dallas, 63; Kelly v. Dunlap, 3 P. & W. 136.\nThere was ample evidence of the delivery of the deed, both in fact and in law: Stephens v. Huss, 54 Pa. 20 ; Stephens v. Rinehart, 72 Pa. 434; Belden v. Carter, 4 Day, 66 ; Levergood v. Bailey, 1 Woodward, 275.\nCritchfield v. Critchfield, 24 Pa. 100, differs from this case, as there the deed never passed out of the possession of the grantor.\nIn Thompson v. Lloyd, 49 Pa. 127, there was no instruction as to the delivery.\nIn Appeal of Louise Duraind, 116 Pa. 93, the deed remained in the possession of the grantor until her death.\nIn Baum\u2019s Appeal, 113 Pa. 58, it was held that an escrow takes effect from the second delivery, the title not being perfected in the grantee until the happening of the condition; but the grantor, when the deed has been placed in the hands of a third party as an escrow, cannot, after the happening of the act on which delivery is conditional, prevent delivery taking effect by getting possession of the deed.\nOctober 7, 1895 :"
