        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Mitchell,\nFrom the facts which are found by the learned judge below to be not really disputed, it appears that a voluntary settlement, was made by Dr. Horner upon plaintiff in 1856. It is not necessary to discuss the question so fully argued by appellant, as to the sufficiency or the validity of the declaration of trust, for conceding those points, it still appears that the trust was subject to change, which might be either as to the subject-matter,. the Eleventh street house, or as to the terms of the trust itself. The trust, it will be observed was notin favor of the appellant alone, but of the appellant and her mother jointly, and it was expressly declared that the house should be held on the trust \u201c as long as desirable.\u201d The mother was to continue to reside there \u201c as long as she may deem proper.\u201d It therefore appears beyond question, by these and the other terms of the paper, that the trust was intended to be open to change and resettlement as circumstances might require. In the course of years there were changes of circumstances and the parties acted upon them. In May, 1864, Dr. Horner bought the more valuable house on Twenty-first street, and in June of the same year he rented it to Catharine Brown the mother, who for payment of the rent pledged the rent of the Eleventh street house, calling it \u201c my house.\u201d In February, 1866, the mother again calling the Eleventh street house \u201c my house \u201d signed a paper agreeing to exchange it for the Twenty-first street house ; and by a paper dated April 4, 1865, but which clearly was made April 4,1866, Dr. Horner declared a trust as to the latter house, which though not identical in terms with the trust of 1856 as to the other house, was practically equivalent to it, being in favor of appellant and her mother. In all of these transactions the mother, who was a cestui que trust in her own right and the natural guardian of her daughter, appears to have acted for the interests of both as if the property were, as she called it, her own. Of course the want of formality in the conveyancing, and the absence of any legal steps to pass the daughter\u2019s estate, prevented any of these dealings with the property from becoming a bar to appellant\u2019s claims, but the transactions are competent evidence to show the intention of Dr. Horner and the mother. They leave no doubt whatever that such intention was to substitute the new house for the old one, to be held on what the parties regarded as the same trusts within the latitude of resettlement contemplated in \u2022 the instrument of 1856, and to leave the first or Eleventh street house in the possession of Dr. Horner with the legal title which had continued in him, freed from the previous trust.\nThis arrangement as already said would have been ineffectual against the appellant\u2019s present claim. But in 1879 Dr. Horner conveyed the Twenty-first street house in fee to appellant, who receipted for. it \u201c in full, thereby releasing them (the grantor and his wife) from all taxes, water rents, and other claims.\u201d The words \u201c other claims \u201d would ordinarily be read in connection with taxes and water rents to mean claims ejusdem generis, but a receipt \u201cin full\u201d from the donee to the donor of a free gift is in itself a somewhat extraordinary document, and has some significance in this case. The Eleventh street house had been in possession of Dr. Horner, and be had received the rents as his own, since the exchange in 1866. He continued to do so until his death in 1892, a period of twenty-six years, seventeen of which were after appellant had come of full age. In all this time no claim was made upon him for any part of the rents, for an account, or for the enforcement in any way of the trust now set up. The only rational explanation is that appellant acquiesced in the exchange of houses made by her mother for her, and accepted the conveyance in fee of the more valuable house in 1879, with full knowledge of the circumstances, and as a complete and final settlement of the whole trust. Parties who come into equity with such stale claims postponed not only for such a lapse of years, but until the death of the party sought to be charged, must understand that they will, be held to the strictest proof of every step in the establishment of the asserted right. Appellant has utterly failed to meet this requirement. Her claim is without merit in law or in morals and the bill was properly dismissed.\nDecree affirmed at the costs of the appellant.",

The plaintiff, on January 22, 1879, accepted said deed, and gave the following receipt:\n\u201c Philadelphia, Pa., January 22, 1879.\n\u201c Received of Dr. G. R. B. Horner and Mary A. T. H., his wife, their deed to me for the house and lots 314 North Twenty-first street in full, thereby releasing them from all taxes, water rents, and other claims.\n(Signed) \u201c Catharine B. Gboome.\n\u201c Witness: Thomas J. Gboome,\n\u201c Mary O\u2019Brien.\u201d\n13. That the Twenty-first street property has been occupied since June 30, 1864, by the plaintiff and her mother, pursuant to a lease of that date offered in evidence.\n14. That the value of the Eleventh street property was $3,800, and that the value of the Twenty-first street property was $5,000.\n15. That since 1866 Dr. Horner has had possession and enjoyment of the Eleventh street property to the time of his death, and there appears to have been no demand on him to account for the income of the property, until the filing of this bill after his death.\nFrom the facts as stated, I am of the opinion that whatever may have been the effect of the papers dated July 18,1856, the deed of the Twenty-first street property, with its accompanying occupancy, receipt, lapse of years, failure to claim rent of Eleventh street house, and so on, all indicate that Dr. Horner intended, and the plaintiff accepted, the Twenty-first street property as a substitution for any interest she may have had in the Eleventh street property.\nThis conclusion requires the decree dismissing the bill.\nBill dismissed.\nError assigned was above decree.\nHenry Budd, for appellant.\nNatural love and affection are a valid consideration for a deed to sustain the assumption of a trust relation.\nThe obligation to provide for an illegitimate child is fully recognized by the law and the tendency of the decisions is to put illegitimate children on the same plane as legitimate, so far as the question we are now considering is concerned : Beachcroft, v. Beachcroft, Madd. 437; Holt v. Sindrey, L. R. 7 Eq. 171; Bunn v. Winthrop, 1 Johns. Ch. 329; Beckford v. Beckford, Lofft. 490; Soar v. Foster, 4 K. & J. 152; Tucker v. Barrow, 2 Hen. & Mil. 515; Kilpin v. Kilpin, 1 M. & K. 520; Wilson v. Atkinson, 4 De G. J. & S. 455; Brown\u2019s Trust, L. R. 16 Eq. 239; Dorin v. Dorin, L. R. 17 Eq. 463; Occleston v. Fullalove, L. R. 9 Chan. 147.\nEquity will not interfere to assist a volunteer who claims under an incomplete trust, yet where there is a trust completed either by the appointment of a third person as trustee or by the owner declaring himself a trustee the court will act upon the trust: Ex parte Pye, 18 Ves. 140.\nThe intention to make the owner a trustee is conclusive of the question of completeness: Searle v. Law, 15 Sim. 95; Richardson v. Richardson, L. R. 3 Eq. 693; Viney v. Abbott, 109 Mass. 300.\nThe form in which the trust is declared is not essential. A deed is not necessary: Crossman\u2019s App., 42 Pa. 147 ; Stapleton v. Stapleton, 14 Sim. 186; Wheatley v. Purr, 1 Keene, 551; Morgan v. Malleson, L. R. 10 Eq. 475.\nThe fact that a person constituting himself a trustee reserves to himself at the same time the control of the subject of the trust qua trustee, does not destroy the fiduciary nature of his holding: Bolton v. Bolton, 3 Swan, 414.\nThe testator had just, by the writing quoted in paragraph four, given to his daughter, the plaintiff, certain premises and declared himself a trustee thereof. He had previously by will left to the same person a bequest to the amount of some $8,000. If the plaintiff had been his legitimate child, the subsequent gift would have been an ademption pro tanto of the legacy, but as in the eye of the law an illegitimate child (in the absence of proof of recognition and of the fact that the testator stood in loco parentis) is a stranger, the rule that a gift to a stranger does not amount to an ademption would have applied, and the plaintiff in the absence of any explanation would have taken both the $8,000 and the premises in question, in other words a double portion. See the rule as laid down by Lord Eldon in Ex parte Pye, 18 Ves. 140; and see Wetherby v. Dixon, 19 Ves. 412; Smith v. Cunningham, 9 Phila. 96; Story\u2019s Eq. see. 1110; Miner v. Atherton\u2019s Exr., 35 Pa. 528.\nThe trust having been created and an equitable estate vested in the appellant, she has not done anything by which she has given up or waived her rights or estopped herself from asserting them.\nDr. Horner could not revoke the trust which he had declared by his writing of the year 1856. The authorities are clear that he could not: Fortescue v. Barnett, 3 M. & K. 36; Drosier v. Brereton, 15 Beav. 221; Dennison v. Goehring, 7 Pa. 175.\nIf the receipt is relied upon, the court\u2019s attention is invited to its phraseology. It includes the receipt of the deed and releases Dr. Horner from \u201c taxes, water rents, and other claims.\u201d It will hardly be pretended that without the words \u201c other claims \u201d this receipt could in any way affect the case. How then must \u201c other claims \u201d be interpreted? The rule of law is well settled that where we have specific terms or expressions followed by a more general term or expression, the latter will be limited by the former and can only include things which are ejusdem generis with the former: Moore v. Magrath, 1 Cowp. 9 ; Clifford v. Arundell, 1 De G. F. & J. 305; Nesbitt v. Lushington, 4 T. R. 783; Harrison v. Blackburn, 17 C. B. N. S.. 678; Johnson v. Ry. Co., 35 Beav. 480; Bucher v. Com., 103 Pa. 528.\nWilliam O. Hannis, for appellees.\nIt is essential to specific performance that the consideration should be valuable; a merely good consideration, such as natural love and affection, or the performance of a moral duty, will not be sufficient. Moreover it is necessary that the consideration shall be actual. A constructive consideration, such as that imported by the seal to a bond, will not do: Bispham\u2019s Principles of Equity, 346, 376.\nThe ordinary power of a chancellor extends no further than the execution of a trust sufficiently formed to put the legal title out of the grantor; or to the execution of an agreement for a trust founded on a valuable consideration: Read v. Robinson, 6 W. & S. 329.\nSpecific performance will not be decreed in favor of a party who voluntarily gives up possession of property which he has claimed to hold under an equitable right: Merrill v. Merrill, 5 Kulp, 125.\nEquity will not enforce the specific performance of an agreement, in the nature of a testamentary act, even though there be a valuable consideration for the agreement: Rowan\u2019s App., 25 Pa. 292; McCue v. Johnston, 25 Pa. 306; Stein v. North, 3 Yeates, 324.\nLaches for six years, or under certain circumstances for a less period, will bar an effort to establish a constructive trust: Ashhurst\u2019s App., 60 Pa. 290; Evans\u2019s App., 81 Pa. 278 ; Wallace v. Duffield, 2 S. & R. 521; Pipher v. Lodge, 4 S. & R. 309; Harrison v. Brolaskey, 20 Pa. 299; Walker v. Walker, 16 S. & R. 378; Rush v. Barr, 1 Watts, 110; Clarke\u2019s Est., 1 Phila. 356.\nThe case of Fortescue v. Barnett, 3 M. & K. 36, is not in point because there was no allegation or proof there; as here, of the acceptance as in full of substitutionary provision, and of laches for more than fifteen years.\nHenry Budd, for appellant, in reply.\nMrs. Groome was a married woman. It is claimed that she released or conveyed an interest in realty. This she could only do by a writing executed and acknowledged after a separate examination, and in which her husband joined: Graham v. Long, 65 Pa. 383; Glidden v. Strupler, 52 Pa. 400; Durham v. Wright, 13 Pa. 167; Kirk v. Clark, 59 Pa. 479; Klein v. Caldwell, 91 Pa. 140 ; D. L. &. W. R. R. v. Benson, 61 Pa. 369; Buchanan v. Hazzard, 95 Pa. 240; Innis v. Templeton, 95 Pa. 262; Davidson\u2019s. App., 95 Pa. 394; Miller v. Ruble, 107 Pa. 395; Stivers v. Tucker, 126 Pa. 74.\nOctober 7, 1895 :"
