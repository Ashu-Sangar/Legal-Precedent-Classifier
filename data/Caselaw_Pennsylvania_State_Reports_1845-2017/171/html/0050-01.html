Defendant filed an affidavit of defense as follows : “ It is wholly false and untrue that the promissory note set out in plaintiff’s statement was given for deponent’s accommodation or at her request. It is also wholly false and untrue that deponent undertook and promised plaintiff to provide money for the payment of said note when the same should become due and payable, or that she agreed to indemnify and save harmless the plaintiff from any loss or damage for or by reason of his giving said note or that she assumed any liability to plaintiff whatever by reason of his giving said note.” <em>Held </em>that the affidavit was sufficient to prevent judgment.</p>
