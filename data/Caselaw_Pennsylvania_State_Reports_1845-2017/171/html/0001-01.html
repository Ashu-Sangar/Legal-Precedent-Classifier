The evidence tended to show that a flag <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>was kept in the station house, and it was the custom of persons wishing to stop a train to flag it. On October 10, 1892, the deceased flagged a train, and returned with the flag to the station side of the track, walked a few steps up the side of the track to take the train, when he slipped or stumbled and fell towards the track as the train approached, and was struck in the breast by the engine and instantly killed.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b22-6" data-blocks='[["BL_22.5",22,[276,809,1171,1229]]]'>You have heard the facts in this case—the purpose of his going upon the railroad track was to flag a train in order to stop it. He had a lawful right to go upon the railroad track for the purpose of flagging the train. He was not there as a trespasser, yet if, when he got upon the railroad track, he found that there was danger, then it was his duty to immediately leave the track. If, after he got upon the railroad track, the train was in sight, and he saw the speed with which it was coming, he had no right to stand there until it was too late for him to retreat. The rule that would apply in such a case is that he had no right to be there any longer than a prudent man, in the exercise of reasonable care and caution, would have deemed necessary. If he stayed there longer than reasonable prudence would permit a man to stay in a case of that kind, after the danger became apparent to him, then, as a matter of course, his widow could not recover on this policy. Whether such is the fact or not it is for you to determine under all the evidence in this case, and in doing so you must take into consideration all the surrounding circumstances—the speed with which the train was running, the facilities for seeing the train and the distance at which it could be seen. The care that he exercised and the efforts that he made to get off, together with all the attendant circumstances, are proper matters for you to consider when you come to consider the question, whether this man was doing an act that a man of ordinary prudence would have done under like circumstances.</p>

It is alleged on the part of the defendant that it did not make any difference whether he was struck by the locomotive and killed while he <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>was actually between the tracks or even on the ties, so long as he was upon what is technically known as the roadbed; that he had no right whatever to be there, and was not within the protection of this policy while he was there in that position. Now, true it is, that in actions where the question would arise between railroad companies, or between them and their employees, or in reference to the construction of railroads, that technically the roadbed might cover the entire right of way, or at least that part of the right of way which was leveled off and constructed for the purpose of putting a railroad track on, and it might be ten feet in width, or it might be forty or fifty feet in width. With this contract in question the railroad companies have no concern whatever, nor does it affect any transaction with any railroad company, nor can the questions that might arise between the widow of the deceased and the railroad company have anything to do with this case, and we think that this contract must be construed just in the same manner as this company at the time they gave this policy had a right to expect that the assured would construe it. What had the company the right to expect, when they issued this certificate of insurance, that Francis DeLoy would understand by the wording of this exception in their policy ? Would not they have a right to expect that he would construe it as it would be construed by the public generally; and people generally would understand by it that the roadbed was simply the road as constructed—or rather the ties upon which the rails lay, which might not be, as in this case, more than about eight feet in width; and we think it is a fair construction of this contract to say to you that that constituted what was undoubtedly meant by this policy. There could be no object in an insurance company preventing a man from going upon the right of way of a railroad company, because if he was away from the track and the ties far enough not to be reached by the engine and the cars, he could be in no danger more than any' place else.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b24-5" data-blocks='[["BL_24.4",24,[252,636,1173,1000]]]'>[And again it is evidently intended by this provision that it should not prevent the person from being lawfully upon a railroad track unless it was in a time of danger, when he voluntarily exposed himself to danger by doing it. It was certainly intended to mean that. Otherwise a person could not in safety cross a railroad track; if there were several sidings at a depot, for instance, and he had to cross one or the other to get into the train, and if an accident happened while he was getting in, they might say he could not recover, because he was on a railroad track at the time the injury happened. That construction would not be a fair one. I think it fair to assume that it was intended to cover all cases where a person is on a railroad bed when he had no business to be there, when it is not necessary for him to be there. But when his business or other necessities call him to the railroad track or crossing, for lawful purposes, and he is injured while in the pursuit of his lawful calling ; or when it becomes necessary to use the roadbed for a lawful purpose, and he should be accidentally killed without any knowledge upon his part of the danger, he ought not, in such case, to be excluded from recovering if there was nothing else in the case.] [9]</p>

    <p class="author" id="A_7" data-blocks='[["BL_28.5",28,[523,356,580,36]]]'>Mb. Chief Justice Stebbett,</p>
    <p id="Ave" data-blocks='[["BL_28.6",28,[243,404,1173,174]]]'>This action was brought on a life insurance policy issued by the defendant company to Francis DeLoy, husband of the plaintiff,—beneficiary therein named,—to recover indemnity for the accidental death of said assured.</p>
    <p id="b28-4" data-blocks='[["BL_28.7",28,[242,596,1173,272]]]'>The policy contains eight provisions relieving the company from liability, the fifth of which recites thirty-one different kinds of accident for which it is declared the company shall not be liable. Among these exemptions are the two following which practically constitute the only grounds of defense on which the defendant relies:</p>
    <p id="b28-5" data-blocks='[["BL_28.8",28,[243,885,1170,88]]]'>(1) “ Voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger; ” and (2), “ Walking or being on a railway bridge or roadbed.”</p>
    <p id="b28-6" data-blocks='[["BL_28.9",28,[242,982,1171,133]]]'>While the specifications of error are eleven in number, they each relate to one or both of these exemptions or grounds of defense, and hence it is unnecessary to notice them seriatim.</p>
    <p id="b28-7" data-blocks='[["BL_28.10",28,[236,1124,1178,1151]],["BL_29.1",29,[213,371,1173,340]]]'>As to the first ground of defense, the learned president of the court below instructed the jury, inter alia, that voluntary exposure to unnecessary danger “ means an intentional exposure to unnecessary danger; ” and, unless the assured “ did it intentionally you cannot find that he exposed himself to danger within the terms of this exception. ... It is very difficult, and in fact it is rarely the case that you can prove by positive evidence what a man’s intentions were, and hence you must determine his intentions generally from his acts and conduct; aud, it may be said that if a man acts so recklessly and carelessly that he shows an utter disregard of a known danger, then he may be said to have exposed himself voluntarily to danger. Or, if the risk of danger is so obvious that a prudent man, exercising reasonable foresight, would not have done the act, then he may be said to have voluntarfiy exposed his person to danger. It must also be exposure to unnecessary danger.” This excerpt from the charge is the subject of specific complaint in the first assignment of error, and is involved in some of the others. It fairly represents the learned judge’s construction of the clause first above quoted and is substantially correct, because it is in harmony with the ruling of this court, on the same clause, in Burkhard v. Travelers Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/102/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="102 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="502711" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0262-01">102 Pa. 262</a>. In that case, Mr.Chief Justice Mercub, referring to the assured, said: “It is true, he voluntarily left the car; but <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>a clear distinction exists between a voluntary act and a voluntary exposure to danger. Hidden danger may exist, yet the exposure thereto, without any knowledge of the danger, does not constitute a voluntary exposure to it. . . . The result of the act does not necessarily determine the motive which prompted the action. The act may be voluntary, yet the exposure involuntary. The danger being unknown, the injury is incidental.”</p>
    <p id="b29-5" data-blocks='[["BL_29.4",29,[216,718,1174,503]]]'>The construction put upon the exempting clause in question by the court below is also in substantial accord with that given to similar phrases in other well considered cases, among which are: Mfrs.

But, aside from rulings in similar cases, our own construction of the same clause in Burkhard’s case, supra, ought to be conclusive.</p>
    <p id="b29-6" data-blocks='[["BL_29.5",29,[221,1241,1173,424]]]'>As to the instructions relating to the second ground of defense, including the learned judge’s answers to defendant’s points for charge, we think they are also substantially correct and adequate. There is nothing in either of them that requires elaboration. The testimony tends to show that the deatn of the assured was the result of an accident that was fairly within the terms of the policy as properly construed by the court. The case was fairly submitted to the jury and in the light of all the testimony their verdict was fully warranted.</p>
    <p id="b29-7" data-blocks='[["BL_29.6",29,[270,1672,358,40]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
