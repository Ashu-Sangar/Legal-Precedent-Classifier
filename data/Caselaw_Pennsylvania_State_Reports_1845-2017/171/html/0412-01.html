Alexander, 5 S. &amp; R., 387, there was a return of an inquisition in the orphans’ court of Franklin county, by which the estate of an intestate was divided. The heirs refused to take, and the real estate of the decedent was sold in twelve parcels. The clerk charged four dollars on each, under provisions of the then existing act of assembly allowing such fee for “ all proceedings for the sale of real estate, recording and copy.” Gibson, J., held that a separate fee could be charged on each sale actually made. “ Each sale is a distinct proceeding,” says the justice, “ and has its appropriate duties, which the officer is bound to perform, and in proportion to the number of sales are those duties multiplied. I think it, therefore, a fair and reasonable construction, to allow him a fee for each sale, it being his only compensation for recording and copy. . . . Were the construction otherwise, the officer would, in almost every case, be inadequately rewarded. ... I am of opinion that the appellant be allowed four dollars on each sale.”</p>

In this view of the question in hand, and following Justice Gibson, in the case just cited, the auditor allows the clerk of orphans’ court three dollars on sixty-three sales, respectively, making a total of $189.</p>

Alexander, 5 S. &amp; R. 337, entitled to the binding authority which has been given it? We think not. That opinion was delivered in 1819, when perhaps the possibility of a decedent leaving hundreds of purparts of real estate was remote. In the particular case in which the decision was rendered an inquisition was held by which the estate was divided into twelve parts. There were twenty heirs, upon whose refusal to take at the valuation of the jury there was a sale, and the purchasers were to give security for payment by entering into a recognizance. The clerk of the court thought himself obliged, according to usual practice, to take a recognizance for each installment to each of the twenty heirs, and charge fees for four hundred'and eighty recognizances. The court held that the fees for taking recognizances must be included under the general term of and fee for “ all proceedings; ” Tilghman, C. J., in the opinion distinctly says: “ If this case be considered as part of the proceedings of the inquisition of Gen. Alexander’s estate, the clerk fees would be only $3.00 on each share into which the estate was divided, viz. twelve shares, which would make the whole amount of fees $36.00.” The clerk in that case had not stood, however, on this part of the fee bill, but relied on a subsequent part of the section in which a twenty-five cents fee was prescribed for <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>“taking a recognizance.” It seems, however, from the language of the judge that had a charge been made of $3.00 for the proceedings on each share into which the estate was divided, it would have been sustained.</p>

He found that, under the original and subsequent orders of sale, eighty-three distinct parcels of land were sold and sales confirmed to the respective purchasers, and that “ there were fiftjrfive different purchasers at public sales and eight different purchasers at private sales,” making in all sixty-three purchasers, some of whom bought two or more of the eighty-three parcels of land. Adopting the opinion of Mr. Justice Gibson in Ramsey v. Alexander, 5 S. &amp; R. 337, and treating each of said purchases as a separate sale, he awarded to the appellant, clerk of the court, a fee of $3.00 on each of said sales, making the sum of $189. This was excepted to, and the learned judge of the orphans’ court, considering himself bound by the opinion of Chief Justice Tilghman in Ramsey v. Alexander, supra, sustained the exception and awarded appellant a single fee of $3.00 “for the whole proceeding,” treating the several distinct sales to different purchasers as merely one sale of decedent’s real estate. In doing so he said : “ If we were permitted, as the learned auditor has done, to consult our own feelings in the matter, irrespective of the rule of stare decisis, we should sustain his report and dismiss the exceptions, as in our opinion the compensation allowed by law is entirely inadequate for the services of the officer in this case. But the court .... is bound by the rulings of the Supreme Court, and until the case of Ramsey v. Alexander, supra, is overruled, it is our plain duty to obey the law as it is interpreted for us by our highest court.”</p>

In other words, as to the question of construction now before us, the decree of the court below stood as affirmed by a divided court. That is not a decree or judgment of this court, in support of which the rulé of stare decisis can be successfully invoked. That principle applies only to <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>actual judgments or decrees of this court, and not to judgments or decrees of inferior tribunals which are necessarily allowed to stand as final because of an equally divided appellate court.
