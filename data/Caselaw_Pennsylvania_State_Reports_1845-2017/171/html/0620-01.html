On the morning of March 8,1892, plaintiff went there to look after his wife’s, business and remained in and about her store until evening. He left the store on 11th avenue, about 10:40 o’clock in the evening to go to the depot of the defendant to take a train for New York. On the way from the store to the train he stopped with a friend at a hotel and drank some whisky and then hurried along to the depot.

He further testified that his left foot was crushed and he had to have it amputated ; also that the train stopped and he was picked up and that there was no platform where he jumped off ; that he remained on the train from a minute to a minute and a half before getting off ; that there was no light and nothing to indicate how fast the train was going; that the road was smooth and he could not tell from the motion of the train whether it was going slow or fast; that he had his satchel in his hand when he got off, and it was so dark he could not see anything ; that he jumped off with his satchel in his hand, facing the way the train was going; that the satchel was in his left hand and the railing in his right and he jumped with the motion of the train, and he then says : “ The train was going so rapid that I found my feet had left me and I went down on my hands and knees, and the next thing that I knew I was under the cars. The train went so swift that it pulled the feet from under me.”</p>

    <p id="b642-6" data-blocks='[["BL_642.7",642,[237,542,1183,1770]]]'>The plaintiff got upon the platform of one of the Pullman cars as the train was moving from the station at Altoona towards Pittsburg, and having requested a trainman to give him a berth for New York he was told that he was on the wrong train, that it would not stop to let him off, but that it was going slow and he could jump from it. He was on the car about a minute and a half after the train started from the station and the rate of speed it had attained when he stepped or jumped from it is best described in his own language. He said, “ the train went so swift that it pulled the feet from under me.” It is a reasonable conclusion from his testimony in regard to the speed of the train and the time he was on it that it was moving at the rate of from ten to fifteen miles an hour when he jumped from it. It is well settled that to jump from a moving train is an act of negligence which will defeat a suit for an injury caused by it unless it plainly appears that the circumstances connected with and surrounding it justified or excused it. In this case the plaintiff was safe upon the train and if his getting upon it instead of the New York train was due to the negligence of the company he might have had an action against the latter for the expenses he incurred and the inconvenience to which he was subjected in consequence of its fault. But his presence on the train through the negligence of the company furnished no warrant or excuse for jumping from it as he did. We must therefore for the purposes of this suit consider his presence there as due to his own unassisted mistake and regard the act of jumping from the car in the light of what occurred after he had gotten upon it. The sole attempted extenuation of the act lies in the conversation with the person called by the plaintiff a trainman, but whether this person was the conductor of the train, a brakeman, or a Pullman ear porter does not appear. It does appear however that he did not order the plaintiff to jump from the car and that what he said amounted at most to a suggestion or expression of opinion that he might do so. In this conversation therefore there was no warrant for the act under consideration and nothing to subject the company to liability for the consequences of it.</p>

He did so to escape being carried to the next station when he desired to go in the opposite direction. This desire was the sole cause of bis rash and entirely voluntary act, and he must be considered as having deliberately accepted the risks involved in it. It is essential to the safety of the traveling public that the railroad company shall be held to a strict accountability to its passenger for an injury resulting from its negligence, but common justice requires that it shall not be held liable to him for an injury caused by bis own negligence or violation of its rules.</p>
