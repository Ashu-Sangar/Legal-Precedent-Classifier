He claimed that after he had put in $377 worth of work, consisting of the flue pipes, etc., permanently fastened in the partitions, that defendant wrongfully hindered him from proceeding with the work, and paid him but $190 for what he had done.

Our examination of the charge in connection with the testimony has satisfied all of us that the instructions contained in so much thereof as is recited in the specification of error were erroneous, and the jury were thereby misled to the defendant’s prejudice. In the first sentence of that excerpt, the learned judge said: “Now, if you believe .... that the plaintiff refused to go on unless he received a payment of one hundred dollars, and that the contract did not provide for that payment, and that there was no custom of the trade and no understanding of the parties or acts of theirs, evincing that that was the custom, and that therefore the plaintiff' broke his contract and refused to go on because payment was not made, he would be entitled to recover for the value of the work less what it cost the defendant to complete the contract in accordance with its terms.”</p>

Equally unsound and untenable is the subsequent instruction to the effect that plaintiff in this case could recover his claim unless defendant proved affirmatively that he had suffered damage by plaintiff’s default. Our own cases, among which are Martin v. Schoenberger, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 367" data-case-ids="483403" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0367-01">8 W. &amp; S. 367</a>, and Gillespie Tool Co. v.
