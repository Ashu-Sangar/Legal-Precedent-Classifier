    <p class="summary" id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[267,610,1177,1425]]]'>The defendant is an association chartered under the ninth paragraph of section 2 of the corporation act of 1874, under, which corporations may be formed for “ the maintenance of a society for beneficial or protective purposes to its members from funds collected therein.” The question has been much disputed whether such a corporation has the power to agree with its members to pay to their representatives or their designated beneficiaries a specified sum of money in the event of <em>death; </em>the objection to the existence of the power being that such an agreement is essentially a contract of life insurance, and therefore beyond the power of a beneficial association or of any other association except a life insurance company incorporated either under a special statute or under the general insurance laws of the state. The difference between a beneficial society strictly so called and a life insurance company strictly so called is not difficult to state, and the distinction has been drawn by Mr. Justice CxAR.it in Commonwealth v.

But even after the application of the proper test (whatever that might be), and after it might be thus decided that a particular corporation was a beneficial association, the disputed question above stated would still remain, and it would still be doubtful whether such an association has the power to make a contract which is in effect a contract of life insurance, or whether contracts of life insurance could only be made by companies holding a special charter or by companies incorporated under the general insurance laws.</p>

This decision was made in February, 1889, and the case to which it is appended as a note, and which was taken to the Supreme <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>Court in order to have a similar ruling reviewed by that tribunal, was finally decided in February of the following year. For reasons which are stated in the opinion, the Supreme Court did not decide the point, and the dispute remained undetermined. Upon the meeting of the next legislature, therefore, that body undertook to end the controversy, and on May 23,1891, passed the act above referred to. Accordingly, this statute provides that it shall be lawful for any corporation, formed under the corporation act of 1874 for the purpose of maintaining a society for beneficial or protective purposes to its members from funds collected therein, “ to pay and to enter into contracts to pay to each member thereof money or benefits not exceeding ten dollars per week in the event of sickness, accident or disability, or to pay not exceeding the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars in the event of death, or to pay money or benefits in the event of any or all such contingencies.”</p>

The defendant disclaims the power to do, and denies that it does, a general public insurance business, alleging that it was incorporated in 1892 for the sole purpose above specified in the act of 1874, namely : the maintenance of a society for beneficial or protective purposes. If then the act of 1891 confers the privilege therein described only upon companies doing a general public insurance business, and if the defendant is not doing this kind of business, it has apparently not received that privilege, and is entering into contracts which are plainly insurance contracts and are therefore beyond its power. To avoid this conclusion, it takes the position that the last clause of the proviso is repugnant to the body of the act, <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>and therefore must be declared void; citing in support of this well known principle Dugan v.

    <p class="summary" id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[267,499,1173,1385]]]'>But we do not consider it necessary to apply this principle. We think the proviso can be properly construed so as to give it a meaning which is not at all repugnant to the body of the act. In our opinion the clause under consideration uses the phrase, “ a general public insurance business,” in a loose and popular sense, intending to describe the very business which the defendant is now doing, and which is being done, or at least was then being done, very generally throughout the state. That it was life insurance for small sums can hardly be successfully denied, and in our opinion the language of the proviso recognizes this to be true and refers to companies like the defendant who were notoriously offering this kind of insurance to the general public. The proviso is careful to state that the act is not to apply to societies which operate through the lodge-system, or to societies formed for the benefit of members or employees of corporations or firms; and then, for greater certainty and in order that there may be no doubt about the single class to which the privilege in the act is offered, goes on to state affirmatively that it shall only apply to those companies which offer their benefits through agents to the general public. It seems to us that such companies (although professing to be beneficial associations simply) are properly described as companies “ employing agents and doing a general public insurance business,” and they are thus clearly distinguished from other beneficial associations which confine their benefits to a restricted class or order or group of individuals. Taken in this sense, there is no repugnance between the proviso and the body of the act, and as the language will readily bear this construction we are bound to adopt it.</p>

In other words, the legislature allows this class of companies to conduct the business of life insurance, provided the sum insured is not greater than two hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

It would not follow however that the act would be void because of a repugnancy between its affirmative body and a restrictive proviso, but it is not necessary to consider the case in this aspect, as there is a fair construction which avoids the apparent repugnancy. This is so lucidly and convincingly stated by the learned judge below that we are content to affirm the judgment on his opinion.</p>
    <p id="b490-7" data-blocks='[["BL_490.8",490,[235,1112,1180,1090]]]'>It may be well however to notice the argument made for the commonwealth in this court, on the constitutionality of the act of 1891. This rests upon the view that the real purpose of the act was to take certain insurance business out of the control of the Insurance Department, and that this purpose is not disclosed by the title. The body of the act is an affirmative grant to certain corporations of the power to make contracts with their members to pay money or benefits in the contingencies of sickness, accident, disability or death. Whatever may have been the motive behind the act, this is the whole of its legislative object, and this is expressed fully and in very explicit terms in the title. The business is beyond question an insurance business, and the weight of the commonwealth’s argument is that the act is a loosely defined, ill guarded and dangerous departure from the previous policy of the state, and a breaking down of the proper barriers between genuine beneficial associations and insurance companies, which will subject the class least able to protect themselves to the risks of bad management and fraud for the prevention of which the Insurance Department was established and hitherto has been rigidly sustained. But whatever we might think on this subject as a matter of public policy or wisdom the legislative grant is clear, and it is not for us to defeat it.</p>

There is no constitutional requirement that acts of general legislation shall give notice of all their indirect effects on existing law; nor would such a restriction be practicable. The fabric of modern law is too complicated, and the displacement of any part of it too far-reaching, for its entire effect to be foreseen by any legislator. The constitution requires that the title of an act shall clearly express its subject. That is notice to some extent of its direct effect, and that is as far as it is practicable to go, the indirect and incidental effects cannot be foreseen or announced, but must be left for development by the clash of opposing interests in the field of litigation.</p>

On the contrary, the presumption is that the control of the Insurance Department will attach to these corporations. The department was established for the general supervision of the whole business of insurance in this state, and to that end was given very large powers of visitation and examination into the assets, solvency, business methods etc. of all insurance companies and agents. When a new class of companies is authorized to do insurance business they would naturally come at once under the supervising control of the department, and be subject to all of its regulations which are practicable to apply to their circumstances.</p>

A question of some importance which suggests itself in this regard is the membership of infants. The constitution and by-laws provide for membership by persons between two and sixty years of age. Infants cannot make the contract of membership for themselves, and it is not clear how the parents can make it for them, and as the statute only authorizes insurance of members, not of other persons in whom members may have an insurable interest, the legality of this branch of the business would seem to be open to question. On this however we do not pass. It was not raised or argued and we only refer to it now to make this fact clear.</p>
