His reputation was that of a man of large means, and no doubt he believed he was possessed of a handsome competency. Prior to March, 1892, testator expressed an intention to make a gift to his granddaughter, the <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>claimant, of some shares of stock of the American Coal Company of which he was the owner. About that time he obtained a loan of $10,000 from a bank in New York by the discount of his promissory note for this amount, and deposited with the bank as collateral security one thousand shares of the stock mentioned. In July, 1892, testator recognizing the fact that he had parted with the control of the shares of stock he intended to present to his granddaughter, and also of the probable sale of the stock by the bank in case of his failure to pay his note, at the suggestion of his son, claimant’s father, he made his promissory note in favor of his granddaughter, dated July 19, 1892, for $10,000, and gave the same to his son for delivery to his daughter. When testator’s promissory note held by the bank became due and payable, he procured its renewal with the bank, who continued to hold the shares of stock as collateral. In November, 1892, the renewal note matured and was paid by him. The note for $10,000 he had given for the benefit of his granddaughter was returned to him, and the shares of stock pledged to the bank in New York he then presented to her as a gift. But it seems he did not destroy his promissory note, but retained it in his possession. At this time testator was a debtor to the bank of which he was president, upon his promissory note ; but it became necessary to substitute some other evidence of his indebtedness. He accordingly obtained from his granddaughter either her due bill or promissory note for $10,000, and delivered to her his before-mentioned promissory note for $10,000, which he had retained and not destroyed, as stated. But she returned to him his promissory note. As it appears, testator then obtained from the bank his promissory note and substituted therefor his granddaughter’s promissory note or due bill accompanied by his own note for $10,000, which she had returned to him as a collateral security. This was in November, 1892. Testator died before the debt to the bank became payable. And in May, 1893, after his death, his granddaughter paid her note or due bill held by the bank with her own money; and the bank, in the ordinary course of business, returned to her her due bill or note, together with the testator’s promissory note which she now claims upon.</p>

The award to her in this respect is accordingly corrected.</p>

It was expressly found, however, as a fact, that the consideration for the note was a good consideration, viz, natural love and affection. But this was deemed insufficient to sustain the claim. The auditing judge has given the question careful reflection, and is now inclined to the opinion he was in error in his former conclusion. The gift by testator of his own promissory note to his granddaughter was, it is true, an executory contract. But it was actually delivered by him to her. He declared at the same time the purpose of the gift was to provide for the future comfort and maintenance of herself and sister. While it has been held in numerous instances, both in England and in this country, and is stated by Trttnkey, J., in Conmey v. Maefarlane, supra, that a simple contract, oral or written, without consideration is void, and no action can be maintained- upon it, “ the law requires that the consideration should be valuable to support an action to enforce an executory contract, but some loss or inconvenience to (he promisee upon his entering into the contract, or some benefit to the promisor is deemed a valuable consideration ; ” yet we find that, as in the ease of a grant by deed, “a consideration may be either a good or a valuable one. A good consideration is such as that of blood, or of natural love and affection, when a man grants an estate to a near relative, being founded on motives of generosity and natural duty. A valuable consideration is such as <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>money, marriage or the like, which the law esteems an equivalent given for the grant, and is, therefore, founded in motives of justice. Deeds made upon good consideration only are considered as merely voluntary, and are frequently set aside in favor of creditors and bona fide purchasers.*’ 2 Sharswood’s Blackstone,'*297. And so with an executory contract which is an agreement upon sufficient consideration. It may be founded upon either a good or valuable consideration. If founded upon a good consideration it may, “ however, be set aside, and the contract become void when it tends in its consequences to defraud creditors or other third persons of their just rights.” Id. *444. And, as stated in the note by Judge Shabswood, a voluntary bond under seal which imports consideration is both in law and in equity a gift of money, and must be postponed until creditors are paid ; it is fraudulent and void as to them, but it is always good against the party himself and against heirs, legatees and others who stand in no higher equity.

It appears then that she gave her note or due bill and received his note for the same amount as security. Subsequently she was compelled to pay her note, and was therefore entitled to recover from his estate-the amount of his note which she held as security. It makes no difference that she paid her note out of the proceeds of the Coal Company stock, because the stock was hers. As found by the learned auditing judge, it had been delivered to her by her grandfather and was therefore an executed gift. A payment with the proceeds of part of it was as much a payment out of her own means as a check on her own bank account would have been. We find no error in this part of the case.</p>

It was a mere promise to pay, without consideration, and not enforceable against the promisor or against his estate. The learned counsel for the appellee have gone very far back in history to show that a consideration was not essential in the early common law, and that a seal was only a matter of technical form. But the necessity of a consideration having been settled more than four hundred years ago is scarcely open to discussion now, and while the distinction between sealed and unsealed instruments may be technical it is part of the bed rock on which the whole law of contracts is built. The cases cited by the learned court below <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>are cases of sealed instruments and stand on entirely different ground. The note is also spoken of as “ an executory contract not under seal,” but this is a misnomer.

Natural love and affection are a good consideration for an executed contract or gift, and in this state a moral obligation is a good consideration for an express promise, but natural love and affection are not -a moral obligation in such sense as will support even an express promise to make a gift. “ Natural affection is not a sufficient consideration to support a simple contract: ” Byles on Bills, p. 214.
