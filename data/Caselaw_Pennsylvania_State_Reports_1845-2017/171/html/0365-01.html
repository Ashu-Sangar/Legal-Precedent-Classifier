Wakefield as master, from whose report it appeared that on May 15, 1871, Elisha P. Gibbons, Samuel A. Wood and James A. Cromlow, entered into articles of copartnership for the purpose of carrying on the sawmill and planing mill business in Bridgeport borough. At the time of the formation of the partnership Samuel A. Wood owned a one third interest in lots Nos. 11 and 12, in the plan of the borough of Bridgeport. The articles provided, inter alia, as follows: “ Each partner is to invest an equal amount of funds in the purchase of the ground, and the erection of the <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>mill.” S. A. Wood contributed his one third interest in lots Nos. 11 and 12, without any- special writing, and the funds of the firm were used in purchasing the adjoining lots Nos. 108 and 111. The firm used the four lots during the continuance of the partnership. The business was continued until June 20, 1885, when it. was dissolved by an agreement in writing by which it was stipulated that Gibbons should take possession of the entire real and personal property of the firm, and pay off the partnership indebtedness “to the amount of thirteen thousand dollars, provided they reach that sum. If the debts of the Co. exceed thirteen thousand dollars, then said E. P. Gibbons pay one-third of all excess over thirteen thousand of indebtedness and said Samuel A. Wood and James A. Cromlow the other two-thirds of such excess, and if said E. P. Gibbons can realize more out of the entire, property by judicious management than thirteen thousand dollars, and the indebtedness of the Co,, is .more..than that sum, then be is to apply it to the payment of the debts of the Co. If there is anything remaining after all indebtedness of the Co. is paid, and his own expenses for settling the business of the Co., such proceeds is to be divided equally between the three partners.” Gibbons in his lifetime, and his executors after his death, paid off debts of the firm amounting to $18,427.52.</p>

Wood and C. B. Wood. The master reported as a fact that before Thomas S. Wood, L. M. Wood and C. B. Wood obtained the judgment upon which the above writ was issued the said plaintiffs “had notice of the dissolution of the firm of Gibbons, Wood'&amp; Cromlow, and that the lots aforesaid had been turned over to the liquidating partner as assets for the 2&gt;ayment of the firm’s debts, and that these lots had been used and treated as partnership property.
