During the progress of the work the walls of the house sank, and cracks appeared in many parts of it. The evidence showed that the house had been built upon what is called “ made ground,”—that is, that the natural level of the lot was below the established grade of the city and was used as an ash dump, and place of deposit for rubbish of all kinds. The material used was described by one of the witnesses as “ hoop-skirts, brickbats, oyster shells, tomato cans, old barrels, . . . . dead dogs and cats.”</p>

Upon that made ground, as I have said, the plaintiff’s house was built. It has been testified here, and not contradicted, that the ground upon which this house is built is made ground, and whether it was eighteen feet of made ground, or twenty feet, or more or less, perhaps does not make so much difference.</p>

It is not necessary for you to take these figures and average them, and then give an average sum as your verdict. That is not the right way to render a verdict. The question is, what witnesses do you believe—whose testimony convinced you of what is a proper award ? You will have to inquire, in the first place, whether it would require as much as some of the witnesses have said it would to repair the house—'that is, whether it is necessary to take down the walls, for some of them have said that it can he repaired and put in substantial, good condition to make it as valuable as it was before by simply repairing it without taking down the walls.</p>

If you are of the <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>opinion that the plaintiff ought to receive damages in this case, ■then you will determine how much will compensate her.

The plans show that. Mr. O’Donnell has testified that that could not have been caused, in his judgment, by the sewer, because the crack is only about three-quarters of an inch wide, and if the front wall went out four inches, it would make a bigger crack than three quarters of an inch. That seems to be logical. According to the plan, I find that at the third story windows of those houses there is only forty-nine feet six inches, between the houses on the two sides of the street, whereas there should have been fifty feet. ' Down at the bottom, looking at the plan, you will find that between two houses on different sides of the street there is a space of forty-nine feet, ten and one half inches, there being one and one half inches less in the street than there ought to be. They do not seem to have been very cautious about the street line even in building the houses, and appear to have encroached somewhat on the highway.</p>

Perhaps you yourselves may have had some experience on that subject, and know that that is the case with a good many houses. I have some in mind myself where the walls are four and a half inches at least out of plumb, and they still remain and sustain a very strong building. You will determine, therefore, whether you think these walls ought to be torn down and leveled, in order to restore the building, and if so, how much you will allow for it. If you think that the house has been injured by the construction of the sewer, but that it can be put into good condition without taking down the walls, that it can be repaired bjr a sum of money fixed by the witnessess at from $250 to $500 or thereabouts, you may allow that amount. [I submit it to you as jurors to determine the questions, first, was the injury to the house caused by the constuction of the sewer ? If it was not, and if it was caused by the defective foundation, there <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>is an end of the plaintiff’s case, and the verdict ought to be for the defendants.

In 1893, under an ordinance authorizing the improvement, the city dug a trench, twenty-five or thirty feet deep, in Nineteenth street, in front of the house and within four or five feet of the eastern curb-line, and constructed therein a main public sewer about five feet in diameter. This sewer was not intended to drain plaintiff’s premises, which, for all sewage and drainage purposes, were connected with a local sewer on the westerly side of same street.</p>

Plaintiff, alleging that these and other injuries to her property were caused by the excavation, etc., in constructing said public sewer, brought this action to recover compensation for the damages thus sustained. An agreement of counsel was filed that the case should be considered as if arising on an appeal from the award of viewers under the act of March 16, 1891, or, on the election of the plaintiff, as an ordinary action of trespass.</p>

The learned trial judge instructed them that, if plaintiff’s house was injured, “ not by the construction of the sewer, but by the faulty foundation—the foundation of made ground on which it was built—and that the injury was caused by the settling of the house upon its own foundation,” the plaintiff could not recover. In affirming defendant’s fourth point for charge, he also instructed them, in the language thereof, thus: “If the jury find that the ground where the house in question was erected was so deficient—from whatever cause—in firmness and solidity as to be inadequate to "sustain a building under the conditions which are usual in the conduct of necessary public works upon the highway, the}' must find for the defendant, so far at least as the injury to the house is concerned.” He further instructed the jurjT, in substance, that if they found the injuries to plaintiff’s house were caused by the excavation and construction of the sewer in front thereof, they should award damages to compensate her for the injury. Their verdict awarding damages to plaintiff necessarily implies that the jury found as a fact that the injuries complained of were the direct and proximate result <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>of the excavation and construction of the sewer, and further, that they were not caused by the alleged insecure and defective character of the made ground on which her house was erected.</p>
    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[237,492,1176,424]]]'>It having thus been clearly established by the verdict that the work of constructing the sewer and not the character of made ground on which the house was erected was the cause of the injury, the case is within the very letter as well as the spirit of the constitutional mandate which requires municipal and other corporations, etc., to “ make just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of their works, highways or improvements.” To hold otherwise would defeat one of the main objects of that provision.</p>
    <p id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[238,924,1170,185]]]'>In its controlling principles, this case does not materially differ from O’Brien v.
