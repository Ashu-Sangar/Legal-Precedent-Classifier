There was no exception taken by counsel for appellant, either to the charge of the court or to his answers to the points now complained of. There was no request made by the counsel to the court before the verdict for an order directing the charge to be filed and made matter of record for the purpose of enabling them to except thereto. No order has been made by the trial court since the verdict, directing the&gt; stenographer to write out the charge of the court and the answers to points in long hand and to file them as part of the record. There is no certificate by the trial court attached to the record showing that the charge now printed in the paper-book, to which the errors are assigned, has been examined by him, has been found to be correct, and is therefore directed to be filed as part of the record. All of these facts appear from the record itself as printed in the paper-books. The record on this subject, as appears by <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>the copy of the docket entries printed, shows the following: “May 17,1894, jury find for the plaintiffs. May 19,1894, motion and reason for new trial filed. May 28, 1894, charge of the court filed. August 25, 1894, motion to set aside verdict and grant a new trial overruled and new trial refused.

The party excepting should at the same time request that the charge and answers to points be written out and filed by the stenographer’s notes, but the better practice is to write it out and file it with the prothonotaiy. The request is then granted, the formal order directing that a copy of the charge or of the notes of the trial, as the ease may be, be written out and filed, is entered on the minute book or filed in the case. The stenographer then makes and files the copy and the record is completely made up.”</p>

O’Neil, 154 Pa., on page 589, Mr. Justice Mitchell says: “It is much the better practice for the judge to settle all doubt or question as to the charge, as well as the evidence, by signing the bill of exceptions, but where that is not done, it should appear in some way <em>affirmatively on the charge </em>as <em>reported by the stenographer </em>that it is approved by the judge as correct and filed by his direction. Without that, the filing by the stenographer is a nullity.</p>

We have none of the evidence, for there is no bill of exceptions. Even as to the charge, therefore, we could not, pass upon it for want of the facts to which it related. But the charge itself, though printed in the paper-book of appellant, is not of record. It nowhere appears to have been filed by the, judge or approved by him and filed by his order. The case therefore is not in position for us to afford appellant any relief.”</p>

L. 199, required the stenographer to take notes of the, charge and file them of record and put the charge thus filed on the same footing as a charge filed under the act of 1806, it did not intend nor could it, even if intended, dispense with the necessity of the judge’s personal examination and certification of the correctness of the notes filed. The charge is his charge and the filing is his act, and the statute of Westminster, still in force, the act of 1806 and the act of 1887 alike require that he should do it in person and certify his so doing by his own signature.”</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[276,1338,1170,512]]]'>It is difficult to see how any force can be added to the argument in favor of this motion by enlarging on what has been so briefly, but so clearly and emphatically stated by this court in the cases above cited. Here we have not a single bill of exceptions of any kind taken by appellant to the charge or answers to points; and no properly certified bills of exception to any evidence. True, some exceptions were noted as the trial progressed, but the-trial judge has not certified to these by personally signing each one, nor by signing any general certificate at the end of the stenographic notes certifying to their correctness as a whole.</p>
    <p id="b520-6" data-blocks='[["BL_520.6",520,[276,1865,1173,425]],["BL_521.1",521,[215,376,1173,816]]]'>“We-are not disposed to stand on mere forms. That the record is true and the judge so declares, is the substance, the form is not very material. He may so declare by formal bills with his seal, or he may adopt the notes of the' stenographer as verity <em>and so declare by Ms certificate at the end </em>of the stenographic report certifying to its correctness as a whole .... He, may make as many certificates as he pleases, <em>but he must make at least one </em>which discloses his belief that the stenographic notes are verity and that he so declares.” He has made no certificate. <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>Therefore none of the evidence in these cases is part of the record and none of it is before this court. This of itself, as the court says, would be sufficient to prevent this court from passing upon the charge for want of the facts to which it related. But the charge itself is not part of the record and is not before this court. No exception was taken to the charge at the time. No request was made before verdict for an order directing the charge to be filed as part of the record, and no such order was made. No order has since been made, as the record shows, directing the charge to be written out and filed, and there is no certificate by the trial court, either on the notes of the stenographer filed or in the prothonotary’s office certifying that the charge, which is now printed in the paper-book, is in truth and in fact the charge delivered by the court, and that he has directed it to be made a part of the record. In the face of these facts, it is respectfully urged on the authority of the cases above cited, that these appeals aud the paper-books must be quashed.</p>
