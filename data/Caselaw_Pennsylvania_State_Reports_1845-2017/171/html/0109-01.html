Should it not be accepted in writing on or before that time, the above is to become null and void and without effect between us.” On September 25,1893, the defendant company withdrew the offer of July 31, and it is now contended in its behalf that no contractual relations existed between the parties. That such an option may be withdrawn any time before acceptance is shown by the long list of cases cited in Benjamin on Sales, section 41, in note. The case of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad Company v. Bartlett, 3 Cushing, 224, was the case of an offer to be accepted in a certain time, and the court decided that the contract might have been withdrawn any time before acceptance. In that case, however, the contract was accepted within the time limited. There is an exception in cases in which a consideration is paid for the offer of a contract, but I do not consider that this is such a case. Here the plaintiff company had a contract with the Atlantic Refining Company which expired in March, 1893, and desiring to obtain a supply of oil from the defendant company, conversations were had between some of the officers of the plaintiff company and M r. Mellon, acting on behalf of the defendant company, in which the officers of the plaintiff company stated how much oil they desired to have, and Mr. Mellon, for his company, agreeing to furnish it, and stating that it would be able to furnish a great deal more if required. The efforts on the part of the officers of the plaintiff company to obtain customers in France were efforts expended in their own behalf and for their own benefit in order to increase their business.</p>

It states exactly the terms of the offer by Mr. Mellon’s company. If there ever was a case in which the written agreement of the parties can be said to contain all of the preliminary conversations or <em>may </em>be said to be based upon the preliminary conversations and to include the essential parts thereof, it seems to me that this is that kind of a case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[256,893,1174,185]]]'>I am of opinion, therefore, that the defendant company had the right to withdraw its offer of an option to the plaintiff company, and that it did withdraw it on September 25,1893, which was before the plaintiff company accepted the offer in writing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b134-5" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[254,1086,1177,617]]]'>The plaintiff company seeks to hold the defendant to its contract by an alleged verbal acceptance made prior to September 25, and relies upon a line of cases in which, although written notices are inquired prior to bringing suit, yet verbal notices have been held to be a waiver of the written notices. But these cases concern simply the preliminaries to suit, and I do not believe any case can be found in which that law applies to so vital a matter as the formation of the contract upon which the suit is based. Here the defendant company expressly declared that the acceptance should be in writing, and, in my judgment, nothing else than a written acceptance was sufficient to bind the contract. This was done, no doubt, to avoid disputes of this kind by having the acceptance in writing.</p>

The defense is sometimes said to be an ungracious one, but nevertheless where it exists and is well founded in point of law it must be enforced. Perhaps if the contract had been carried out and the oil delivered, some reason might have been found to sustain an action for the price, but here the contract is not executed, and, even if accepted, is challenged at the outset before anything has been done under it. The cases cited on behalf of the defendant company throw great doubt on the right of the plaintiff company to enforce such a contract, for the reason that under its charter as a manufacturing company <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>it is not allowed to engage in the business of buying and selling without doing some kind of manufacture upon the articles which it buys and sells.</p>

    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.7",137,[220,817,1177,1326]]]'>A careful study of the evidence in the case has convinced us that there was no contractual relation between the litigants before July 31, 1898, and that their previous conversations in regard to a contract resulted and were merged in the offer contained in the defendant’s letter of that date. This letter expressed the willingness of the defendant to enter into a contract with the plaintiff on the terms stated in it, and extended to the latter for the term of sixty days the privilege of accepting or refusing the offer, on condition that if it was not accepted in writing “ on or before that time ” it should be void. The offer was solicited by the plaintiff after its representative had ascertained what amount of oil it could dispose of to its customers in France, and all that was required to establish a contract relation between the parties after the offer was made was a written acceptance of it. There is nothing in the offer which indicates that there was a consideration for the option it gave nor anything in the oral evidence which stamps the latter as irrevocable during the time allowed by the letter for the exercise of. it. The trip made by the company’s agents to France was at its expense and for the advancement of its interests. Neither the trip nor the expenditures incurred in making it had any connection with the option in question. The Atlantic Refining Company contended that its contract with the plaintiff expired on the 29th of March, 1893, and refused to deliver any oil under it after that time. The plaintiff’s contract with the Atlantic Company was therefore determined or broken by the other party to it, and its purchase of oil from the defendant in August, 1893, affords no support to its present contention.</p>

The effect of the offer and the option connected with it would be to release the plaintiff from liability to the defendant on the verbal agreement, while according to the contention of the former the latter remains bound by it. But we need not consider the consequences of a condition which has no existence, or of the success of a contention unauthorized, by the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_138.4",138,[228,697,1171,1140]]]'>There being no consideration for the offer in this case the defendant had a clear right to withdraw it at any time before there was an acceptance of it. The learned counsel for the plaintiff contend that there was a consideration for it, but concede that if there was neither a consideration for nor an acceptance of it, the right of the defendant to withdraw it is plain and indisputable. ' By the terms of the offer the defendant could not be held to it without an acceptance of it in writing. It is admitted that there was no written acceptance of the offer before it was withdrawn. But it is claimed that there was a verbal acceptance of it on the 19th of September, six days before it was withdrawn, and that this acceptance dispensed with the written acceptance stipulated for in the letter of July 31st. While we are not prepared to assent to this claim we do not deem it necessary to discuss it, because in the view we have taken of the case a written acceptance of the offer would at most have created an executory contract, the enforcement of which by the plaintiff could be successfully resisted by the defendant on the ground that the former was not authorized by its charter to enter into it. This is one of the defenses made to the action, and it would have to be sustained even though the alleged verbal acceptance had the effect claimed for it. We conclude that the learned court below did not err in refusing to take off the nonsuit.</p>
