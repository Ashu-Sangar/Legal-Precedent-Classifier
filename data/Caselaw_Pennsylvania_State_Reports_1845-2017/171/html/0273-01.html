He had been boarding in the house of William Losee, about a mile and a half or two miles west of Houtzdale. On the day he was shot he had come home from his work in the mines before noon, and after washing himself, without staying for dinner, he went to Houtzdale. From the testimony of William Losee and his wife, it appeared that he returned home about 10 p. m. He was admitted to the house by Mrs. Losee, and passing through the room of Losee and his wife he went up stairs to his own room, and apparently to bed. Losee and his wife then went to sleep. Mrs. Losee testified that she was awakened by a noise outside of the house about eleven o’clock. She heard some one cry “ William, William, William.” The deceased went out and subsequently returned. As he passed through the room of Losee and his wife on his return, it was noticed, according to their 'testimony, that he carried his arm close to his side. He-passed through their room and up to his own ’room.

We met an English-speaking man with big moustache, the same who was here to-night—Albert Reeser— at the Swan hotel, and we went together to Carter’s. I didn’t see Mika after leaving Houtzdale until I saw him at the road when he shot me. Mika was about six yards from me, standing in the road when he shot me.

    <p id="b301-6" data-blocks='[["BL_301.6",301,[225,720,1162,556]]]'>The defendant was indicted for the murder of Vincent Lucasovich, a fellow workman in a coal mine, and was duly convicted of murder of the second degree. The cause of death was a pistol-shot wound, inflicted about midnight in a vital part. Death ensued in about forty-eight hours thereafter. Defendant was arrested about three hours after the fatal shot was fired; and, when confronted by deceased, the latter accused him of being the guilty agent. Shortly afterwards, the dying declarations of the deceased were taken by a justice of the peace ; and their admission in evidence constitutes the first specification of error. In view of the circumstances, the evidence was rightly admitted.</p>
    <p id="b301-7" data-blocks='[["BL_301.7",301,[227,1284,1164,564]]]'>The second specification, alleging error in the learned judge’s instructions as to the burden of proof, cannot be sustained. The same remark is applicable to the remaining specifications, chai'ging error in adopting the theory of the commonwealth, suggesting possible inferences to be drawn by the jury, and in not giving due weight to the defendant’s evidence, etc. When considered as a whole and in connection with the testimony properly before the jury, the learned judge’s charge is a correct and adequate presentation of the law applicable to the facts which the testimony tended to establish. It was quite as favorable to the defendant as it should have been. We find nothing in it of which he has any just reason to complain.</p>
