In the event of the incorporation of Narberth this expensive school building (which cost fifteen thousand dollars) will have to be taken and paid for by said borough for the exclusive use of the public school scholars attending the said school and residing within the limits of said proposed borough, of whom there are less than twenty; and the payment of the cost of this school building will necessitate the heavy bonding of your exceptants’ and other property from the very start for the purpose of adjusting the indebtedness of Narberth to the school district of the township of Lower Merion on this account.</p>

Their streets need supervision ; the drainage needs attention; and their nearness to a large city and the race tracks in the vicinity call for proper police protection. The majority of the citizens are anxious to improve their surroundings. Their voluntary association is no longer sufficient to meet their necessities. Nor is it just that these voluntary contributions should inure to the benefit of those who decline to contribute. Their complaint that the road taxes levied within the limits of the proposed borough are expended within the township without giving a corresponding benefit to the citizens of the village is fully made out and sustained. . Nor is it possible for the supervisors of the township to fully meet their wants. Supervisors do not direct the construction of sidewalks or attempt to fix a town system of street grades. Where a majority of the village is ready to make much <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>needed improvements to give themselves comfortable homes, the project should be encouraged. The township seems to recognize the justice of the petitioners’ claims, for it does not appear as an exceptant to the proceedings.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[212,593,1170,986]]]'>We are aware that the proposed incorporation imposes to a certain extent a hardship upon some of the landowners south of the railroad. They do not need the street improvements required north of the railroad, because they have them already. But this applies only to about half of the property south of the r ailroad. Their grievance is that they will be taxed to improve the properties of their neighbors. This difficulty is not an unusual one. Few tax laws in their application work out exact justice and equality in all cases. But an improvement in the village necessarily to some extent inures to the benefit of all the property owners. Good streets are more valuable if the approaches to them are in like good condition. The inhabitants of a town have at times occasion to use other streets than those in the immediate vicinity of their houses. The objection now made could be used with equal force against the township. Why should these exceptants pay road taxes to the township when they are receiving no corresponding benefits ? The supervisors spend no money upon the streets upon which their houses front. If their money, raised by taxation, is spent upon the streets of the town, are not their properties benefited as much as if it was paid into the township ?</p>

The Wood tract is to the east of this farm, but the greater portion is located on the south side of the railroad. The portion south of the railroad is in part divided into suitable lots for building purposes; one of the lots was sold, the others are in the market for sale. The southern portion of this tract adjoins the built-up parts of the village. The owners objected to the incorporation before the grand jury; but by a paper now on file they say, “We have not and do not care to file exceptions to the report of the grand jury.” If we exclude the Thomas tract, we must necessarily exclude that part of the <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>Wood'tract located east of the Thomas tract. The latter is exclusively used for the purpose of farming, and we cannot say that “ it properly belongs to the town or village.” There is much unimproved property within the proposed limits, many lots are for sale for building purposes, and the time is perhaps not near at hand when this farm will he required for the further extension of the town. The value of the land, it is true, is far beyond the price of farm land; but we are well aware that this can be said of all the land in the neighborhood, even for several miles around. No doubt it has a value of two thousand dollars per acre; but this value is not due to its proximity to the village. We must exclude this farm, as well as the Wood tract to the east of it and north of the railroad, and the Hunter tract north and east of the Thomas tract.</p>

We may alter the boundaries to exclude farm land, but we doubt our authority to make such alterations to meet objections based upon other grounds. The fact that the turnpike is not within the borough limits, is not, in our judgment, such a mistake, if it be a mistake at all, as calls for the rejection of the finding of the grand jury.

It is claimed, however, that the record proper presents such errors as justify the interposition of this court and require a reversal of the decree.</p>

L. 163, in connection with its supplements, empowers the several courts of quarter sessions, by and with the concurrence of the grand <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>jury of the county, to incorporate any town or village within their respective jurisdictions, and prescribes the mode of proceeding therein. The second section provides that the petition for such incorporation shall be in writing, signed by a majority of the freeholders residing within the limits of the proposed borough, setting forth its name, style and title, with a particular description of the boundaries thereof, exhibiting the courses and distances in words at length, and accompanied with a plot or draft of the same. The next section declares the court shall cause the application to be laid before the grand jury when in session, and if a majority of said jury, after a full investigation of the case, shall find that the conditions prescribed by the act have been complied with, and shall believe it is expedient to grant the prayer of the petitioners, they shall certify the same to the court and at the next term of court the judgment of the grand jury may be confirmed ; and if the decree of the court shall be in conformity with the prayer of the petitioners the decree shall be recorded, etc. But, if the court shall deem further investigation necessary, such order shall be taken thereon as to right and justice shall appertain.</p>

In this ease, the power thus conferred was invoked and was properly exercised by the court below.</p>
    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.5",237,[206,1717,1171,565]],["BL_238.1",238,[253,356,1173,1092]]]'>It thus appears that the questions of compliance with the prescribed conditions, and the propriety of granting the prayer of the petitioners, etc., together with all questions of fact pertaining thereto or relating to the situation of the territory included within the limits of the proposed borough, etc., are committed to the arbitrament of the grand jury, who after a full investigation of the case are required to report their eonelusions to the quarter sessions. That court in its revision of the judgment of the grand jury is clothed with large discretionary power. It is clearly the province of the grand jury,— subject to the revisional authority and discretionary power of the quarter sessions in the premises,—to determine all ques<a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>tions of fact and expediency that are necessary to a valid decree of incorporation. It was never intended that any decree incorporating a borough should be disturbed by tins court, unless illegality in the proceedings is made manifest by the record, or abuse of discretion, on the part of the court below, is distinctly charged and clearly established. A careful examination of the record, as presented to us, shows that all the requirements of the act and its supplements were substantially if not strictly complied with. The application in due form was laid before the grand jury. They certified to the court that “after a full investigation of the case,” they found “ the conditions prescribed by the act of assembly .... and by other acts supplementary thereto have all been complied with,” and expressing their belief that “ it is expedient to grant the prayer of the petitioners,” they approved the application. To this judgment of the grand jury exceptions were filed, testimony was taken, hearings were had, and upon due consideration of the whole subject, the learned court passed upon the questions involved, and, with the exception of so modifying the boundary of the proposed borough as to exclude certain lands used solely for farming purposes and not properly belonging to the village, confirmed the judgment of the grand jury and entered the decree from which this appeal was.taken.</p>
    <p id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.4",238,[249,1457,1169,806]],["BL_239.1",239,[200,388,1174,1033]]]'>The first eight specifications of error are to the refusal of the court below to sustain appellants’ exceptions to the findings of the grand jury, recited therein respectively. The questions of fact involved in these exceptions must have been considered by the grand jury and determined by them in favor of the appellees. They were afterwards reviewed by the court and the findings of the grand jury were confirmed. As to all questions of fact, necessarily involved therein, this confirmation was evidently intended to be conclusive; and there is nothing in the record to make this case an exception to the general rule. If the action of the court in dismissing the exceptions needs any vindication, it will be found in the opinions sent up with the record. In his supplementary opinion, the learned president of the quarter sessions, referring to the eighth exception, says : “ The owners of property along the line of the turnpike may prefer a change or modification of the boundaries that will exclude them from the borough but we cannot see our way clear to <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>make any sueb exclusion. Their lands are not used exclusively for farm purposes, nor can it be said that those lands ‘ do not properly belong to tbe town or village.’ Perhaps it would have been wise to include the bed of the turnpike road within tbe borough limits, but we cannot make the change at this time, certainly not without notice to the turnpike company and affording it a hearing. We may alter the boundaries to exclude farm land, but we doubt our authority to make such alterations to meet objections based upon other grounds. The fact that the turnpike is not within the borough limits, is not in our judgment such a mistake, if it be a mistake at all, as calls for the rejection of the finding of the grand jury.” In adopting the southerly line of the turnpike road as the northerly line of the borough there was no such error as would justify a reversal of the decree; nor do we think there was any error in including within the lines of the borough the other highways by which it is bounded on the remaining sides. There is nothing in the record to indicate any error in the conclusions of fact reported by the grand jury; nor does there appear to have been any abuse of the judicial discretion with which the court below is invested in such cases. Neither of the assignments of error is sustained.</p>
