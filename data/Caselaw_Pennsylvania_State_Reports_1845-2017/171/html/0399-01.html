In the former it was expressly held that under a rule of court substantially the same as that in the present case, a denial in the affidavit of defense was a sufficient affidavit, within the rule to put plaintiff to the proof of execution of the note. And in Reiter v. Fruh, the same effect was given to the denial of partnership in the affidavit of defense, and it was said, referring also to Adams v. Kehoe, 1 Weekly Notes, 232, that Hogg v. Orgill had settled the construction of the rule, and the practice under it. While this court usually accepts the construction by other courts of their own rules, yet in the case of a rule like the one under discussion, which is of quite general existence throughout the state, to permit a different construction from that twice expressly given to it in this court would do great injustice to parties who might rely on the settled practice.</p>

Hogg v. Orgill was not cited in that case, and we may certainly <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>conclude that if it had been tbe expression now relied on by appellee would not have been used.</p>

It did not represent his interest in the note in suit, but was claiming adversely against his interest as well as against Henning. Nor was Henning’s interest adverse to that of his deceased partner, in this suit. The note was sued on as a firm note. Henning was called to testify that it was not made by the firm, and therefore his testimony was in exoneration of both partners, so far as the present action was concerned. If the interest of the deceased partner should be incidentally affected by the testimony, not as a partner but by virtue of an individual act in another capacity, that would not render Henning incompetent. The interest of the deceased would he in the question, not in the immediate result of the suit. His representative was not party to the suit and the judgment could not operate upon his rights one way or the other: Dixon v.
