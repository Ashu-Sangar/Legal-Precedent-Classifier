A written constitution marks only the degree of restraint which, to promote stable government, the people put upon themselves; they resolve in this instrument in substance: We will not do certain things and we will do certain others; and generally in the same instrument any change in the course of government thus marked out is rendered difficult by the formalities and lapse of time which must attend an amendment of it; therefore, changes are infrequent and a reasonable degree of stability is attained. But whatever the people have not, by their constitution, restrained themselves from doing, they, through their representatives in the legislature, may do. This latter body represents their will just as completely as a constitutional convention in all matters left open by the written constitution. Certain grants of power, very specifically set forth, were made by the states to the United States, and these cannot be revoked or disregarded by state legislation ; then come the specific restraints imposed by our own constitution upon our own legislature; these must be respected; but in that wide domain not included in either of these boundaries the right of the people through the legislature to enact such laws as they choose, is absolute. Of the use the people may make of this unrestrained power, it is not the business of the courts to inquire.

But this is inseparable from the nature of human institutions. The wisdom of man has never conceived of a government with power to answer its legitimate ends and at the same time incapable of mischief.” So here, even if we concurred with the appellee, which we do not, that approval of the exercise of such a power by the legislature as manifested in this act will naturally lead to abuse of it, that should have no influence in determining the constitutional question ; to permit it to control our judgment would be, in effect, to say, that, as the people have by the adoption of this constitution unwisely neglected to restrain themselves in their lawmaking power, we will wisely restrain them now. We have no such opinion ; but if we had, we have no such power, and therefore turn to the constitution to ascertain, from that alone, whether the statutory provision is forbidden.</p>

The manner of electing Supreme Court judges is also prescribed in the constitution; but being silent in the judiciary article as to the method of electing the members of the Superior Court, we turn to sec. 1, art. 12, which declares: “All officers whose selection is not provided for in this constitution shall be elected or appointed, as may be directed by law.” And so, in pursuance of the authority to create other courts in sec. 1 of art. 5, the court is established, and by the authority of sec. 1, art. 12, the method of election is prescribed.</p>

As the language of the constitution of 1838, prescribing the qualifications of voters, possesses the same significance as that of 1874, the words “shall enjoy the right of an elector,” and “ shall be entitled to vote at all elections,” meaning the same thing, do they as urged by appellee mean more than they express? Can they, by any reasonable <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>interpretation, include an absolute right to vote for every candidate of a group of candidates for the same office? Without regard to what the legislature might have done to fill the offices created by the establishment of the Superior Court, whether they might or might not have made the office appointive, all these questions are now unimportant and we pass no opinion upon them ; the court is established; the office is made elective to be filled by the candidates elected at the general election. We 'therefore must treat the case as the legislature has treated it. The question now is as to the interpretation to be put upon the language specifying the qualification of the voter who has by law a right to vote at the election for candidates for this office.</p>

Within one year after the adoption of the constitution of 1838, the act of July 2, 1839, became a law. It provided: “Section 4. Each of such qualified citizens shall vote for one person as judge, and also for one person as inspector of elections, and the person having the greatest number of votes for judge shall be publicly declared to be elected judge, and the two persons having the greatest number of votes for inspector, shall in like manner be declared to be elected inspectors of election.”</p>

This is more than a mere legislative construction ; it is a cotemporaneous interpretation of language by those who lived when the constitution was framed, possibly by some of those who took part in the convention, and certainly by those who had voted at the election at which it was adopted. This interpretation was never questioned. A period of twenty-eight years elapsed when the jury commissioner act of 1867 was passed, providing for the election every three years of two jury commissioners, and limiting the qualified voter to a right to vote for but one. For seven years every verdict in civil and criminal cases in the commonwealth rested on the <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>twelve jurors whose names were put in tbe wheel by officers elected under this act. Although the legality of tbe panel and array of jurors has been disputed in many cases, the constitutionality of the election of those who selected them has never been questioned. Then, in 1872, was passed the act providing for the election of delegates to the constitutional convention which framed the constitution of 1874. Again, the plan of limited voting was provided for and its legality not disputed. We concede that, no matter how irregular may have been the election of the delegates to that convention, the adoption of its work by the direct vote of the people cured all such irregularities and made the constitution the fundamental law of the commonwealth. We cite the act only as evidencing the legislative interpretation of the constitution of 1838.</p>

It thus clearly appears, that the interpretation put upon the language of the constitution by those who lived at the time it was framed and adopted, was the same as that put upon like language in that of 1874 by the legislature of 1895 ; that flu: interpretation put upon the constitution of 1838 was acquiesced in by the bar, the courts and the legislature for a period of thirty-five years until the adoption of the constitution of 1874. That in two other instances, offices of the highest importance, jury commissioners and delegates to a constitutional convention were by legislative enactment filled on the limited voting plan. In view of this long continued interpretation of our own constitution, we do not think it necessary to discuss the authorities cited from other states. In fact in the case most relied on by the appellee, State against Constantine, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Ohio%20437" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="42 Ohio 437">42 Ohio, 437</a>, in which the court arrives at a conclusion different from ours, it is said: “ The right of each elector to vote for a candidate for each office to be filled at an election had never been doubted; ” in our state the right of the legislature to limit the vote to a less number than all the officers to be elected has never been <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>doubted; as the historical interpretation has been wholly different the conclusions must necessarily be at variance. Hays v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/82/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="82 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="1047878" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0518-01">82 Pa. 518</a>, turned on another question than is raised here ; viz : whether by application of the cumulative voting plan, a stockholder’s election in a railroad corporation chartered under act of 1868 could be controlled. This court held that even the constitution could not take from the stockholder his vested right under the charter to have one vote cast for each officer to be elected.</p>

The application of this maxim depends wholly on the subject of contention'; the expression of one thing often necessarily is, or tends to, the exclusion of others not expressed; but the induction is not warranted in all cases, and if indiscriminately applied would frequently lead to most erroneous conclusions. Take the cáse before us: the constitution establishes limited voting in the election of Supreme Court judges, county commissioners, Philadelphia magistrates, and inspectors of election; therefore, it is argued, the implication is that the plan is excluded in the election of all other officers. But the limited voting plan was.recognized and adopted in the constitution because it was deemed wise that as to offices non partisan in character, or which at least should be, the minority party ought to have representation, and this could only be attained by limited voting. Does the expression of this thing necessarily exclude other things not expressed ? As the same reasons for the plan exist as to like offices thereafter created, is it not a necessary deduction that a like plan to that expressed should be followed? Does not the whole spirit of the constitution plainly so imply, while there is not a word indicating that such plan as to other or new courts is forbidden. In the cases specified the constitution is mandatory; it saj-s to the legislature in these, enumerating them, thou shalt prescribe the limited voting plan ; in the cases not enumerated but of the same kind it is discretionary.</p>

Some of the reasons that impel mo to dissent from it I will state as briefly as I am able. The government of Pennsylvania is in the language of the Declaration of Rights a “ Free Government,” and rests on the authority of the people. Their authority is exercised and their will expressed by their votes. To protect themselves in the unrestricted exercise of their right to vote at all elections and for all public officers they have declared hi the fifth section-of the Declaration of Rights that “ no power civil or military shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage.” In order to define what they meant by “ the right of suffrage ” and to regulate the manner of its exercise, they devoted the seventeen sections of the eighth article of the constitution to this subject. In the first of these sections they declare that “ every male citizen twenty-one years of age, possessing the following qualifications shall be entitled to vote at all elections.” The qualifications that follow relate to citizenship, to residence, and the payment of a tax. These qualifications cannot be changed, increased or diminished by the legislature. This was distinctly asserted by this court in Page et al. v. Allen et al., <a href="/pa/58/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="58 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1013165" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0338-01">58 Pa. 338</a>, in these words : “ No constitutional qualification of a voter can be abridged, added to, or altered by legislation.” In McCafferty v. Guyer, <a href="/pa/59/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="59 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="426969" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0109-01">59 Pa. 109</a>, a statute passed to disfranchise a deserter from the armies of the Union was held unconstitutional because it added a disqualification not found in the constitution; and the rule of Page v. Allen, <a href="/pa/58/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="58 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1013165" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0338-01">supra,</a> was recognized and restated in these words: “ A right conferred by the constitution is beyond the reach of legislative interference.” If there were no other provisions upon this subject it would be too clear for serious contention that the people had reserved to themselves the unrestricted right of suffrage, and that the legislature was powerless to deny to any qualified voter the privilege of voting at all elections and for all elective officers, if he desired to exercise it. But some experiments had been made by the legislature with what is called limited voting prior to the calling of the constitutional convention of 1873. These had been made without constitutional authority, to secure minority representation on boards of officers where it was thought the presence of a representative of the minority politi <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>cal party might tend, to a more impartial discharge of the duties devolving on the board, or to increased efficiency. It was thought best to recognize the principle underlying such legislation and to indicate in what cases and to what extent this power to limit a citizen in the exercise of his right of suffrage should thereafter be exercised. These cases are where two judges of the Supreme Court are to be elected at the same time, art. 5, sec. 16; in the election of inspectors of election, art. 8, sec. 14; in the election of county commissioners and county auditors, art. 14, sec. 7, and the election of magistrates in Philadelphia.</p>

Expressio unius exclusio alterius. It has been suggested that this maxim is not applicable in the interpretation of the constitution, but this court held exactly the opposite in Page v. Allen and Robb v. Barlow, <a href="/pa/58/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="58 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1013165" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0338-01">58 Pa. 338</a>, and the following language was used: “ The expression of one thing in the constitution is the exclusion of things not expressed.” It was further said in the same case “ The inhibitions of the constitution as to legislation are to be regarded as well when ■ they arise by implication as by expression.” We are bound by our own precedents and by every rule of interpretation to say in this case that an enumeration of the instances in which the exercise of the right of suffrage shall be limited is equivalent to a distinct denial of the power to limit it in all cases not in the enumeration. But this judgment is not only in violation of the constitution, but it recognizes a power in the legislature to disregard the constitutional safeguards of the right to vote that is far reaching and that might be used, to subvert the will of the majority. In many counties of the state two or more, and in the counties of Philadelphia and Allegheny many members of the legislature are elected upon the same general ticket. The right of the voter might with equal propriety be limited to a certain number of these. If the legislature may deny to the voter the right to vote for one, why not for two, or three, or to vote for all but one ? There are counties in the commonwealth where the relative strength of the great political parties is as one to three. Suppose such a <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>county elects two representatives and each voter is restricted in his right to vote so that he can vote for but one. Then the majority numbering three fourths of all the voters secures the same representation as the minority that numbers but one fourth of the voters. If this judgment is right and the legislature may without constitutional authority deny to every citizen of the commonwealth the right to vote for one of the judges of the superior court, why may not the same thing be done as to associate judges in the counties where those officers still exist? Why not in all judicial districts where two or more judges are elected in the same district ? Why not extend the same limitation to school directors, to members of select and common councils in cities, to councilmen in boroughs, to congressmen at large of whom we have two, and even to presidential electors ?</p>
    <p id="b539-3" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[210,1059,1176,1284]]]'>But it is said that jury commissioners are elected on the plan of limited voting, and if this judgment should be affirmed the law under which they are elected would fall. I can imagine a greater public calamity than that would be. Suppose it should be held, as but for this judgment I cannot doubt it would be held, that the law under which jury commissioners are elected is unconstitutional, then the duty of selecting and drawing jurors would fall back upon the county commissioners if no other method was provided by law. No serious inconvenience could arise. But meantime, and until the question is regularly raised on quo warranto and decided, it could not be raised on a challenge to the array. The officers will continue to serve until the law is repealed or held to be invalid. But suppose it was inevitable that an affirmance of this judgment would empty every jury wheel in the state. It is better, a thousand times better, that this should happen than that the sacred “ right of suffrage ” so carefully intrenched by the people in their fundamental law should become the football of party majorities to be limited or restricted as the exigencies of political warfare might seem to require. I would affirm this judgment and uphold the constitutional declaration that “every male citizen twenty-one years of age .... shall be entitled to vote at all elections ” and, in the language of the Declaration of Rights, I would hold that “ no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage ” at any election or for any elective officer, except in the instances and to the extent that the constitution has plainly authorized.</p>
