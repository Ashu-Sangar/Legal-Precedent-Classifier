Hand and Chase a town lot of land in the Second ward of the city of Wilkes-Barre, known as lot No. 66, on a map or plot referred to in the contract. The return of assessment of 1884, now offered in evidence and objected to, contains among other things the following: “McGurk, J., Washington, Ward <em>2.” </em>For the purposes of the present ruling it is stated and admitted that there is no other assessment of McGurk, J., shown by the return in question. This return now offered in evidence is objected to upon two grounds by the counsel for the defendants—-first, because the certificate attached thereto is not properly dated—that the year for which the assessment in question was returned does not appear except by evidence furnished aliunde. Secondly, that the assessment and the advertisement of the property do not sufficiently describe the premises assessed and subsequently sold. We have considered both of these questions, and now say that under the act of 1881, entitled An act to make taxes assessed upon real estate the first lien and to provide for the collection of such taxes, etc., this return of assessment would be insufficient for the reason that that act requires the return shall contain a statement of the amount of each kind of tax returned, the names of the parties assessed with the same, the year when such taxes were assessed, a sufficient description by_boundaries, or otherwise, of each separate lot or tract, and about the &lt;juanlity of the same, etc. The description in this case clearly would not fulfill the requirements of the act of 1881, and would afford no basis for filing a lien upon property nor for an advertisement and sale thereof. Therefore in our judgment, under the act of 1881, this evidence could not be admitted. It is objected, however, that this act is unconstitutional. It has been so decided by the two eminent judges of the Dauphin <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>county district, as well as by the equally eminent Judge Barker of the Cambria district of this state. The Supreme Court of the state have not yet expressed their opinion on the subject, and we do not express any opinion either. But we come now to a consideration of this offer, independently, entirely, of the act of 1881. Prior to that act, sales of seated lands for taxes were to be conducted as sales for taxes of unseated lands in Pennsylvania—under the act of 1815 and other acts. We therefore naturally look to the requirements of the statute for the sale of unseated lands; and the law on this subject was that these lands should be advertised in their warrantee name, and that the number of acres either of the tract itself, or the number of acres of the tract to be sold as unseated, were to be stated in the advertisements. Now, in our opinion, in the present case, there is no such description of the premises in question as would be required in an advertisement for the sale of unseated lands—no sucli description as would enable a purchaser to know what he was buying—bidding on—at sale; nor is the evidence such as to justify the theory that the ownership of the defendant was so notorious and long continued as to amount to notice—identification of the property.</p>

The defendants hold the title under a regular chain of conveyances and are in possession as owners. They have a right to the verdict unless the title has been taken from them by virtue of the tax sale under which the plaintiff claims. This sale was made under the act of 1881, P. L. 45, and upon a collector’s return of the lot in controversy for the nonpayment of taxes assessed upon it as seated land. Two questions are raised, viz: the constitutionality of the act of 1881, and the sufficiency of the return made by the collector. The act of 1881 purports to be a general law, and provides that “ all taxes whether count3T, township, poor, school or municipal taxes” shall be a first lien on the real estate on which such taxes are assessed. It provides for the return of such lands upon nonpa3'rnent of the taxes and for their sale for the collection of the taxes unpaid. Cities of the first, second and fourth classes are excepted from its operations. Townships, boroughs and cities of the third class. remain under its operations. We thus have one system for the collection of taxes, <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>and for creating liens in one class of cities, and a different system in the other classes. The difference does not relate only or mainly to municipal taxes. It affects all the taxes levied by all the taxing officers. The collection of a county tax is not a municipal purpose. The same thing maybe said of school and poor taxes. Classification has been upheld for municipal purposes only. Legislation fora class of cities is only general and valid under our constitution, when it relates to some municipal purpose. If it does not affect the exercise of some municipal power, or the number, character, powers and duties of the municipal officers, or the regulation of some subject within the appropriate range of municipal control, the legislation is local and unconstitutional: Ruan Street, <a href="/pa/132/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="132 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="970573" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0257-01">132 Pa. 257</a> ; Ayars’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/122/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="122 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1948405" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0266-01">122 Pa. 266</a>: Meadville v. Dickson, <a href="/pa/129/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="129 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="568083" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0001-01">129 Pa. 1</a>; In re Wyoming Street, <a href="/pa/137/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="137 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="821485" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0494-01">137 Pa. 494</a>. The constitutional provisions involved in this inquiry are art. 3, sec. 57, which provides that no local or special law shall be passed “ authorizing the creation, extension or impairing of liens ; ” “ creating offices or prescribing the powers and duties of officers in counties, cities, boroughs, townships, election or school districts ; ” “ regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs or school districts.” Under the provisions of the act of 1881 unpaid county, school, township, and poor taxes are collected in one way in the county of Philadelphia, and in a very different way in the other counties of the state. In the county of Allegheny the collection of unpaid county taxes falls under the act of 1881 so far as the townships, boroughs and cities of the third class are concerned. In the cities of Pittsburg and Allegheny they do not. Thus two different methods are in force within the limits of the same county for dealing with county, school, poor and municipal taxes.</p>
    <p id="b183-5" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[181,1864,1167,324]]]'>This is so clearly in the face of the constitutional provisions referred to, and so destructive to that uniformity of procedure upon subjects of general iuterest which it is the object of the constitution to bring about and to preserve, that a simple statement of the necessary consequences of the enforcement of the act of 1881 renders an argument upon the constitutional question unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[181,2196,1166,138]]]'>But we concur with the learned trial judge upon the second question, viz : the sufficiency of the description of the lot sold in the collector’s return. The description is as follows :</p>
    <p id="b184-3" data-blocks='[["BL_184.3",184,[275,333,1166,84]]]'>
      <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>Owner, McGurk; street, Washington; ward, 2; Val. 62.; Co. tax .37; other taxes were carried out.</p>
    <p id="b184-4" data-blocks='[["BL_184.4",184,[265,429,1177,1670]]]'>The act of 1881 requires that the return shall contain a statement “ of each kind of tax so returned, the names of the parties assessed with the same, the year when such taxes were assessed, a sufficient description by boundaries or otherwise of each separate lot or tract and about the quantity of the same and the township or borough in which it is located, that the person making such return has a warrant for the collection of such taxes, and the date thereof, and that after a proper effort at the proper time he could not find sufficient personal property, by the legal sale of which, such taxes or any portion thereof could have been collected.” The return does not state the year when the taxes were assessed nor does it give any description of the lot which it is sought to charge with their payment. It is said in reply to this position that unseated land is sufficiently described by giving the number of the part and the name of the warrantee, and may be sold without other effort to describe the land. But the number and name of the person to whom the warrant issues are matter of record, and as there can be no actual occupancy of unseated land the records afford the only means for investigating the ownership. But a sale of unseated land made in the name of a warrantee who was not such in fact, and whose name was in no way connected with the recorded title, would not ordinarily pass the title. So in this ease. The name of McGurk afforded no help in locating the lot to be sold for he was in no way connected with the recorded title. He was not in possession, and as we understand the evidence he had at no time been in the actual, visible occupancy of the lot. Any lot on Washington street, in the Second ward, might be intended, so far as anything in the description would enable an intending purchaser to judge, or a lot owner to ascertain. If therefore the act of 1881 had been unobjectionable the collector did not follow its provisions, and his return was insufficient to authorize the sale of the lot for unpaid taxes. The assignments of error are overruled and judgment appealed from is now affirmed.</p>
