It is admitted that he has sustained some damage. The sole question, therefore, for your consideration is, to what extent was the property injured, or what is the amount of the damage to which the plaintiff is entitled. It is solely a question of fact for you to determine from all the testimony adduced on the trial. The only aid the court can give you in this matter is the standard of damages, or the rule of law as to the standard of damages, the measure of damages, which you should apply to the facts and circumstances of the case, as they have been given to you on the witness stand. It is the actual damage sustained to the property as a whole, that is, the difference between the market value before and the market value after the widening of the street. That is the true test by which you are to be governed. In other words, the difference between what it would have brought in the market before and what after the change in the street by reason of the widening. That difference is the actual loss sustained by the plaintiff in this case. The market price you will have to ascertain from the general selling price in the vicinity, and not fi’om particular sales. Everything which gave it intrinsic or real value before, and which gave it after the street was changed, should be taken into consideration by you when you come to estimate the amount of damage. You should, however, take into consideration the benefits, if any, to the property by reason of the borough improvement as to this street in mitigation or lessening of the damages.</p>

You will notice a difference as to the views of the actual damage. The plaintiff’s testimony fixes the damage at $1,000. One witness, I believe Mr. Gemperling, at $1,050. This was the judgment of some six witnesses. The defendant’s witnesses fix the damage from $50.00 to $100 and to $250, and, I believe, two wit<a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>nesses as high as $300 and $400, and Mr. Weidman from $400 to $500. These views of the witnesses, who are evidently good and estimable citizens of the borough of Ephrata, may all be honest views, honest opinions formed from their individual knowledge of real estate values in the vicinity of this street.</p>

You will remember that the plaintiff said he was offered $2,500 for the property some years before. That would not be evidence. What he said with reference to what it was ‘worth immediately before any improvements were made would be evidence. Therefore, jrou are not to consider what was offered for the property seven or eight jmars before. [The fair test is, what was the market value of this land, of this property before this street was widened and what was it worth after. And when I say “before,” I don’t mean just a day.or two before, but three, or five or six months before or afterwards.] [5] The difference between these market values will be the amount of the damage sustained, and that you will find from the evidence in the case.</p>

In the present case there was no opposing title, and as already said plaintiff was only bound to make out a prima facie case.</p>
    <p id="b453-3" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[196,544,1169,418]]]'>Plaintiff was a competent witness to prove his title. He was not claiming adversely to his deceased father. The statute does not make a claimant an incompetent witness merely because a former owner of the thing or contract in action is dead, but only when “his right thereto has passed to a party on the record who represents his interest.” The light of plaintiff’s father did not pass to the appellant borough, and the latter did not represent his interest in any way. Such interest, whatever it was, would be totally unaffected by this judgment.</p>
    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[199,970,1173,514]]]'>The answer of the witness Musser, contained in the fourth assignment was irregular and inadmissible, but it was not brought out by any improper question what he would give for the property, but was the witness’s own form of expressing his opinion of what the property was worth. It is doubtful if he meant anything more than that. It would have been more regular to have struck it out, but the record does not show any direct request to the judge to do so, but only an exception to the answer, for the form of which neither the appellee nor the court was responsible. It was a mere irregularity and we are not convinced that it did appellant any harm.</p>
    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.6",453,[202,1493,1171,844]]]'>The learned judge in commenting to the jury on a part of the evidence relating to the measure of damages, referred to the time of the taking, but added “I don’t mean just a day or two before, but three or five or six months before or after-wards.” This was an inaccurate, and no doubt an inadvertent expression, but taking it in connection with the context we do not think the jury could have been in any way misled by it. The proper rule had been carefully given to the jury in the early part of the charge. But the plaintiff in testifying had mentioned “ accidentally ” as the judge describes it, an offer for the property several years before. This, the jury were told explicitly was not evidence, and the judge again repeated the rule as to the value before and after the taking, and then added the words excepted to. In their connection we think they were merely intended and must have been so understood, to prevent the jury from considering too remote a time, and to confine their attention to a period at or about the taking. In that there was no error.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.3",454,[260,371,1168,273]]]'>
      <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>The last assignment is hypercritical. The witness expressed his judgment as to the amount of plaintiff’s damages, and was immediately cross-examined as to his estimate of values before and after the taking. The form of the question was somewhat irregular, but the substance of the testimony was competent and the error did no harm.</p>
    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[303,661,356,40]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
