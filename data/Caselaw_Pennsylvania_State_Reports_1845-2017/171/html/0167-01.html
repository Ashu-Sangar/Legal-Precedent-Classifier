Under all the evidence in the case, can there be a recovery here by this plaintiff against this borough? Whatever may be the plaintiff’s rights and remedies against <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>the contractor, has she a right to recover damages here from the borough of Hazleton ? It will be observed that the digging of this trench was not in any sense a public enterprise, not an undertaking in which all the people of the town were interested; but it was a private improvement to be made by Mr. Leisenring, a citizen of the borough of Hazleton, the benefits of which were to be enjoyed by him exclusively. He was the owner of the premises. His purpose was to connect them with a public drain or sewer, and he employed a contractor to do the work. Benjamin Rausch was this contractor, one of the defendants, the man who undertook to do this work. To authorize him to dig up this street, it was necessary that he procure from the proper municipal authority the right so to do. Ho went to the burgess of the borough and asked for a permit to connect Leiseuring premises with the sewer, and paid the usual fee therefor. [A permit or paper, signed by the burgess, was handed to him,] [1] and then he went on to do the work. Now, it becomes important in this case to ascertain whether this permit was sufficient to authorize a contractor like Mr. Rausch to go upon the highway and do what was done. One of the objections to this permit is that it mentions the wrong street; another is that it was granted by the burgess instead of the street commissioner; and thirdly that it was not correctly dated, but was procured on the morning of the accident and dated back—that being the allegation. We have given considerable attention to these questions, and have come to a conclusion on the subject as follows: [that the mistake in mentioning Church street in this paper was a clerical error, which is not fatal to its validity, under the testimony of Rausch, as to the manner of obtaining it and its purpose.] [2] It was granted by the burgess and not by the street commissioner. Under the ordinance of the borough of Hazleton, we are of opinion that it should have been granted by the street commissioner instead of the burgess; but we admitted testimony on this point, in the exercise of what we regarded as a fair discretion, to show that it had been the common—uniform practice, I may say, under the evidence, in this borough, to obtain permits for purposes similar to the one in this case, not from the street commissioner, but from the burgess.] [3] There is no evidence that in any case prior to this trial such permits have been issued by <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>the street commissioner; but there is evidence that in numerous cases like this similar permits have been issued to parties by the burgess. The permit was granted, then, under a misinterpretation of the meaning of an ordinance; but this interpretation was a possible one—in other words, it is possible so to read the ordinance in question as to mean what these people thought it meant, and furthermore, there is no fraud nor collusion in this respect alleged in the case, and therefore we hold that this certificate or permit, under the circumstances, was good and sufficient. On the other point, [as to whether it was correctly dated or not, or whether there has been any crookedness or fraud in the management of this part of the business, we simply say that we feel bound, under the evidence, to hold that there is no such testimony of actual fraud on this subject as would justify us in submitting that question to a jury ;] [4] nor in any view of the case is there any evidence in this connection that this permit was issued after the accident occurred, although it is shown that it was dated differently on the minute book from the date which appears on the face of the paper itself. Fraud is not to be presumed, but must be proved. We are compelled to this conclusion, that on this point there is not sufficient evidence of actual fraud in the case to submit that question of fact to the jury. But we accompany these remarks on this branch of the case with the further observation that, like much public business, the testimony shows that this was done in a slipshod, lax and very improper way; that it is not an example to be followed, but only to be avoided, in the transaction of public business.</p>

Section 3 of the ordinance in relation to streets and alleys provides that “ it shall not be lawful for any person, company, corporation or their employees to open, dig, or in any way disturb any street or alley without first applying to the street commissioner and obtaining a written permission for that purpose,” and makes it the duty of such commissioner to “ see that all persons to whom permits are so granted shall restore the street- or alley to as good condition as before being opened, dug or disturbed.” It is conceded that no permit was issued to Rausch under this <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>ordinance, but it is claimed that a permit was issued to him by the burgess under section 1 of the ordinance in regard to building permits, which authorized him to dig the ditch.</p>
    <p id="b193-3" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[191,538,1174,1087]]]'>The learned court below thought that to authorize an opening in the street of this character the borough ordinance required that the written permission of the street commissioner should be first obtained, but, inasmuch as the burgess testified that it was his habit and the habit of his predecessor in office to issue permits to make such openings, the ditch must be regarded as dug under a valid municipal license. The permit issued by the burgess and relied on to legalize the work done by Rausch at the intersection of Fern and Laurel streets simply allowed him to lay a drain on Church street, but, as he testified that it was given on his verbal application for leave to dig a ditch at the former place, the insertion of the words “ Church street ” was considered as a clerical mistake, and the permit as containing a license to do the work complained of. It should'be stated in connection with the foregoing reference to the testimony and the conclusions of the court that the ordinance which authorized the burgess to issue permits required that he should describe in them the place where the work was to be performed, and that he occasionally delegated his power under it to a policeman. It also required that the permit should be obtained before the commencement of the work, while the evidence in this case would fairly sustain an inference that the permit in question was issued after the accident.</p>
    <p id="b193-4" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[196,1634,1170,666]],["BL_194.1",194,[258,352,1165,947]]]'>We agree with the learned court below that under the ordinances of the borough Rausch was bound to obtain from the street commissioner written permission to dig the ditch before proceeding to do so, but we cannot concur in its conclusion that a permit from the burgess to lay a drain on Church street authorized him to dig a ditch at the intersection of Fern and Laurel streets. The burgess was not empowered by any ordinance to grant a permit to any person, company or corporation to open, dig or in any way disturb any street or alley within the borough, but, as we have already seen, the power to do so was expressly committed to the street commissioner. If the burgess was in the habit of assuming and exercising powers not vested in him but plainly delegated to another, such habit may be considered as a violation of the borough ordinances but <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>not as a nullification of them. No number of violations of them will constitute or establish a custom or usage which the law will recognize as of any validity. We cannot therefore regard the evidence in relation to the habit of the burgess, and of his predecessor in office, as a warrant for giving to the permit in question the effect of a permit issued in accordance with section 3 of the ordinance which declares it to be unlawful for any person, company or corporation to open, dig or in any way disturb any street or alley in the borough without a written permission from the street commissioner. The validity of this ordinance is not questioned and the work done by Rausch was in contravention of it. In digging the sewer ditch without the written permission of the street commissioner he was a trespasser, aud if his work rendered the street unsafe for ordinary travel it was the duty of the borough authorities, having actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition created by him, to take proper measures to protect the public against it. In ojther words a municipality cannot tolerate unlawful and dangerous obstructions on its streets and claim exemption from liability for injuries caused by them.</p>
    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[257,1307,1163,424]]]'>The cases cited to sustain the borough’s contention that it is not liable to the plaintiff for the injury she received in consequence of the work done by Rausch, are not applicable to the facts of this case. They are cases in which the work was done under a contract with or license from the municipality, while in this case the work was done without its permission and in violation of its laws. We see no occasion, and we are not disposed, to go a hair’s breadth beyond them in relaxing the supervision by a municipality of the streets within it.</p>
