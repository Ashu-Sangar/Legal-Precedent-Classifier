On the other hand I think there can be no doubt that they are such fixtures that they become tlie property of the land owner if not removed by the lessee during the term, or at least within a reasonable time after its expiration. These two propositions are both, of course, subject to modification by the agreement of the parties. Are they modified in this case? because, if they are not, then the defendants had no right to enter upon the plaintiffs’ land for the purpose of removing tlie fixtures in question.

The lease was for a fixed period to be extended to an indefinite period, and the extension to depend upon what the future might develop. [The right to enter at any time and the right to remove machinery at any time was predicated of that part of the term that was uncertain, that is, after three years the lessee had the right at any time to enter and drill additional wells, if oil or gas was being produced in paying quantities;] [l] and had the right, although the three years had passed, to remove the machinery and fixtures after or when the well would cease to produce oil or gas in paying quantities.</p>

Here the lessees, if oil or gas had been found in paying quantities, would have had a reasonable time within which to draw their casing and remove their derricks after it had become apparent that the operation of the wells was no longer profitable, let this he soon or long after the expiration of the three years ; [at any time when they thought it would no longer pay to operate their wells which had been producing oil or gas in paying quantities they had a rig-ht to remove the fixtures connected with such wells.] [2]</p>
