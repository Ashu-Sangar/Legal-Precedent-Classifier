The estimates thus made by the engineer were to be final and conclusive as to both parties, subject to the right of the president to revise and alter them. As the work progressed estimates were furnished monthly by the engineer and the amounts appearing by them to be due were paid, except the amount of the last estimate. This estimate like the preceding one showed the total allowances and payments, and the principal question at the trial was whether it was a final estimate and fixed the rights of the parties. The plaintiff’s contention was that as it had been furnished after the completion of the work and not revised or altered by the president, it was a final estimate and conclusive upon the defendant company, and that it was incompetent for the engineer afterwards to submit a revised or second final estimate.</p>

Whether however the estimate furnished was a final estimate was an open question at the trial. In form it was not a final estimate, nor such an estimate as was contemplated by the agreement. It was not intended to show the balance due under the completed contract, but the work done during the preceding month and the amount due for it less the retained percentage. It was similar in form to the preceding monthly estimates, and was made as they had been at the end of the month to show the amount óf work done since the last estimate. It was but one of the series of monthly statements for which the agreement called, and was final only in the sense that it was the last in date and was made after the completion of the work. By agreement of the parties, expressed or implied from theit acts, this estimate might have become a final one, but neither party could arbitrarily make it such.

The fact that the engineer was in the employ of the defendant did not commit it to the consequences of his misconduct while acting as an arbiter for both parties, and an award which was the result of collusion with the plaintiff was not binding upon it. The proof of the offer would have shown that the award upon which the plaintiff relied was not only an unjust award, obtained by unfair means and the result of misconduct and collusion, but that it was not intended as a final award.</p>
