L. 282, which declares, inter alia, that “ no bill shall be passed finally in either branch upon the same day on which it was introduced or reported.”</p>

It is conceded that the bill in question was introduced in select council on March 27, 1890. On that day it was referred to the committee on highways and sewers, composed of members of both branches of council, and ordered to be printed. On March 31 following, it was favorably reported back to select council, and on same day it was considered and finally passed by that body and forthwith messaged to the common council, which on same day took up and finally passed the ordinance. It thus appears that the bill, originating in select council, was properly referred, favorably reported, etc., and afterwards, on the fourth day after its introduction, taken up and finally passed by that body. In this, there was no want of compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of the act; but, as to the proceeding in common council, <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>it was very different. Ou the same day that the ordinance was messaged or reported to that body it was taken up, considered and finally passed. This was done in manifest disregard of the legislative mandate that “ no bill shall be passed finally in either branch upon the same day on which it was introduced or reported.” This mandate applies with equal force to both branches of council, that in which a bill has been first introduced as well as the other branch to which it has been messaged or reported after it has been finally acted on by the former. Any other construction of the clause would ignore the plain intent thereof, as clearly expressed in unambiguous words, and defeat the manifest purpose of the act, which was to prevent hasty, inconsiderate and vicious legislation. In employing the language above quoted the legislature evidently intended to absolutely prohibit the final passage of any bill or ordinance by either branch of councils ou the same day upon which it was introduced or reported in said branch. The wisdom of the prohibition, or limitation on the authority of councils, has been demonstrated by experience, and the law should be rigidly enforced, notwithstanding the alleged fact that councils, in this case, may have acted on erroneous advice as to the scope of their power in the premises. No such saving clause can be found in the act, and its interpolation, by strained construction or otherwise, would be not only unauthorized but exceedingly dangerous.</p>

The cases are widely different.

A proper degree of deference is due by each department to each of the others.
