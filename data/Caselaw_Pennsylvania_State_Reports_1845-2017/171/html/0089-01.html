On March 11, 1888, in response to a telegram from Mason, he went to New York to assist in completing the framing of contracts for building the line, at which he worked from 16th to 19th of March, and then, accompanied by one Hopkins, the principal contract- or, he went to Philadelphia and called upon Norris, another of defendants; in <em>the </em>conversation with reference to the work between him and Norris, the latter denied Mason’s authority to make the agreement of January 23,1888, and asked Rice to accept compensation for his work out of the expected profits of the enterprise; this Rice peremptorily declined to do, and declared he would hold the syndicate or copartners to the terms of the Mason agreement with him. He afterwards met both Norris and Jackson in Philadelphia and New York, and assisted in' the preparation of the construction contract, which on March 26, was duly executed. In the meantime, on March 21, Rice received from Jackson $125, on account of expenses, which Jackson said had been given him for that purpose by Norris. Soon afterwards Mason went to London for the purpose of negotiating a loan to be expended in the construction of the railway, and to aid him took with him all the papers prepared and obtained by Rice in furtherance of the enterprise. As a fact found by the referee, Rice had no knowledge of the terms of the partnership agreement of 29th of December, 1887, when he entered into the agreement with Mason of January 23,1888.</p>

The parties then referred all matter’s in controversy to N. Dubois Miller, Esq., under the act of 1874. From the facts, the referee’s conclusions of law were : 1. The syndicate agreement constituted a contract of partnership. 2. The limitations of the agreement upon the authority of the partners to contract indebtedness in behalf of the partnership were binding upon the plaintiff. 3. Norris is not liable upon the contract sued upon. 4. He is not liable to plaintiff in assumpsit.</p>

      <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>On the report coming into court, exceptions were filed to the referee’s conclusions of law, which the court sustained, and entered judgment for plaintiff for the amount of his claim, from which judgment G. Heide Norris brings this appeal, assigning seventeen errors. As to the referee’s findings of facts, they are fully warranted by the evidence, and we adopt them. All the other assignments of error are disposed of by a determination of the correctness of the conclusions of law arrived at by the referee and the court below.</p>
    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[197,815,1174,1180]]]'>In support of his second conclusion, that the limitation on Mason’s authority to contract for the partnership of which he was a member also bound Rice, the referee draws the distinction between the answerability of the principal for the contracts of a general agent, and his answerability for those of his special or personal agent. As to the first, such as factors and those of like character, who hold themselves out to the public as general agents for all who choose to employ them, third parties dealing with them have a right to assume that within the scope of the business intrusted to them there are no secret limitations on their authority. But it is otherwise as to one whose calling is not public, and who is merely employed by the principal to conduct the particular business out of which grows the contract sued upon ; in this last case, it is the duty of the party dealing with such agent for the first time to know the extent of the agent’s authority; if without knowing it, he contracts with such agent, then he assumes the risk of disaffirmance of the authority of the agent by the principal, if the agent have exceeded that authority. This, in substance, is a correct statement by the referee of the law applicable to principals and agents. If Mason had been a mere agent of the partnership, he would have had no authority except such as his principal conferred upon him, and any third person, dealing with him for the first time, would have been bound to ascertain from the terms of his appointment the extent of his authority.</p>
    <p id="b115-6" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[207,2004,1168,279]],["BL_116.1",116,[259,354,1168,377]]]'>But Mason was not a mere agent; he was a member of the copartnership formed to carry to completion an important business project. Are secret restrictions upon the authority of a partner, who acts within the scope of the partnership business, binding upon third parties? The learned referee concedes they are not as to purely commercial enterprises, but is of opin<a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>ion the rule is not applicable to noncommercial partnerships such as the one in question, and a note to Parsons on Partnerships, 4th edition, p. 86, is cited as follows: “ As to acts within the scope of the partnership, a fundamental distinction exists between commercial or trading partnerships and nontrading partnerships, arising out of the fact that in a nontrading partnership there is no general power in the partners to do such acts, as are customary in carrying on business.”</p>
    <p id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[255,739,1171,845]]]'>This is a correct statement of the general rule, directly traceable to the law merchant; and the power of one partner to bind his copartners was long confined to strictly trading partnerships; yet, in recent years, there have been many departures from it, not only in England, but in this country. The reason for the general rule is stated bj*- Chief Justice Marshall in Winship v. Bank, 5 Peters, 561: “ This is a general power essential to the well conducting of business, which is implied in the existence of a partnership. When, then, a partnership is formed for a particular purpose, it is understood to be in itself a grant of power to the acting members of the company to transact its business in the usual way. This is a general authority held out to the world, to which the world has a right to trust. The articles of copartnership are perhaps never published. They are rarely if ever seen except by the partners themselves. The stipulations they may contain are to regulate the conduct and rights of the parties as between themselves.”</p>
    <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.5",116,[254,1602,1170,665]],["BL_117.1",117,[170,428,1175,1616]]]'>The rule and the reason for it had their origin in an age when trading partnerships formed the large majority of business ventures. Now, when manufacturing, mining and carrying enterprises have reached such large numbers and proportions the same reasons necessarily invoke the same rule ; its rigorous confinement at first to trading enterprises, on grounds of public policjr, should give way to the necessity of its application to other kinds of business which now affect the public interests as seriously as trade and commerce. In Hawkins v. Bourne, 8 M. &amp; W. 703, the case of a joint stock company formed to work a mine, the work was carried on by directois for the benefit of other persons; the defendant was a partner in the operation under an agreement that the directors were to buy only for cash, and not to contract upon credit; the plain<a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>tiff supplied goods on orders of the resident agent without knowledge of the secret stipulation. Parker, B., says: “There was evidence that he (defendant) was a complete partner with the directors in working the mines in the manner they were worked; and one partner, by virtue of that relation, is constituted a general agent for another as to all matters within the general scope of the partnership dealings, and has communicated to him, by virtue of that relation, all authorities necessary for carrying on the partnership, and all such as are generally-exercised by partners in that business in which they are engaged. Any restriction which, by agreement amongst the partners, is attempted to be imposed upon the authority which one possesses as a general agent for another, is operative only between the partners themselves, and does not limit the authority as to third persons, who acquire rights by its exercise, unless they know that such restriction has been made.” The rule thus applied to a coal mining partnership is in substance the law merchant rule applicable to trading partnerships. And Williams, J., says, in Hoskinson v. Eliot, <a href="/pa/62/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="62 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="1017216" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0393-01">62 Pa. 393</a>, the ease of a brick manufacturing partnership: “But while it is conceded that this is the law as applicable to commercial partnerships, it is insisted it does not apply to partnerships formed for mechanical or manufacturing purposes. But no such distinction is suggested or recognized in any of the adjudicated cases or text books, and there is no foundation for it in the necessities or usages of these partnerships. The necessity for borrowing money to carry on the business of a manufacturing partnership may be as great as it is in order to carry on the business of one that is strictly commercial.” While here the assertion that no distinction is recognized or suggested in the adjudicated cases is perhaps too broad, the ground which would warrant a distinction, the necessity of the contract for the promotion of the partnership business, is put forth as the real reason for the application of the rule for the protection of third parties.</p>
    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[177,2053,1170,232]]]'>In view of the undisputed facts before us, is there any reason for applying a different rule to the contracts of this partnership than to those of a trading partnership ? The partnership was that of a railroad construction company; a business as common, almost, as railroad building itself.</p>
    <p id="b117-6" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[224,2294,1121,39]],["BL_118.1",118,[279,404,1170,1385]]]'>What is the nature of the partnership ? By their agreement, <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>they say it is a syndicate to promote the construction of the Paducah &amp; Mt. Vernon Railway; in other words, a construction company; a cash capital of §25,000 is to be contributed by the partners. Mason is to be the active partner “ to take charge of the general business of the syndicate ; ” attend to correspondence, contracts and subsidies, procure rights of way, terminals and such aids as shall be for the benefit of the Paducah &amp; Mt. Vernon Railway, and attend to the marketing of its bonds. Obviously the profits of the partnership were to be realized from the sale of the securities, the bonds and stock of the road; the capital provided, §25,000, would not construct the road ; this was doubtless intended for preliminary surveys and expenses; to advance the enterprise a single step towards success, the very services contracted for by plaintiff must be performed by somebody; no bond could be marketed, no share of stock sold with a railway line onty in the air; the line must be first run and located on the ground, rights of way and terminals secured, before the railway could have an existence, except on paper. Not only was the work to be done by Rice within the scope of the partnership enterprise, but it was an absolute necessity to its birth; therefore, the authority to Mason, one of the partners, to make a reasonable contract with Rice which should bind the partnership was a necessary implication from his relation to his copartners ; Rice had a right to rely on this authority and contract with him. The referee has found as a fact that he knew nothing of any restriction on Mason’s authority; this being so, he is not bound by it, for as long as Mason acted within the scope of his powers there was nothing to put him upon inquiry.</p>

The authority to a partner is to make contracts for the promotion of the partnership business, not to contract to make gifts to servants of the firm ; such an obligation is not within the scope of his authority to impose upon his copartners. Although the services for which payment is sought under this <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>contract were performed in the preliminaries to the construction of this railway, the contract, either express or implied, on which they rested, was with wholly different parties ; Rice was therefore bound to know that Mason without express authority could not make his copartners answerable for the debt of others.</p>
