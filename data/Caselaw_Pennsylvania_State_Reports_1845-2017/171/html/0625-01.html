    <p class="summary" id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.5",645,[198,507,1178,696]]]'>The course that we feel compelled under the law as we find it recorded in the books to take in this case renders it unnecessary that we should listen to any further argument upon it. The legal questions have been very thoroughly discussed, almost from the commencement of the action down to the present time. We have been compelled somewhat reluctantly to come to the conclusion in the case that the libellant cannot recover against the respondent a verdict in this case ; that the evidence is insufficient. Under our act of assembly, as it was passed in 1815, it was provided that “ when any husband shall have by cruel and barbarous treatment, endangered his wife’s life, or offered such indignities to her person as to render her condition intolerable and life burdensome, and thereby force her to withdraw from his house and family,” she can obtain from him a divorce.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.6",645,[205,1222,1175,412]]]'>Now that act of assembly applied to the wife. It provided that “ whenever the husband, by cruel and barbarous treatment shall endanger his wife’s life, or shall offer such indignities to her person as to render her condition intolerable and life burdensome, and thereby force her to withdraw from his house and family/’ she was entitled to a divorce. But it made no provision whatever for the husband, by which he could obtain a divorce from his wife for any such cause. It applied simply to tiie wife.</p>

And that act of assembly—the part of it we think important—we will read: “ Where the wife shall have by cruel and barbarous treatment, rendered the condition of her husband intolerable or life burdensome,” etc. Now you will observe that the act of 1815 gives the wife the right to obtain a divorce wherever the husband shall have by cruel and barbarous treatment, endangered the wife’s life, or offered such indignities to her person, as to fender her condition intolerable and life burdensome, she might obtain a divorce, but when the legislature came to apply the remedy to the husband they <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>stopped short of saying that he should be entitled to obtain a divorce on account of indignities to the person. It simply gave him a right to a divorce where the wife by cruel and barbarous treatment, had rendered the condition of her husband intolerable or life burdensome. No matter how great the indignities she might offer to his person, he would not be entitled to a divorce.</p>

L. 644, unless he showed that her treatment of him endangered his life. While this was his view of the law governing the case he considered that the respondent had done all she could to render the condition of the libellant “ miserable and wretched,” and that it would be better for them and the public if they were divorced. In short the learned judge would have 'gladly submitted the case to the jury if he had believed the evidence was sufficient to carry it there, and he would have done so in the hope of a verdict that would have authorized a severance of the marital relation between the parties. These conclusions are drawn from the charge in which the reasons for a peremptory instruction to the jury to find for the respondent were clearly stated. While we do not question the soundness of his views respecting the conduct of the respondent we cannot concur in his construction of the statute under which the proceeding was instituted. This statute expressly authorizes the court of common pleas of the proper county to grant a divorce on the application of the husband where his wife has by cruel and barbarous treatment of him rendered his condition intolerable or life burdensome. The cruel and barbarous treatment mentioned in the statute includes acts which endanger life but it is not restricted to them. It is sufficient that the wife’s treatment of her husband renders his condition intolerable and his life burdensome: Jones v.

In the case before us the libel as amended conforms to the provisions of the statute under which the proceeding was instituted, and the material averments in it are flatly denied by the answer. The respondent desiring to have the issue thus formed tried by a jury it was so ordered by the court and’ a trial was had which resulted as above stated.</p>
    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.8",649,[210,2197,1176,92]],["BL_650.1",650,[254,351,1178,562]]]'>We do not deem it necessary to consider separately each specification which calls in question the rulings upon offers of <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>evidence. These rulings appear to have been influenced by a construction which as we have already seen was erroneous. We think it is clear that in cases of this character whatever directly tends to show a course of treatment which renders the condition of the libellant intolerable and his life burdensome is admissible. We think too that in determining whether there was cruel and barbarous treatment within the meaning of the statute the whole conduct of the wife toward her husband during the period of the alleged ill treatment should be considered, and that evidence descriptive of it should be received. Neither the court nor the jury can intelligently and justly dispose of the case without the assistance which such evidence affords.</p>
    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.4",650,[253,930,1177,368]]]'>We are not prepared to say that any error was committed in the ruling complained of in the first specification. The rejected offer suggests a line of inquiry which might create distinctions and produce results not within the letter or spirit of the statute. Besides, we agree with the learned trial judge that it was for the jury and not for the libellant to say whether his condition was rendered intolerable and his life burdensome by the treatment he received from his wife.</p>
    <p id="b650-6" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[252,1315,1177,225]]]'>To the extent that the rulings complained of are in conflict with the views herein expressed regarding the construction of the act of 1854 and the evidence relevant and material to the issue, the specifications are sustained. Judgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded.</p>
