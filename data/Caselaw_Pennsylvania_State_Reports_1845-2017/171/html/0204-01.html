The insured house and all the loose or personal property contained therein was destroyed by fire on the night of the 20th of May, 1893. Shortly thereafter, according to the evidence of Mr. Carey and his wife, he notified Mr. Boone, from whom he said he received the policy and paid the money for the insurance, of the total loss, and a short time after that he met Mr. Paine, who, it is agreed, was the agent of the defendant company. I shall not attempt to go over what transpired between Mr. Carey and his wife on the one side and Mr. Paine upon the other. You will remember the evidence as to what, if anything, Mr. Paine stated was his purpose in coming to Kingston for the purpose of examining or adjusting this loss. What was said and done at the first meeting? There were throe meetings. [At the second it appears that at the request of Mr. Paine a schedule or list of articles destroyed by the fire, and their prices, or their value, at least, was made out and given to Mr. Paine, and he took it with him. That was the last meeting before the sixty days expired. At that meeting, according to the testimony of Mrs. Carey, she said: “ I gave him the list. <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>I asked him if we had anything more to do there, and he said no, we could go home. He took the list.” That list of itself is not evidence as to the value of the property, or, in other words, the plaintiff could not make evidence for himself in that way as to the value of the property; it was only admitted in evidence by the court for the purpose of submitting the question to the jury whether it was evidence of a waiver—whether that conduct upon the part of the agent of the company was a waiver of the right which the company had to stand upon the terms of its policy.] [1]</p>

[As stated by both gentlemen in this case, the question for you to ascertain from the preponderance of the credible evidence in this case is, Did the company, who had the right to stand upon the terms of its policy, waive that stipulation ?] [3] [If you believe the evidence in this case, you may find as a fact that the company did waive their right to stand upon this stipulation in the policy.] [4]</p>

No reply was made until shortly before suit was brought against the company. Then, according to the evidence of Mr. Gibbons, Mr. Paine stated that the company did not recognize this proof of loss because it had been made too late, that is, after the sixty days set in the policy had expired.</p>

The formal proofs of loss having been made out and sent to and received by the company after the sixty days, if the company intended to rely upon another defense, to wit: that the proofs of loss had not been furnished in time, it was their duty to say so. It would be nothing more than fair dealing between man and man, and they are bound <em>to </em>stand by it. It was their duty, if they intend to rely upon that defense, to so notify McLean and Gibbons. If you determine that they did receive that proof of loss and made no reply or made no objection to the proof until in October, you may conclude that they waived the right to require the proof of loss should be furnished in sixty days, and accepted the formal proof furnished even at that late date. The company cannot play fast and loose more than any other person.</p>

The policy required that the proofs of loss be furnished to the insurer within sixty days after the fire, while tho fact is that they were not furnished until ninety-six days after that time. Compliance with this requirement of the policy was a condition precedent to suit upon it, and the failure to furnish the proofs within the stipulated time is, standing by itself and unexplained, a sufficient answer to the plaintiff’s demand. But it is alleged that the company waived the stipulation in regard to the proofs in what was said and done by its agent and adjuster in the interviews he had with Mr. and Mrs. Carey soon after the fire. It appeared that on the 12th of June, 1893, he obtained from the plaintiff a written statement under oath in relation to the fire, the size of the house, the nature of the business carried on in it, and the title to the lot on which it was erected ; and that two days thereafter he procured from him a list, prepared by his wife, of the articles destroyed, together with an estimate of the value of each of them. The statement and list were furnished to the adjuster on his request, and after <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>they were delivered to him he said in substance that there was nothing more for the insured to do.

The company denies the alleged waiver and estoppel, and insists that there is no evidence in the case which warrants an inference of either, but our examination of the evidence has failed to convince us that the court erred in submitting these questions to the jury.</p>

The jury, however, were instructed that if the company received formal proof of the loss on the 24th of August—ninety-six days after the fire—and did not object until October that it was furnished too late, they might conclude that the sixty days limit was waived. The instruction was broad enough to,allow the jury to find a waiver from the single circumstance mentioned in it, and in this case they may have based their verdict upon it. If the plaintiff lost his right to maintain an action on the policy by his neglect to furnish the proof of loss within the time stipulated in it something more was required to reinvest him with that light than the delay referred to.
