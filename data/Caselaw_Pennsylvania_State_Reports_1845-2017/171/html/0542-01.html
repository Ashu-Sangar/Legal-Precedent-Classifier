Daniel Leet had only marked the four central squares as public squares. On the 11th of March, 1793, the governor, through his secretary, directed the surveyor general as follows: “ The governor directs me to inform you, that besides the lots marked <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>public square, he deems it expedient to reserve for public uses lots Nos. 1, 20, 21, 22,155,156 and 15S, and you will be pleased accordingly to mark official entry thereon on the original survey in your office.” This was accordingly done, and on the 12th of March, 1798, the governor issued his commission to sell, so that the four lots in the center and the corner lots of the town plot marked “ public squares ” shall be reserved as lands deemed necessary for public uses and reserved by the governor accordingly. And under these acts and the action of the governor, and in accordance with this town plot made by Daniel Leet, approved by the general assembly and by the governor, the lots so laid out in the town of Beaver were sold. The streets were laid out on a plan parallel with the Ohio river, to wit: Front, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth; and Beaver, Elk, Market, Raccoon and Buffalo at right angles thereto. Each of said streets was laid out and marked on said plan as being one hundred feet in width, except that Fifth street, the northern boundary, and Buffalo street, the western boundary, are marked on the plot as being two hundred feet in width. Between each , of these streets equi-distant were laid out and marked alleys of twenty-five feet in width. The northeast block of lots and the northwest block are marked in plan “ public square,” and were not sold. The portion lying bounded on the north by Turnpike alley, on the east by Insurance alley, on the south by Corporation alley, and on the west by Commerce alley, divided into four squares by Third street running east and west, and Market street running north and south, each of which on the plan is marked “ public square,” were reserved for public use and not sold. Each of these public squares is three hundred feet, running north and south, and three hundred and sixty feet east and west, exclusive of streets and alleys.</p>

In 1876 a new courthouse was built on a different part of the same square. The jail, however, in 1856, was removed to other property. By act of March 29, 1824, the trustees of the Presbyterian church were authorized to occupy a portion of the southwest square, not exceeding one quarter of an acre, for a church, and a building was erected and used in accordance with this grant, but which has recently been abandoned and a new church built on property outside of the public square.

The town of Beaver seems to have had a very gradual growth. As originally marked out on paper it was a magnificent plan, having very fine, wide streets and large, deep lots. Nevertheless, as in so many towns in western Pennsylvania, the fashion was to build houses out to the line of the street, and rather than lose land in front, the owner preferred running the risk of building a little over on the street, so that the front of the houses were built, as a rule, on or near the street line. When there were porches erected they were frequently built out on the street.</p>

An occasional proprietor, in the business part of town—if it may be said to have had such a portion— might have had a small pavement of brick in front for his own <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>accommodation; but the man who had a cinder walk in front of his residence on the street was entitled to be considered a citizen of unusual public spirit and enterprise. The public squares were unsightly places, in fact, nuisances. And up until 1883 the lot owners, so far as the occupying and using these alleys or making any pavements or improvements was concerned, were very much like Israel of old, “ without a king, and every man did that which was right in his own eyes.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[244,752,1170,953]]]'>A municipal revolution occurred in the election of 1882, and a. borough council was elected on the question of municipal improvements, and .those in favor thereof were in the majority. The council so elected passed ordinances enacting that sidewalks be laid on Third street from the eastern to the western boundary and paid for by the property owners. And they, also, it would appear from the testimony—although the ordinances were not produced, the testimony shows they were passed— enacted that sidewalks of brick or stone should be laid on the four alleys bounding the central public squares, at a like expense. It seems that this gave rise to very serious opposition, and a distinguished lawyer (now deceased) and a property holder, opposite one of these public squares, resisted the matter in court, and personally declared he would not submit to have brick sidewalks placed in front of his residence. In time, however, he became reconciled and of his own accord put down a sidewalk. The resistance to these enactments of council was so great that the sidewalks on these alleys were not laid of either a uniform grade or a uniform width, or to uniform places on the alley.</p>

A grade was fixed and the street was graded in accordance with this ordinance.</p>

The borough authorities, apparently by general consent, having undertaken to improve the streets, began to grade and work on these wide streets, and the traveled portion—sidewalks included—through the town is from forty to fifty feet, except as before stated as to Third street. The portions lying between the sidewalks and the property line is left in grass, and has upon it fine shade trees varying in age. But this unpaved portion lying between the improved portion of the street and the property line, with its grassy plots and shade trees, has become a prominent feature of the town; and this class of improvement has changed it from an unsightly, slovenly kept, place, as it was thirty years ago, until it is really a very beautiful town.</p>

While the sidewalk laid may have been less than nine feet in width, nevertheless the owners of the property there had planted a line of shade trees on Commerce alley outside of the center from their <em>property </em>line ,• and the curb as set in 1883,. by the plaintiff or those under whom he claims, is thirteen and one half feet from the property line, leaving only eleven and one half feet from the curb to the outside of the street.

The grading of Third street at this point to the depth before stated necessarily carries with it the grading of Commerce alley to accommodate it to that grade, and if damage is done to the plaintiff by that grade, it is a part of the necessary damage resulting from the change of grade at his property on Third street, on which his property fronts.</p>

He did accompany them, and in such a tour of investigation, at their request, has endeavored to make himself familiar, by sight, with the surroundings. First, as to Turnpike alley: Private property or lot owners on the opposite northwest square, namely, “the courthouse square,” are, on the west Mr. Laird; next comes Judge Agnew, and next on market street Judge Hice, each having lots one hundred and twenty feet in width and running back three hundred feet or more. Opposite the northeast square the property is occupied very much in the same way. The houses were originally set out, either the house line or with the porch to the extreme of the lot limit, unless it be the house occupied by Judge Agnew, which is now a short distance back from the street. Mr. Laird’s house was built probably fifty years ago or more out to the street line, and the porch over the street or alley line, and has so continued. At the other corner, occupied by Judge Hice, <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>the house was so originally built; now a new house stands back from the street. Also, at the northeast square some of the houses have their porches built over on the street, and have long been so occupied. Opposite the courthouse square a row of trees—maple, catalpa and horse-chestnut—were planted at least forty years ago, at a distance of fifteen feet from the property line. They have grown to be very considerable trees. Since those trees were planted the driveway has been outside of those trees, leaving fifteen feet between the property line and the line of trees for foot travel and for ornament. Along this line were some of the earliest improvements of the borough, in the way of a cinder walk; but some twelve or fifteen years ago the three owners joined together of their own accord and put -down a neat brick pavement at their own expense between the property line and this first row of trees, leaving about six feet between the sidewalk and the row of trees. The travel by vehicle was then outside of this fifteen feet—or with the growth of the trees almost sixteen feet—leaving only nine or ten feet for a roadway. At an average of about twenty-two feet from the first line there was a second row of trees on the public square. The line of travel by vehicles then lay in part between this row of trees, sixteen feet from the property line, and the row on the public square, being of the average width of about twenty-two feet, and almost necessarily has been in part on the public square ; and until recently there was nothing to prevent horses and vehicles from going any place on the public square. And the weight of the testimony is that for a considerable length of time the larger portion of the travel was wholly on the public square. Opposite the northeast square, on Turnpike alley, at least two porches were out on the alley, and in addition a row of trees run along the entire front, out so far as to drive vehicle travel almost entirely on the square. These trees were planted by private owners, and nobody seems to have objected. Shade trees on the streets and in front of properties seem to be a feature of Beaver town, which the people are generally satisfied with and of which they are justly proud. In fact, the warmest opponents of the action of council would be unwilling to have these trees removed, and claim that they are not a -nuisance and should not be removed.</p>

And, being anxious to improve and beautify the town, and especially these public squares and their surroundings, they undertook in their discretion to leave these trees and to construct a driveway on the public square in front of Turnpike alley of about eighteen feet in width and a paved sidewalk of about six feet; thus constructing driveways so as to avoid the necessity of taking out these trees and so as to make a reasonable and commodious driveway around the entire central public squares, a distance of over half a mile. On Commerce alley the old curb line was thirteen feet from the property line, and of that thirteen feet a portion was occupied by a brick pavement and a portion a grassy plot, with trees close to the curb line, leaving twelve feet for a driveway. The plan on which the borough council have acted is to make the curb line eighteen' feet from the property line, and a driveway on the balance of the twenty-five feet of Commerce alley, and in part on the public square, the driveway to. be twenty feet in width, seven feet on a part of the alley and thirteen feet on the public square. On Corporation alley side a driveway of twenty feet, the larger portion of which would be on the public square ; and on Insurance alley a driveway of twenty feet, of which about twelve and one half feet would be within the lines of Insurance alley and seven and one half feet, taken fro in the public square.</p>

There has certainly been no legal vacation or closing of any of these alleys. As to the encroachment by private persons upon the alleys, it is sufficient to say in regard to all that testimony, if any claim of right is based On the long, uninterrupted, continuous acts of encroachment by the lot owners and acquiescence by the public, that it is not sufficient to raise any question as to right. The right of the public to the alleys is unimpaired thereby. The defendants-<a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>have not by any act of theirs closed these alleys further than by the curbing and footwalk on Market street at Turnpike alley, and at the junction corners of Commerce and Insurance alleys. On Turnpike alley the curb is so sot and the pavement so laid that vehicle travel would be impeded thereby. The principal obstruction to travel, aside from the trees and the sidewalks, is one erected by Mr. Laird across Turnpike alley at the junction with Commerce, at which place he has an iron railing. According to the testimony, that is an erection by Mr. Laird, without any authority of councils, without their consent, but of his own private motion, and if a nuisance, as it certainly is, it is removable as any other nuisance erected by a private party.</p>

The weight of the testimony is that it does not, but on the contrary will benefit his property. The damage to his property, as before stated, comes from the grading and improving of Third street, which is already done and for which he has had an award of damages. The grading of Commerce alley, we have already found, is a necessary consequence. My own judgment, on an inspection of the property in company with the owner and the attorneys would be, that the change of grade on Third street already made and settled, makes necessary the change of grade on Commerce alley; that the changes the council propose to make is not only a detriment, but it will add very considerably to the market value of the property. As to his property fronting on Corporation alley, at the corner of Commerce alley, the testimony is in equilibrio. I would be unable to find, as a matter of fact, that it was damaged. And the same thing would be true of his other property; but if damaged he would have legal redress to recover damages. Further, that while in our opinion the question for the court to decide is one of power in the councils, not one of discretion, yet as a higher court may have a different opinion, we find as a fact that the proposed making of these driveways around and in part on the public square will be an improvement to the public squares and of general public bene<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>fit to the town, and we are unable to see that there is, in fact, any private detriment to be suffered by the lot owners, but to a great extent it will not only be beneficial to the public, if carried out, but will add to the value of the properties on the alleys ■and fronting these squares.</p>
