This is a question of fact to be decided by the jury under the evidence in the case.] [1] It is the duty of township authorities to keep roads in good order and repair, so that they shall be reasonably and fairly safe for ordinary use by the people. It is the duty of supervisors of townships to be active in the performance of their obligations to the public. They are to go over their respective districts, and ascertain the condition of the roads and bridges, and are not to wait for accidents to occur, but they are to prevent them if possible. This duty of townships, of course, is not confined to that of providing a level or good roadway upon which vehicles can move, but it may include the obligation to maintain barriers, fences, or protective agencies at points along the roads where, from narrowness of the road itself or the existence of embankments or any other natural cause, there is a demand for more than ordinary provision for public safety.</p>

R. have a quarry which has been worked for some fifteen years by means of a derrick and a drum. If by reason of the existence there of that quarry and this mechanism to work it, the road was rendered an unusually dangerous place likely to be the scene of disaster and accident, then it would be the duty of the supervisors having knowledge of this state of things to use reasonable care and diligence to prevent such accident. Now, some question has <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>been made in the present ease as to what was the primary cause of the accident. I do not think that question is of controlling importance in the present case, while in other cases which are reported in the books it has been much discussed and considered of the last importance. In the present case it is not clearly established by the evidence what caused the horse to be frightened. That he was frightened is clearly shown. Whether his fright came from a noise made by the drum or derrick is not clearly established. Because while it is alleged on the part of some of the witnesses that this was the case, it is denied by others who were there that the derrick was in operation or that the drum was being used at the time. Again, if the accident was caused from the noise from the drum or the derrick, there is no evidence that these appliances were being used in any unusual or extraordinary manner on this day. [As we have said, this quarry had been worked for fifteen years, and the machinery had been practially the same during all that time. The supervisors, therefore, had full notice and knowledge of these facts, and if the road was rendered unsafe or dangerous by reason of the existence of this machinery at this point, then their duty to protect the road would follow, provided this increased the risk beyond the ordinary danger.] [5] On this subject, in order that I may he within the line of the adjudicated cases, I call your attention for a moment to a decision by our Supreme Court which seems to me to be pertinent. Speaking of the facts, -the Supreme Court say : “ The defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff as one of the public, to keep a reasonably safe road at the place where this accident happened. If that was not done, the omission was an act of negligence on the part of the defendant, and if in consequence of that negligence an injury was sustained by the plaintiff, the defendant is responsible in damages to the plaintiff. It is no answer to say that some one else was also guilty of another act of negligence, in consequence of which the plaintiff’s injury was suffered. If both the defendant and other parties were derelict, the plaintiff may proceed against either, though of course only one actual recovery of damages for the same injury could be permitted. Between the two alleged acts of negligence in the present ease there is no relation of proximity or remoteness in the sense in which the law regards that subject, so as to post<a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>pone the liability of one because of the liability of another, or because of the intervention of an intermediate agency Burrell Township v.

It is said that the road was laid of the width of fifty feet, and, if so, it is obvious that some of the operations of the railroad company were within the lines of it. The derrick was used to move the stone from the quarry across the highway to the cars for transportation to the points where it was wanted. While the derrick itself from its proximity to the roadbed was liable to frighten horses, the operation of it was quite likely to do so. If the slope from the lower edge of <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>the roadbed was gradual and even as the appellant contends, it was nevertheless a point of danger because it declined eight feet in twenty and terminated in a perpendicular descent of six feet to the railroad. There was no fence or guard rail between the roadbed and the slope, and a horse frightened by the appearance or noise of the derrick would naturally shy towards the open space between the roadbed and the wall. This is precisely what occurred in the case at bar. The horse, frightened by the movements and noise of the machinery employed in operating the quarry, shied off the roadbed and dashing down the slope landed with the driver, the cart and the occupant of it upon the stones loaded on the flat car at the foot of the wall. The plaintiff received a serious injury which she attributes to the negligence of the township in not erecting a suitable fence or guard rail at or near the lower edge of the roadbed opposite the quarry. The condition we have described existed a long while before the occurrence in question and the township was chargeable with notice of it. Was it a condition which called for the erection by the township of a guard rail or fence to provide against accidents of the kind under consideration ? The jury answered this question affirmatively and the answer was authorized if not demanded by the evidence in the case. The township however contended that conceding its negligence the plaintiff could not maintain her suit because her negligence concurred with its own in causing the injury. This contention clearly involved a question of fact which the jury under proper instructions found against the defendant.</p>

It is plainly distinguishable from them in .its facts, and it is, we think, governed by the principles on which Burrell Township v. Uncapher, <a href="/pa/117/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="117 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="555790" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0353-01">117 Pa. 353</a>; Plymouth Township v.

The cases which constitute the township’s principal reliance in this contest recognize and approve the principle applicable to the facts of this case. In Shaffer v. Jackson Township, <a href="/pa/150/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="150 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="834399" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0145-01">150 Pa. 145</a>, Justice Heydkick, speaking for this court, said, “ The concurrence of that which is ordinary with a party’s negligence does not relieve him from responsibility for the resultant injury. Examples of such con<a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>currence may be found in cases where by reason of causes known to the public authorities horses are likely to become frightened, and in their sudden fright plunge over an unguarded precipice or rush upon some danger within the highway for the existence of which the authorities are responsible. In such cases the consequences of the neglect of duty are natural and probable and ought therefore to be foreseen.” A like view is expressed in Horstick v. Dunkle, <a href="/pa/145/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="145 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="825889" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0220-01">145 Pa. 220</a>, and in Hess v.
