Smith, Esq., that on January 6, 1893, prothonotary J. L. Hartman received after office hours by mail from Dysart &amp; Weaver, of Bellwood, a judgment note for $205.77 drawn in their favor and against William A. Kann. The prothonotary duty indorsed the note, “filed 6. January, 1893, J. L. Hartman, prothonotary,” and also indorsed thereon the proper number it would bear on the judgment records, “No. 627, October Term, 1892.” The prothonotary did not enter the note at this time on the judgment index docket. In acknowledging the receipt <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>of the note he inclosed inadvertently the indorsed note in an. envelope and returned it to Dysart &amp; Weaver, at Bellwoqd. Instead of rectifying the prothonotary’s error and returning the note forthwith, Dysart &amp; Weaver kept it in their possession. On January 9,1893, G. M. Meyers, Esq., a member of the Blair county bar, appeared in the prothonotary’s office, and at his instance two judgments were entered on that day against Kami in favor of James P. Glasgow, one for $161.59 and the other for $555. He then examined the judgment index docket to ascertain what liens there were against Kann at that time. He found no judgments there and saw no record of the Dysart &amp; Weaver judgment. He made no personal inquiry of the prothonotary to ascertain if there were any liens ahead of the Glasgow notes. He advised Glasgow of the results of his search. Glasgow testified that “ I had no notice of the fact that the Dysart &amp; Weaver judgment was entered before mine.”</p>

It was held in Polhemus’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20Pa.%20828" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="32 Pa. 828">32 Pa. 828</a>, that the judgment docket is prima facie evidence of the order in which liens are entered, and though in that case priority of date was united <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>with priority of position, yet the prima facies must apply to the latter as well as to the former, for by the act of March 29,1827, sec. 8, 9 Sm. 319, Purdon, ed. 1894, p. 1100, entries in the judgment docket “ shall be so made that one shall follow the other in the order of time in which the said judgments shall have been rendered, entered or filed.” Priority of position on the page of the docket therefore implies priority of date, and appellant’s judgment is entitled prima facie to this priority. But on coming down to the Dysarb and Weaver judgment we find that although posterior in position it bears an anterior date. If the date is right the position is wrong, and there is a manifest inconsistency in the record itself which calls for explanation. If it were necessary we should be compelled to go outside to ascertain the actual facts, and the rule that the record must be self sustaining and self explanatory would have to give way pro tanto to necessity. But here the docket itself points out the explanation. The last column contains the memorandum, “see endorsement on note,” and on turning to the endorsement we find the facts stated, “ Filed 6 January 1893. ... 11 Jany. ’93 <em>indexed on record </em>but within note having been returned in error with statement to plff.” The inconsistency in the record is thus explained, and the actual facts made clear. The note was filed with the prothonotary on Januaiy 6 but was not docketed until January 11. In the interval appellant’s judgments had been entered and indexed without notice of the Dysart &amp; Weaver note or the judgment on it. Appellant is entitled to his priority thus acquired. It is the order of actual entry not the mere date that it bears, which determines the legal priority. A judgment regularly entered on the judgment docket cannot be deprived of its position then acquired by any act of the prothonotary in putting an earlier date to an entry lower down on the page and in fact made afterwards.</p>
