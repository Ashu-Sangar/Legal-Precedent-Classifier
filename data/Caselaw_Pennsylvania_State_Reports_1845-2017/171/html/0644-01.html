The judgments were given for full and valuable considerations. The McCartney judgment is the first lien. It was entered August 6, 1875, while the other judgment did not become a lien until June 3, 1876. As the record stands, the money was properly appropriated to the McCartney judgment. The exception alleges, however, that the judgment was fully paid. Thus a distinct issue is raised. The burden is clearly upon the exceptant. He affirms that the judgment is paid. Whether this is the fact is to be determined only from the evidence which has been introduced. Before examining the evidence it is necessary to pass upon the competency of some of the witnesses.

How is this fact in the light of the evidence ? After a careful examination of the evidence, we fail to find any statement that will lead to the conclusion that the judgment was in fact paid. There is no evidence tending to show that it was paid by the defendant, Kipp. For the exceptant three witnesses are called, viz : Dr. J. S. McCartney, Robert Mitchell and John F. Humes. Dr. McCartney testifies: “ Lockhart paid me the first money on account of this judgment, February 8th, 1876. Paid by note for $5,000. . . . He paid balance 22d May, 1879. I, at that time, assigned balance of judgment to him by power of attorney. . . . Mr. Kipp, not to my knowledge, ever paid our bank any part of the $7,787 judgment.” It is true, this witness makes inconsistent, if not contradictory, statements. His testimony is thus weakened, if not destroyed. He is a witness called by exceptant, and it will not do to simply cull out the statements of the.witness which are favorable to the party calling him, and exclude the other parts of his testimony. On the <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>question of payment, there is little testimony besides. The witness, Mitchell, testifies simply to a declaration of one Ellis, “ who was a director in the First National.” McCartney testifies that Ellis was not a director, but taking the declaration for what it is worth, and as coming from one in authority to speak, it does not show payment, nor, as we view it, tend to show payment. The declarations were that the “ bank had gotten its money,” and an alleged declaration of McCartney, “ that the bank had gotten all their money from Kipp and had not lost a dollar by him.”</p>

At least no such averment was made in the exceptions, nor any such ground urged at any stage of the proceedings. It is alleged, however, that the debt covered by the first judgment was extinguished by novation. This is not the ground originally laid in the exceptions to the special return; but how is the fact? Novation is a substitution of a new debt for an old one, or of a new debtor instead of a former one. It is recognized in the law as a mode for the extinguishment of a debt. It must clearly appear, however, that a substitution was in fact intended; and that where another person becomes a debtor, instead of a former debtor, that he was so accepted by the creditor, who thereupon discharged the first debtor. In other words, it must be shown that the parties in interest assented to the extinguishment of the old debt.</p>

In this connection the learned auditor says : “ On May 1, 1876, the change in security is consummated; Kipp, the defendant in said judgment, on February 8 and on May 1,1876, presumptively, at the reqirest of the bank, presented commercial paper, of which he was the owner, and negotiated, or, in other words, sold the same to the bank, the consideration therefor being the indebtedness secured by the Armstrong county mortgage, and the above judgment in this county, and the discounting of the said paper in the regular way and accepting of same by the bank was, so far as the bank was concerned, an extinguishment <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>of the old debt. A clear novation; the old security was in violation of law and it was supplied by another.” But it does not follow that the acceptance of the new paper was an extinguishment of the old debt. The authorities already cited hold the very reverse. New paper of the debtor and paper of third persons accepted for a pre-existing debt, in the absence of a special agreement, are regarded simply as conditional payment or collateral security. There can be no novation unless it was the intention of the parties to substitute the new security for the old and thereby extinguish the old debt.</p>

His own testimony is to this effect and it is uncontradieted; Lockhart, the use plaintiff, paid $2,500 on June 7, 1876, and the like sum of $2,500 September 11, 1876 ; the judgment was never satisfied, but on the other hand was twice revived by amicable confession of judgment. From the time of the acceptance of the securities until the sale by the sheriff there was nothing done by either the plaintiff or th.e defendant in the judgment to indicate an intention on their part to extinguish the old debt. Nor do we discover evidence of any special agreement looking in that direction. No party to the arrangement testifies that any such contract was made. The books of the bank and the testimony of Humes, the cashier, show the acceptance of the securities, but fail to show that the judgment was to be satisfied and the old debt extinguished. Nor is there any other testimony which tends to show an intention of the parties to surrender and extinguish the old debt at the time of the acceptance of the new securities.

We have already noticed the fact that the indebtedness of Kipp exceeded the credit which the National Bank was permitted to extend to any one individual. Kipp, however, was not in a position to complain of this. The securities which he had given were not <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>therefore invalid. In Winton v.

They are bound by the act of the debtor. As was said by Gibson, C. J., in Cover v. Black, 1 Barr, 493, a judgment creditor “ stands on the foot of his debtor.” It is plain that the debtor has no equity here, nor does he claim any. The debt was not extinguished as to him until he paid the debt, and there is no evidence to show that he paid any part of the debt embraced in the Westmoreland judgment. The learned auditor relied on the case of Moorhead v. Duncan, 1 Norris, 488. But in Shrews-bury Saving Institution’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/94/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="94 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="485911" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0309-01">94 Pa. 309</a>, it is made plain that that and similar eases have no application.

If novation is a question of intention, what was the intention at that time ? Undoubtedly to observe the law. It was the only answer the government would tolerate. Having said so, then is it not estopped, at present, from coming in to assert its turpitude and its own dishonesty?</p>
