In an action against a street railway company to recover damages for personal injuries by an occupant of a carriage who was injured in practically a head-on collision between one of defendant’s cars and a carriage, the case is for the jury and a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff will be sustained where the evidence tends to show that the accident occurred on a winter night; that snow at the sides of the road was thirty inches in depth and packed and frozen so that vehicles could not pass through it or turn from the track, except at places where openings had been made; that the plaintiff and other occupants of the carriage were vigilant an looking for a car, and that when they first saw one it was 200 or 300 feet in front, running at the rate of 35 or 40 miles an hour; that its head light was very dim, and no notice of its approach had been given; that the driver at once looked for a place where he could turn out, and that the collision occurred while he was in the act of turning into an opening at a gateway.</p>

Snow had been thrown from the track on the sides of the road and was of a depth that made it difficult for vehicles to travel at the sides of the road or to turn from the track to the side when cars or vehicles going in an opposite direction were met. This condition had existed for several weeks during which time travel had been practically confined to the track. The plaintiff, a young woman, and two other persons who accompanied her, had been met at a. railroad station by a friend, who was taking them in his carriage to his home as his guests. It was a bright, moonlight night and there was an oil lamp on the front of the carriage. The road was straight for a long distance but the undulations of its surface obscured at times the headlight of a moving car. The horse and carriage were struck by a car which approached from the direction in which they were going. The testimony in relation to the speed of the car, the condition of its headlight, the failure to give warning of its approach, the depth of the snow at the sides of the road and of the care exercised by the driver and by the plaintiff, who was at his side, on the front seat of the carriage, to look out for their own safety was conflicting. It was submitted to the jury by a charge which was full and fair to both sides and exceptionally clear and accurate and to which the only error assigned is the refusal to direct a verdict for the defendant.</p>
