In a suit in equity by the heirs of a deceased grantor against the grantee, a physician, to have the conveyance set aside, the evidence showed that the defendant was a near neighbor, friend and attending physician of the grantor who reposed great confidence in him. On the day before the grant the defendant wrote to the grantee who lived in a boarding house kept by a woman over eighty years of age and’ several miles from his relatives, deprecating a sale of a hundred acre farm which was four-fifths of the grantor’s whole estate and worth about $8,000. In this letter the grantee conveyed to the grantor’s mind a value of the farm much below its real worth, and promised that if the farm was deeded to the grantee that he would not only pay the sum of $400 per year, but would obligate himself not to dispose of the property until the grantor was satisfied that he would be secure in his income, and that he would give the latter free professional services, and cheerfully administer to his wants and comforts during life. The written contract accompanying the deed and executed by the grantor did not contain the last two stipulations, and the grantee did not explain their omission. Nor did it appear that the grantee had been advised of his rights, or that the deed and contract had been explained to him, or that it had been suggested to him that he should have the counsel of an attorney. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the grantor’s mental capacity to understand what he was doing, and it also appeared that he had offered the farm to others on practically the same conditions that he had conveyed it to the defendant. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the undisputed facts constituted a constructive fraud, which the defendant had failed <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>to overcome by any sufficient evidence; and (2) that a decree should have been entered setting aside the conveyance.</p>

The consideration mentioned in the deed was seventy-five hundred dollars, but no part of that sum was paid or intended to be paid by the grantee, —the actual consideration being a contemporaneous written contract whereby the grantee agreed to pay Matthaei $400 a year in quarterly payments during the remainder of his life. On December 26, 1906, Dr. Pownall wrote a letter to Matthaei in which he referred to the difficulty of getting farm-work done, and stated that he had been informed the farm in question would not bring over $40 or $50 an acre, and that he thought there was little prospect of getting $80 an acre; he reminded Matthaei that in an effort to sell he would be put to the expense of advertising, and even if he was success<a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>ful, that he would have the risk of investing the proceeds. Dr. Pownall makes a passing reference in the letter to what he terms an agreeable offer made by Matthaei to him, adding, “I am willing to accept your offer by obligating myself, my heirs and assigns, to pay you $100 every 3 months as long as you live and not to sell the farm until I have satisfied you that you will be secured in your income. I will also promise to give you free professional care so long as you are within the limits of my practice, and will cheerfully administer to your wants and comforts____If you need extra money I will feel obligated to give it...... If you think favorably of the proposition, let us get it fixed up promptly......” The next day Dr. Pownall brought the deed and contract to his patient and they were duly executed. Shortly after this the defendant rented the property for $525 per annum, and in February, 1908, he sold it for $8,118; of this, $6,500 remained on mortgage ánd the balance was paid in cash. On November 4,1908, Matthaei died, leaving to survive him as his heirs certain brothers, sisters, and children of deceased sisters. These heirs filed the present bill against Dr. Pownall upon the theory that the conveyance had been secured by fraud, praying that the mortgage held by him should be assigned to them and that he should be decreed to account for the cash consideration paid him in the sale of the property, and for all income therefrom.</p>

It is further to be noted that the contract, as actually executed, contained neither of the last two stipulations, but left the defendant free to dispose of the property and put the money in his pocket without any security to Matthaei whatever; that the defendant failed in his answer and proofs to give any explanation of these material omissions, to claim or show that Matthaei had understood or assented to the same, that he had been advised of his rights, that the papers as executed had been explained to him, or that it had been suggested to him in any manner that he should have the counsel of an attorney or other adviser in this transfer to his friend, neighbor and physician, of the greater part of his small estate.</p>

But in spite of this concession, a rule of public policy and pure morals founded in long experience of the human heart and knowledge of man’s cupidity, interposes....... The case represents what is called a constructive fraud, springing from the confidential relations existing between the parties. This peculiarity, withdrawing it from the operation of ordinary rules, throws upon the beneficiaries the duty of showing expressly that the arrangement was fair and conscientious, beyond the reach of suspicion. In requiring this, courts of equity act ir<a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>respective of any admixture of deceit, imposition, overreaching or other positive fraud. As it has often been said, the principle stands independently of such elements of active mischief. It is founded upon a motive of general policy, and is designed to protect a party, so far as may be, against his own overweening confidence and self-delusion, the infirmities of a hasty judgment, and even the impulses of a too sanguine temperament.” And in Miskey’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/107/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="107 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="8858996" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0611-01">107 Pa. 611</a>, referring to the same general subject, at page 630, by quotation from a noted English case, we said that the question was not whether the grantor “knew what she was doing, had done or proposed to do, but how the intention was produced ; whether all that care and providence was placed round her, as against those who advised her, which from their situation and relation with respect to her they were bound to exert on her behalf.”</p>

The fact that Matthaei had no mental weakness, and the further fact that he had suggested to others that he desired to get rid of his farm and was willing to part with it on some such terms as those contained in the contract between Dr. Pownall and himself, were not sufficient to meet the burden cast upon the defendant. That burden could only have been met by clearly showing that the value of the grantor’s property and the inadequacy of the bargain he was making had been honestly brought home to him, or that he had been given the opportunity of independent advice; and in this particular case the departure in the contract as actually made from the terms suggested in the defendant’s letter should have been explained, in order properly to sustain the bona fidés of the transaction; none of these things wasi done, however. On the contrary, it was shown that not even the witnesses to the documents knew their nature, and that the only attorney present was the one acting for <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>the defendant. As we said in Darlington’s Estate, supra, at page 635, such transactions are not condemned because of mental incapacity on the part of the grantor or proof of actual fraud, but because of the absence of that full and satisfactory proof that the contract in question was the free and intelligent act of the party, fully explained to him, and done with a thorough knowledge of the bargain and all its consequences.</p>
    <p id="b496-4" data-blocks='[["BL_496.5",496,[307,807,1149,800]]]'>The rule that a responsive answer must be overcome by two witnesses, etc., has no application to a case like this where the denial goes only to the legal effect of the essential facts and not to their existence: Everhart’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/106/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="106 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="455641" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0349-01">106 Pa. 349</a>, 354. The burden was upon the defendant to explain fully the transaction complained of in such a manner as to demonstrate its bona fides; if Matthaei were alive to-day and were the complainant, on the record as presented it cannot be doubted that a chancellor would grant him the relief prayed for; the present complainants have the samé right. While the defendant should pay the costs, he should be allowed all the moneys properly expended by him upon the* property and the sum of the payments made to Matthaei under the contract.</p>
    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.6",496,[305,1623,1145,317]]]'>It is not necessary specifically to pass upon all the assignments of error. The last two which go to the dismissal of the bill are sustained, the decree is reversed, the bill is reinstated, and the record is remitted to the court below with directions to enter a decree in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>
