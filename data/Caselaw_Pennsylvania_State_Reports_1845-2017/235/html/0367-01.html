By it the city undertook to pay a certain sum to the plaintiff to be first collected by it from the owners of properties upon which the cost of the construction the bonds were to provide for was to be assessed by the city. Of course the city, in so undertaking, impliedly assumed to make the assessment and to collect it, and in common sense and fairness must be understood to have contemplated an assessment as adequate for the purpose and its collection as promptly as with due diligence they could be so made. The purchaser of the bonds under a clause limiting the liability of the city upon them to the proceeds of the assessment had the right to regard the city as so assuming. A binding agreement to that effect is therefore to be treated as a part of the contract between him and the city; for what is implied in a contract is as much a part of it as what is expressed in it: Siegel v. Lauer, <a href="/pa/148/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="148 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="981784" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0286-01">148 Pa. 286</a>, 244 (and see also Waslee v. Rossman, <a href="/pa/231/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="231 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="973884" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0219-01">231 Pa. 219</a>, 227). Moreover, the city expressly stipulated that the requirements of the ordinance had been fully complied with. One of those requirements was the assessment of the “exact cost <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>and expense” of the improvement upon the properties liable therefor; which clearly means an assessment sufficient to meet the whole of the cost and expenses to be provided for. When through the carelessness of its own officials the city then made an inadequate assessment it committed a breach not only of one branch of its implied contract with the plaintiff, but also of its express assurance just referred to. It is conceded and is undoubtedly true that there is now no means of retrieving the error committed by an additional assessment covering the deficiency. The mischief is done, and there is no one to answer for it to the plaintiff except the city through whose short-coming it occurred. In equity, — and the action of assumpsit partakes of the nature of a bill in equity: Martzell v. Stauffer, <a href="/pen-w/3/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 398" data-case-ids="1827667" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0398-01">3 P. &amp; W. 398</a>, 402; Hind-march v. Hoffman, <a href="/pa/127/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="127 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="565751" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0284-01">127 Pa. 284</a>, 288; Brown v. Title &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/pa/174/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="174 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="878702" data-case-paths="/pa/174/0443-01">174 Pa. 443</a>, 447, — it is plain that the city ought to be held to make him whole. Whilst there seems to be no authoritative declaration of its liability to do so under the precise state of facts here existing, there are certain adjudications in this state in principle decisive of this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b398-4" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[320,1531,1147,864]],["BL_399.1",399,[148,381,1152,973]]]'>In Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co. v. Corry, <a href="/pa/197/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="197 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="918666" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0041-01">197 Pa. 41</a>, a 'contract for the construction of a sewer provided that its price should be paid partly by money in the city treasury and partly by assessments on abutting and non-abutting properties. The assessment was made against both, but was subsequently found to have been unlawfully made against the non-abutting properties, which were not liable to assessment. These assessments being irrecoverable by the city, the total of the assessment was inadequate. The city was held liable for the deficiency. And so in Gable v. Altoona, <a href="/pa/200/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="200 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="924432" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0015-01">200 Pa. 15</a>, the city was held liable for bonds issued by it payable out of assessments on property, where the assessment turned out to have been illegally made and void. O’Hara v. Scranton, <a href="/pa/205/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="205 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="930073" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0142-01">205 Pa. 142</a>, and Dime Deposit &amp; Discount Bank v. Scranton, <a href="/pa/208/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="208 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="998076" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0383-01">208 Pa. 383</a>, were actions upon bonds issued by the city <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>•with a restriction upon its liability entirely similar to that in the bonds here sued on. The possibility of collecting part of the assessment was lost through the neglect of the city officials to file liens in time or their failure to proceed upon liens that had been duly filed, and there was a consequent deficiency. In the Common Pleas and on appeal by the city, it was held liable. Substantially to the same effect seems to be the decision rendered May 17, 1911, in Dale v. Scranton, <a href="/pa/231/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="231 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="973860" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0604-01">231 Pa. 604</a>. The broad underlying reason of all these rulings is that, notwithstanding the express limitation of the liability of the city to the avails of the assessment, it is bound to make good any deficiency thereof to meet the whole bond issue, where that deficiency occurred in any way through the default of its own officers. That principle is as applicable to the case here presented as to those to which it was applied in the decisions cited. It follows that the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b399-3" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[144,1367,1150,699]]]'>The question next arises, what is he entitled to recover? The city will never by virtue of the assessment made by it be in a position to pay him in full. It has no funds now available for the purpose. It is doubtful when collection will be made of the amount secured by the liens filed by the city. Its contract with plaintiff has been broken. Its liability to him for the whole face of the bonds and interest is certain. It would seem that in analogy to the rule adopted in U. S. Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass’n v. Silverman, <a href="/pa/85/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="85 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="440515" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0394-01">85 Pa. 394</a>, plaintiff is entitled to a judgment for the full amount of his claim.
