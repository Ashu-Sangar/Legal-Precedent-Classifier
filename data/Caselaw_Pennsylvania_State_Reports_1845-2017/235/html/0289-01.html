In that case the testator devised certain real estate in trust for the use of Ms son William for life and after his death in trust for his children then living and the issue of such of them as should be deceased, their respective heirs and assigns, in equal parts or shares, etc., and for want of such child or children or lawful issue, then in trust for the use of his (testator’s) right heirs forever. William died without issue, and the decision turned on the question as to who were the right heirs of the testator who were to succeed to the estate on the death of William without children or issue of deceased children. Mr. Justice Williams, in a clear and lucid opinion, calls attention to the fact that many cases in Pennsylvania had decided such remainder interests to be vested, and others contingent, and goes on to say: “If, then, the estate devised to the testator’s right heirs was a vested remainder, the heirs at his death took the estate, and as William, the devisee for life, was one of the testator’s heirs, it would follow that <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>Ms devisees became entitled to his share on the termination of his life estate. But there are authorities, and among them some decisions of our own, which show that the remainder in this case is to be regarded as con- ■ tin gent rather than as vested; and the weight of the authorities seems to be in favor of this doctrine. * * * If, then, the remainder is to be regarded as contingent, in whom did it vest? In those who were heirs of the testator at the time of his death, or in those who were heirs at the death of his son William? The remainder, if contingent, did not vest till William’s death. But it does not follow that it vested in those who were the heirs at his death; if it did, then it was doubly contingent. The event upon which it was to take effect, and the persons to whom the estate was limited, were both dubious and uncertain. If there was no uncertainty as to the class, the persons composing this class could only be known and ascertained upon the death of the tenant for life. If the remainder had been expressly limited to the heirs living at the death of the testator, it would have been contingent in view of the doctrine of the cases last cited. And the question recurs, who are the testator’s right heirs? As a general rule of construction, it is well settled that a devise or bequest to heirs, or heirs at law of a testator, or to his next of kin, will be construed as referring to those who are such at the time of the testator’s decease, unless a different intent is plainly manifest .by the will;” citing numerous authorities.</p>

Barker, 4 Kay &amp; Johns. 483. * * * The limitation in these words: ‘And for want of such child or children, or lawful issue, then in trust for the use and behoof of my right heirs for ever.’ Obviously, the word then is not used in this clause as an adverb of time, but as a conjunction, signifying in that case, in that event or contingency. If this be its meaning, there is nothing to prevent the general rule from applying, and the words must be construed as referring to the heirs of the testator at the time of his death.”</p>

Prom the decree of the court below, awarding one-half of the said trust fund to the estate of Walter, his surviving sister Helen has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.5",324,[331,1744,1150,534]]]'>The auditing judge awarded to Walter’s estate one-half of the fund held in trust for his sister Margaret, on the ground that his estate had a vested interest in her trust estate under the term's of his father’s will. In overruling the exceptions to the adjudication and confirming it the court below avoided a decision as to what interest Walter had during his life in the fund held in trust for his sister, holding that the only question before it was what interest, if any, in that fund had passed to his estate upon her death.</p>
    <p id="b324-6" data-blocks='[["BL_324.6",324,[331,2287,1147,156]],["BL_325.1",325,[186,407,1152,1300]]]'>If the testator had directed that, upon the death of his daughter Margaret without issue, the share held in trust for her should go to his heirs at law, the heirs to <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>take would be those who were living at the time of his death, for no contrary intent appears in his will: Buzby’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/61/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="61 Pa. 111" data-case-ids="428591" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0111-01">61 Pa. 111</a>; Stewart’s Estate, <a href="/pa/147/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="147 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="829828" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0383-01">147 Pa. 383</a>; Fitzpatrick’s Estate, <a href="/pa/233/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="233 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="981123" data-case-paths="/pa/233/0033-01">233 Pa. 33</a>. Walter was one of those heirs, and his estate would now take his share in his sister’s trust estate; but that there might be no doubt as to the intention of the testator as to who should take if Margaret should die without issue, he declared that the estate held in trust for her should belong to his two other children, “to my other children mentioned in this my will and to the issue of any of them being then deceased.” Walter was one of these two children, the other being the surviving daughter. The survivorship was confined to the daughters. Walter or his issue were to take one-half of the trust fund without condition upon the death of either of his sisters leaving no issue. As Walter died without leaving issue, the limitation over to his issue, if he should die leaving any, becomes utterly unimportant as a substitutionary clause and need not be considered in the distribution: Carstensen’s Est., <a href="/pa/196/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="196 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="916820" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0325-01">196 Pa. 325</a>. The clear and well considered opinion of the court below relieves us from any further discussion of the questions raised by the appellant.</p>
