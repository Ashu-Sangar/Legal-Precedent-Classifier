The property known as 1322 Chestnut street is bounded on the east by another store building known as No. 1320 Chestnut street, in front of the latter building has not been widened to its full width as recently established by the city of Philadelphia and the front wall of No. 1320 Chestnut street stands on the old line <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>of that street which is five feet farther north than the line of the front wall of No. 1322 Chestnut street. The west wall of No. 1320 Chestnut street, consequently projects five feet beyond the front of No. 1322 Chestnut street. This wall is solid and without openings. It stands on the line which formerly bounded the two properties just referred to. Against this wall the defedants have set up a show case above five feet wide eight feet high and twelve inches deep. This show case stands within the lines of Chestnut street projecting westward from the west wall of No. 1320 Chestnut street and northward from the front wall of No. 1322 Chestnut street. It is made of glass set in iron or wooden frames and is used for the display of samples of silk skirts, waists and other wares offered for sale by the defendants. On the top of this show case the defendants have set up and fastened to the wall above mentioned a large business sign about five feet wide and six or eight feet high and upon this sign they have erected and secured against the wall an upright sign extending from the top of the sign last mentioned to the top of No. 1320 Chestnut street. The signs which surmount the show case as well as the show case itself encroach upon the space included within the lines of Chestnut street. They are located directly north of the doorway situated on the east side of No. 1322 Chestnut street by which entrance is had to the elevator used for conveying visitors to the second, third and fourth floors of that building.</p>

The value to the plaintiff of the advertisement afforded by the display of its goods in the front windows of its place of business is very great and any interference with this means of bringing its wares to the attention of the public involves a serious injury to the plaintiff and entails a loss which falls on it alone.</p>
