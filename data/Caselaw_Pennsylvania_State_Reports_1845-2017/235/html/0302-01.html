In an action by an employee against his employer to recover damages for an injury to his hand sustained while he was working at a machine in defendant’s factory, a non-suit is properly entered where the evidence shows that the plaintiff was thirty-seven years old, that he had worked at the machine for fifteen months, that at the time of the accident he was instructing an apprentice in its use; that the machine was of the kind in ordinary use; that it was in proper condition; and that any danger in its use was exceedingly remote and was fully understood by plaintiff.</p>

The machine consisted of an iron table over the middle of which, and seven-eights of an inch above its surface was a frame in which the blade which produced a crease worked up and down. In operating the machine the boards were fed into the narrow space under the frame and pressed by the blade. The operator handled the boards from the edge nearest himself and had no occasion to place his hands within several inches of the blade. Back of the blade there was a movable gauge against which, when the machine was fed from the front, the boards were pressed in order that * they should be uniformly creased. A crease nearer than two inches from the edge of a board could not be made when the operator stood at the front of the machine and when a narrower margin was desired, he went to the back of the machine, adjusted the gauge at the right distance and placed the edge of the board nearest him against it. The gauge was not intended as a protection for the operator but only to secure uniformity in creasing.</p>
