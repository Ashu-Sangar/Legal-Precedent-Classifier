Norris, sent a bill to the defendant for professional services rendered to The Breakwater Construction and Engineering Company for the sum of |8,286.25, claiming it as a balance due under the agreement of February 24, 1908, which the said Edward W. Norris had with The Breakwater Construction and Engineering Company. The defendant refused to pay the said bill of the said Edward W. Norris, and thereupon the said Edward W. Norris and John F.

The application for a receiver was denied and answers contesting the proceedings were duly interposed, and the defendant upon the refusal of his application for a receiver, then made an application in the Unted States District Court for the Southern District of New York to set aside the sale of the assets and property of The Breakwater Construction and Engineering Company made by the special commissioner to the defendant herein. This proceeding was begun some time in September in the year 1908. The <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>said application to set aside the said sale was made by certain alleged creditors of The Breakwater Construction and Engineering Company, and were brought at the instance of the said Edward W.

Norris upon the petition of divers creditors drawn by him, and the allegations of which were made by the said creditors upon information supplied and furnished by him in betrayal of his professional obligations and in violation of his office as an attorney-at-law of the state of New York, and in violation of his duty towards his clients as aforesaid.</p>

And the defendant under duress, and by reason of the threats of the said Edward W. Norris and the claims of the said First National Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, entered into negotiations with the said Edward W. Norris and John F. Donovan, and the said bank having then and there the control of The Breakwater Company insisted that the demands of the plaintiff, the said Edward W. Norris, both for himself and for the said John F. Donovan, should be complied with, and on October 3, 1908, the bank having demanded and forced the settlement with the said Edward W. Norris, and John F. Donovan for the sole and whole purpose of quieting the title of the said bank to the said securities aforesaid", compelled the defendant to enter into the agreement in controversy, and the said agreement was drawn and entered into.

That the defendant during the time that its securities were held by the First National Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, was controlled by the First National Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, is apparent from the fact that a majority of the board of directors was composed of the officers and counsel of said bank and it was therefore compelled to yield to the control of the said First National Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, in the execution of said agreement, which execution was produced by duress, and to the detriment of the defendant, and for the benefit of the First National Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, which held the securities of the defendant as collateral security for its debt of $350,000.</p>

The appellee is an attorney-at-law, and his claim for professional services is based upon a written agreement with the appellant, dated October 3, 1908. A defense set up in the affidavit is his alleged infidelity to the appellant as his client, but this was held by the court below to be unavailing, because there is an express denial in the affidavit of defense that the appellee had rendered any services whatever to the appellant prior to October 3, 1908, and it could take no advantage of his unfaithfulness to its predecessors. We do not so read the affidavit of defense. The first recital in the agreement is, “Whereas the first party and the company have adjusted and settled all their differences, disputes and controversies and agreed that the company is indebted to the first party in the sum of five thousand and fifty-three and 50-100 ($5,053.50) dollars for services rendered as its attorney to the date hereof.” The execution of this agreement is thus admitted by the appellant: “It is true, as he alleged in the plaintiff’s statement of claim, that the defendant entered into a certain written contract, copy of which is annexed to the plaintiff’s statement of claim, but it is not true as is alleged in the said statement of claim that he, the plain<a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>tiff, has well and faithfully rendered, performed and discharged such services for the defendant as were required of him by its board of directors, and has faithfully performed and kept all of the conditions and provisions of said contract as therein provided upon his part to be kept and performed. But on the contrary, the plaintiff has always been inimical and hostile to the interests of the company, in violation of the spirit and intent of said agreement.” The averment which the court below seems to have misunderstood is not that the appellee had not “rendered any services whatever to The Breakwater Company” prior to the date of the agreement, but is, “Said agreement was based upon the fact that the said Edward W. Norris had rendered services to the defendant when in truth and fact he rendered no service whatsoever to the defendant, but all his actions had been to the detriment of the said defendant, and he had rendered no services in its behalf.” This, taken in connection with the agreement and the other quoted averment in the affidavit of defense, does not necessarily mean that the appellee had not been counsel for appellant prior to October 3, 1908, but is entirely consistent with such a relation, in which, however, he may have failed to faithfully serve his clients. There is a sufficient averment of professional unfaithfulness in the affidavit of defense to send the case to a jury on the question of the right of the appellee to recover. It is not necessary that we, at this time, pass upon his alleged duress of the appellant in procuring the agreement from it.</p>
