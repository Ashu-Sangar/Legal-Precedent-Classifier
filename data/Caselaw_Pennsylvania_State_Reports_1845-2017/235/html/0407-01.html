We find nothing in them to give rise to even a debatable question. The murder of which the prisoner was convicted was committed in the perpetration of robbery. Of this there was no doubt under the testimony and no question in relation to it was raised at the trial. In the instructions complained of the jury were told that if the murder was committed for the purpose of robbery, it was murder of the first degree and that it was their duty to so find. This plain statement of the law was accompanied with the distinct instruction that it was the right of the jury to ascertain the degree. Nothing of the nature of a direction to find a verdict of the first degree or of a withdrawal of the question of the degree from the jury appears in the charge. The expression of opinion by the learned trial judge that there was no middle ground and no room for a finding of the second degree was followed by the statement, “I do not intend, by saying this, to take away from you or to interfere with the right which you have under the law to fix the degree; but I deem it proper to <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>point out to you what I believe is the measure of your duty.”</p>

These cases and all of our cases recognize the right of the trial judge to express his opinion of the duty of the jury on the facts, leaving them always free to act. The question of the degree of murder goes to the jury with the question of guilt, and a peremptory instruction which withdraws it is erroneous. But it is always within the province of the court to point out the duty of the jury under the law and the evidence if they are left free to act. Commonwealth v.

In affirming the points the court called attention to the words “material circumstances” used in the first and in answering the second said that the fact must be a material fact that was a necessary link in the chain which made out the Commonwealth’s case.
