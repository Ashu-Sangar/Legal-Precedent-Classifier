      <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>The court in banc filed the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-3" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[161,436,1149,420]]]'>Our decree of incorporation contained a proviso that no intoxicating liquors should be sold, furnished or distributed on the premises of the association. This stipulation was made a part of our decree because the president, vice president and treasurer signed a paper indicating that it was the desire of the said home that no intoxicating liquors should be dispensed upon the premises of the association.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[161,885,1147,250]]]'>We are now asked to eliminate the provision in our decree relating to intoxicating liquors. It is contended that the officers of the association had no authority to file a stipulation against the use of liquors on the premises.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.6",433,[162,1165,1145,98]]]'>We referred the original application to an examiner and submitted to him the following inquiry:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-6" data-blocks='[["BL_433.7",433,[163,1281,1144,144]]]'>“Does the proposed corporation intend to dispose of, distribute or otherwise furnish intoxicating liquors to its members?”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-7" data-blocks='[["BL_433.8",433,[157,1454,1151,643]]]'>He took the testimony of ten witnesses called by the petitioners. Each and every one declared he was opposed to any distribution or sale of intoxicating liquors on the premises. They also intimated that the association, so far as they were able to determine, would not countenance the sale or distribution of liquors by the home. They offered a poster that was displayed by the house committee which reads as follows: “Any member found bringing liquor into the home shall be fined the sum of five dollars and be debarred from all privilege until the same is paid.” The examiner attached to his report as an exhibit one of these posters.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-8" data-blocks='[["BL_433.9",433,[152,2118,1149,316]]]'>It is evident that the court granted the charter, incorporating the provision against intoxicating liquors, in accordance with the expressed desire of the petitioners. If the evidence submitted to the examiner did not express the sentiment of the petitioners, why was it not opposed by some one?</p>

The corporation chartered is not here complaining of the restrictions imposed. But waiving the question of the right of the appellants to be heard, it is evident, as stated in the opinion of the learned judges of the common pleas, that the petitioners for a charter were granted what they asked for.</p>
