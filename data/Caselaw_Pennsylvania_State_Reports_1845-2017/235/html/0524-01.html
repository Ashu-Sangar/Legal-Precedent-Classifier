In an action to recover such money the court left two questions to the jury, (1) was the payment made by mistake on the part of plaintiff’s officers, and (2) was it caused by inadvertence in reading the first paragraph of the will as the paragraph under which plaintiff was acting as trustee; and was that due to the similarity of the names mentioned in the will. The first question was answered “yes,” the second “no.” Thereupon a third question was submitted, viz: “State what was the character of the mistake?” This was answered “Carelessness of the officers of the Union Trust Company.” The court asked the jury in what particular the officers had been careless, and the foreman said, “in reading the will.” These words were then added to the answer. The court then directed a verdict for plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the court committed no erroreither in propounding the questions to the jury, or in directing a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>

At their death the principal in each case went to their respective issue, if any; otherwise to the executors of the will.

With the trust described in the voucher the plaintiff had nothing whatever to do. That was the fund in the hands of the other company. The two trusts were quite as distinct and independent of each other as two separate paragraphs of a written instrument could make them. The death of her sister in no way affected the relations of Mrs. Gilpin with the plaintiff Trust Co. The plaintiff took nothing by the release. The liability which it purported to discharge had never existed. All this is apparent upon a mere reading of the will, if read with care and attention to what it says. There is nothing ambiguous about either paragraph, calling for anything more than careful reading. So that upon examination of the two instruments, the bequest on the one hand and the receipt on the other, the inference would seem to be irresistible that the payment was the result of mistake on part of some officer of the Trust Company in failing to note the identity of the trustee named in the first paragraph on the occasion of being advised of Mrs. Hart’s death and the defendant’s understanding in the premises. There is nothing outside of these writings to throw any light on the nature and character of the mistake except this correspondence, and.nothing in that to weaken the inference arising from the terms of the receipt. There was no attempt to im<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>pair plaintiff’s equity unless it be in the offer to prove that defendant had in the meantime spent the money so that repayment would now be a hardship; and that is believed to be immaterial for reasons to be mentioned below.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b555-3" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[119,634,1151,1744]]]'>From the inception of the suit the close question has seemed to be whether it wasn’t a case for binding instructions for plaintiff. The court being divided on the question, the defendant was given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to go to the jury. 6. (But, instead of a general submission, two specific questions were first submitted to the jury subject to further instruction upon return of their answers. These were as follows: “(1) Was the payment of October 22, 1902, made by mistake on part of plaintiff’s officers? (2) Was it caused by inadvertence in reading the first paragraph of the will as the paragraph under which plaintiff was acting as trustee; and was that due to the similarity of the names of the two trustees mentioned in the will?” The first was answered, “Yes;” the second, “No.” Thereupon a third question was submitted, viz: “State what was the character of the mistake?” This was returned with the somewhat indefinite answer: “Carelessness of the officers of the Union Trust Co. of New York.” Their attention being called to the necessity of stating in what particular the officers had been careless, it was disclosed that what was meant was carelessness in reading the will; and thereupon, by hand of their foreman, the jury were permitted to complete the answer in open court. In order to guard against possible misunderstanding the answer as so completed was then first read aloud to them, not by the clerk, but by the court, and they were asked if that was correct — as appears by the transcript —to which the foreman replied “yes,” and the others nodded assent in the usual way. Upon that a verdict was directed for plaintiff, for the reasons then stated and which in my judgment made it inevitable.)</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.5",555,[167,2389,1097,34]],["BL_556.1",556,[327,361,1145,307]]]'>These circumstances are referred to because the <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>learned counsel seeks to support the present motion, in part, by the foreman’s testimony. The effort is to reform the finding of the jury by substituting the term “construing” in place of “reading” the will, thus characterizing the mistake as one of law rather than of fact, and so to defeat the action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[324,689,1149,1732]],["BL_557.1",557,[159,377,1145,474]]]'>Accordingly the motion is to amend the verdict to one in favor of defendant. Aside from the foreman’s version of what was in the minds of the jurors, the motion is based on the answer to the second question. The point made is that this negatived the specific averment upon which plaintiff’s case turned, and was therefore a finality. The contention is believed to be unsound. If for the jury at all the case was such as made it important to have the benefit of their unbiased judgment as to the nature and character of the mistake. That wasn’t accomplished by the first two answers. They left the matter just where it was at the outset. The second question was probably somewhat inapt by reason of its having two branches. I can think of no good reason why the courts in attempting to administer the law through trial by jury may not submit any question appropriate to the issue of fact. That the final question here was inappropriate to that purpose has not been suggested. The answer affirms the substance of plaintiff’s allegation. As such, it warranted the verdict as directed, unless recovery is barred by the fact of plaintiff’s negligence; or the finding be open to revision on the deposition of a juror; and this, for no better reason than that in the opinion of the witness “no person can read a will without putting a construction on it.” This is manifestly incompetent and merits no consideration: Smalley v. Morris, <a href="/pa/157/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="157 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="846585" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0349-01">157 Pa. 349</a>. Citations could be multiplied if the occasion called for it. For the sake of discussion it may be conceded that the jury would have held the Trust Co. to the loss of the money if at liberty to do so. They were called upon, however, only to decide the facts, unmoved by sympathy or prejudice <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>for or against either party, regardless of the consequences. Undoubtedly their conclusion was correct. No one could read the will attentively without being forcibly impressed with the fact that a blunder had been made. That would be quite as apparent to a jury of average understanding as to a lawyer. The final answer here was not only consistent with the evidence, but it is not apparent how there could have been any escape from it.</p>

It has been sometimes said that plaintiff’s laches will preclude recovery unless defendant can be put in statu quo. And it is upon this principle that it was sought to be proven here that defendant had spent the money. There is neither reason nor authority, however, to support the theory that the mere fact of the money having been spent amounts to an alteration of defendant’s legal position. It is enough to say that if it were so, the instances in which the right to recover has been affirmed would have been much less frequent.</p>
