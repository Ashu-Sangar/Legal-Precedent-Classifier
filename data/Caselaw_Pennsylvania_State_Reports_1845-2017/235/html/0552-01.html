He was riding south towards Penn street, which is two blocks from the point where he came upon Eighth street. He had not been in the habit of passing over this portion of Eighth street, and was not familiar with its condition. The block immediately north of Penn street, between it and Washington street, had for some considerable time been and then was very much out of repair. The asphalt pavement was broken up with numerous holes. When plaintiff reached Washington street he found the street freshly sprinkled, and slowed down to a very low speed. Beyond Washington street he at once encountered a large hole, but passed it keeping close to the curb. Looking ahead of him he observed between the curb and the street railway track several teams, some moving and one standing at the curb. With his attention directed partly to the street bed and partly to the teams, he ran into another hole which he did not see. His machine broke and he, in falling, was very severely and permanently injured. His own testimony in chief and on cross-examination as to what he was doing and how he was proceeding cannot be declared as matter of law to con<a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>vict Mm of any omission of duty.

(After passing the first hole) you didn’t look for any more holes after that? A. No, sir. I looked ahead on the road and watched the teams too .....as a man will do when he is driving, he cannot give his sole attention to a horse or to an automobile or to the road, because in doing one or the other something else may happen; he has to watch for both.
