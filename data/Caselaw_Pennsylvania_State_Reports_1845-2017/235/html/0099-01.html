They further contend that as the plaintiff paid one-third of the outlay hitherto made and each of the defendants also paid one-third thereof, such payment is in law a mutual ascertainment of their true relations at the time, and a waiver of any contract theretofore made or of any other relation subsisting between them.</p>

This agreement was not in writing and may have included no other specific terms than those set forth in the bill. These were, in substance, that the money required for completing should be raised by procuring from the defaulting contractor its four promissory notes to the order of plaintiff and defendants and having them discounted by a bank for the defendant, Smith. These notes were for the amounts of $1,500, $4,500, $3,500 and $3,000, respectively, and their proceeds were properly applied. The notes were not paid at maturity, because the defendants refused to admit that the plaintiff was liable only for one-seventh, but insisted that he was liable for one-third. To prevent judgment and execution, he, under protest to defendants, paid one-third, or $4,349.20, to the bank, and the defendants each paid the same amount. As the whole amount paid in settlement of the promissory notes was $13,047.60, it would follow on the principle laid down that the plaintiff was liable only for one-seventh thereof, viz., $1,863.94. As he actually paid $4,349.20, he claims that he has thus far exceeded his true share by $2,485.26, which he may rightfully call upon his co-sureties to pay to him.</p>

That the plaintiff has paid more than his one-seventh is clearly averred. The contention of the defendants that the existence of additional claims against the co-sureties which are contested and have not yet been decided exempts them from present contribution is based on the idea that a present decree could only be partial and that equity will not favor a multiplicity of suits. Their inference is unwarranted. The decree can be so moulded that all litigation will end with it, though, of course, subsequent motions oy orders may have to be made. In any event, the fact that the defendants may be held to further liability hereafter, is no equitable reason why they should subject their co-surety to indefinite delays in reimbursing him for what he has already paid on their account. In no event can these pending claims reduce the defendants’ liability. They can only increase it.</p>
