    <p class="summary" id="b124-4" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[328,622,1143,206]]]'>The defendant claims that Sherman was upon its premises as a licensee merely, and that therefore it owed him no duty except not to wilfully injure him or negligently permit him to encounter hidden peril.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[331,840,1142,358]]]'>The determination of the respective rights and duties of the parties depends in the first place upon the fact of employment as chauffeur of Sherman by Dr. Stewart, and, in turn, his rights and those of his chauffeur to the use of the second floor of the building, and the degree of care thereby owing to Sherman from the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b124-6" data-blocks='[["BL_124.7",124,[332,1219,1149,638]]]'>The defendant is an owner and proprietor of a public garage for the storing and repairing for pay of automobiles, situated on the east side of Broad street between Race and Vine streets, and extending eastward to Watts street. The building consists of a basement and three stories. In the basement the automobiles were washed and polished. The first floor was used as a salesroom, and its rear opened upon Watts street. An elevator was operated for carrying automobiles to the several floors, on the third of which was a repair shop, and the second of which was used for storage purposes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b124-7" data-blocks='[["BL_124.8",124,[337,1870,1141,314]]]'>The contract of storage between Dr. Stewart and the defendant does not appear in evidence. It was offered by neither side. Sufficient evidence, however, appears in the case to support the finding of the jury that Sherman was in fact employed as chauffeur by Dr. Stewart, who, in turn, had storage rights with the defendant.</p>

No effort was made to disprove it by testimony. Sufficient proof also appears to support the jury’s finding that Sherman wa,s in the <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>employ as chauffeur of Dr. Stewart, whose automobile was upon storage with the defendant on the second floor of its building. The defendant did not show rules and regulations between it and Dr. Stewart, the employer of the chauffeur, which forbade the use of the second floor by Sherman upon the evening in question. In fact, his presence there and his use of the place was known to and apparently acquiesced in by the employees of the defendant in charge upon the afternoon and evening of the accident. The evidence, therefore, supports the finding of the jury that Sherman, being upon the premises, was more than a mere licensee.</p>

Sufficient evidence appears on the record to show, as the jury have found, that the averments of negligence were well founded and that the second floor of the building was not properly lighted, nor the elevator shaft properly guarded to the reasonably careful degree, which was owing from the defendant under the circumstances.</p>
