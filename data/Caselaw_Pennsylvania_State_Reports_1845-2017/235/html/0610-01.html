He left a will in which he devised all of his property. The plaintiffs claim as the heirs of William Barnsley who was the father of the testator, and the defendants under this will of the testator’s nephew and devisee. In a well stated opinion, after reviewing various authorities, the learned Court below determined the case thus: “Invoking either the rule in Shelley’s case, or the rule in Wild’s Case, we are of the opinion that the word ‘children’ was a synonym for ‘heirs of his body,’ and that the devise being ‘immediate’ and there being no children to take, the farm was devised in tail and this is enlarged by the Act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 368, into an estate in fee. * * * In accordance with the foregoing reasons * * * , judgment is entered for the defendant for the whole of the above described property.” The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>

In Elliott v. Diamond Coal and Coke Co., <a href="/pa/230/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="230 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="8846353" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0423-01">230 Pa. 423</a>, a devise to a daughter “To have and to hold unto my said daughter and her children forever” was held to vest an estate for life in the daughter, remainder in fee to the children as a class. Finally, In Vaughan’s Estate, <a href="/pa/230/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="230 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="8846654" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0554-01">230 Pa. 554</a>, a life-estate was given to a wife, at her death one-third of the property was given to a trustee to hold for a daughter, “for her and her children’s sole use and benefit;” held, that the daughter took a life-estate with remainder to her children in fee.</p>

But the question arises, does the first resolution apply when there are no children? Although several of the cases to which we have already referred apparently indicate that this court has recognized the first resolution, yet in none of them have we had occasion actually to apply it in order to rule the matter before us for decision. ■ In fact, this appears to be the first instance where a case has been presented without children in being to take. After an exhaustive examination of the authorities and much thought, we are brought to the conclusion that the resolution does not control under such circumstances, for the reason upon which it rests fails because of the different interpretation which we place upon a devise to a parent and children. Under the second resolution in Wild’s case, as applied in England and originally accepted in Pennsylvania, it was held that such a devise gave the parent and children a joint estate, the children taking immediately and not in remainder. The theory was that, if there were no children in existence at the time of the devise the provision in their favor would fail altogether, unless the parent were given a fee-tail; hence, and for that reason alone, the first resolution. But with us, where the children take in remainder, it is immaterial whether they are, or are not, in existence at the time of the devise or at the time of the death of the testator: Cote v. Von Bonnhorst, <a href="/pa/41/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="41 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="480064" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0243-01">41 Pa. 243</a>, 251; Curtis v.

In Cote v. Von Bonnhorst, <a href="/pa/41/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="41 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="480064" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0243-01">supra,</a> where the devise was to a daughter “to have and to hold to her for and during the term of her natural life and at and immediately after her decease, * * * <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>to her children in fee; bnt if she should die without having children,” then over, we held that the daughter took but an estate for life, and after refusing to treat the word “children” as a word of limitation, and referring to the rule in Wild’s case, Strong, J., said (p. 252) : “Where a limitation is to a parent for life, and to his children by way of remainder, there seems to be no ground, whether there are children or not, for holding the parent to be a tenant in tail,” and (p. 251), “the reason ceases entirely when the gift to the children instead of being immediate is by way of remainder.”</p>
    <p id="b644-4" data-blocks='[["BL_644.5",644,[333,969,1149,1070]]]'>We shall now consider the applicability of the rule in Shelley’s case. In the present instance, as in all other cases, our first inquiry is, looking at the words of the will, what did the testator intend? We entertain no doubt that when Joseph Barnsley devised the farm to “my nephew and to his children,” and provided if the nephew should die without legal issue it was to go to the heirs of his, the testator’s father, he did not at all contemplate that, if the nephew should leave no descendants his heirs should take to the exclusion of the heirs of the testator’s father. Yet, if the words used express an intention that the land shall go to the testator’s nephew and then descend lineally through him to his issue, the rule in Shelley’s case applies and the Court below must be affirmed on that theory. But on the other hand, if the words show that the testator intended the children of his nephew to take as purchaser’s directly from him, the testator, then the rule in Shelley’s case has no application: Kemp v. Reinhard, <a href="/pa/228/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="228 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="969848" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0143-01">228 Pa. 143</a>.</p>

We think not. “Children” is prima facie a word of purchase and not of limitation, and we are convinced that the present testator intended so to use it. Moreover there is no necessity for giving the word an enlarged meaning, for here, under the devise as framed, the estate would vest in the children of the nephew as a class immediately upon any of them coming into existence before his death and there could, therefore, be no possibiliy of an exclusion of descendants. As to the phrase “without issue,” “there is less reluctance to narrow the prima facie meaning of the word ‘issue’ than of” other words; that word may be “applied only to children:” Taylor v. Taylor, <a href="/pa/63/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="63 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1019043" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0481-01">63 Pa. 481</a>, 483. “It is an unbending rule that when a fee-simple * * * is given in remainder after an estate for life to the children of a first-taker, words following containing a limitation over on. default of his issue are held not to raise an estate-tail by implication. In this class of cases ‘issue’ is construed to mean ‘such issue;’ that is, children:” Sheets’ Estate, <a href="/pa/52/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="52 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1002227" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0257-01">52 Pa. 257</a>, 268; Curtis v. Longstreth, <a href="/pa/44/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="44 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="484292" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0297-01">44 Pa. 297</a>, 302-3. “It is well settled also that words importing a failure of issue without the word ‘such,’ following a devise to children in fee-simple or fee-tail, refer to the objects of that prior devise and not to the issue at large:” Daley v. Koons, <a href="/pa/90/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="90 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1065574" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0246-01">90 Pa. 246</a>, 249. The present case falls within these authorities and the words of the devise, “legal issue,” should have been construed to mean, “such children,” and to import a definite failure of issue.</p>
