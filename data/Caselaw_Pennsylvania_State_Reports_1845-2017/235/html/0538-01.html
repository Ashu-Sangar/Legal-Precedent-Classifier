    <p class="summary" id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[149,580,1145,88]]]'>Barbara Lloyd devised her estate in the following words:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b567-7" data-blocks='[["BL_567.7",567,[151,1293,1147,427]]]'>It is clear that the wife, in reasonably apt terms, gave to her husband the power to dispose of one-fourth of her estate between her son, Thomas, and her adopted son, William, “in such shares as my husband, John Lloyd, shall see fit.” There can be no serious doubt, but that a limited power of appointment was vested by the wife in the husband as to one-fourth of her entire estate. Counsel, we understand, concede this proposition.</p>

      <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>In reading the wife’s will it will be noticed that she gave the power to her husband to dispose of the one-fourth of her “entire” estate. Her will in terms devises all her property, “real, personal and mixed of what nature or kind soever.” In disposing of the one-fourth over which he had the power of appointment, the husband gives to one son “a share of all the real estate like Samuel Lloyd and Mary Ann Patten” that is, one-fourth of the real estate. There is nothing in the case stated to indicate the sum of the one-fourth of the wife’s “entire” estate. It may be a mooted question as to whether the husband has fully exercised the power vested in him by bis wife’s will. There may be some part of the one-fourth of the wife’s entire estate yet undisposed of; but that question does not concern us now. So far as it is shown by the husband’s will, he has given one-fourth of the real estate to one son, and to the other son he has given $5.00 “as his full share.” The items six and seven of the husband’s will should be read together, and thus reading them together we find a valid exercise of the power of appointment vested in the husband,. He gives to one son the one-fourth of the real estate and to the adopted son he gives $5.00 as his full share.</p>
