    <p class="summary" id="b108-4" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[332,747,1146,1297]]]'>The Agnew Company was a corporation of the State of New Jersey, with a capital stock of $250,000.00 divided into 5000 shares of the par value of $50.00 each. Upon a proper proceeding begun in the Court of Chancery of that state, having jurisdiction of the affairs of insolvent corporations, it was determined that the said corporation was insolvent; that its outstanding indebtedness, bonded and otherwise, equalled or exceeded the amount of its capital stock; that all of the shares of the said stock had been originally issued by the corporation without its receipt of anything therefor from the parties to whom it was originally issued; that it was necessary in order to pay its debts, that an assessment equal to the full par value of the stock, be levied against all the stockholders; that J. Horace Harding, the present defendant, was then the owner of ten shares of said stock; and that the receiver, who had been previously appointed, be authorized to levy such. an assessment and to proceed to collect the same from the respective stockholders. Basing his right to recover on this decree of the New Jersey court, the plaintiff, the duly appointed receiver, brought this- action in the county of Philadelphia to recover from the defendant the amount of such assessment with interest and costs.</p>

The argument of the learned counsel for the appellee attacking the affidavit in this respect we do not find to be convincing. We shall consider the question in two aspects. Do the facts averred indicate a legal defense to the plaintiff’s claim? Is such defense here available in the face of the decree <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>entered by the New Jersey court, or would its acceptance amount to a collateral attack on that decree?</p>

The law goes still further and holds that where a person in open market, in good faith and without notice, purchases certificates, such stock is to be deemed 'paid up’ in his hands, and he is protected as a bona fide purchaser, even though there is nothing on the face of the certificates stating that they are paid up. This can now be laid down as the established rule. It is based on sound public policy, favoring as it does the transfer of personal property and the quasi-negotiability of stock and discountenancing secret liens and constructive notice.” The principle thus deduced by the learned author has been clearly stated and followed in the decisions of the courts of last resort of a number of the states of the Union as well as in England. In Finletter v. Appleton, <a href="/pa/195/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="195 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="914105" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0349-01">195 Pa. 349</a>, a bill was filed by. the receiver of an insolvent corporation against the company and its stockholders to compel the payment of unpaid subscriptions to its capital stock. The bill averred in detail the manner in which the stock had been originally issued in violation of law and without the receipt by the company of any value therefor. It further averred that certain persons, who became the appellees in the reported case, were at the time of the filing of the bill the owners of certain shares, having received them by transfer from those to whom they were originally issued. "The appellees' demurred on the grounds that the bill disclosed that they were not original subscribers to the stock or promoters of the <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>company but were purchasers of the stock in the market; . . . and that the bill fails to aver that they purchased the stock with notice of the frand alleged in the bill, or were not purchasers hereof for value.” The demurrer was sustained. In affirming the decree, Mr. Justice Mestkezat, speaking for the court, said: “The bill in this case shows that the defendants are owners of, but not the original subscribers to, certain full paid shares of stock. There is no allegation that they are not holders for value or holders with notice of the fraud alleged in the bill. It is conceded that they purchased their stock in the open market. As shown by the pleadings, therefore, the defendants are not responsible to the plaintiff for any unpaid subscriptions on the stock now held by them, and hence can safely rest upon their demurrer.” We must therefore conclude that the affidavit disclosed a legal defense.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b111-4" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[152,1284,1154,1131]],["BL_112.1",112,[304,353,1147,203]]]'>(2) That the New Jersey court had complete jurisdiction of the insolvent corporation and its affairs is not and cannot be denied. Its findings and decree therefore, made within the limits of that jurisdiction in disposing of the affairs of the corporation, cannot be collaterally attacked in the courts of this state. The defendant is therefore concluded by the decree in so far .as it determines the fact of insolvency; the extent of the indebtedness of the insolvent corporation; that its capital stock was issued to the original stockholders in violation of law and without the payment of any money therefor; that an assessment equal to the par value of the stock was necessary to enable its receiver to pay its debts; that this defendant, with the other persons named in the decree, were the holders of the shares of such stock named in the decree; and that the receiver was authorized to proceed with the collection of such assessment. All of these matters were necessarily determined in ascertaining the status of the corporation to its creditors and stockholders, and in so far as these determinations affected the individuals holding the <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>stock, the court was acting within its jurisdiction because it was dealing with them only as a class, qua stockholders, and in this sense and in this respect they were within the jurisdiction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[304,570,1148,1346]]]'>But the defendant as an individual was never within the jurisdiction of that court. No judgment in personam against him could therefore be entered by that court. If this were not true, no citizen of any state could with safety buy in the open market shares in the capital stock of a corporation of a distant state, because he would be compelled at all times to go to that distant state to defend or else be liable to have a personal judgment entered against him. An examination of the decree of the New Jersey court leads us to the conclusion that it does not purport on its face to amount to a personal judgment against this defendant that he pay to the receiver a particular sum of money. Decrees like the one before us are of not infrequent occurrence, and we think there is a consensus of opinion, indicated by all of the decisions, that there still remains to the individual stockholders, when sued in the courts of his domicile in a case like the present one, the right to make any defense personal to himself. That is to say, a defense which cannot be made by the entire body of stockholders as a class, with whom alone the court was dealing, but by him as an individual, such as minority, lunacy, payment or any other defense arising out of the particular circumstances incident to his personal acquisition of the stock.</p>

In Fire Insurance Co. v. Boggs, <a href="/pa/172/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="172 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="874094" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0091-01">172 Pa. 91</a>, a case of that character, Mr. Justice <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>Mitchell used the following language: “The order of the Dauphin county court is conclusive upon the validity and the amount of the assessment, but it does not touch the liability of the defendant to pay. It could not do so, as he has not been heard and therefore cannot be concluded as to defenses which are personal to himself.” In Wood v. Live Stock Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/154/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="154 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="842392" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0157-01">154 Pa. 157</a>, the Supreme Court, in touching upon this aspect of the case then before them, said: “In view of what has been said, the remaining specifications do not require discussion. There is nothing in either of them that would justify a reversal or modification of the decree. Appellants and other policy holders are not concluded by the decree from defending on any ground that is personal and peculiar to themselves, respectively.” The same doctrine is recognized in our own case of Brown v. Spademan, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20Pa.%20Super.%20688" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="29 Pa. Super. 688">29 Pa. Super. Ct. 688</a>.</p>

A brief citation from two of such cases will suffice. In Rood v. Whorton, 67 Fed. Repr. 434, •the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin thus defined the limitations of a decree of the character of the one now under consideration. “It is true, as held in Hawkins v. Glenn, <a href="/us/131/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="131 U.S. 319" data-case-ids="5698550" data-case-paths="/us/131/0319-01">131 U. S. 319</a>, and in Glenn v.

S. 533</a>, that in the absence of fraud, stockholders are bound by a decree against their corporation in respect to corporation matters, and such a decree is not open to collateral attack, as the stockholder is to be deemed privy to the proceedings touching the body of which he is a member. But this rule applies only so far that he cannot question the findings of insolvency and the foundations of an assessment upon the stockholders. Upon any question of individual liability in which are involved his <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>rights as a bona fide holder, or in respect to his special holding of stock, a stockholder is entitled to his day in court and cannot be bound by any ex parte adjudications of liability. There is no adjudication affecting the defense interposed by this defendant, and he is not liable upon his shares of stock.” In Great Western Telegraph Company v. Purdy, <a href="/us/162/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="162 U.S. 329" data-case-ids="6137796" data-case-paths="/us/162/0329-01">162 U. S. 329</a>, we quote the following language from the opinion of the court: “The whole effect of the order of assessment being to fix the amount which any stockholder under his contract of subscription should pay and to authorize the receiver to bring suits for the same, but not to determine whether the present defendant or any other particular stockholder was liable for anyhing. The Iowa court, by sustaining the defense of the statute of limitations, did not deny to the judicial proceeding of Illinois the full faith and credit to which it was entitled.”</p>

That was an action by a receiver against a stockholder to recover an assessment authorized by a decree of a court having jurisdiction of the affairs of the corporation. The defendant interposed the plea of the statute of limitations. To determine the validity of this plea it became necessary to inquire into the nature and effect of the assessment and the decree of the court authorizing it. For if that decree had the effect of a judgment against the defendant, his plea must have been unavailing. Speaking for this court, Henderson, J., said: “The order authorizing the assessment was not a judgment. ... It was conclusive evidence of the necessity for making the assessment and bound the stockholders without personal notice to that extent, but the stockholder sued had the right to set up any defense which he might have to an action on the contract, among which defenses is the <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>plea of the statute of limitations.” Great Western Telegraph Co. y.
