    <p id="b384-5" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[355,498,1149,1682]]]'>On June 10, 1910, at about 8:45 in the evening, George Ott was driving a carriage containing himself and his two-year-old daughter along a public street when his conveyance fell into a ditch or trench opened by the city for the purpose of connecting water-mains; the child was thrown over the dash-board and is alleged to have received serious injuries. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant has appealed and assigns for error the following excerpts from the charge of the trial judge: “The next item to be considered is whether Mr. Ott, as the result of this injury, will be obliged to spend other money for medical services or care of this little girl from this time until she arrives at the age of twenty-one years, when his legal liability would cease. If you find that, as the result of this injury, he would be necessarily required to spend money for her care in the future, medical or otherwise, if the testimony satisfies you of that fact, while there has not been any evidence as to what it would probably be, you will have to apply your good judgment to that, and judge by what has been paid in the past; ascertain, if you can, reasonably, what he would probably be required to expend in the future for such medical treatment, the testimony being, according to some of the witnesses, at least, that she is still by no means well;” and “She (Jennie Irene Ott) would also be entitled to an allowance or compensation for her loss of earning power after she had arrived at the age of twenty-one years, if you find and can find from this evidence that there would be such a loss of earning power after she is of the age of twenty-one years.”</p>

The plaintiff called three doctors who had treated the child, and they should have been asked for their professional opinion concerning the probable duration of her trouble, the nature of the treatment necessary in the future, and for an intelligent estimate of its cost, but there was no real attempt to secure light upon any of these points; in the absence of this, the parts of the charge complained of constitute harmful error. The assignments are sustained, and the judgment is reversed with a venire facias de novo.</p>
