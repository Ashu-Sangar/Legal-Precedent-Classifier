    "head_matter": "Lloyd v. Fretz, Appellant.\nWill \u2014 Power of appointment \u2014 Recital of Power \u2014 Act of June k, 1879, P. L. 88.\n1. Where a testatrix gives to her husband all her property for life and directs that after his ' death one-fourth of her estate should be divided between a son and an adopted son in such shares as her husband should see fit, and the husband without reciting the power gives one-fourth of all real estate to the son and five dollars to the adopted son \u201cas his full share,\u201d the husband validly exercises the power given him by his wife\u2019s will.\n2. Under the Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 88, a power of appointment may be validly exercised without a recital thereof or direct reference thereto.\nSubmitted Feb. 19, 1912.\nAppeal, No. 60, Jan. T., 1912, by defendants from judgment of C. P. Lackawanna Co., June T., 1911, No. 465, for plaintiff on case stated in suit of Mary A. Lloyd and Samuel J. Lloyd to the use of Mary A. Lloyd v. Alice Fretz and M. D. Fretz.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Potter, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to determine marketable title to land belonging at one time to Barbara J. Lloyd, wife of John Lloyd.\nEdwards, P. J., filed tbe following opinion:\nThis case has been before us twice on a rule for judgment for the want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. Each time, for adequate reasons, we refused to dispose of the merits of the case on the record as presented, and we suggested that the controversy could be more satisfactorily considered on a case stated. Our suggestion was accepted by counsel, and the case stated is now before us.\nThe legal questions involved arise from the consideration of two wills, that of Barbara Lloyd, the wife and that of John Lloyd, the husband. Does the will of Barbara Lloyd vest in her husband a valid power of appointment? And, has John Lloyd, in his will, properly exercised the power of appointment so vested in him?\nBarbara Lloyd devised her estate in the following words:\n\u201cI do hereby give, devise and bequeath unto my beloved husband, John Lloyd, all my property, real, personal and mixed of what nature or kind soever, to hold during the term of his natural life, and after his death one-fourth of my entire estate to~go to my son, John D. Lloyd, one-fourth to my daughter, Mary Ann Patten, one-fourth to my son, Samuel J. Lloyd; (the remaining\\ ''one-fourth of my estate to be divided between my son, \\ Thomas T. Lloyd, and my adopted son, William Lloyd, \\ in such shares as my husband, John Lloyd, shall see | fit.)\nIt is clear that the wife, in reasonably apt terms, gave to her husband the power to dispose of one-fourth of her estate between her son, Thomas, and her adopted son, William, \u201cin such shares as my husband, John Lloyd, shall see fit.\u201d There can be no serious doubt, but that a limited power of appointment was vested by the wife in the husband as to one-fourth of her entire estate. Counsel, we understand, concede this proposition.\nThe real dispute relates to the exercise of the power of appointment by the husband. Two of the items in his will read thus:\nItem 6. \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my son, Thomas Lloyd, a share of all the real estate like Samuel Lloyd and Mary Ann Patten, share and share alike, equal shares.\u201d\nItem 7. \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to William Prosser, whom I have raised, the sum of $5.00, as his full share.\u201d\nIt is agreed that the William Lloyd, named in the wife\u2019s will, is the same person as the William Prosser named in the husband\u2019s will. He was an adopted son.\nIn reading the wife\u2019s will it will be noticed that she gave the power to her husband to dispose of the one-fourth of her \u201centire\u201d estate. Her will in terms devises all her property, \u201creal, personal and mixed of what nature or kind soever.\u201d In disposing of the one-fourth over which he had the power of appointment, the husband gives to one son \u201ca share of all the real estate like Samuel Lloyd and Mary Ann Patten\u201d that is, one-fourth of the real estate. There is nothing in the case stated to indicate the sum of the one-fourth of the wife\u2019s \u201centire\u201d estate. It may be a mooted question as to whether the husband has fully exercised the power vested in him by bis wife\u2019s will. There may be some part of the one-fourth of the wife\u2019s entire estate yet undisposed of; but that question does not concern us now. So far as it is shown by the husband\u2019s will, he has given one-fourth of the real estate to one son, and to the other son he has given $5.00 \u201cas his full share.\u201d The items six and seven of the husband\u2019s will should be read together, and thus reading them together we find a valid exercise of the power of appointment vested in the husband,. He gives to one son the one-fourth of the real estate and to the adopted son he gives $5.00 as his full share.\nThe title of the plaintiffs in this case depends upon the validity of the devise by John Lloyd of the one-fourth interest in the real estate to the son, Thomas. We are of the opinion that the devise is valid and that the title is good.\nIt is not necessary to discuss at length the law applicable to the present controversy. As early as 1863, in the case of Graeff v. DeTurk, 44 Pa. 527, it was decided that the English equity rule that where there is a power of appointment among several distributees each shall have an interest in the fund fairly proportioned to the amount for distribution and that the appointment of a nominal share to a beneficiarv is illusory and void, has never been adopted in Pennsylvania.\nThe same doctrine has been recognized in several subsequent cases, cited in counsel\u2019s briefs.\nFor tbe reasons stated tbe plaintiffs are entitled to judgment. An order to this effect has already been signed.\nError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nJohn J. Owens, Jr. and Houck & Benjamin, for appellants.\nIf it were not for the Act of June 4th, 1879, this attempt to execute a power conferred by the will of Barbara Lloyd would be void, in that it does not refer to the power of appointment: Thompson v. Garwood, 3 Whart. 287; Wetherill v. Wetherill, 18 Pa. 265; Keefer v. Schwartz, 47 Pa. 503.\nThe donee of a limited non-exclusive power must so appoint that every one of the objects shall have a share: Neilson\u2019s Est., 17 W. N. C. 158; Russell v. Kennedy, 66 Pa. 248.\nA. A. Vosburg, for appellee.\nUnder the act a power of appointment may be validly executed without a recital thereof, or direct reference thereto: Dillon v. Faloon, 158 Pa. 468; Ingersoll\u2019s Est., 167 Pa. 536; Howell\u2019s Est., 185 Par 350; Aubert\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 447.\nThe validity of a power of appointment of this character is well settled: Seitzinger\u2019s Est., 170 Pa. 500; Forsythe v. Forsythe, 108 Pa. 129; McNeile\u2019s Est., 217 Pa. 179.\nWhere one has a general power of appointment, by will, the property will pass even under a general residuary request in the donee\u2019s will, precisely as if he were the absolute owner: Terpee\u2019s Est., 224 Pa. 482; Francombe v. Hynward, 29 Jurist 344; Finn\u2019s Est., (No. 2), 18 D. R. 408; Graeff v. DeTurk, 44 Pa. 527; Forsythe v. Forsythe, 108 Pa. 129; Darling v. Edson, 4 Pa. Super. Ct. 498; Russell v. Kennedy, 66 Pa. 248.\nMarch 18, 1912:"
