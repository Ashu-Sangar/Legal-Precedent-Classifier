The corporation chartered is not here complaining of the restrictions imposed. But waiving the question of the right of the appellants to be heard, it is evident, as stated in the opinion of the learned judges of the common pleas, that the petitioners for a charter were granted what they asked for.\nThe order is affirmed at the cost of the appellants.",

    "head_matter": "Moose Home Association Charter.\nCorporations \u2014 Charters of the first class \u2014 Restriction as to sale of liquors.\nWhere the petitioners for a charter for a corporation of the first class make it appear to the court that they do not desire or intend that intoxicating liquors shall be furnished or permitted on the premises of the corporation, and the court in granting the charter inserts a restrictive stipulation as to intoxicating liquors, the court cannot subsequently be convicted of an abuse of discretion in refusing to strike such stipulation from the charter.\nArgued Jan. 30, 1912.\nAppeal No. 11, Jan. T., 1912, by George Gane and Marvin E. Reynolds, on behalf of the incorporators, from order of C. P. Montgomery Co., refusing to eliminate restrictive stipulation In re incorporation of Moose Home Association of Bryn Mawr.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Mestrbzat, Potter and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition to eliminate restrictive stipulation in a charter, representing that the petitioners composed a majority of the members of the association.\nThe court in banc filed the following opinion:\nOur decree of incorporation contained a proviso that no intoxicating liquors should be sold, furnished or distributed on the premises of the association. This stipulation was made a part of our decree because the president, vice president and treasurer signed a paper indicating that it was the desire of the said home that no intoxicating liquors should be dispensed upon the premises of the association.\nWe are now asked to eliminate the provision in our decree relating to intoxicating liquors. It is contended that the officers of the association had no authority to file a stipulation against the use of liquors on the premises.\nWe referred the original application to an examiner and submitted to him the following inquiry:\n\u201cDoes the proposed corporation intend to dispose of, distribute or otherwise furnish intoxicating liquors to its members?\u201d\nHe took the testimony of ten witnesses called by the petitioners. Each and every one declared he was opposed to any distribution or sale of intoxicating liquors on the premises. They also intimated that the association, so far as they were able to determine, would not countenance the sale or distribution of liquors by the home. They offered a poster that was displayed by the house committee which reads as follows: \u201cAny member found bringing liquor into the home shall be fined the sum of five dollars and be debarred from all privilege until the same is paid.\u201d The examiner attached to his report as an exhibit one of these posters.\nIt is evident that the court granted the charter, incorporating the provision against intoxicating liquors, in accordance with the expressed desire of the petitioners. If the evidence submitted to the examiner did not express the sentiment of the petitioners, why was it not opposed by some one?\nWe were bound to assume that this testimony was furnished by the applicants for the charter to guide us in formulating our decree. If we eliminate the proviso against intoxicating liquors, we will disregard the declared wishes of certain incorporators, without affording ing them a hearing. We find no justification for any interference with the decree already entered and now on file. The application is refused.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nIrvin P. Knipe, with him Irving P. Wanger, for appellants.\nNo printed brief nor argument for appellee.\nMarch 18, 1912:"
