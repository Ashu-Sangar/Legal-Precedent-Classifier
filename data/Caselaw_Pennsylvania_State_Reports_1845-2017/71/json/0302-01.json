        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nAgnew, J.\nThis cause comes before us upon a case stated, to determine whether certain students at Muhlenberg College in the Second Ward of the city of Allentown, who voted at a municipal election held in that ward on the 11th of October 1870, were legal voters. The question turns wholly upon their residence, the students being otherwise duly qualified voters. The case states\u2014 \u201c that they claimed that their residence was in said college, where they have lived from one to three years ; that they came to Allentown from other counties, for no other purpose than to receive a collegiate education, but intended to leave after graduating.\u201d They consisted of two classes, to which reference will be made hereafter. The charter of Allentown requires the electors, in addition to prescribed qualifications, to be citizens \u201c who. are other-, wise qualified, under the laws of this Commonwealth\u201d (Pamph. L. 1867, p. 389). This sends us at the outset to the first section of the third article of the state Constitution. The portion relating to residence is as follows: \u201c In elections by the citizens, every white freeman of the age of twenty-one years, having resided in this state one year, and in the election district where he offers to vote ten days immediately preceding such election * * * shall enjoy the rights of an elector.\u201d To determine the true residence of these students, we must begin by ascertaining the meaning of the term \u201c resided,\u201d in the Constitution. The first thing in the section striking the attention is, that the single word \u201cresided,\u201d qualifies, without reiteration, both the one year\u2019s residence in the state and the ten days\u2019 residence in the district. Precisely the sam\u00e9 form of expression is repeated in the proviso as to citizens between twenty-one and twenty-two years of age ; the same words \u201c resided\u201d again, and without repetition, qualifying the state and district residence. The qualification is evidently of like character in the clause relating to-qualified voters removing out of the state, who have returned and resided therein six months, and who have resided in the election district as aforesaid. It is obvious, therefore, that the state residence and the district residence are of the same nature, and whatever is necessary to constitute the one, is essential to define the other; the only difference being in their time of duration. The language of the section, thus plain in itself, is rendered completely certain by the history of the introduction of the district residence by the Constitutional'Convention of 1837-38. The tax qualification was a subject of extended debate in the committee of the whole on the third article beginning on page 484, vol. 2, of the Debates, and ending on page 133 of the 3d vol. ; some members opposed the tax qualification as restrictive, while others favored it, not only because taxes were a proper contribution by the elector to the support of the state, but were necessary to identify the voters, by means of the registration and assessment of the taxables. Some who opposed a tax qualification, advocated a registry of voters in lieu, and referred to the recent registry law for Philadelphia city and county, which was then a subject of bitter partisan controversy. Its purpose was alleged to be to prevent frauds by <\u00a3 colonizing\u201d or bringing voters into the precinct immediately on the eve of an election. Much was said therefore on the subject of fraudulent voting. This it is to be presumed led Mr. Mann when the amendment embracing the tax qualification was adopted, to move further to amend by adding : \u201c but no person shall be entitled to vote except in the district in which he shall actually reside at the time of the election.\u201d Ilis amendment was agreed to. Yol. 2, Debates, pp. 560, 561. It did not, however, end the discussion upon the registry law, the tax feature and fraudulent voting. See vol. 3, pp. 30 to 133. But it became evident to the majority that some provision, beside the tax feature, was necessary to identify electors and prevent fraudulent voting, and it led to Mr. Merrill\u2019s proposition requiring a district residence of thirty days: vol. 3, p. 134. It was adopted, fixing the residence at ten days, after voting upon the term of sixty, thirty and twenty days: pp. 134 to 143. This, however, fell along with the other amendments to the report, by a majority of one vote. The ten days\u2019 residence was again proposed on second reading and adopted : Debates, vol. 9, pp. 297 to 320. The whole section as finally amended and adopted will be found at pp. 197-8, vol. 12. Thus an actual fixed residence and home, as the means of identifying the elector, and securing the public against frauds, was the evident purpose of the district residence. The same view of home or domicil is stated by Woodward, J., in Chase v. Miller, 5 Wright 418.\nThe state and district residence thus being of the same nature, it is proper now to exhibit that nature more clearly, in order to define it properly. The absence of judicial decision by this court on the point, makes it necessary to examine it in the light of other provisions in the Constitution, and of judicial determinations in analogous cases, as well as in reference to the purpose of the qualification itself. The Constitution provides that senators and representatives shall be inhabitants of the state, the latter three and the former four years; and the last year, inhabitants of the districts from which they are chosen. \u25a0 So the governor must be an inhabitant of the state seven years. Judges of the Supreme Court shall reside within the Commonwealth, and other judges, while in office, within the district or county for which they were elected. It is evident that the term \u201c inhabitant\u201d or \u201c resident\u201d in these clauses cannot mean one sojourning temporarily, or for some special purpose, but refers to one who has a permanent abode; the domicil of the senator, representative, governor or judge. \u201c Inhabitant\u201d (says Webster), \u201c a dweller; one who dwells or resides permanently in a place.\u201d The judges of this court sitting in Pittsburg for weeks, at the time of general election, though in the prosecution of their business, yet away from home, have never dreamed they had a right to vote there. No one doubts that one domiciled in another state, but resident here for a special purpose of business or pleasure, is ineligible to election as a senator, representative, governor or judge. It is equally clear, that the electors of the state are those who have their Homes within it, and not elsewhere. Their domicil is there, and their home is the place where they permanently reside, and to which they intend to return when away from it. It is also clear, that one domiciled in another state cannot be an elector here, though he be resident here for some temporary purpose, or on some special business, and though his stay may be prolonged upward of a year. Therefore, when the Constitution declares that the elector must be a resident of the state for one year, it refers beyond question, to the state as his home or domicil, and not as the place of a temporary sojourn. This being the character of the state residence, it defines, as we have seen, the district residence; for both are members of the same sentence and are qualified by the same words, \u201c having resided\u201d without repetition. The elector must, therefore, vote at home, not only in the state, but in the district where his home is. His domicil must be there. He may change his domicil within the state, but in order to vote in another district, he must have made the change at least ten days before the election. If he have a fixed and permanent home in one district, he cannot, because dwelling temporarily in another, in the prosecution of his business, vote in the latter. The purpose of the district residence, as we have seen, is not only to identify the elector; but to prevent frauds in elections. But if because he is engaged in sdme business there, he may vote in the district where he is so employed for ten days, what is to prevent his voting at home and in his proper district? In these days of swift travelling, one voting in the morning one hundred miles away from home, where he is temporarily sojourning, might vote again at home before night. He has not lost his domicil, where his family and chief business are, by his temporary sojourn on some special employment.\nAnd again this idea of home or domicil as conveyed by the word \u201cresided\u201d in the Constitution, is strengthened by the origin and use of the term freemen, the noun with which it is coupled. Thus in the laws agreed upon by William Penn on the 5th of May 1682, the second section provides: \u201c That every inhabitant in the said province, that is or shall be a purchaser of one hundred acres of land, or upwards, his heirs or assignees, and every person who shall have paid his passage and taken up one hundred acres of land at one penny per acre, and have cultivated ten acres thereof, and every person that hath been a servant or bondsman, and is free by his service, that shall have taken up his fifty acres of land and cultivated twenty thereof, and every inhabitant, artificer or other resident in the said province, that pays scot and lot to the government, shall be deemed and accounted a freeman of the said province, and every such person shall and may be capable of electing or being elected representatives of the people in Provincial Council, or General Assembly in said province.\u201d A freeman was an allodial proprietor; the opposite of a vassal or feudal tenant ; a free tenant or freeholder as distinguished from a villein. In the Constitution of 1776, he was described as one \u201c having a sufficient common interest with, and attachment to the community,\u201d and as having a \u201cright to elect officers and to be elected to office.\u201d He was also one who was liable to military service. (See my opinion in the case of McCafferty v. Guyer, 9 P. F. Smith 115 to 119 for an historical account of the freemen of the province and state as electors.) The traditionary freeman as thus portrayed was a stable person, a farmer, a resident artificer or mechanic, or other fixed inhabitant, having a community of interest, where he resided, paying to the support of government, and doing military service. In view of the traditionary character of a freeman, when the Constitution of 1790 was framed, the word \u201c resided\u201d was introduced into the third article to define his residence as an elector. The provision reads thus : \u201c In elections by the citizens, every freeman of the age of twenty-one years, having resided in the state two years next before the election, and within that time paid a state or county tax, and which shall have been assessed at least six months before the election, shall enjoy the rights of an elector.\u201d . Two things are noticeable here \u2014 first, that the term \u201c freeman\u201d is not defined, but is used as a well known phrase; and secondly, that the long period of residence and assessment denote permanency of residence.\nIn the Constitution as amended in 1838, though this section was much discussed and altered, this language was retained without alteration, the term of time only being reduced. The nature of the residence remains the same therefore, and its characteristics being unaltered, it strengthens the interpretation that \u201c residence\u201d in the Constitution means home, fixed abode, domicil of the elector, as distinguished from a place of temporary sojourning.\nIn his Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 41, Mr. Story says: \u201cBy the term \u2018 domicil\u2019 in its ordinary acceptation, is meant the place where a person lives or has his home. In a strict legal sense that is properly the domicil of a person where he has his true, fixed, permaneiit home and principal establishment, and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning.\u201d \u201c Two things (he says) must concur to constitute domicil \u2014 first, residence ; and, secondly, the intention of making it the home of the pai\u2019ty. There must be the fact and the intent:\u201d Id. \u00a744. See Pfoutz v. Comford, 12 Casey 422. Says Judge Rush: \u201c The apparent or avowed intention of constant residence, not the manner of it, constitutes the domicil:\u201d note in 1 Binney 351. \u201cIt may be defined (he says) to be a residence at a particular place, accompanied with positive or presumptive proof of continuing it in an unlimited time:\u201d Id.\nUndoubtedly (says Judge King), residence is a question of intention. In cases involving it, the inquiry is quo animo the party either moved to or from the state. And upon the solution of this question, depends the fact, whether the petitioner has gained or lost a residence. But before this question can arise an actual removal must have taken place. A mere intention to remove not consummated, can neither forfeit the party\u2019s old domicil nor enable him to acquire a new one. Removal out of the state, without an intention permanently to reside elsewhere, will not lose residence, nor will a mere intention to remove permanently, not followed by actual removal, acquire it: Case of James Casey, an insolvent debtor, 1 Ashmead 126.\nThese extracts will enable us to understand more clearly the term residence, as denoting that home or domicil which the third article of the Constitution applies to the freemen of the Commonwealth. It means that place where the elector makes his permanent or true home, his principal place of business, and his family residence, if he have one; where he intends to remain indefinitely, and without a present intention to depart; when he leaves it he intends to return to it, and after his return he deems himself at home. It remains now to apply these charaoteristics of residence to the case in hand. The stated case expressly declares that the students referred to in it, came to Allentown from other counties, for no other purpose than to receive a collegiate education, but intended to leave after graduating. It is evident that the college was not their true and permanent home ; their stay there was not to be indefinite, as the place of a fixed abode, until future circumstances should induce them to remove. Their purpose was indefinite and temporary, and when accomplished they intended to leave. They retained their original domicil, for the facts stated show that they never lost it. On this point the authorities are in entire accord. \u201c The third rule I shall extract (said the Master of the Rolls) is, that the original domicil, or as it is called forum originis, or the domicil of origin, is to prevail until the party not only has acquired another, but has manifested and carried into execution an intention of abandoning his former domicil, and taking another as his sole domicil.\u201d Sir Richard Pepher Arden, in Somerville v. Lord Somerville, 5 Vesey 786. See also 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 431, in note; Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 46, 47. This language was adopted by Judge Grier in White v. Brown, 1 Wall. Jr., 217, adding: \u201cA man cannot be considered a vagabond or person without any domicil, for the domicil of origin is not abandoned until a. new one has been intentionally and actually acquired:\u201d Id. 264. See also Judge King\u2019s remarks, supra. And in Lyle v. Foreman, 1 Dall. 480, the defendant was on his way to Fort Pitt, in December 1789, intending to proceed to the Spanish settlements below Natchez, on the Mississippi, when a foreign attachment issued against him. Shippen, president, quashed the attachment, observing: \u201c That while a man remained in the state, though avowing an intention to withdraw from it, he must be considered an inhabitant, and therefore not the object of a foreign attachment.\u201d See also Miller\u2019s Estate, 3 Rawle 312. In Graham v. Commonwealth, 1 P. F. Smith 257, where the question was, whether a soldier who had been two years out of the state as a volunteer in military service, was \u201c an inhabitant of the state, or usual resident therein,\u201d under the seventy-seventh section of the penal code, the present Chief Justice said, \u201chis usual residence was not changed by the fact that he obeyed the call of- the President and volunteered to fight for his country at her command. To hold the contrary would be against the spirit of all our legislation. A soldier is regarded as a voter because a citizen of the residence he left before entering the service, and he votes there wherever he may be.\u201d\nThese principles enable us now to dispose of the first of the two classes into which the stated case divides these students, viz.: \u201c Those who support themselves, or are assisted pecuni arily by persons other than their parents, are emancipated from their father\u2019s families; have left the home of their parents and never intend to return and make it a permanent abode.\u201d Having, as the case states, come to Allentown for no other purpose than to receive a collegiate education, and intending to leave after graduating, they have not lost their home domicil, and could vote there on returning to it though they should not reenter their father\u2019s house.\nEmancipation from their father\u2019s family and independent support, and the leaving of the home belonging to their parents, have not forfeited their own domicil. Their father\u2019s house is not necessarily their home, but the place is where it is. Though not in the bosom of that family, the place of their residence is not lost to them until they have voluntarily changed it and found a new home. Upon the terms of the stated case, it cannot be said they have abandoned their original home, and actually obtained another. The second class needs no comment. They are those students \u201c who are supported by their parents, visit their parents\u2019 home during vacation, and may or may not return there after graduating.\u201d It is clear as to both classes the college is not their home. They are not members of the community among whom they sojourn. They have no common interest; do not intend to live with, or to cast their lot among them. They have no proper motive to interfere in their local affairs. On no proper principle of a true residence should the student vote to-day and fasten on the community officers whom the majority do not desire, then graduate to-morrow and be gone.\nThe great underlying principle of a republic is, that men should be permitted to govern themselves, but not to constrain others. Yet this would be the result of such a shifting vote, which, like the Parthian arrow, pierces as he who casts it flees. There are vague notions of liberty and personal rights, which often impress the mind, and lead it to incline against what may seem to be a restraint. A man is a man everywhere, and the thought is apt to rise, a freeman should vote anywhere. But the only true, wise and rational liberty, founded on the golden rule of doing as one would be done by, and upon the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non \u00a1cedas, is that which is regulated by laws made for the common good.\nThe rights of all men, the peace of society, and the good government of the state, require that the elector should vote at home, in his proper district where he is known, and among those with whom he has cast his lot, until yielding to circumstances, or to a desire of change, he has chosen voluntarily to abandon his former residence, and actually to gain a new one.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Fry\u2019s Election Case.\n1. Students at a college living at the place in which it is located, whether supported by themselves and emancipated from their fathers' families, with no intention to return to their home, or supported by their parents, who visit their home, in vacation, and may or may not return after graduating, have not such residence as will entitle them to vote in the district where the college is.\n2. Under the constitution and election laws, state and district residence are the same.\n3. \u201c Resident \u201d means one who has a permanent abode; it does not include one sojourning temporarily, or for some special purpose.\n4. Removal without intention permanently to reside elsewhere will not lose residence; nor will intention to remove permanently not followed by actual removal acquire it.\n5. Residence under Art. 3, sect. 1, of the Constitution is, that place where the elector makes his permanent or true home, his principal place of business, and his family residence, where he intends to remain indefinitely and without present intention to depart.\n6. The question of residence and authorities extensively examined and discussed in this case.\nMarch 19th 1872.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Agnew, Sharswood and Williams, JJ.\nCertiorari to the Court of Quarter Sessions of LeMgh county: No. 86, to January Term 1871.\nThis case was argued at Harrisburg May 13th 1872.\nThe proceedings in this case were commenced by the petition of citizens of the Second Ward in the city of Allentown, contesting the election of certain persons returned as elected members of the common council of that city.\nThe parties afterwards agreed on the following ease stated:\u2014\nIt is admitted that at the municipal election in the Second Ward of the city of Allentown, held October 11th 1870, George B. Both received 223 votes for the office of common council; George Pry received 218 votes for said office ; that John Nonnemacher received 208 votes for said office; and Eli J. Saeger received 211 votes for said office; that the election officers returned that the said George B. Both and George Pry were elected; that two petitions were filed in due form of law in the Court of Quarter Sessions \u2014 one alleging that said Eli J. Saeger was elected instead of said George Pry to said office, \u2014 the other alleging that said John Nonnemacher was elected instead of said George B. Both to said office; that said George Pry and George B. Both filed their respective answers to said petitions, admitting that the persons named in the petition, except one, did vote; that the following named persons did vote for said George Pry and said George B. Both, to wit, J. A. Schaffer, and ll others.\nIt is further admitted that the said voters are students at Muhlenberg College, an institution of learning located in said ward; that they \u00e1re citizens of the state of Pennsylvania; that they claimed that their residence was in said college, where they have lived from one to three years; that they came to Allentown from other counties for no other purpose than to receive a collegiate education, but intended to leave after graduating; that they were assessed and paid taxes before said election.\nIt is further admitted that these students are divided into two classes, as follows:\u2014\nThe Pirst Class : Those who support themselves, or are assisted pecuniarily by persons other than their parents, are emancipated from their fathers\u2019 families, have left the home of their parents, and never intend to return and make it a permanent, abode. In this class are S. W. Kuhns, and four others.\nThe Second Class: Those who are supported by their parents, visit their parents\u2019 home during vacation, and may or may not return there after graduating.\nIt is further admitted that of the votes cast for said John Nonnemacher and Eli J. Saeger there are three, those of J. H. Neiman, and two others, also students at said college, who claimed residence in said ward; that t]iey did not intend to remain here when they came; that they came to receive a collegiate education, and leave after they graduate.\nThe legality of said votes is disputed, and the question as to the legal effect thereof is submitted as a matter of law for the court. If the court should be of the opinion that the persons named, or any of them, are legal voters, then their votes are to be allowed and counted in favor of the party for whom they were cast. All of said votes which, in the opinion of the court, are illegal, are to be cast out, and then the court to decree in favor of the parties having the highest number of votes.\nOn the 5th of June 1871, the court (Longaker, P. J.) made a decree declaring Eli J. Saeger elected, and the certificate of election theretofore issued to Fry to be void.\nOn the removal of the record by Fry to the Supreme Court, this decree was assigned for error.\nThe charter of the chy of Allentown, approved March 12th 1867, sect. 4, provides: \u201c That the citizens of said city who are otherwise qualified voters under the laws of this Commonwealth, who shall have resided within the bounds of said city at least six months immediately preceding the election,.\u201d shall meet, &c.\nJ.

J. 315; Kneass\u2019s Case, 2 Parsons 581.\nA domicil is where a person has fixed his habitation without any permanent intention of removing therefrom: Crawford v. Wilson, 2 Barb. S. C. 519; Matter of Wrigley, 8 Wend. 142; Phillimore, Law of Dom. 13; Frost v. Brisbin, 19 Wend. 11; Green v. Wyndham, 18 Maine 225.

Gore, 5 Pick. 374; Jennison v. Hapgood, 10 Id. 98. Going to a public institution and residing there solely for the purpose of education, would not, of itself, give a right to vote there, because it would not necessarily change the domicil: Opinion of the Judges, 5 Met. 589; Horne v. Horne, 9 Ind. 99.\nJuly 3d 1872,"
