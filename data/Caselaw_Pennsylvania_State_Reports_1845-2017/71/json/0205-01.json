        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nSharswood, J.\nFunk was the surety of Gangwer on the note in suit, and there was evidence from which the jury could have found that he was discharged from liability because of time given to the principal by a binding contract to that effect. So the learned judge below instructed the jury. But assuming this to be so, he held that if the two letters in evidence of December 21st 1869 and January 6th 1870, by Funk to Frankenfleld, referred to the note in question, and there was a delay to bring suit in consequence of Funk\u2019s request for more time, they contained a binding promise to pay, whatever Funk\u2019s position was previously to his writing the letters. In this we think there was error. Considering Funk as absolved from all responsibility, there is in the letters no absolute promise to pay the debt in consideration of forbearance. In the first, dated December 21st 1869, there is no promise at all.\n\u201c Have patience until about January 3d, and I think you will receive your money.\u201d It evidently means that, in his opinion, he would receive his money from Gangwer by that time. The second, January 6th 1870, states that he had been at Freemansburg, at Bloss\u2019s, Esq., for money already three times, but did not meet him (either Gangwer or Esq. Bloss, or some one else, from whom money was expected). He then adds: \u201c 1 will pay you as soon as the money is obtained.\u201d Admitting this to be an absolute promise to pay the money in a reasonable time, as soon as be, Punk, could obtain it, where was tbe forbearance to sue which was necessary to form the consideration of it ? This suit bad been then actually commenced. But it was not an absolute but only a conditional promise to pay, when be, Eunk, should obtain tbe money from Gangwer, or from bis book accounts, which had been assigned to bim for collection. Tbe justice to whom these books bad been intrusted to sue upon was probably Esquire Bloss, at Freemansburg, and the only fair construction which could be given to this letter is, that as soon as money should be collected from this source he would pay it to Frankenfield. No evidence was given that such money was ever obtained.\nJudgment reversed, and venire facias de novo awarded.",

H. Gangwer and IT. S. Funk on notes of which the following are copies :\u2014\n\u201c $200. Springfield, Pa., July 25th 1867.\nNinety days after date we or either of us promise to pay to Wm.

Springfield, August 8th 1867.\u201d\nSix months after date we or either of us, separately or jointly, promise to pay William Frankenfield, or order, the sum of four 7 cents\nhundred dollars, with legal- interest from date, without defalcation for value received. E. H. Gangwer,\nH. S. Funk.\u201d\nFunk only was served; the return as to Gangwer was \u201cNihil.\u201d Funk was surety for Gangwer in the notes.\nBoth cases were tried together, February 16th 1871, before Chapman, P. J.\nFunk testified on the trial, that in the fall of 1868 and in the spring of 1869, he gave the plaintiff notice to collect the money due on the notes at once, and if he did not, defendant would not hold himself bound; that Gangwer had property, &c. Gangwer assigned his book accounts to Funk, who placed them in the hands of a/justice for collection.\nThe plaintiff gave in evidence the following letters:\u2014\n\u201c Springtown, Bucks co., December 21st 1869.\n\u00a5m. Erankfield, Esq.\nDear Sir: Yours rec\u2019d. Have patience until about Jan. 3d, and I think you will receive your money.\nYours with respect,\nH. S. Funk.\u201d\n\u201c Springtown, Pa.\nJanuary 6th 1870.\nWm. Frankenfield, Esq.\n'Sir: I wrote you I would see and intended to pay you about the 3d.\nI was at Freemansburg, at Bloss\u2019s, Esq., for money already three times, but did not meet him. I was there yesterday. Will go again to-morrow.\nI will pay you as soon as the money is obtained. I will see you yet this week. Yours, H. S. Funk.\u201d\nThe court charged: * * *\n\u201c It is further alleged by defendant, that in the fall of 1868, or spring of 1869, Funk gave notice to Frankenfield to bring suit at once on the notes, against Gangwer, and if he did not do so, he would consider himself discharged. Gangwer says that in the spring of 1869, or in fall of 1868, he was worth $1600, and was able to pay the notes. Sometime after this, his property was swept away by fire, and there was not enough left to meet this responsibility. These suits were not brought till February Term 1870, so that the delay on Frankenfield\u2019s part extended beyond the period when the fire occurred. Funk, the surety, contends that inasmuch as the plaintiff did not institute suits immediately, he is discharged. The law, as laid down by defendants\u2019 counsel, is correct. When a surety gives notice to the creditor to institute suit, and declares if he does not, he will hold himself discharged, if the creditor allows time to elapse, during which the principal debtor fails, the creditor\u2019s laches may be visited upon him. He holds the evidences of debt, and is bound to institute suit at once, if he gets notice, or take the consequences. Mere delay, however, will not absolve the surety. Funk testifies, that in the fall of 1868, he told Frankenfield to collect the money at once, or he would not be responsible. If this be true, he did all the law required him to do. Frankenfield denies the statement made by Funk, and says, instead of Funk giving him notice to proceed, he asked him to delay proceeding. Which will you believe ? According to Frankenfield, there was no such notice given as will absolve Funk. If you believe Funk, he did at this stage of the business all he was required to do. But even if you believe Funk, there is still a question arising as to the effect of the two letters addressed by him to Frankenfleld before the suits were instituted. And upon the solution of this question the case turns. What is the effect of the two letters to which I referred ? In the first letter, dated December 21st 1868, Funk writes to Frankenfield, \u2018 Have patience till January, I think you will receive your money.\u2019 The second letter is dated January 6th 1869, and therein Funk promises to pay the money as soon as it is obtained. It is an established rule of law, that forbearance to sue upon a promise, constitutes a consideration. Even supposing Funk at this time had been absolved from the payment of the notes, if he promised to pay in case Frankenfleld would forbear to sue Gangwer, he is bound. The forbearance for one day to sue, constitutes a consideration. When one man engages, if a creditor will forbear to sue a third person he will pay the debt, and the creditor does forbear, he will be hound. Did Frankenfleld forbear to sue ? These letters-must be scanned closely. If they referred to these notes, and there was a delay to bring suit in consequence of Funk\u2019s request for more time, then I say there was a binding promise to pay, whatever Funk\u2019s position was previously to his writing the letters.\u201d\nThe verdicts were for the plaintiff for f>221.66 and $311.21 respectively.\nOn removal of the case to the Supreme Court, the defendant \u2022 assigned the charge of the court for error.\nCr. Lear, for plaintiff in error.\nJ. L. Dubois, for defendant in error.\nMarch 21st 1872,"
