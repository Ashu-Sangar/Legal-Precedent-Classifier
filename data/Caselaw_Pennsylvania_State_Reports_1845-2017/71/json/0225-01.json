        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nSharswood, J.\nIn the court below this cause was referred under the Act of January 20th 1870, Pamph. L. 85, extending to Susquehanna county the provisions of the act entitled \u201c An act authorizing the reference of civil actions in the county of Bradford,\u201d passed April 6th 1869, Pamph. L. 725. By the 4th section of this latter act it is provided that the referee \u201c shall state the facts found and the conclusions of law separately, and his decision shall be given and may be excepted to and reviewed in like manner as though tried by the court with a jury, but not otherwise.\u201d It follows that upon the rulings of the referee on the trial before him upon questions arising as to the admission or rejection of evidence, the party objecting must take his exception at the time, and that on review in this court the finding of the referee as to the facts must be regarded as conclusive, just as the verdict of a jury. It is evident that the act contemplates that there shall be in each case what is equivalent to a special verdict. The finding of the referee must have the same certainty and fulness as is required in a special verdict, so that the judgment shall be the conclusion of law upon the facts. Ten days, however, are given after the report is entered to file exceptions thereto, which we take clearly to have been intended by the legislature as a substitute for bills of exceptions to the charge of a court and their answers to points presented. No power is given by either of these acts to the Court of Common Pleas over the decision of the referee. \u201c The report,\u201d says the Act of 1869, \u201cof the said referee upon the whole issue shall stand as the decision of the court, and judgment shall be entered in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the court before a jury.\u201d\nWe think there was error in the conclusion of the referee upon the facts as found by him. Indeed upon a very material question the finding would be bad as a special verdict for uncertainty. He says: \u201c The sheriff\u2019s sale on Lathrop\u2019s judgment was at Mrs. Deans\u2019s house; cheese not there but was at factory, or had been sold previously by the committee.\u201d When sold ? previously to the levy or previously to the sale ? If previously to the levy, it is abundantly clear that Baxter had no interest remaining in any cheese, but if had been converted into a mere money demand on the factory. But suppose that no sale had taken place? The arrangement as proved between the farmers \u2014 owners of milk \u2014 and the cheese factory, is somewhat peculiar. It certainly did not constitute the parties partners. Nor were the milk-owners tenants iu common of the cheese when manufactured. No one could have claimed an individual share, and considered the sale by the factory as a conversion. Neither replevin nor trover could have been maintained. By the agreement \u25a0 the milk delivered from time to time by the different customers was thrown into a common mass, made into cheese, sold by the committee of the factory, and then the milk paid for at the price produced b.y the cheese, allowing ten and a half pounds of milk to one pound of cheese, deducting the cost of manufacturing. \u201c The practice at the 'factory,\u201d says the referee, \u201c was to credit the different patrons of that establishment with the number of pounds of milk received \u2014 to charge them one and a half cent per pound for what cheese was made \u2014 to credit the parties again with the proceeds of the sales in proportion to the amount of milk brought.\u201d There was evidently no bailment or agency as to the particular milk delivered. By the very terms of the agreement it was to he mixed and confused in part or in whole with other milk indefinitely. It was a sale of the milk to the factory, for which they were to pay at a certain time and in a. certain manner. It is not to he distinguished from the case of Jenkins v. Eichelberger, 4 Watts 121. There the contract was to deliver hides to a tanner at a certain price \u2014 the hides when tanned to he returned to the person who had delivered them, to he sold by him, and out of the proceeds, after deducting the price at which they had been delivered, the balance to be paid to the tanner. It was evidently a contrivance by which the hides were to be protected from the creditors of the tanner, but this court held it to be a sale. The same doctrine ivas maintained in Prichett v. Cook, 12 P. F. Smith 193. It is true in both these cases' the question was as to creditors of the manufacturer. But upon the facts as reported by the referee, it does not appear that there was anything to qualify the effect of the absolute delivery of the milk, to be used and mixed indiscriminately with other milk, and for which the party was afterwards to receive a credit at a certain rate. Baxter had then, from the delivery of the milk, a mere demand for the price of its product as agreed upon; and his interest was not such as could be seized and sold on a writ of fieri facias.\nJudgment reversed.",

Under the Acts of April 6th 1869 and January 20th 1870 (the reference of oases in Bradford and other counties), exceptions to the referee\u2019s rulings on evidence must be taken at the time they are made, on review in the Supreme Court the finding of the referee as to facts is as conclusive as a verdict.\n2. The finding of facts is equivalent to a special verdict, and must have the same fulness and certainty, so that the judgment on the report shall be the conclusion of law on the facts.\n3. The exceptions to the report are the substitute for bills of exception to the charge of the court and answers to points.\n4. The Common Pleas has no power over the decision of the referee.\n5. Baxter and numerous other farmers delivered milk to a cheese factory ; each was credited\u201d7with the amount of his milk, and all was manufactured together; the company sold all the cheese ; each farmer was charged with the expense, and received his share of the proceeds in proportion to the milk furnished. Baxter\u2019s interest in the cheese, &e., was sold under an execution against him. Held, that the sale by the factory converted his interest into a money demand, and this interest was therefore not the subject of a levy.\n6. The arrangement at the factory did not constitute the farmers\u2019 partners, nor tenants in common in the cheese: nor was there an agency or bailment as to the particular milk delivered.\n7.

Agnew, J., at Nisi Prius.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Susquehanna county: No. 52, to January Term 1872.\nThis action was commenced January 27th 1869, before a justice of the peace, by A. & D. R. Lathrop against A. D. Butterfield; the justice gave judgment for the plaintiff for $57 85 ; the defendant appealed from the judgment to the Court of Common Pleas, where it was referred to I. E. Carmalt, Esq., under the Act of April 6th 1869 (Pamph. L. 725), authorizing references in the county of Bradford; extended with additions to Susquehanna and Wyoming counties, by Act of January 20th 1870 (Pamph. L. 85).\nBy these acts parties by agreement may refer their cases to one referee, the trial to be conducted as \u201cby the court with a jury;\u201d the referee to state the facts found and his conclusions of law separately, his decisions may be excepted to and reviewed as if tried by the court with a jury, \u201c and the referee may as the court, settle exceptions on appeal or writ of error to' the Supreme' Court.\u201d \u201c The report of the referee on the whole issue shall stand as the decision of the court, and the judgment shall be entered as if the action had been tried by a court before a jury; incase of reversal on appeal or writ of error the Supreme Court shall enter the proper judgment or direct a new trial,\u201d &c. The prothonotary shall enter judgment on the report, and either party may file exceptions to the report within ten days, but not after, and that there may be opportunity for a writ of error or appeal to Supreme Court, execution shall not issue within three weeks from the entry of judgment.\nThe following is the referee\u2019s report on the facts :\u2014\n\u201c On the 1st of April 1868, O. W. Baxter took the farm of Mrs. Zilpha Deans to work on halves for one year, to be to one-half of the expense and have one-half of the products. Ten cows upon the property were included in that arrangement.\n\u201c He first made butter, but subsequently, after consulting Mrs. Deans, took his milk to the \u2018Bridgewater Cheese Factory,\u2019 to be made into cheese and sold according to the custom of that establishment. He commenced carrying milk to the factory on the 18th day of May, A. D. 1868. He ceased working and left the farm on the 22d day of July, A. D. 1868 ; how and under what circumstances does not appear.\n\u201c A. D. Butterfield, the defendant in this action, testified, and was not contradicted, that in the year 1868 he was one of a committee of three to manage the \u2018 Bridgewater Cheese Factory,\u2019 on the part of its patrons, and sell the cheese. He only kept the books of sale. The practice at the factory was to credit the different patrons of that establishment with the number of pounds of milk received \u2014 to charge them one and a half cent per pound for what cheese was made \u2014 to credit the parties again with the proceeds of the sales in proportion to the amount of milk brought. He, with two others upon the committee, had charge of all sales of cheese in 1868. He kept the books containing the account of the sales, but only knew whom the cheese was made for by the account, which was kept by a girl at the factory. By that account, Butterfield, the defendant, settled with Mrs. Beans and paid her $273.73. This included Mrs. Deans\u2019s personal account and Deans and Baxter\u2019s account. The latter began May 30th and concluded July 25th 1868. After which time the account was kept in the name of Mrs. Deans. At the end of the season the defendant paid the whole of both accounts to Mrs. Deans.\n\u201cDeans and Baxter were credited at the factory from the 18th day of May to the 22d day of July with 10,422 pounds of milk. The average amount of milk during the season required to make a pound of cheese, was 10J pounds. The average of sales that season was 14f cents per pound net for cheese. One-half the above cheese only belonging to Baxter, the referee holding the quitting of Baxter and the change of the account from Deans & Baxter to Mrs. Deans to constitute a surrender at law, and cannot affect third parties in interest.\n\u201c By the sheriff\u2019s return to judgment as No. 575 of August Term 1868, interest on note given by O. W. Baxter to A. & D. R. Lathrop, the note being given to satisfy an account at A. & D. R. Lathrop\u2019s store of $52.15; the balance was fictitious or to secure future advance.\n\u201c He, the sheriff, received his writ July 20th, at 8J o\u2019clock A. M., 1868, and sold a quantity of cheese (which was proved to have been Baxter\u2019s interest in the cheese at the factory) on the 30th day of July.\n\u201c The sale took place opposite Mrs. Deans\u2019s house, about ten rods from it. She did not forbid the sale, though she said to D. R. Lathrop, who bid off the cheese, and to the sheriff, that \u2018 they\u2019d better not touch anything \u2014 they might, get their fingers burned.\u2019\n\u201cImmediately after sheriff\u2019s sale, Butterfield, the defendant, was notified that A. & D. R. Lathrop had bought Baxter\u2019s interest in the cheese at the factory and wanted the money for it when sold.\n\u201c The practice at the factory was to sell the cheese at the factory at different times through the season. The cheese was made in bulk, and there was no separation of the cheese. The factory is about one and a half mile from Mrs. Deans\u2019s farm-house. The sheriff\u2019s sale on Lathrop\u2019s judgment was at Mrs. Deans\u2019s house; cheese not there, but was at factory, or had been sold previously by the committee.\u201d\nHe stated his conclusions of law as follows :\u2014\n\u201c Defendant\u2019s law points. * * *\n\u201c 3. That there was no levy upon the cheese, it not being a chattel \u2014 the sale was irregular.\n\u201c As a legal principle, the referee concedes this point, but does not think it sustained by any evidence on the subject of the levy but the return of the sheriff, which appears to be regular.\n\u201c 4. That the taking of the milk to the factory was a sale of the milk, and the proper remedy to secure Baxter\u2019s interest was attachment, instead of levy and sale.\n\u201c From this position the referee dissents. Those working in the factory were in the employ of the patrons of the factory, making and selling cheese for those patrons at a fixed price, cent per pound. The patrons left their milk at the factory as bailors, to be manufactured into cheese by the bailees, who also possessed a power of sale over the product.\n\u201c5. A tenant leaving before the expiration of his lease, has no interest in the property upon the farm.\n\u201c This may be true of growing crops or other after-acquired property, but cannot be true as against the vested interest of third parties, where, as in this case, there is no evidence of damage or dissent.\u201d * * *\nThe defendant removed the record to the Supreme Court.\nLittles and Blaheslee, for plaintiff in error.\nJ. B. 'A. H. McQollum, for defendants in error.\nMarch 30th 1872,"
