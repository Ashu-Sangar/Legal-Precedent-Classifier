Hence, a power relating to real estate given in a will to executors was a mere common-law power to them, <em>nominatim ; </em>it did not therefore pass to executors, nor could it be exercised by an administrator <em>de bonis non cum testamento annexo. </em>The subject is learnedly and ably investigated by Mr. Justice Cowen, in Conklin <em>v. </em>Egerton’s Administrator, <a href="/wend/21/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="21 Wend. 430" data-case-ids="2151940" data-case-paths="/wend/21/0430-01">21 Wendell 430</a>. The common law in this respect was changed in this state by the Act of Assembly of March 12th 1800, 3 Sm. L. 433, which provided, that where there was either a devise to executors to be sold, or a naked power to them to sell, it should survive upon the death of one or more, or be exercised by the acting executor in case one or more renounced, or by an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>when all die or renounce. These provisions were all incorporated by the revisers in the Act of February 24th 1834, sections 13, 14, 67: Pamph. L. pp. 75, 86. As to the administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>it is expressed thus: <em>‘ </em>all and singular the provisions of this act relative to the powers, duties and liabilities of executors are hereby extended to administrators with the will annexed.’ In their report they declare, that for the sake of brevity they have introduced this general provision, placing administrators with the will annexed on the same footing in every respect with executors: 2 Parke &amp; Johnson 765. Whether this Act of 1800 was or was not supplied and repealed by the Act of 1834, it seems very clear and has always been considered that the intention of this legislation was confined to powers given to executors as such <em>virtute officii, </em>and did not extend to a power of sale collateral to or unconnected with their duties as executors : Ross <em>v. </em>Barclay, 6 Harris 179; Keefer <em>v. </em>Schwartz, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20503" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 Wright 503">11 Wright 503</a>; Waters <em>v. </em>Margerum, 10 P. F. Smith 44. It was held in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Forney, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20853" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 853">3 W. &amp; S. 853</a>, that where executors are dismissed 'and an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed is appointed, it is the duty of the court to take a bond with sureties in an amount commensurate with the powers and trusts contained in the will. This case was upon a bond given prior to 1832 ; but by the Act of March 29th of that year, § 23, Pamph. L. 195, it was expressly directed that when an executor shall be dismissed, the court shall award new letters to be granted by the register upon such security as the court shall think proper. The ordinary cases of a grant, of administration by the register, on the death or renunciation of executors, were provided for by the eighteenth and nineteenth sections of that act, without any special direction as to security; that resting on the twenty-seventh section, which declares that in case of any grant of administration, the bonds should have respect to the value of the estate. The eighth section of the Act of April 22d 1856, Pamph. L. 533, first made specific provision that the register, in granting letters of administration with the will annexed, should ‘ take adequate security for the faithful accounting <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>for the proceeds of any sales of real estate the administrator may make under such will.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b53-6" data-blocks='[["BL_53.4",53,[200,494,1160,1717]]]'>“A general power to sell will of course be conclusively presumed to be for the payment of debts ; for a purchaser is never required to call for or look into an account, or demand an inventory of personalty or list of debts. Such was the power in Meredith’s Estate, 1 Parsons 438. Mr. Binney’s opinion, Hood on Executors, p. 241, note. About the authority of an administrator with the will annexed, in such a case, there could be no question. A power also to sell for the purpose of distributing the proceeds amongst persons named or described in the will is a power which it seems equally clear belongs to the executor <em>virtute officii. </em>This would be the case without any question where there is an absolute direction to sell, and not a mere discretionary power, for in that case the estate would be converted into money from the death of the testator; but the same rule, as it appears to me, applies where there is only a power. In the case of Keefer <em>v. </em>Schwartz, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20503" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="11 Wright 503">11 Wright 503</a>, there was indeed an absolute direction, but it is not rested on this ground in the opinion. Mr. Justice Strong said: ‘ The executors were not made testamentary trustees of the property. They were directed to sell for distribution. Their powers and duties were official by virtue of their office.’ Some difficulty appears to have arisen in the minds of counsel, from what was evidently merely a dictum of Chief Justice Gribson, in Ross <em>v. </em>Barclay, that ‘ no statute of Pennsylvania empowers an administrator, with the will annexed, to execute a trust of land confided to an executor by title or name for any other purpose than to sell for payment of debts;’ and his declaration in the same case,* that a power could not be exercised by such administrator ‘to turn the land into money for the convenience of partition.’ This last phrase is repeated in Waters <em>v. </em>Margerum. In both of these cases the trust extended beyond the sale and distribution <em>virtute officii </em>to an investment; in short a trust for a collateral purpose. The executors were, in both these cases, testamentary trustees, and they were invested with the power as such. These <em>dicta </em>were, therefore, entirely aside from the case. For myself, I may say, that I copied the phrase from Ross <em>v. </em>Barclay, as is often done in the hurry of composition, and it passed without notice in consultation. I may have, and probably had, in my mind, not a sale for purposes of distribution, but what is not uncommon in the country, a power to executors to make partition with an ancillary power of sale and conveyance for that purpose.</p>
