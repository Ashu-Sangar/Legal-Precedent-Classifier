      <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>The cause of action was the loss by the plaintiff occasioned by his team and wagon having been precipitated into an excavation on the side of a public road, by which he lost a mule and had his harness and wagon injured. The road at the point where the injury occurred was about 23 feet wide; the excavation had been made by mining for ore by the Allentown Iron Company; there was no fence or other guard at the place of the excavation, and the road was there somewhat descending; in driving down the road the front wheel on the left or near side of the wagon sank into the ground near the edge of the bank which gave way; the wagon and team went over, and one of the mules was so badiy injured as to be worthless. The plaintiff gave evidence also for the purpose of showing that the road at that point was in a dangerous condition.</p>

They gave evidence also for the purpose of showing that the wagon and team belonged to the Allentown Iron Company, by whom the excavation into the side of the road had been made. It appeared that the team had belonged to the company; it had been sold to the plaintiff for $1700; he was to pay $50 per month till it was paid for; at the time of the accident he was hauling for the company, and had then paid $902 on account of the purchase-money.</p>

The finding of the jury has acquitted him of that, and he was consequently entitled to a recovery compensating his injury. It was not a defence to the township to show that by careful driving accident might have been avoided at the place in question. That would fall far short of what is the purpose of a public highway. It must be kept in such repair that even <em>skittish </em>animals may be employed without risk of danger on it, by reason of the condition of the road.
