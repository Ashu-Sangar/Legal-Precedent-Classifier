      <em>“ </em>We have therefore the fact established, that the testator, soon after his first marriage, and of course not long after he received the money of his first wife, declared that he had between four and five hundred dollars of her money, which was put in the property that he then owned for her children, that after he had sold that property he declared that he had loaned that money to an individual till he could buy again ; and that when he purchased another property he invested the same money therein, where it was to remain till after his death, and then it was to go to the children of his first wife. That he repeated these declarations in almost <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>the same words to different persons from time to time, for a term of about forty years down to a short time before his death. The auditor is of the opinion that these declarations, although none of them were shown to have been made at the time when he received the money, are clearly evincive of the intent of the testator at the moment of reduction to possession, and that they repel the presumption of personal acquisition by the testator, and establish the relation of trustee of the money for the children of the first wife. * * *</p>

If the auditor is correct in his conclusions, the testator did create a trust of this fund for the children of his first wife. A trust once effectually created by parol cannot subsequently be extinguished, revoked or altered by the party creating it, any more than a more formal assurance. He disposes of his own property, says nothing about trusts or trust property, and revokes all other wills, legacies and bequests by him before that time made. It may be remarked that while the claimants are bound to prove their case fully and completely, so as to bring themselves within an exception to a general rule of property, they are not to be held to anything further. They are not to be visited with the, effects of any sympathy for the testator’s legatees and devisees, who are only volunteers, and therefore hound by testator’s acts and declarations as effectually as he himself would be if living. The trust having been established, the burden of proof is thrown upon the volunteers to lift it from the estate.</p>

The question of a trust of the money Jacob Dellinger received, through his marriage with his first wife, for her children, depended on the credibility of the witness Jacob Strawbridge. Evidence was given to contradict as well as to corroborate his testimony. In such a case the auditor, who has seen the witnesses, has heard them examined and compared their oral statement, is much more capable of judging of the credibility of the testimony than we can possibly be. Therefore, when his report is confirmed by the court below, we ought not to set it aside except for plain mistake. It is not possible, on the evidence before us, to assert that such plain mistake exists. The trust therefore must be accepted as he has found it to be.</p>

The testimony of the litigants themselves was excluded as falling within the second clause of the proviso to the 1st section of the Act of 15th April 1869, which declares that the act shall not apply to actions by or against executors, administrators or guardians. But the <em>witnesses, </em>as wife and husband, had no personal interest in this controversy, and were not parties to it. They were not to be excluded unless they fall within the first clause of the proviso prohibiting a husband or wife from testifying against each other. The witnesses being neither parties nor interested, their exclusion could rest only on the ground of policy. But this policy is removed by the enactment which declares that no policy of law shall exclude a person from being a witness in any civil proceeding, while the exception to the enactment does not embrace a husband and wife <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>called, to testify for each other. The first clause of the proviso, therefore, brings them within the force of the maxim, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius. </em>The second clause of the proviso evidently applies to parties or interested persons, and not to those who had at law been excluded from policy alone. The witnesses not being parties to the issue in controversy, and not being interested, were therefore competent.</p>
