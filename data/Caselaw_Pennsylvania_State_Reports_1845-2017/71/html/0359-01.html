The boundaries of the land must be designated with sufficient clearness, so that it could be run off upon the ground with reasonable accuracy and certainty.

If, however, after a careful consideration of all the evidence in the cause, your minds are fully and clearly satisfied that the defendants have made out such a parol sale as the law requires, it will then be the duty of the jury to ascertain and determine where is the southern boundary of the land that was bought by John Rowles from the plaintiff. The plaintiff contends that the defendants must be limited in their claim to 90 acres of land out from the upper line extending towards the creek. The defendants claim that the creek was fixed by the parties as one of the boundaries when the bargain was made. [If, when the bargain was made between Ardery and Rowles, it was agreed and understood between them that the land bought was to extend to the creek and the creek to be the boundary, then defendants’ claim would extend to the creek, and if there was an excess over and above the 90 acres, the defendants must pay for the excess at the price agreed upon per acre.] But if the bargain was that defendants were to ¡start at the upper line and run towards the creek so as to make but 90 acres, then defendants cannot extend their claim further towards the creek than to make the 90 acres. As we have before said to you, the proof as to the boundaries must be clear, distinct and satisfactory, and if it is a doubtful question whether defendants’ southern boundary is the creek, it must be determined against them, and defendants must be limited in their claim to the 90 acres laid out from the upper line.” * * *</p>

The jury found that that was Clearfield creek, and for this there was sufficient testimony if believed, as it was by the jury. But the plaintiff claimed to fix the boundary by the quantity of land in the strip sold. Having established an initial point and line, the plaintiff claimed ’that this should control the line at the other end of the strip or tract, at a point which would include 90 acres. So it would, if this had been the terms of the contract. But it was not; the land was to go to the creek as the jury have found; and whether from the initial line» or boundary there should be more than 90 acres, it mattered not, for the boundary would control the quantity. The boundaries being fixed, the quantity remained to be ascertained by them, and whatever that was, passed by the sale. The plaintiff was sdcure on these terms, for he was to 'be paid by the acre. Nothing could be more proper than the views expressed by the learned judge as to this matter. It constitutes the first assignment of error in the case, and is not sustained.</p>
