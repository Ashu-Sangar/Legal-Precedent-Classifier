The answer was, that he offered to prove the facts and matter set out in the notice of special matter as given to the counsel for the plaintiff. This notice was produced, and stated on its face that “ the facts the evidence will be offered to prove, are more fully set out in the copy of the affidavit of defence hereto annexed.” Copies of two affidavits are attached. The plaintiff then objected to this statement, and required the defendants to state which of the matters and things contained they intended to prove by this witness. To this call there was no response, and the learned judge thereupon rejected the offer. It is well established that, when a witness is offered, the counsel of the party producing him may be called on to state what he proposes to prove by him, in order that if the facts are irrelevant, they may be excluded: Small v. Jones, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 122" data-case-ids="480173" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0122-01">6 W. &amp; S. 122</a>; McClelland <em>v. </em>Lindsay, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20362" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 362">1 W.&amp; S. 362</a>; Milliken <em>v. </em>Barr, 7 Barr 23. It is an evasion of this rule, for a party when thus called on, to refer to the affidavit or affidavits filed in the ease. If they are read, and their pertinency discussed in open court, it brings before the jury the sworn <em>ex parte </em>statement of the defendant without the opportunity of cross-examination. Such a practice is altogether irregular, and the learned judge below committed no error, especially when the defendants, though called on, did not state which of the matters and things contained in the affidavits they intended to prove by the witness.</p>
