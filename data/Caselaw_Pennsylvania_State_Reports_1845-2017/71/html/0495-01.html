No one, save the perpetrator himself, witnessed it; and. there is, therefore, no direct or positive evidence to be appealed to.. Indeed where wilful and deliberate murder— contemplated for any considerable time beforehand — is committed, it rarely occurs that direct or positive proof, in respect to it, exists. Perpetrated, as such murder usually is, by lying in wait for the victim, or by means of poison, the only evidence in relation to it must commonly be found in the circumstanc.es attending it. And this character of testimony is found, as well by experience, as by reason, to be little, if any, less satisfactory and certain than direct or positive evidence. Where the circumstances relied upon are properly established, and the inferences arising from each one, and from all of them combined, point naturally and unequivocally in one direction, there is no greater danger in following them to their conclusion, than attends .all human investigation. That we may err in such cases is possible — but so we may where the evidence is direct or positive — the circumstances may, possibly, mislead,'but so may the eyes, or the ears, or the dishonesty of witnesses.</p>

We find wounds upon her body apparently made by rifle or pistol balls; we also find the balls; and without more, none of us hesitate to draw the inference that she was killed by a firearm of some description; but this is rendered, if possible, more conclusive by the circumstance that the report of a firearm was heard immediately before. Thus is one fact established.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b499-9" data-blocks='[["BL_499.7",499,[187,1631,1165,518]]]'>“ Then, upon examination of the ground in the vicinity, a firearm is found, half hidden in the grass and shrubbery, within a few feet of where' she lay. It is extraordinary in its character, apparently an army rifle or musket cut down in the barrel and stock, capable of receiving and sustaining a heavy charge. It is empty, and, as the witnesses say, appears to have been recently discharged— burned powder is in the muzzle, and an exploded cap, still bright, is on the tube. These circumstances, considered with the fact that the report heard was extraordinarily loud, that three balls were discharged, and one driven entirely through the body, do not leave the mind in doubt that it was with this firearm the crime was committed. The prisoner’s counsel admit this to be so.</p>

If this testimony is believed — and it is not contradicted or impeached — it cannot be doubted that this firearm, with which the crime was committed, belonged to the prisoner.</p>

It is blackened, and has upon it the odor of gunpowder. 'You will judge whether this was, or was not, the wadding used in the charge with which she was killed. Other pieces of calico, of similar pattern and manufacture, are produced, which the witnesses inform us were found in the prisoner’s house, the day following the murder, some of them in a drawer with balls and percussion caps. From this latter circumstance the Commonwealth asks you to infer that the charge with which Mrs. Spence was killed was placed in the pistol at the prisoner’s house, or from his ammunition. It is in evidence, however, that goods of the same pattern and material as the supposed wad, are sold from one of the stores of this town. You will judge whether it is safe to infer that the pistol was loaded at the prisoner’s house or from his ammunition. This question does not, however, strike us as of very great importance, inasmuch as, if the ammunition is found to have been his, the case of the Commonwealth is not advanced by it a step beyond the point to which the inference arising from his ownership of the pistol has carried us. The inference from this fact — the ownership of the pistol (if it were his), — as we have before remarked, would of itself be insufficient to warrant the conclusion that <em>he </em>used it on the occasion of the murder. And the result would be the same if t.he ammunition with which it was loaded, was also shown to be his. He might have parted with the possession of the pistol, as he alleges, shortly previous to the commission of the crime (and if he did so it would be as likely to be loaded with his ammunition as not). Still, as we have before observed, the inference from his ownership would be strongly against him, exciting suspicion and calling for explanation. The prisoner evidently saw and felt this to be so; and therefore'declared, when before the magistrate, Mr. Hibbard, the day after the murder, that he had parted with his pistol three weeks before that time — that he lost it on the Fair ground. If this explanation is untrue, it adds greatly to the force of the inference against him. Is it untrue ? One witness, Spriggs, tells you that he saw the pistol in the prisoner’s possession on the 25th of September, ten days only before the murder. Another witness, Proctor, tells you that he saw it in his possession on the 29th of September, within six days of the murder. These wit<a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>nesses speak positively, say they know the weapon and that they are not mistaken in regard to it; telling you how they fix the time, 'one of them by the opening of the Normal School, and the other by the Agricultural Fair. If these witnesses are believed, his explanation with regard to the pistol, was untrue. If this is so, as we have before suggested, it adds materially to the presumption of guilt arising from his ownership of the pistol.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b501-6" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[204,707,1169,604]]]'>“ But now a witness is called, Rebecca J. Price, who testifies that she saw the pistol in his possession on the very night of the murder, within less than an hour of the time when it was committed. If this is true you cannot fail to see and feel its importance. It advances the Commonwealth’s case another, and a long stride. If Mrs. Spence was killed with this weapon, and if it is shown, not only that it is his, but that it was in his hands so immediately before the killing occurred, can he, without some explanation of how he parted with it between that time and the murder, escape the inference that he used it on this occasion ? We repeat, if the pistol was then in his hands, and carried out with him, as Mrs. Price declares, and Mrs. Spence was murdered with it so directly thereafter, can he without explanation, escape the conclusion that he committed the murder ? You will judge.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b501-7" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[204,1311,1166,390]]]'>“ But was it in his hands at the time referred to ? One witness only testifies to having seen him with it. Several saw him at the bureau doing something — they know not what. None of them saw, as they declare, his left hand, or what was in it, at the time. Two of them went out on an errand, and he left before they returned. It was after they had gone out, Mrs. Price says, that he turned toward her with the pistol in his left hand. Her son was there, but he says he was engaged in reading, and did not observe the prisoner turn around.</p>

Can this witness be relied upon ? Her veracity has been attacked, and witnesses called to testify that her character for truthfulness is not good. On the other hand a number of persons were called, who testify that they never heard her character for veracity questioned. Some of these persons further say that several of the witnesses who testified against her are themselves of bad character for truth, and unworthy of belief. You will judge whether she has been successfully impeached. If she has not, and you discover no motive in her to falsify, you will be warranted in believing her. If you find she has been successfully impeached, then you should not believe her, unless you find her to be corroborated by other testimony.' As we have seen, three other witnesses testify that the prisoner was at the bureau, engaged as <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>she describes; that they did not see his left hand; that.two of them were out on a.n errand, and that the third was engaged in reading, and says he did not observe the prisoner when he turned around.</p>

And this mark, they say, was made by gunpowder. They tell you their reasons for saying so — some that they saw the grains, and knew them to be powder; and one, Mr. Miles, that he tasted it, and thus also ascertained it to be powder. If this was powder, left by the prisoner on the bureau cover, you will judge whether it does not corroborate the statement of Mrs. Price, wherein she says he had the pistol there at the time she describes. You will thus determine whether Mrs. Price is to be believed, and whether the prisoner had the pistol in his hands at the time referred to — just before the murder was committed.</p>

You will determine how far this has been successful. He is married to her niece. She advised his wife, as is said, to separate from him. Mrs. Davis says she heard him declare some two years ago that he would kill her for it, repeating the expression, and declaring that he was regardless of the consequences. Isaac Davis says he came in when the prisoner was talking at the time, and heard him use threats, but did not know to whom he alluded. One witness was called to impeach the veracity of Mrs. Davis, and two called to sustain it. You will say whether she is reliable. It appears that since the time of which Mrs. Davis and her husband speak, the prisoner has repeatedly visited the saloon of the deceased, and been waited upon by her, but that he did not visit her dwelling, and that they were not social.

It must be borne in mind, however, that where murder is committed, the motive which induces it, frequently, if not generally, appears, to a properly constituted mind, greatly inadequate. The murderer, who commits the crime in cola blood, is cruel, ferocious, without ordinary conscience, belongs to the lowest class of human creatures, and is moved to the commission of his crime by considerations and causes that would offer no temptation, and present no motive, to ordinary men.</p>

Men are so differently constituted in mind and heart, that while one, after the commission of crime, will fly, another will stand his ground; that while one will be overcome with alarm and remorse, and shun the presence of his victim, another will wear a brazen front, exhibit no concern, and mingle with those whom his conduct has excited and collected.</p>

Spence, by shooting her, and his case has been brought up for review under the provisions of the Act of Assembly of the 15th February 1870. The act allows a writ of error as of right “in all cases of murder and voluntary manslaughter,” and defines our duty to be “ to review both the law .and the evidence, and to determine whether the ingredients necessary to constitute murder in the first degree shall have been proved to exist; and if not so proved, then to reverse the judgment, and send the same back for a new trial, or to enter such judgment as the laws of this Commonwealth require.”</p>
    <p id="b507-9" data-blocks='[["BL_507.11",507,[195,1115,1162,1292]]]'>We have listened to the able and zealous argument of the prisoner’s counsel as if on a motion for a new trial; we could find no fault with that, for it in fact was a method of showing that the ingredients of murder in the first degree had not been proved. But our duty under the Act is widely different. A court on hearing a motion for a new trial, judges of the action of the jury on the testimony on both sides, and considers whether too much or too little weight has been given to features for the whole of the testimony in view of its intrinsic character; the manner in which it has been given by the witnesses, their apparent bias, intelligence or want of it, and character. All this has been before and under the eye of the court, and they can say on a calm reconsideration of it all, whether justice does, or does not, require a new trial. This court cannot do this, and the Act of Assembly does not contemplate any such thing. Our duty is to see whether there was evidence given in the case, which, if believed by the jury, would furnish the elements, or “ ingredients,” as the act says, of murder in the first degree, under our statutes on the subject, viz.: the <em>corpus delicti, </em>either “killing by poison, lying in wait, or by any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any arson, rape, robbery or burglary.” To this extent is the duty devolved on this court of reviewing the facts in cases of convictions for murder in the first degree, by the Act of 1870. It goes no further towards enabling it to grant new trials. If there have appeared in the testimony the ingredients to constitute murder in the first degree, our power ceases. Whether the jury should or should not have believed and relied on it, is what this court cannot • examine into. That must be inquired of on a motion for a new trial in the court below, as formerly.</p>

      <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>We have examined the testimony given in this case as returned by the learned judge below, and in our opinion it discloses every ingredient necessary under the law, to constitute murder in the first degree, and to connect the prisoner with the performance of the wicked deed. That the jury believed the evidence is conclusively shown by their verdict. We do not mean to recapitulate it minutely. The <em>corpus delicti </em>was clearly shown, and not controverted by the prisoner. The life of the deceased was taken by shooting her at or near her own kitchen-door, in the night time, and the instrument of death was a peculiar sort of firearm or pistol, constructed out of an army rifle, and was found lying near the body. The ownership of the pistol was traced to the prisoner, and testimony was given to show that he picked or scraped, and capped the nipple, that evening shortly before the murder; that there was an old grudge in the mind of the prisoner towards the deceased; that he was heard' to express threats that evening that he was going to commit violence on some one while walking rapidly towards the house of the murdered woman, and shortly afterwards the sound of a firearm was heard in that direction by the neighbors. There was testimony to raise an inference that he was in the lot at the back of the kitchen, for dock burrs, such as grew there were proved to have been picked from his clothes a very short time after the killing of Mrs. Spence took place. There was also proof that marks on the weeds and grass by the fence near the kitchen-door, indicated that some one had lain there that night, at least for a time, for some purpose or other. There was proof also, that the prisoner alleged after arrest, or about that time, that he had not the pistol in his possession on that evening, that he had lost it some weeks before. It was a peculiar weapon, and the witness who swore she saw it on his person on j;he evening when he was doing something with it at her .bureau, said she knew it well, and had seen it often before. It was exhibited without denial or objection on the argument before us, and I can safely say, that any person who had once seen it would have no difficulty in recognising it on seeing it again: The testimony of this witness was distinct that the prisoner had it the evening of the murder and before she heard the shot. ' It was further proved that the wad discharged from the pistol and picked up where Mrs. Spence fell, was identical with a piece of calico found on the bureau in the prisoner’s house, in the top' drawer of which were balls and caps suitable for loading the pistol in question. This was.evidence, although there may have been hundreds of yards of the same material for sale in the town. The firearm and the ammunition in so close proximity to it, gave consequence to the kind of wadding shown in his possession. But our duty is done when we find in the testimony proof of the ingredients of murder in the first degree; this we unhesitatingly do. Whether it was right or wrong for the jury to believe it, <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>and disbelieve tbe prisoner’s theory of his actions on the occasion, was for the jury, and it was all presented to them in a clear, impartial, and intelligible manner by the learned judge, and their finding afterwards approved by him on a motion for a new trial.</p>

The Act of 1870 does not alter or supply the law in this respect, and this court has no other means of knowing that objection was made in time, or at all, but by this means. In <em>favorem vitce </em>we may look at errors ineffectively assigned, but as we said in the case just referred to, we cannot reverse unless the exception be taken on the trial. So far as to ascertain whether the facts bring a conviction within the act defining murder in the first degree, the act dispenses with the bill of exceptions, but it does not dispense with it in questions raised on the trial. We expressed ourselves in regard to the loose and insufficient character of the Act of 1870 in the case of Schoeppe <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 15 P. F. Smith 51; but our remarks do not seem to have attracted the attention of the General Assembly, as they should have done, and we must administer the act as best we may, to make it consist with the certainty of procedure in other cases brought for review to this court.</p>
