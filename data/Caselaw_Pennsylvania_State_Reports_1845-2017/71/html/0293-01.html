If the intent be to create a liability for wares, goods and commodities, so as to protect the merchant, the word merchandise would be used.

The second was for repairing wagons at plaintiff’s shop in an adjoining county, some five miles distant from defendants’ quarry.

Whenever, therefore, there is a change in this particular in the act of incorporation, it is consequently just so far in derogation of the common law, and is to be strictly construed; McMullin <em>v. </em>McCreary, 4 P. F. Smith 230; that is to say, it is not to be extended by implication. Many authorities go to prove this which need not be cited. It is not to be forgotten, however, that this, as a rule, has no place where the intent is manifest from the words of the law.</p>

It is generally only to such that liens are extended in the mining districts. For them the law provides additional security; so in this case, the additional security of the individual responsibility of the stockholders is added to that of the corporation, in favor of the employees of the corporation, “ its mechanics, workmen and laborers.”</p>

Were it intended to hold them liable generally, enumeration, it is reasonable to suppose, would have been omitted. If the words in themselves were general enough to seem to bear the construction contended for, we are admonished by these considerations that they were not so intended. Generality of expression in Acts of Assembly, as in contracts, is often restricted by regard to the subject-matter to which it has been used: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>The Councils of the Borough of Montrose, 2 P.

    <p id="b300-7" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[246,1186,1166,1036]]]'>The learned judge of the Common Pleas was right therefore, we think, in holding as he did, that the charge for hauling slate, the party using his own team and contributing his own time, was not embraced by the liability clause quoted. Indeed, I regard it as not within the words at all. The teamster was not strictly either a laborer or workman, but the ruling stands well enough on the general ground suggested. His was labor of the same kind as that performed by the railroad company in transporting the slates to market, and the yardmen who took charge of them on their arrival at their destination. These parties were independent of the corporation altogether, and cannot be regarded as employees at all. All this is true of the wagon-maker’s bill. He was not the mechanic of the corporation. His was an independent business under his own control and option, and he was no more entitled to avail himself of the stockholders’ liability, than the horse-shoer, or the ordinary shoemaker, who might furnish shoes worn by .the workmen and laborers. And so of materials furnished.. That of course has reference only to such as form part or portions of the products of the establishment. Without injustice to the stockholders, we cannot hold to the general liability clause against them, and yet it is to be regretted, if loss ensue to individuals, because the corporation may be unable to pay them their dues. This, however, is the fault of the legislation on the subject. For the reasons given these judgments must be affirmed.</p>
