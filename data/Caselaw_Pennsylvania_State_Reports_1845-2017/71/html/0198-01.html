It does not ascertain the rights of the parties under the mortgage, nor pretend to adjust the rights of the plaintiff growing out of the mortgage.

These propositions were not based upon the mortgage as a claim, but looked to the future working of the colliery, upon joint account of the plaintiffs and defendants. The award was not to ascertain the rights of the parties as' to the mortgage, and other questions growing out of that and their other dealings, but was that the plaintiff should become a partner, satisfy his mortgages and pay defendants fifteen thousand dollars. This does not seem to us an award in any legal sense. It is a contract and to be binding must have the consent of the parties. The fact that the plaintiff said he was satisfied with the award does not make an acceptance of the defendants’ offer, nor does it become an offer by plaintiff to defendants. It is in effect a recommendation of the referee to the parties that thpy settle upon certain terms which he proposed, and these terms do not appear to have been carried out by either party. It is quite clear that such an award is not good at common law for two reasons. One we have already suggested that the award does not make a final account or settlement between the parties, but proposes terms in the nature of a contract which requires the parties to consent to the terms of the award.</p>

Even if the defendants were not estopped from denying the right of the plaintiffs to issue the writ, the Act of 3d April 1868, Pamph.

If the writ was defective in not reciting the provision in the mortgage, that upon the failure of payment of any instalment of principal, the whole debt secured thereby should forthwith become due and collectable, and that a scire facias might thereupon forthwith issue, it was a clerical error, amendable by the prsecipe, which recited the provision in <em>totidem </em>verbis, and the court, therefore, properly allowed the amendment to be made on the trial.

Even if the matter submitted to him was a proper subject of reference at common law, the defendants did not offer to perform the award on their part, nor demand its performance by the plaintiffs.

If the defendants had to make up that amount, and more too, as alleged, to place the mines under the leases in a working condition, they did not offer to show that they had incurred any expense in raising the money, or that they had borrowed it on less favorable terms, and if not, the refusal of the plaintiffs to advance the money did them no harm. The allegation that in consequence of this refusal the defendants -were subject to great delays and losses, is too vague and indefinite to support the offer. If the defendants actually sustained delays and losses by the plaintiffs’ refusal to make the loan, they should have been specified; without any specification of their nature and extent, the court was justified in treating the allegation as a mere make-weight, and rejecting the offer, if insufficient in other respects. If it had been proved precisely as made, the jury would not have been warranted in giving more than nominal damages for the plaintiffs’ refusal to loan the money, and therefore its rejection did the defendants no suoh injury as calls for a reversal of the. judgment.</p>
