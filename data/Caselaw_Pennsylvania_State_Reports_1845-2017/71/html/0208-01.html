Upon this subject we instruct that the note sued on, was payable by instalments annually. For each instalment, upon its maturity, the plaintiff had a right of action at law. The Statute of Limitations was intended to operate and does'Operate upon the right of action. Six years after the right of action accrues, the Statute of Limitations suspends-it. Six years, therefore, after the first instalment fell due the plaintiff’s right of action was barred as to that instalment. So is the law also, as to all the instalments.</p>

We think this is correct so far as it relates to cases in which the defence is made upon the general issue, but not true, - as applicable to cases in which the defendants sever in their pleadings and set up distinct special defences. The defendants who plead the statute have a right to do so. Those who decline to do so, have as unquestionable a right to put their defence upon the general issue. The plaintiff is not to be injured by such diversity of purpose and pleading among defendants. Nor are part of the defendants to be precluded from availing themselves of the Statute of Limitations, because their co-defendants do not choose to set up the same defence.

Litt. 292 b. Lord Loughborough reviewed all the law on this subject in Rudder <em>v. </em>Price, 1 H. Bl. 547, in which it was held that an action of debt will not lie on a promissory note, payable by instalments, till the last day of payment be past. He shows that prior to the case of Cooke <em>v. </em>Whorwood, 2 Saund. 337, it was the uniform course where an action of assumpsit was brought before all the instalments were due, to allow a recovery in damages for those still to accrue and come due, upon the notion that after a judgment on the contract no further recovery could be had: Beckwith <em>v. </em>Nótt, Cro. Jac. 504; Peck <em>v. </em>Ambler, Dyer 113 and note; Milles <em>v. </em>Milles, Cro. Car. 241. But in Cooke <em>v. </em>Whorwood, which was assumpsit to perform an award to pay money in instalments, it was objected that all the days of payment were not past ;’but the Court of King’s Bench, Sir Matthew Hale being then Chief Justice, was clear that the action might be brought for such money only as was due at the time of bringing the action, and the plaintiff could recover damages accordingly; and when another sum of the money awarded should become due, the plaintiff might commence a new action for that also, and so <em>toties quoties. </em>The law must be now considered as settled in conformity to this doctrine: Tucker <em>v. </em>Randall, <a href="/mass/2/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Mass. 283" data-case-ids="2007359" data-case-paths="/mass/2/0262-01">2 Mass. 283</a>; Greenleaf <em>v. </em>Kellogg, Id. 568; Cooley <em>v. </em>Rose, 3 Id. 221.</p>

It is unnecessary to inquire what the law would have been if this had been an action of debt, and the plea <em>actio non acerevit infra sex annos; </em>for, as we have seen, an action of debt could not have been maintained on this promissory note until after all the instalments had fallen due. But being assumpsit, there would seem to be no question that, as to the first instalment, the action was barred: Burnham <em>v. </em>Brown, <a href="/me/23/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="23 Me. 400" data-case-ids="8846885" data-case-paths="/me/23/0400-01">23 Me. 400</a>; 2 Pars, on Cont. 373.</p>

In such a proceeding if evidence is offered of an acknowledgment or payment by one only of the defendants, it is strictly inadmissible, unless indeed offered to be followed by a similar acknowledgment or payment by the others, which would be sufficient to take the case out of the statute as to all. It follows that in this case the jury should have been instructed to find for the plaintiff as against all the defendants only the amount of the second instalment and interest. Whether the plaintiff could maintain an action against those not affected by the bar of the statute in consequence of their acknowledgment or payment for the first instalment, need not now be discussed, nor on what principle contribution between the joint debtors is to be regulated. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. Upon a writ of error by the defendants, the verdict and general judgment entered on the verdict could not have been sustained. It is in effect several judgments in a joint action. We must assume that the defendants acquiesce, as they do not complain. But what injury has been done to the plaintiff in error ? He has in his joint action, by the verdict and judgment below, all the benefits which he could possibly have attained had he brought several actions against each defendant. It would evidently be an injury to him to reverse this judgment, and send the case back for another trial, which must result in a verdict and judgment against all for the less sum, leaving the plaintiff to pursue his separate remedies against those as to whom the bar of the statute is saved.</p>
