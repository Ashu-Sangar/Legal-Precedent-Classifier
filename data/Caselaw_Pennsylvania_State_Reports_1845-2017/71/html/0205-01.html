      <em>“ </em>It is further alleged by defendant, that in the fall of 1868, or spring of 1869, Funk gave notice to Frankenfield to bring suit at once on the notes, against Gangwer, and if he did not do so, he would consider himself discharged. Gangwer says that in the spring of 1869, or in fall of 1868, he was worth $1600, and was able to pay the notes. Sometime after this, his property was swept away by fire, and there was not enough left to meet this responsibility. These suits were not brought till February Term 1870, so that the delay on Frankenfield’s part extended beyond the period when the fire occurred. Funk, the surety, contends that inasmuch as the plaintiff did not institute suits immediately, he is discharged. The law, as laid down by defendants’ counsel, is correct. When a surety gives notice to the creditor to institute suit, and declares if he does not, he will hold himself discharged, if the creditor allows time to elapse, during which the principal debtor fails, the creditor’s laches may be visited upon him. He holds the evidences of debt, and is bound to institute suit at once, if he gets notice, or take the consequences. Mere delay, however, will not absolve the surety. Funk testifies, that in the fall of 1868, he told Frankenfield to collect the money at once, or he would not be responsible. If this be true, he did all the law required him to do. Frankenfield denies the statement made by Funk, and says, instead of Funk giving him notice to proceed, he asked him to delay proceeding. Which will you believe ? According to Frankenfield, there was no such notice given as will absolve Funk. If you believe Funk, he did at this <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>stage of the business all he was required to do. But even if you believe Funk, there is still a question arising as to the effect of the two letters addressed by him to Frankenfleld before the suits were instituted. And upon the solution of this question the case turns. What is the effect of the two letters to which I referred ? In the first letter, dated December 21st 1868, Funk writes to Frankenfield, ‘ Have patience till January, I think you will receive your money.’ The second letter is dated January 6th 1869, and therein Funk promises to pay the money as soon as it is obtained. It is an established rule of law, that forbearance to sue upon a promise, constitutes a consideration. Even supposing Funk at this time had been absolved from the payment of the notes, if he promised to pay in case Frankenfleld would forbear to sue Gangwer, he is bound. The forbearance for one day to sue, constitutes a consideration. When one man engages, if a creditor will forbear to sue a third person he will pay the debt, and the creditor does forbear, he will be hound. Did Frankenfleld forbear to sue ? These letters-must be scanned closely. If they referred to these notes, and there was a delay to bring suit in consequence of Funk’s request for more time, then I say there was a binding promise to pay, whatever Funk’s position was previously to his writing the letters.”</p>

So the learned judge below instructed the jury. But assuming this to be so, he held that if the two letters in evidence of December 21st 1869 and January 6th 1870, by Funk to Frankenfleld, referred to the note in question, and there was a delay to bring suit in consequence of Funk’s request for more time, they contained a binding promise to pay, whatever Funk’s position was previously to his writing the letters. In this we think there was error. Considering Funk as absolved from all responsibility, there is in the letters no absolute promise to pay the debt in consideration of forbearance. In the first, dated December 21st 1869, there is no promise at all.</p>
    <p id="b209-12" data-blocks='[["BL_209.14",209,[230,2320,1159,83]],["BL_210.1",210,[284,386,1162,776]]]'>“ Have patience until about January 3d, and I think you will receive your money.” It evidently means that, in his opinion, he <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>would receive his money from Gangwer by that time. The second, January 6th 1870, states that he had been at Freemansburg, at Bloss’s, Esq., for money already three times, but did not meet him (either Gangwer or Esq. Bloss, or some one else, from whom money was expected). He then adds: “ <em>1 </em>will pay you as soon as the money is obtained.” Admitting this to be an absolute promise to pay the money in a reasonable time, as soon as be, Punk, could obtain it, where was tbe forbearance to sue which was necessary to form the consideration of it ? This suit bad been then actually commenced. But it was not an absolute but only a conditional promise to pay, when be, Eunk, should obtain tbe money from Gangwer, or from bis book accounts, which had been assigned to bim for collection. Tbe justice to whom these books bad been intrusted to sue upon was probably Esquire Bloss, at Freemansburg, and the only fair construction which could be given to this letter is, that as soon as money should be collected from this source he would pay it to Frankenfield. No evidence was given that such money was ever obtained.</p>
