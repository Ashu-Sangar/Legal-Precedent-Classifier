It is to be presumed that the testator knew .this fact, and that his personal property, not bequeathed to the widow, would be more than exhausted in the payment of his debts. Knowing this, he knew more, to wit: that whatever the form of ¡the bequest to the petitioners, they could take only the consideration-money, as that was all he had left to give, and knowing this, it is a necessary inference that he so intended it. * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b338-14" data-blocks='[["BL_338.12",338,[274,1828,1160,379]]]'>“ Another reason for holding that the testator, in bequeathing the rest and residue of hrs estate to the petitioners, had especial reference to the consideration-money, will be found in the fact that in the codicil he refers to this money by name, and directs <em>it </em>to be paid in a different manner from that provided in the will ‘ <em>for the more equalizing his said children and grandchild’s shares.’ </em>This purpose could be effectuated only by -paying the money to the petitioners, and the inference is a fair and reasonable one, that the testator so intended it.</p>

But this is not necessary. All the authorities agree that it is sufficient, if the intention to charge the land appear under any form of expression; and such being the law, it is difficult to conceive of language more evincive of such an intention, than that used in connection with this devise. The testator devises the farm to Christian, ‘under and subject to the payment of $7000.’ * * * It follows from the above, in the auditor’s opinion, that the testator intended to charge the $7000 on the farm devised to Christian, and that he further intended to give this money to the petitioners as a legacy.</p>

But is the objection well founded ? The act does not direct that the executors should be made <em>parties </em>to the proceeding. It only requires that they should have notice given them, which may be done without making them parties; and such seems to be the interpretation of the Supreme Court. * * *</p>

All the act requires is that the court should cause due notice to be given to them, without being nice as to the capacity in which it is received, or the manner in which the information is communicated.</p>

He also claims interest on these balances, as follows: on $2103.14, the balance of the first account, from February 18th 1851; and on $9.01, the balance of the second account, from November 19th 1868. The petitioners deny that he is entitled to any offset on account of these balances. After deducting devises and bequests, including the $7000 consideration-money, the petitioners admit there was a deficiency of assets for the payment of debts of $1855.90; add to this a reasonable sum for the expenses of administration, and we have in round numbers $2000 of claims against the estate, for which no provision whatever is made in the will. * <em>* </em>*</p>

As a further warrant for assuming this to be the true state of the present case, we have the fact that this assumption furnishes a key to the interpretation of a portion of the codicil, which cannot be satisfactorily explained upon any other theory. * * *</p>

It also follows that he' has no <em>legal </em>right to interest on the $2000, .and indeed no legal right to offset the principal sum even. The truth is, that this entire controversy respecting the balances of the two accounts, will have to be determined, not upon legal, but upon equitable principles. It is not a question of set-off, but a question of contribution or abatement.</p>

Had the codicil taken from the petitioners $2000 out of their legacy, with which to pay debts, without more, it would probably have worked a revocation of the legacy <em>pro tanto </em>to their increased relative disadvantage. But one of the avowed purposes of the testator in making the codicil is ‘ the more equalizing of his children and grandchild’s shares,” and to this end he quickens the times for paying the instalments of the consideration-money. This, however, would be as a feather in the scale, when weighed against the loss of the $2000 ; so that the reasonable inference is, that the testator did not intend to cast the entire burden of paying the $2000 on the petitioners.</p>

Armstrong’s Appeal, 13 P. E. Smith 312, furnishes the rule, which is, that ‘in marshalling assets for the payment of the debts of a testator, specific devises of land abate proportionably with specific and demonstrative legacies.” There is no difficulty in the rule itself, but in the application of it there is frequently great difficulty, for in that process the authorities furnish no guide, except that the amount of abatement or contribution is to be determined upon <em>equitable </em>principles.</p>

In answer to the respondent’s claim of interest on the balances of his accounts, wre have the fact that he enjoyed uninterruptedly the possession and yield of this valuable farm, subject only to the rights of the widow, for a period of nearly twenty years, without rent, upon a comparatively trifling investment of a little over $2000, whilst all this time the petitioners derived no benefit whatever from the estate of the testator. Eejecting the claim of interest for this reason, it will leave as the deficiency to be made up, the balances of the executors’ two accounts, to wit: the sum of $2112.15. To make up this deficiency, the devise to the respondent and the legacy to the petitioners, under the rule above stated, must abate proportionably. Taking the net value of the farm to be $13,000, and the value of the legacy at its face, the ratio in which they must abate, will be as thirteen to seven. * * *</p>

The proportion of the deficiency, therefore, under the rule above stated, to be paid by the petitioners, is seven-twentieths of the whole amount, or $817.39, and their legacy will have to abate by that amount, leaving a balance due them of $6182-61.

He was to take it under and subject to the payment of this sum, and the codicil declares it to be the consideration-money of his land. The intent to charge is plain. The proceeding to recover the legacy was properly under the 59th section of the Act of 24th February 1834. The objection that the executors of the will were not made parties is unfounded in fact. The petition sets forth expressly that letters testamentary were issued to Christian Knecht and Reuben Knecht, one of whom was a plaintiff and the other the defendant. The parties were therefore in court, and the petition was merely informal in its mode of statement, and not substantially defective. The informality was properly permitted to be amended. No objection can be urged against the jurisdiction of the court. And even if the proceedings were not under the 59th section, the Orphans’ Court has jurisdiction generally to enforce the payment of legacies under the 47th section of the Act of 1834. The intent of the testator in this will was to make the sum of $7000 payable out of the land devised to Christian, and hence this sum is, in its nature, plainly demonstrative. The fact that the division of it takes place under the residuary clause does not alter its specific character, or the intent of the testator in regard to it. The place alone, where the distribution is made, will not fi^ the intent, if the purpose of the testator can be gathered elsewhere in the will; but we must be governed by his main intent. The reasons leading to the conclusion that the sum of $7000 charged on the land, is demonstrative, are so fully given in the opinion of the court, and the argument of the counsel of the appellees, that we need not refer to them. This being the character of the fund and <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>the source of its payment, the question whether there is other estate to pass under the residuary clause becomes immaterial. It turns out that the personal estate was insufficient to pay the debts, and the real estate was therefore liable for the deficiency. The sum payable out of the farm being demonstrative, it follows that the owners of the realty must suffer a ratable abatement to the extent of the debts, which were liens, on the real estate. This deficiency was made up by Christian Knecht, who was both devisee of the farm and executor of the will. It amounted to little over $2000, and was paid by him within a year after the testator’s death and settled in his account as executor. The sum charged on his land was not payable, however, until after the death of his mother, which occurred nearly twenty years after the settlement of the account. He therefore claims interest on the balance of his account as executor.</p>
    <p id="b346-6" data-blocks='[["BL_346.4",346,[276,1008,1165,1374]],["BL_347.1",347,[194,373,1171,1820]]]'>But under the circumstances he is not entitled to interest. When he paid the money he stood in the double capacity of a devisee and executor. As executor it was in his power and it was his duty to have procured an order to sell the land for the payment of the debts. As executor he could not pay the debts out of his own pocket, and wait until after the lien of the debts thus paid had expired. In this respect the executor or administrator is bound to the same diligence as the creditors: Clauser’s Estate, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 208" data-case-ids="1852517" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0208-01">1 W. &amp; S. 208</a>; McCurdy’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 397" data-case-ids="477989" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0397-01">5 W. &amp; S. 397</a>; Loomis’s Appeal, 5 Casey 237. When then as devisee and owner of the land he chose to retain it, and waive the sale he might have made as executor, he elected to take so much of the land as was equivalent to the amount of the debts, and thus assumed the deficiency. The possession and usufruct of .the land thus retained were in law the equivalent of the interest on the debts, while the principal only would be a credit in the payment of the $7000, he himself contributing his ratable proportion on account of the devise to him. So far the decree of the court was right, and this leads us to examine the manner of adjusting the abatement between Christian, as devisee of the land, and his brothers and sisters, as the owners of the legacies charged upon it. The Orphans’ Court adjusted it by the proportion which the sum of $7000 bore to the value of the real estate. This was correct. Abatement in such case is the act of the law, taking into view the whole scope of the will and the actual intent of the testator, and arriving at what, it is believed, would be the intention of the testator, had he known of the deficiency and undertaken to make the abatement himself. The intention of the testator as gathered from his will is, therefore, still the polar star of the interpretation, and of the adaptation of the abatement to the new situation, which then must be reached on principles of justice and equity. At this point, we think, the Orphans’ Court made a slight departure, requiring a modification <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>of the decree. The Orphans’ Court took the value of the land at the time of adjustment, instead of the time of the testator’s death, as the measure of proportional abatement of the devisee of the land. This was an error. When the testator made his will, he formed his plan of the distribution of his estate, as the facts then appeared before his mind. In looking at what it would be just to give Christian in land, and what to the others in money, he had in his view the value of his property as he then knew it, and not a state of things to happen twenty years afterwards, when his land might appreciate or depreciate. The value of his land then, and the sums to be paid out of it, he fixed in his mind then, as the proportions proper for his children. He certainly did not look forward to the existence of adventitious, or it may be fortuitous circumstances, as the means of regulating his bounty. If within a year after Christian took his devise, the house and barn were destroyed by wind or fire, the loss would be his, and not that of those to whom the $7000 were bequeathed. So an adventitious rise in price in the land would certainly be his and not theirs. Had the testator then known that he was in debt $2000, which must be paid out of his land, debts which must be paid at his death, he certainly would not have adjusted the abatement between Christian’s land and their money, on an unknown and prospective value, but he would have done it on the valuation he would then make in his mind. He knew that his will would take effect at his death, and that the rights of creditors would then attach, and would not wait on distribution under his will. Had an executor sold the land, or the devisee then paid the debt, it is evident the loss would have been according to the then value of his land. The postponement of the time of settlement, by the sufferance of a devisee who had paid the debt, clearly would not add to the right of those who were to receive their share in money, at sums then fixed in amount, and in just proportion, as the testator willed it, to the value of his property. It seems to us, therefore, that the only fair adjustment of the abatement should be upon the basis of the value of the estate as it was at the death of the testator, and when the debts were paid by the devisee. The decree of the Orphans’ Court is therefore affirmed, subject to a modification as to the value of the land devised to the appellant, which is to be ascertained as of the time of the testator’s death; and the record is ordered to be remitted to the Orphans’ Court with instructions to carry this modification into effect. The costs of the appeal to be paid out of the estate.</p>
