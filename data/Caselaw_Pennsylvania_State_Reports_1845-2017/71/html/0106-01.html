The relations between the executor and his sister, who was trustee for her daughters, and represented her sons in their minority, were extremely confidential, and if, on the one hand, he was careless and irregular, she, at least, never seems to have demanded anything beyond the payment of so much of the income as sufficed for the immediate wants of the family. To this extent she acquiesced, in the executor’s management; though there is not the least proof that she assented to his use of the funds of the estate, nor that she knew or even suspected anything of the kind. This mere acquiescence cannot exonerate the executor. * * * The length of the acquiescence seems to have been misunderstood. Mr. Brown died in 1842. The estate was retained, or was supposed to have been retained by the executor for two or three years at least, under the advice of Solomon Allen. Captain Brown came of age in 1852, and almost immediately began his demands for a settlement. The same course was pursued by his brother and by the daughters, so far as regarded their income, which was all they could personally claim. All this shows, first, that there was no such absolute lapse of time without demand of payment as would warrant any presumption of settlement, and next, that the only real acquiescence, even of Mrs. Brown, extended to the mere retention and management of the estate by the executor under the erroneous supposition that he was managing it judiciously. Moreover, if this assent be admitted, it was an assent that Mr. Norris should continue to act as executor of the estate, not as the banker of the parties themselves. * * *</p>

Interest is awarded to them alike in either case, as a compensation for the use of their money, and profits or investments may be equally followed and appropriated, whether made by an honest or dishonest trustee, if made from the funds of the trust estate.

Within the twenty years, the onus of proving payment lies on the defendant; after that time it lies on the plaintiff to show the contrary.’ If an executor or administrator be cited to account more than twenty-one years from the grant of letters testamentary or of administration, he may reply to the citation that, twenty years having elapsed since he might have been called' to account, the law presumes that he settled an account within one year, and distributed the estate among those entitled thereto. By the law of this state, an executor is entitled to one year within which to settle his account. During that period he cannot be cited unless for misconduct, and it would seem the presumption would commence to run from the expiration of the year, or the time when he might have been called upon for an account. But it is at best only a presumption, liable to be rebutted by proof that in point of fact no account had been filed and no distribution made. And when overthrown by such evidence, the liability to account remains in full force. In this it is unlike the Statute of Limitations, which interposes a flat bar to a recovery after the expiration of the statutory period. The practical effect of the presumption is merely to shift the burden of proof.</p>

In the first place, the account filed of itself rebuts it conclusively. The accountant commences by charging himself with the inventory made in 1842, and goes on with numerous and continuous dealings with the estate, receipts and disbursements, up to and during the year 1866, showing a considerable amount of the estate unadministered at that time. Payments were being made by the accountant up to the period of his death of interest to some of the distributees. Nor is there any averment upon the face of the account that any balance that might appear to be in his hands at the time of the filing of the same had been distributed. There is no pretence that any such account actually existed. This account was commenced <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>
      <em>by the </em>accountant just before his death, and was completed by his co-executor, who had not taken any part in the management of the estate prior to that time. In the account filed there is no charge of a balance of a former account, nor any credit of a former distribution. Nor could there well be in this case, as the account commences, as before stated, with the inventory and first dealings with the estate. The proof is overwhelming that there never has been any accounting other than what is contained in this account. The correspondence between the executor and the children of the testator also negatives the presumption of a settlement. It commences years back with requests for money. Then come inquiries as to the state of their accounts. These inquiries gradually became more pressing — amounting to a demand in 1856, and culminating in a citation in 1866. It must be remembered that the accountant was the brother-in-law of the testator; was a man of fortune, of high social position, and appears to-have had the unbounded confidence of his nieces and nephews, who were the distributees under the will. All these, and many other facts stated by the auditors, lead us irresistibly to .the conclusion that no account was settled by the accountant, and in the face of facts, mere presumptions disappear.</p>

Smith 157, in support of the principle, that the mere admission of assets by an executor’s account, filed within the twenty years, is not sufficient to repel the presumption of payment of legatees arising from the lapse of more than that space of time without demand on the part of the legatees. The settlement of an account showing the receipt of assets more than twenty years before might not rebut the presumption of payment to the legatees or parties entitled thereto. It was said, in Foulk <em>v. </em>Brown, that the mere settlement of the administration would not be an admission that the legacy was not paid. The distribution is properly no part of an executor’s account. Yet, without some positive averment on the face of the account that the balance appearing therein had been distributed, it is difficult to see how any conclusive presumption of payment can arise. The law of each case must be interpreted by its facts. The presumption, if any, arising from the filing of a particular account, must be measured by the circumstances of the case. Thus, in McLean <em>v. </em>Findley, the effect of filing the account is said to have been very properly left to the jury as a matter of fact; and in Wilkinson’s Estate, Judge Parsons says, ‘ When the executors present their account, and in it claim that a legacy has been paid, when the law presumes the satisfaction, they can avail themselves of this legal presumption.’</p>

There is no break or interruption in it from which the presumption of payment might reasonably be supposed to begin. As was well observed by the learned auditors, ‘ when there is a blank of more than twenty years between the receipt and the filing of the account, without intermediate action, a fair presumption of payment may be drawn; but where there is a series of receipts and payments without any interval at all, even if twenty years or more have gone by since the first came in, where is the presumption to begin, and where is it to end ?

Even if the position referred to were tenable, the auditors give some excellent reasons why it would not help the accountant; the most important of which is, that the Statute of Limitations, in such cases, does not commence to run until the dissolution of the relation of attorney and client, or agent and principal, where, as here, there were continuous dealings with the estate.

It is to be noted that they have had a number of such cases before them, and have never yet held an accountant to such a rule. The liability of an executor for interest in this state has been the subject of legislative enactment. By the 17th section of the Act of 29th March 1832, Purd. 300, pi. 65, it is provided, that ‘ the amount of interest to be paid in all cases by executors, administrators and guardians shall be determined by the Orphans’ Court, under all the circumstances of the case; but shall not in any case exceed <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>the legal rate of interest for the time being.’ It would seem difficult, in the face of this Act of Assembly, to charge compound interest, as <em>such, </em>in Pennsylvania.

The auditors find that a large portion of these stocks were purchased with funds belonging to the estate of William Brown, and as to such they surcharged the executor with the dividends received thereon, and with the present market value of the stock, crediting him with the amount actually paid therefor with interest thereon.

The true rule is perhaps stated in Holman’s Appeal, 12 Harris 174: ‘It is hardly necessary to say, that where there is no evidence of a proper attention to the duties of the trust; where no account has been settled for thirty years, and then only where a settlement was compelled by law ; and where a very unfair exhibit was made when the account was presented, no compensation ought to be allowed to the executor.’ Commissions were disallowed in Stehman’s Appeal, 5 Barr 413, 417; Witman &amp; Geisinger’s Appeal, 4 Casey 376; Smith’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20424" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="11 Wright 424">11 Wright 424</a>; Swartswalter’s Account, <a href="/watts/4/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="4 Watts 77" data-case-ids="1842761" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0077-01">4 Watts 77</a>; Stearley’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20525" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Wright 525">2 Wright 525</a>; Dyott’s Estate, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 557" data-case-ids="1853564" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0557-01">2 W. &amp; S. 557</a>; and Robinett’s Appeal, 12 Casey 191, for reasons in nowise stronger than exist in the case now under consideration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b128-7" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[276,1436,1157,471]]]'>“ The auditors have charged the costs of the audit to the estate of William Brown, but without any allowance for counsel fees. Costs are peculiarly within the control and discretion of the court. It is to be noted that the auditors state their belief that the accountant, in his exceedingly irregular dealings with the funds of the estate, did not intend any actual fraud. The distinction between such a trustee and a fraudulent trustee is a very nice one, and we think the auditors have taken as charitable a view of this branch of the case as it will bear. It is.of but little moment to the cestui que trust what the motive of the trustee may be, if his act be such as to imperil the estate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b128-8" data-blocks='[["BL_128.6",128,[276,1908,1156,429]]]'>“ Where a trustee uses the trust funds in speculations for his private gain, the character of the act does not depend upon the success of his operations. If he loses the money in such transactions, and is unable to replace it, the law has a name for such an offence, which we will not designate here, but which is well understood by lawyers, and ought to be by laymen. This investigation has been greatly protracted, and the expenses thereof heavily increased by the accountant’s improper management of the estate, and by his failure to keep proper accounts. It is not just that this increased expense should be paid by the distributees.</p>

We would throw a larger share of the costs of the audit upon the accountant, but for the fact that the distributees have not been as vigilant as they might have been in calling him to an account.
