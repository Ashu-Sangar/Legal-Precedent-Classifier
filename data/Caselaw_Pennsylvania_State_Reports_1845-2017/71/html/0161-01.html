In the event of the merely implied contract between the parties, the plaintiff could not recover for the <em>whole </em>time of her services, because here the Statute of Limitation steps in, and limits her recovery to what her services were worth during a period of six years prior to the time of suit brought. * * * But, this matter of the Statute of Limitations, to which I have just adverted, will, perhaps, not be of any great importance in one view that I take of the law, and that you may take of the fact. Now, so much for the doctrine of implied contract, provided there were no allegations and no proofs on the other side setting up an express contract. [But, if I understand the facts before you, both parties maintain that there was an express contract in this case.] If that be true, and you so find it, then what I said about implied contract becomes of little or no consequence. The plaintiff, if I understand it right, maintains that there was an express contract,. That this old gentleman again and again declared to others, who communicated it to her, that if she would continue with him and serve him, that he would provide for her abundantly at his death, or that he would make such provision that she would never have to work any more. * * * Now, the defendant, on his part, also says there was an express contract, and, if I understand him aright, he says the contract was that this young lady was to remain in his employ and serve him as she had done him before the wife’s death, and that her compensation was to be such a legacy as he might choose to leave her; that she agreed to serve him, trusting to his generosity to make it right at his death. Now, gentlemen, these are the two opposite express contracts which are alleged here by the opposing parties. * * * [Either of these contracts would be entirely valid in law.] It is entirely competent for a man to agree to pay another man for services, at a rate vastly above what the services are worth, [and if, in this particular case, you shall find, that the testator agreed to pay this young lady for her services, by making such provision in his will that she should be under no necessity after his death- to labor for her livelihood, or to make an abundant provision for her by his will, then, in law, his estate must answer for that undertaking, though it should take the whole of it.] On the other hand, if she agreed to work for the decedent, trusting entirely to his generosity for such a sum as he might choose to bequeath to her in his-will, then she is bound by her contract to the sum of two thousand dollars that he left her, she would have to be satisfied with, if that is the contract. * * * There is another question that I have not yet adverted to, growing out of this two thousand dollar legacy. That the decedent left the plaintiff a legacy of <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>that amount, and that she received it, are not disputed. But the defendant alleges that said legacy was left by decedent as and for the provision that he had contracted to make for her, and say that that legacy was in full, as,uf their view is correct, it necessarily would be; but the plaintiffs, under their view of it, say that it was part payment of what was due. * * * There are two ways, gentlemen, of proving that a legacy is payment of the debt. The one is by the will itself, and the other is by evidence or circumstances outside of the will. Now, as far as the will itself is concerned [I instruct you as a matter of law. There is nothing in the will itself that makes this legacy other than a pure gratuity, and, if there is nothing outside of the will you will then make up your verdict as though there was no such thing as a legacy in the case.] * * * There is evidence from which you may be able to find that there was an intention on the part of the testator, that the legacy should be in payment of what he owed her. The very contract on which the plaintiff relies, that is to say, a contract to compensate her fully at his death, or by his will, would be sufficient to justify you in finding such an intention; and there may be other facts in the case from which you may find his intention. But what his intention was in leaving this legacy, whether as a pure gratuity, or as payment either in whole or in part, is a question of fact entirely for you. If you find that there was such an intention on the part of the testator in giving this legacy, and that the defendant’s view of the contract between the parties is a correct one, that is to say, that he was to fix an amount, that it was to be discretionary with him as to how much he would pay her by his will, then the $2000 is in full; but if you find such an intention on his part, and yet that the plaintiff’s view of the contract is correct, that he was to make such a provision for her as would relieve her from the necessity of working in after life, or such other abundant provision as you may find from the expressions used by the witnesses he appears to have promised her, then these $2000 will merely go upon account, and will still leave you to determine from the whole case how much her entire services to the decedent were worth. Now, I repeat, gentlemen, that whether this legacy is to be considered by you at all in working up your verdict, will depend upon whether from facts outside of the will, you arrive at the conclusion that it was the intention of the testator, in leaving these $2000, to leave it as payment, and not as a pure gratuity. * * *</p>

The 2d error assigned is in permitting a witness to be asked whether the plaintiff’s appearance did not show her constitution broken down by her duties at that time. Certainly, if the offices performed by the plaintiff were of such a character as necessarily to be injurious to her health, it was a fair element to be taken into consideration in determining what her services were worth. The other errors assigned are to the charge and the answers to the points, and need not be separately considered. They present substantially only two questions. First, Was there evidence of such an express contract as ought to have gone to the jury ? And second, If the services were rendered in expectation of being compensated by a legacy, ought that to prevent a recovery ?</p>
    <p id="b170-9" data-blocks='[["BL_170.13",170,[293,1538,1162,861]],["BL_171.1",171,[258,372,1164,1470]]]'>As to the first question, it is undoubtedly true, that contracts of this character, by which the estates of deceased persons are called on to pay large sums to nurses and housekeepers, ought to be very closely scanned, and juries instructed that they can only be made out by very clear proof. The courts are especially justified in setting aside such verdicts, when not founded on proof of this character, or when unreasonable in amount. Yet these are matters not within the province of a court of errors. They are necessarily confided to the sound legal discretion of the tribunal before which the trial has taken place. Such a contract must of course possess the element of certainty, as was held by this court in Sherman <em>v. </em>Kitsmiller, 17 S. &amp; R. 45, and Graham <em>v. </em>Graham’s Executors, 10 Casey 475. But the maxim is, <em>Id certum est quod, oertum reddi potest. </em>In neither of the cases could that maxim be applied. In the first, the promise as set up, was to give the plaintiff 100 acres of land. One hundred acres of land where ? worth how much ? Five dollars an acre or five hundred ? “ The promise,” said Mr. Justice Duncan, “is as boundless as the terrestrial globe.” “ The action only lies where a man by express words assumes to do a certain thing. Not that this means an absolute <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>certainty, but a certainty to a common intent, giving tbe words a reasonable construction. But the words must show the undertaking was certain; for, in assumpsit for non-payment of money, it is necessary to reduce the amount to a certainty; or on a <em>quantum </em>meruit, by an averment, where the amount does not otherwise appear. Express promises or contracts ought to be certain and explicit to a common intent at least. They may be rendered certain by a reference to something certain;" Sylvester’s Case, Popham 148; 2 Roll. Rep. 104; 1 Leo. 88. In Graham <em>v. </em>Graham’s Ex’rs., a promise to give the plaintiff, in consideration of services, “ as much as to any relation on earth,” was held to be indefinite. As our brother Williams said, in his opinion below, which was affirmed in this court: “ The testator did not intimate what or how much he would' give to <em>any relative he had on earth.” </em>Who could say how much that would be ? It depended on his own will, as if a man were to say, I will give you for these services just what I choose. In the case now before us, however, the contract as proved by Elizabeth Sheaf, and confirmed by the testimony of other witnesses was, that “if she (the plaintiff) would stay with him (the testator) as long as he lived, he would provide and give her full and plenty after he was gone, so that she need not to work.” Now, certainly, here is a measure by which the amount can be ascertained, and which brings the case within the rule of certainty to a common intent. Consideration being had of the condition in life of the plaintiff, what annuity would place her in such circumstances that she need not work ? The annuity tables settle what such an annuity is worth or can be bought for. It is true, that this mode of arriving at the plaintiff’s compensation does not appear to have been pursued on the trial below, hut it was left to the jury generally. The supervisory power of the court over the verdict must be resorted to where the amount found is more than was reasonable under the circumstances. We see no error in the manner in which the plaintiff’s right of recovery under the alleged express contractwas submitted to the jury.</p>

Certainly where services are gratuitously rendered under the mere expectation of a legacy, there can be no recovery, for in such a case there is no contract at all: Little <em>v. </em>Dawson, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dall.%20111" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Dall. 111">4 Dall. </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dall.%20111" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Dall. 111">111</a>; </em>Swires <em>v. </em>Parsons, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 357" data-case-ids="478506" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0357-01">5 W. &amp; S. 357</a>. But in Roberts <em>v. </em>Swift, <a href="/yeates/1/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Yeates 209" data-case-ids="6773330" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0209-01">1 Yeates 209</a>, it was decided that if one does services for another at his request, no matter what his expectations were, assumpsit may well be supported to recover a compensation. And in Snyder <em>v. </em>Castor’s Adm., <a href="/yeates/4/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Yeates 353" data-case-ids="6773985" data-case-paths="/yeates/4/0353-01">4 Yeates 353</a>, it was said by Mr. Chief Justice Tilghman, in pronouncing the opinion of the court: “ It has been urged by the defendant’s counsel, that if a person serves another through the expectation of a legacy, in which he is disappointed, he cannot support an action. The law certainly is so, but cannot <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>be applied to a case where the person for whom the services was done promises to pay for it; and it is immaterial whether the promise be made before or after the service.”</p>
