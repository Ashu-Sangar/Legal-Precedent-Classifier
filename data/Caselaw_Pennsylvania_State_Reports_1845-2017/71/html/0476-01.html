We instruct you on the contrary, that if Nancy Baker was at the time she executed, with the other grantors, the conveyance to George Clapper, a minor, or under the age of twenty-one years, that nothing contained in <em>the </em>conveyance itself or in <em>the </em>certificate of the acknowledgment by the magistrate, stands in the way of her avoiding that deed upon her arrival at the age of twenty-one years, or within a reasonable time afterward. The deed of a minor, as said on the one side here, in the case of Schroeder <em>v. </em>Decker, cited, is said to be absolutely void. It is alleged» on the other side to be not absolutely void in every instance, but voidable only, though it is admitted to be in some instances absolutely void, and in every instance, voidable. And for all practical purposes, where the contest or question arises immediately between the minor and another party, it is of very little importance, whe<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>ther the question or the most general rule, be that it is void or only-voidable ; for when we say the deed is avoided, that means that the minor when he or she arrives at the age of twenty-one, may at his or her election treat it as void, without assigning any other reason for it except as to her or his knowledge of the fact. They may treat it as void, and in such case it would not at all intei’fere with that right, or limit the right. If other parties had in the interim between the execution of the deed and the time that that right might be asserted, acquired an interest for a valuable consideration, and without any knowledge of the fact that when only eighteen at the time the conveyance was executed, the grantor might when he or she arrived at the age of twenty-one, treat it as void, and claim the property although it had passed through a dozen of hands in the meantime, and a dozen of intermediate purchasers had acquired title without notice, and for a valuable consideration. The minor might treat it as if it had never existed, and claim the title, he or she had before, in possession of it.]</p>

It would not stop her from avoiding the deed afterwards, if upon such order it were believed that she received the full amount of the consideration, or that it was received upon it.] [It is further alleged that she brought a suit in this court in 1852 in her own name, four or five years after this deed was executed, and upon any conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence to show her age, she was of age, against George Clapper for the purchase-money, claiming the money from him as for something she had sold him, and that suit stands upon the record undetermined, the statement or declaration in this case showing that this was her claim. That action was brought five years after the deed, and is still pending here in this court, and might still, for anything we see, be prosecuted. It was brought at the time and has never since been ended, but is still pending in this court. She is^ the plaintiff upon the record, but she testifies here that she did not bring it, or did not authorize it to be brought. It was commenced by an attorney in this court appearing as her attorney and commencing the case still pending, though she says she did not do it, and that if it was done, her husband must have done it, or had it done, and that it was without her knowledge. Now, it is alleged further that with this suit pending, and the deed on record showing thaf her interest was conveyed, up to the expiration of about twenty years, no claim could be set up for this specific interest in the land while the action was pending in which the purchase-money in the conveyance was pending all the time. We think that the bringing of the action and the prosecution of it for the purchase-money, if she did do it, and understood what she was doing, and her claiming upon the record the purchase-money, would be such a fact as if it not to estop her, would imply a ratification and election of the deed, and her election to treat the deed as valid when she was claiming the purchase-money, if she did so ; but she testifies that this was not done with her knowledge or assent; and there are some facts going to show that she was dissatisfied; and that Clapper himself was endeavoring to get her to sign some paper, the purport of which they could not tell. Now it is for you to say whether there is in all that has been suggested, acts, conduct or declarations of her shown here, which satisfy you that she treated, and that it was calculated to induce others that might become interested in this title to treat the title that she had conveyed as subsisting and valid in the vendee, or those to whom the vendee had conveyed. There was no expressed intention, but if you are satisfied of that, then» you can find here for the defendant, if she did, in your judgment, ratify. If you find from all this evidence that she ratified and treated that conveyance as valid, then your verdict should be for the defendant. If you find either of these questions of fact against the plaintiff, and in favor of the defendant, your verdict will be for <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>the defendant, while if on the other hand you find that she was a minor, and fail to find that she ratified this conveyance after she arrived at the age of twenty-one years, they having shown title to the interest claimed in this land, your verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff, for the undivided one-tenth of the land, described in the writ; and with this we submit the case to you.”]</p>

But though it is not conclusive as between the parties in Gases of fraud and imposition, or of duress, and may be overcome by parol evidence, it is conclusive as to subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration without notice: Schrader <em>v. </em>Decker, 9 Barr 14; Louden <em>v. </em>Blythe, 4 Harris 532; Louden <em>v. </em>Blythe, 3 Casey 22; Michener <em>v. </em>Cavender, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20334" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Wright 334">2 Wright 334</a>; Hall <em>v. </em>Patterson, 1 P. F. Smith 289. But it is conclusive of such fact only as the magistrate is bound to record and certify, not of facts which he is not required to certify under the provisions of the statute. The general rule in regard to certificates, given by persons in official star tion, is that the law never allows a certificate of a mere matter of fact, not coupled with any matter of law, to be admitted in evidence. If the person was bound to recoi’d the fact, then the proper evidence is a copy of the record duly authenticated.. But, as to matters which he was not bound to record, his certificate being extra-official, is merely the statement of a private person, and will therefore be rejected. So, where an officer’s certificate is made evidence of facts, he cannot extend its effect to other facts, by stating those also in the certificate ; but such parts of the certificate will be suppressed: 1 Greenlf. Ev., § 498; Omichund <em>v. </em>Barker, Willes’s R. 549, 50; Wolfe <em>v. </em>Washburn, 6 Cowen 261; Johnson <em>v. </em>Hocker, <a href="/dall/1/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Dall. 406" data-case-ids="12148793,12148851,1408509,1408560" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0406-01,/dall/1/0406-02,/us/1/0421-01,/us/1/0421-02">1 Dall. 406</a>; 3 Cowen &amp; Hill’s Ev., note 701, p. 1044.</p>
    <p id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[295,1644,1163,474]]]'>As the magistrate is not required by the act to certify that the wife was of full age when she acknowledged the deed, she is not concluded by his certificate of the facts from showing that she was a minor when she signed and delivered it. It follows that the evidence of Mrs. Baker’s minority when she executed and acknowledged the deed, under which the defendants claim title to her interest in the land, was rightly received ; and the court properly left the fact to the jury, with the instruction that if she was a minor she might avoid the deed when she came of age, and was entitled to recover, unless she had subsequently ratified the conveyance.</p>
    <p id="b484-7" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[296,2118,1163,302]],["BL_485.1",485,[220,389,1167,611]]]'>Nor have the plaintiffs in error any reason to complain of the charge of the court on the subject of the wife’s alleged ratification of the deed after she attained her majority, or of the manner in which the question was submitted to the jury. It is clear, as the court charged the jury, that if she was a minor when she executed the deed, she was when she signed the order in favor of her husband for the purchase-money, and anything that was received in <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>her minority under the order would he entitled to no weight whatever as a ratification of her act and deed. It would not estop her from avoiding the deed afterwards, if upon such order it were believed that she received the full amount of the consideration, or that it was received by her husband upon it. Nor was she estopped by the suit brought in her name for the purchase-money, which was pending at the trial of this ejectment, if it was not brought with her knowledge and consent. Instead of leaving the jury to find from the evidence that she ratified and treated the conveyance as valid, the court would have been justified in withdrawing the question from the jury and instructing them in conformity with the doctrine in Glidden <em>v. </em>Strupler, 2 P. F. Smith 400, that she. could not ratify the conveyance otherwise than by a re-acknowedgement of the deed in the mode prescribed by the statute. •</p>
    <p id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[222,997,1162,823]]]'>Nor is the plaintiff estopped from recovering her interest in the land during coverture, although her husband joined with her in the deed and received the purchase-money. When it was executed he had no interest or estate in the land as tenant by the curtesy, or otherwise, which he could convey. The wife was not actually or potentially seised of the land. Her mother had a life-estate in it, and-so long as it continued, the husband could not be tenant by the curtesy of the wife’s estate in remainder: Hitner <em>v. </em>Ege, 11 Harris 305; Buchanan <em>v. </em>Duncan, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2082" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Wright 82">4 Wright 82</a>. As the outstanding estate for life did not end until after the passage of the Married Woman’s Act, the wife’s interest in remainder accrued to her subject to its provisions, and the husband took his estate as tenant by the curtesy, with the qualities given to it by the act and its supplements. As the wife’s estate in the land cannot be taken in execution for the debts of her husband, on account of his interest as tenant by the curtesy, it is clear that he has no power to convey or alienate it during coverture. She is therefore not estopped by his deed or covenant of warranty from maintaining this action for its recovery.</p>
