The whole controversy on the trial was in relation to the ownership of the fund — whether it belonged to the plaintiffs or to Hamersly — ■ and the court submitted the question to the jury, with the instruction that if it belonged to the plaintiffs they were entitled to recover ; but if it did not, the verdict should be for the defendant.
