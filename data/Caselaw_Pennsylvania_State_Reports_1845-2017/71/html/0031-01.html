      <em>“ </em>This case arises under the following circumstances: It is an attachment issued by the plaintiffs for the amount due on a marine policy executed by the defendants in favor of Trask, the defendant in the judgment.

There was no formal or written transfer of the policy, but it was endorsed in blank by Trask and given to Bell in pursuance of the covenant. These facts were not contested by the plaintiffs at the trial; but it was contended that the transfer was invalid, because the consent of the insurers had not been given as required by the policy, which contained the following condition : 4 Provided, that no assignment of this policy shall be valid unless the premium has been paid or the note given therefor is further secured by a previous endorsement of the person or persons for whose benefit said assignment is intended, or unless the consent of the insurers be first obtained.’ The question therefore is, whether there was a failure to comply with the terms of this provision invalidating the transfer of the policy to Bell.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b35-12" data-blocks='[["BL_35.10",35,[236,2183,1155,215]],["BL_36.1",36,[281,372,1164,473]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>The assignment of a policy of insurance may be viewed in two different aspects. In one of them it passes the insurance considered as such. In the other it is a mere equitable transfer of the right to receive any sum that may be due in the event of a loss. A purchaser who buys a vessel and takes an assignment of the policy, <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>is substituted in place of tbe vendor. He must, it is true, sue in the name of the latter, but the recovery is in his own right, and the defendants cannot rely on the determination of the insurable interest of the nominal plaintiff as a bar. The liability of the insurers is under these circumstances for all practical purposes the same as if the insurance had been effected in the first instance by the assignee. It is a qualified negotiation of the instrument, which may be likened to the passage of a covenant of warranty with the estate to which it is made incident by the deed. Such is also the rule in the case of an insurance against fire, except that the consent of the insurers is requisite to give validity to the transfer.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b36-5" data-blocks='[["BL_36.4",36,[280,845,1159,513]]]'>“ On the other hand, an assignment of the policy to a stranger in interest, can only operate as an equitable appropriation or transfer of the damages that are or may be payable for the destruction of the property by the perils for which the insurers have agreed to be answerable. The fund is assigned and not the contract, nor the right to be indemnified under it in the event of loss. The assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor without acquiring a neAY or independent status, and cannot recover unless the assignor has an insurable interest when the loss occurs. Such an instance is afforded by the transfer of a policy as collateral security to a creditor who has no estate or interest in the premises insured: Bibend <em>v. </em>Liverpool, 30 California 78.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b36-6" data-blocks='[["BL_36.5",36,[275,1359,1160,1076]],["BL_37.1",37,[231,416,1164,563]]]'>“ In the cases above supposed, the distinction is plainly marked and may be readily applied, but there is a third where the assignment may have a twofold operation, and it is not always easy to say which was designed. This occurs Avhen the policy is transferred to a mortgagee of the property covered by the insurance. Here there are tAvo insurable interests, each of which may subsist and be a ground of action, notwithstanding the determination of the other. The mortgagor is entitled to indemnity as the owner of the equity of redemption; the mortgagee, by virtue of his lien for the debt; and as the extinguishment of the mortgage will not affect the right of the mortgagor, so a sale or alienation by the mortgagor ayíII not preclude a recovery by the mortgagee. Such at least is the case when the consent of the insurers is obtained, or is not requisite to the validity of the transfer, and there is no condition against alienation. When, however, the insurance is against fire, or contains a proviso that it shall not be assigned without the consent of the insurers, a different question may be presented. If the property is conveyed under these circumstances and the policy transferred to the purchaser without the sanction of the insurers, the insurance will be at an end, and there can be no liability under it for a subsequent loss. The assignor cannot recover, because his insurable interest has been determined by the sale; and the assignee is not a party to the contract originally, or by virtue of the assignment. When, lioAvever, the policy is assigned to a mortgagee, and not to an <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>absolute purchaser, there is this material difference, that the assignor retains an insurable interest, and may recover as if the mortgage had not been executed. His right in this regard is a chose in action, a demand assignable in eqitity to any one to whom he thinks fit to transfer it; and it may consequently be transferred as a collateral security to the mortgagee. It is immaterial that the policy does not attach to the insurable interest of the latter; he will still be entitled to the amount due for any loss that may be sustained by the mortgagor. The assignee contends that this Anew should be taken in the present instance. If the assignment did not operate to pass the contract of insurance because the assent of the insurers Avas not given, it should still be construed as an equitable transfer of the claim of the assignor to compensation for the loss.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[231,979,1162,734]]]'>“ The force of this argument is so obvious, that it must prevail unless excluded by the terms of the policy. It is well established that a contract should be so 'construed <em>ut res valeat; </em>and general words of grant will consequently be applied to that which the party can transfer, and not to that Avhich he cannot. A vessel which has been insured is mortgaged. The insurers do not, perhaps will not, sanction an assignment of the policy. The loss is, however, payable by the terms of the instrument to the order of the mortgagor, and Avould be so if there were no express stipulation. Instead of giving an order or power of attorney, with a clause declaring his intention to pass the fund irrevocably by Avay of anticipation, he endorses the policy in blank and delivers it to the mortgagee in pursuance of an agreement to keep the property insured for the benefit of the latter. Manifestly the transaction should be construed in accordance Avith the intention of the parties as an equitable transfer of the right to receive the money, and not as an assignment of the policy as an insurance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b37-7" data-blocks='[["BL_37.5",37,[229,1713,1163,734]],["BL_38.1",38,[285,408,1159,173]]]'>“ It is, hoAvever, said, on behalf of the plaintiffs, that the words of the condition are broad enough to include any assignment, either of the policy, as such, or of the amount that may be due under it in the eve^t of loss. In considering this argument, it is necessary to remember that restraints on alienation are to be strictly construed. Of two interpretations, that is to be preferred which reconciles their operation with the general principle that every one may give what he possesses or is entitled to receive. A man who contracts with one person may well refuse to permit another to become a party to the agreement. This is peculiarly true when the relation is one of trust and confidence, which is necessarily the case betAveen the insurers and the insured. The former may therefore properly require that they should not be put under an obligation to indemnify a third person by an act to which they do not agree. But a provision that the insured shall not be permitted to transfer the amount that may become due under the contract as originally made, is a very different thing. Rights of action <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>
      <em>ex contractu </em>are in the contemplation of equity as susceptible of alienation as rights which have been reduced into possession. In either case a restraint imposed capriciously without a sufficient cause, is contrary to good policy and void.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.4",38,[278,581,1166,645]]]'>“ It is accordingly established that the right of action arising from a loss may be transferred subsequently without the consent of the insurers, notwithstanding the express provision that if such an assignment be made, ‘ the policy shall be void, and all liability of the company under it shall henceforth cease.’ The West Branch Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Helfenstein, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20289" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Wright 289">4 Wright 289</a>. Woodward, C. J., said that ‘however competent it might be for the company to make the contract of insurance dependent upon such a condition, it was not competent for them to limit the legal effect of a claim upon them after a loss. The insured acquired by reason of the loss, a legal right to receive so much money from the hands of the company. That chose in action he might assign. The condition appealed to was not a defence. If it was applicable to a case like that under consideration, it was void and null because opposed to the law of the land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-6" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[275,1227,1164,334]]]'>“ In this instance, the assignment was subsequent to the loss; but the reasoning of the Chief Justice is not less in point where the transfer is made, previously and designed to take effect when the loss occurs. A man cannot, it is said, assign the freight of the ship which he is about to build, or the wool of the sheep which he intends to buy; but a contingent right depending on an existing contract is assignable in equity, and for some purposes, at law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-7" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[272,1572,1166,678]]]'>“ These views are sustained by the cases of Cresswell <em>v. </em>The Brooklyn Eire Insurance Company, 39 Bark. 227, and Shotwell <em>v. </em>The Jefferson Insurance Company, 5 Bosworth 247, which bear a close analogy to the present, and are indeed identical in principle. The former case was virtually a bill in equity by an unpaid vendor to have the benefit of an insurance effected by the purchaser. It appeared from the evidence that the vendee had gone into possession under an agreement to keep the premises insured as security for the unpaid balance of the purchase-money. A policy was taken out in pursuance of this agreement, which contained the following proviso: ‘ The interest of the insured in this policy is not assignable unless by consent of this corporation, manifested in writing. In case of any transfer or termination of the interest of the insured, either by sale or otherwise, without such consent, this policy shall thenceforth be void and of no effect.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-8" data-blocks='[["BL_38.7",38,[271,2261,1160,171]],["BL_39.1",39,[233,405,1159,907]]]'>“ The court held that if the interest of the assured had been assigned without consent, it would have been a breach of the condition, and no recovery could have been bad on the policy by any one. It was, however, established under Mellon <em>v. </em>The Eranklin <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>Fire Insurance Company, 17 New York 609, that such a clause did not apply to a transfer of the policy, or of the claim arising under it, after the happening of a loss. In the case before the court, the plaintiff was not an assignee of the policy in the sense of the condition, nor did his claim arise through a transfer of the interest covered by the insurance. His true position was that of an equitable assignee of the right of the purchaser to compensation for the destruction of the premises. It had been contended that an equitable assignment of the policy of insurance was as much within the prohibition of the policy, and within the mischief it was intended to prevent, as a legal assignment. It was not necessary to consider the truth of this proposition, because the right which plaintiff had acquired was not to the policy as such, buffo the money due as compensation for the loss. Such an assignment was not equivalent to an assignment of the policy, whether made before or after the occurrence of the injury. The short answer to the objection made on behalf of the insurance company, was that the plaintiff was an equitable assignee of the fund arising out of the obligation of the contract, and not of the policy, and therefore not within the clause prohibiting the assignment of the policy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-6" data-blocks='[["BL_39.4",39,[231,1312,1159,1120]]]'>The distinction was drawn with much precision in Shotwell <em>v. </em>The Jefferson Insurance Company. The plaintiff effected an insurance on his real estate, Avith a proviso that the premises should not be alienated, or the policy be assigned without the consent of the insurers. He subsequently sold the house, and covenanted to keep it insured for the benefit of the vendee. The latter went into possession, and paid the purchase-money except the last instalment of $1500. It was held, under these circumstances, that the policy was not avoided by the sale. The vendor might recover to the extent of his insurable interest, or, in other words, so far as he was prejudiced by the loss. The judgment must, however, be limited to the amount of the purchase-money. There could be no recovery under the policy for the injury sustained by the vendee. In this regard, it made no difference that the vendor had covenanted to keep the premises insured for the benefit of the purchaser. This stipulation operated as an equitable assignment of any demand that might accrue in his own right; but did not confer an independent right on the covenantee. The consent of the insurers was requisite to the transfer of the policy as an insurance, it was not requisite to the transfer of the policy as a demand. It followed that the insurers were not entitled to subrogation to the lien for the unpaid purchase-money. If such a right could have arisen under other circumstances, it wás precluded by the covenant which operated as an implied assignment, entitling the vendee to have the fund applied to the extinguishment of the unpaid balance of the purchase-money.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b40-4" data-blocks='[["BL_40.3",40,[294,401,1159,1330]]]'>
      <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>We may, therefore, draw the following inferences with regard to the case in hand: 1st. That the assignment should be viewed as a transfer of the claim for damages in the event of loss, and not of the policy as a contract to insure; and next, that this claim might be transferred without the consent of the insurers, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the contract. If, however, we thought differently on these points, we should still be of opinion that the plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment. The policy is against losses by the perils of the sea; and might, consequently, pass to any one who acquired a title to the vessel unless restrained : Powles <em>v. </em>Jones, 13 M. &amp; W. 101. The restraint imposed was not absolute, but that no transfer should be valid without the consent of the insurers, ‘ unless the premium had been paid or the note given therefor was further secured by the previous endorsement of the person or persons for whose benefit the assignment was intended.’ The premium was not paid when the insurance was effected by Trask, nor was the note given for it endorsed by Bell when the policy was subsequently transferred; but on the 16th of September 1868, the garnishees came to a settlement with Messrs. Moody &amp; Telfair acting for Bell, by which it was agreed that the loss should be paid to him after deducting the amount of a judgment which had been obtained for the premiums due by Trask. This arrangement took place prior to the attachment, and with full knowledge that Bell claimed as assignee. The effect was to satisfy the premiums by setting them off against the amount due under the assignment. It was, therefore, not only an admission by the garnishees that the assignment was valid, but a bar precluding them from alleging the non-payment of the premium as a reason why it should be void.

The condition contained in the policy against assignment was for the benefit of the insurers and could be waived by them, and even if the question arose upon the record we think there was ample evidence that they did waive it. No exception was taken to the reservation in the court below, and such being the ease, we are bound to assume that it was assented to or acquiesced in by all parties as a true statement of the facts. Very great injustice might be done if a party not objecting at the time of the reservation should be permitted afterwards to take the ground that there was no evidence of the facts or that they ought to have been submitted to the jury. If a point of law be reserved it must be done by stating on the record the facts on which it arises: Winchester <em>v. </em>Bennett, 4 P. F. Smith 510; Wilde <em>v. </em>Trainor, 9 <a href="/iowa/1/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="1 Iowa 404" data-case-ids="8664755" data-case-paths="/iowa/1/0404-01">Ibid. 439</a>; Ferguson <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 Ibid. 258; Campbell <em>v. </em>O’Neill, 14 Ibid. 290. Unless the facts are found by the jury specially, there is no mode of reserving a question but by an agreement, and if the judge states the facts without such an agreement, the party must make his objection and enter his exception at the time according to every rule for the fair trial of causes.</p>
