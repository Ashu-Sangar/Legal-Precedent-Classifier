In an issue in the Court of Common Pleas of Le-high county a verdict was rendered for the following sums on said judgments, to wit: June 14th 1871, verdict for $2213.24, and same day, verdict for $10,965, with interest thereon from date of verdict and costs. The question of new trial is pending in court in said cases, and therefore counsel for Barrett’s estate object to all evidence under the offer of counsel for assignee and creditors ; and further allege that while the question of new trial is yet in the hands of the court and undisposed of, the auditor has no jurisdiction ; and further allege generally that the auditor has no jurisdiction except to allow and report the amount of the verdict on said judgments in full, with interest and costs. A great number of witnesses were called by the accountant — they were objected to severally by the counsel for Barrett’s estate, and cross-examined under protest.</p>

Fisher, the agent of Miller <em>&amp; </em>Cottrell, before <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>this sheriff’s sale, that Barrett should not bid on this mill property, but should let Fisher buy it in, and should then let his money stand for one year, in consideration of which Miller &amp; Cottrell were to pay Barrett’s lawyer fees and expenses, and to pay or secure his notes against D. A. Smith and James Smith; that Barrett did not bid on the property, and that after Fisher, as agent for Miller &amp; Cottrell, had become the purchaser of the property ; this arrangement was consummated by Miller &amp; Cottrell ■paying $800 for Barrett’s lawyer fees and expenses, apd giving him their mortgage on this property, accompanied by a bond and warrant for $6500, being his share of the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale, and the $3200 notes with the’ interest due thereon. The next question then is, what is the effect of this ? It is very plain that by this arrangement Barrett made nearly if not quite $4000. The defendants had a -right to have their property sold for the highest price it would bring at a fair and open public sale, and any combination between Barrett and Fisher to prevent bidding on the property, was unlawful and a fraud upon the defendants. Had the facts of this ease been known at the time of the sale, as they are now developed, it would have been good ground to set the sale aside. But that not having been done, can the assignee and creditors of D. A. Smith now take advantage of it, and have the amount thus secured to Nathan Barrett deducted from his judgments ? This case seems to fall within the principle of the case of Young <em>v. </em>Stone, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 45" data-case-ids="1856462" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0045-01">4 W. &amp; S. 45</a>. In that case the Supreme Court say that the ‘ amount of money realized by the plaintiff in a judgment by means of a sheriff’s sale of land, must be credited to the defendant, whether it be procured by a private contract with the purchaser or bid at the public sale.’ If this be sound law, then whatever sum Barrett actually realized out of this sheriff’s sale, either out of the $12,000 actually bid for the property at the sale, or by means of the private arrangement between him and Fisher, must be credited to the defendants on Barrett’s mortgages on this property, and it is a satisfaction of these judgments for that amount. * * * Hence it will appear that on judgment No. 355 there is now actually nothing due, and on judgment No. 356 there is due the sum of $9,684.88.</p>

Bridges and Stiles again appear for the estate of Nathan Barrett and protest against the admission of evidence to impeach the judgments of Barrett or to show a satisfaction of them in part, and object to the jurisdiction of the auditor while the issues remain undecided in the Common Pleas, but while thus protesting and objecting they demand a distribution of the fund so as to pay the judgments in full, denying to the auditor all right to inquire how much may be due on their demands. While such a protest presents a most strange anomaly in jurisprudence, it becomes a most convenient device, by which the payment of an unjust demand may be secured; it is an arrogant demand for payment, with a persistent refusal to permit an inquiry as to how much is due upon the claim presented. The law, however, tolerates no such arrogance. The presentation of the claims and a demand for payment, is totally inconsistent with the protest and objection, and the auditor therefore had a clear right to disregard them, and to treat the claim as presented for distribution, and to proceed to admit the testimony of the assignee to show that there was a <em>pro tanto </em>satisfaction. It will be remembered that the issues in the Common Pleas were instituted by the assignee, and I take it, that while it is the right of all parties to have a question of fact tried by a jury, he who does not ask for an issue cannot avail himself of the action taken by his adversary. The assignee had a clear right to insist on a trial of the issues, but he had also as clear a right to waive it; and having assented to a hearing before the auditor of the same subject-matter involved in the issues, he cannot now demand a trial in the Common Pleas. Had the issue of fact before the auditor been found against him, he could not invoke the verdicts found to set aside the finding of the auditor.. The absolute confirmation of the auditor’s report would have operated as a decree to enforce payment of the judgments in full. If the pending motions for a new trial are made absolute, the verdicts on the issues are set aside, and the estate of Nathan Barrett will receive no more than is allowed in this distribution. Again, if a new trial shall be granted, it will be competent for the assignee to ask leave to withdraw the issues framed. Whether that can be done, or not, need not now be decided.</p>

We fail to see, as the learned judge saw, any waiver by the appellants of their right to have the questions of fact decided in the pending issue in the Common -Pleas by appearing before the auditor. They appeared in the first instance under protest, insisting upon their legal rights. When they appeared again upon a reference back to the auditor, the court had suspended their opinion on the motion in the feigned issue “ until the distribution be made in the assigned estate, if an account shall be filed in a reasonable time.” The issue had been awarded on the petition of the assignee — the present appellee — ■ and when awarded, all proceedings on the judgments were stayed until the feigned issue was decided; so that the hands of the appellants were tied by the orders of the court. Under such circumstances they cannot be held to have waived any legal right by appearing before the auditor. Nor were they bound to demand a new issue when one was already pending, upon which they had succeeded in obtaining a verdict in their favor. It would seem more reasonable to hold that the assignee was precluded from any other course than that which he had himself voluntarily adopted, without at least, with the approbation of the court, having the feigned issue in some way finally disposed of. It seems to us that the court ought not to allow him to withdraw it without the consent of the appellants. The only doubt we have entertained is, whether the appellants had any standing before the auditor, or in this court on appeal. The judgments of the appellants against David A. Smith were entered up in Lehigh county, May 11th 1870. The assignment was dated May 16th 1870. We presume, although the fact is not distinctly stated, that the fund in the hands of the assignee for distribution was the proceeds of real estate in Lehigh county sold by him. The judgments, if they were valid, were and continued to be liens on the lands in the hands of the purchasers. The contest should rather be with them. It is their business to see that these judgments are satisfied or set aside. If Weiler has undertaken to sell for an outside price, clear of all encumbrances, it would be at his risk if the liens were after-wards enforced against the land. Under the circumstances, however, the appellants having appeared before the auditor and claimed payment of the judgments out of this fund, may perhaps be held to have waived their liens as against the purchasers, aad <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>we think therefore they ought not to be precluded from the benefit of this appeal.</p>
