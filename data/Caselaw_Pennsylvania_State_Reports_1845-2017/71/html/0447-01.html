It was no judgment as to him, any more than it would have been against any stranger who might have attested it. It follows from this, that the first judgment entered against Heagy, bound his interest in the land acquired by deed from Harman, and so on, according to priority. Harman’s interest was divested by his conveyance, and Fickes’s lien was lost because he did not continue it against Heagy in time.
