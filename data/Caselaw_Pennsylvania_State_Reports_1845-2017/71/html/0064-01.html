The property adjoining on the northwardly side at the date of the conveyance to the plaintiff had no building on it and was then the property of Frederick Fox, from whom these respondents derived title: there was a fence between the plaintiff’s property and this adjoining property in which was a gate from plaintiff’s lot to the adjoining ground, which these defendants averred was the “remaining ground of Frederick Fox: — this ground belonged to Matthew Craig. These defendants denied that Frederick Fox made a passage in his house to carry the filth through the house now belonging to them; there was an entry through the house made by Frederick Fox for the convenience of his family; Frederick Fox in his lifetime and these defendants since his death, denied the claim made by the plaintiff. These defendants denied the right of the plaintiff to carry the filth through the entry; denied that Frederick Fox conveyed such right to the plaintiff, or that the words “ over and across the remaining ground ” gave the plaintiff the right to carry through the house. <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>Craig answered, admitting according to his belief that Frederick Fox conveyed the premises and passage-way to the plaintiff as stated in his bill. On the 24th of August 1860, Frederick Fox conveyed to this defendant free from any condition or reservation a lot of ground on the north-east side of Marlborough street and at that time Frederick Fox owned a lot and messuage adjoining the defendant on the south-east; Frederick Fox died intestate in possession of the said messuage and lot. and seised of them, and the other defendants were his heirs. About the time of the sale by Frederick Fox to this defendant, he had opened an entry or passage “ through, over and across his remaining ground, that is to say over and through the messuage and lot of ground, which he himself occupied, and which adjoined ” this defendant’s lot; that this passage was once or more used by the plaintiff during Frederick Fox’s lifetime “with his knowledge and consent and in <em>ex-t </em>ercise of the privilege granted to the plaintiff for the purpose of conveying the filth, &amp;c., into Marlborough street.” No such way had ever been opened over this defendant’s premises; the plaintiff never used his lot or claimed the right to do so in exercise of his privilege; but “ the passage or alley above set forth was selected and used by Fox and the plaintiff for that purpose.”</p>

The right of way is expressly granted, but its precise location and limits are not fixed and defined by the deed. Looking to the general terms of the grant and the condition of the ground at the date of the deed, the reasonable construction and inference would seem to be, that the parties intended that the right should be exercised over that part of the ground which was <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>then vacant. Rut it was competent for them to define the location and determine the limits of the passage-way, which were undefined by the deed, by subsequent agreement, use and acquiescence. When, therefore, the appellant’s grantor, on the 14th of August, 1860, sold and conveyed the adjoining vacant ground to Matthew Craig, with covenant of special warranty, without subjecting it to the burden of the right of way previously granted and conveyed to the appellant, the fair presumption is, that he intended that Craig should take the land discharged from the burden of the easement, and that it should be fastened on the improved land of which he was still the owner. The evidence shows that, soon after the date of this conveyance, Fox agreed to open an entry in his house leading out to Marlborough street, for the purpose of enabling the appellant to exercise the right of way to which he was entitled by the terms of his deed. That he subsequently opened an entry through his house to Marlborough street in order to provide a passage-way as agreed, and that the appellant used it during the lifetime of Eox, for the purposes expressed in the deed, is satisfactorily shown by the testimony of Louis Holsworth, corroborated, as it is, by the testimony of Philip Rothfuss, John Miller, and Edward P. Nace, one of the defendant’s witnesses. Under the circumstances, it is manifest that Frederick Fox, if he were living, could not with any justice or equity, insist that the right of way granted to the appellant should be exercised over the lot which he subsequently sold and conveyed to Craig; and if not, then the appellees have no right to insist that the burden of the servitude shall be imposed on Craig, who bought the property from their ancestor and paid him a full consideration for it. Under the pleadings and proofs in this case the appellant is clearly entitled to the right of way over the appellees’ lot, as fixed and defined by their ancestor, and as used in his lifetime. The court below, therefore, erred in awarding an injunction against Craig, and dismissing the bill as' to the appellees. The bill should have been dismissed as to Craig, and a perpetual injunction awarded as against the appellees who claim title as heirs of Frederick Fox, to the lot on which he imposed the easement claimed by the appellant.</p>
