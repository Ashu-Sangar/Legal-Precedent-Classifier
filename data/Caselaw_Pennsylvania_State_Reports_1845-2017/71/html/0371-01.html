In April 1869, one of the over seérs of the poor of Moreland applied to C. B. Sperry, a resident of Davidson township, and a brother of the pauper, to take and keep her. Mr. Sperry replied that he was not able to support <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>her, but was willing to do what he could. The overseers replied that she belonged to the township of Davidson. On the 22d day of May 1869, at the time of the conversation last stated, the Overseers of Moreland had brought the pauper to the house of Mr. Sperry, in the night, when it was cold and raining.

In May 1870, Mr. Sperry caused her to be taken to Moreland township ; the overseers of the poor refused to receive her, and she was brought back to his house. He then procured an order of relief from two justices of the peace, directed <em>to the </em>overseers of the poor of Davidson township, and thereupon the order of removal from Davidson to Moreland, which gives rise to the present controversy, was procured, the pauper was removed to Moreland, and this appeal therefrom was taken by the overseers of the poor of that township.</p>

If by legal proceedings, or otherwise, a pauper is brought where he is legally settled, and is there, by proper authority, placed in the hands of the overseer, an order to remove him thence would be contrary to the spirit and meaning of the Acts of Assembly.

It appears from her testimony that she went to hire with a Mr. Worthington, in that township, and remained until a year from the next fall. In regard to this she says: <em>‘ </em>Mr. Worthington came after me to go to his house, to give me a home; he said his wife wished me to come and live with them. After I had been there awhile, I asked him if I should be sick, if they would be willing to take care of me. He replied that if I had a short sickness he would take care of me as well as they could, but if I had a long sickness they would put me on the township. After this conversation I went on and worked for them,.and they provided me with boarding and all that I needed. This conversation took place, I think, in the fall after I went there. I stayed there after, the same as I did before. I lived with them, and worked as one of the family.’</p>

Clearly it was not. She was offered a home at his house, and she accepted the offer. She went to ‘ live with them,’ and she stayed and worked there as one of the family, both before and after the conversation in regard to taking care of her if she should be sick. The whole arrangement was gratuitous. She needed a home, and her services were undoubtedly equivalent <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>for all that she required for her sustenance. The promise, if it may be so called, to take care of her ‘when sick for a short time,’ was nothing more than was implied in offering her a home. It does not appear that she was induced by this conversation to remain, nor that she intended to leave if it had not taken place. Without a hiring under a contract, express or implied, no settlement is gained; service for which board and clothing are given, without a bargain, is not sufficient: Lewiston <em>v. </em>Granville, 5 Barr 283. * * *</p>

She said, ‘ I am not able to pay you for what you do, but I will give you all my clothes.’ I stayed with her until she died, which was about a year and a half.’ Again witness Rays, ‘ There was no bargain of any kind when I first went there Sometime after I first went there, to my sister’s, she spoke to me about giving me her clothes, and said she had no money.

This conversation took place at ‘ sometime’ after Anna went there; but whether she worked for her sister a year after that, does not appear. But if it did, a living was not thereby established. A dying woman tells her sister, who was ministering to her wants, probably while gratefully acknowledging the kindness received, that the only return she can make for it is to leave her her clothes when she is done with them.

That summer she came and remained with the family until she was injured by the fall before mentioned. Mr. Taylor swears expressly that he had no bargain with her, and that he did not pay her wages.

    <p id="b379-7" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[271,880,1165,1556]],["BL_380.1",380,[269,379,1167,813]]]'>The first exception has reference to the evidence and finding of the learned judge of a hiring and performance of service by Anna Sperry, in Benton township, Columbia county, at one Doty’s for a year. The proof was by a brother of Anna, who testified that he visited her while she worked there; that she was strong and capable of doing full work as a house servant; that she worked there one or two years, and that he thinks she worked for wages; that he always understood it so, and that Doty’s family were no relations of hers. It was earnestly contended that this was not a hiring, and the performance of service for a whole year under which a settlement could be gained. It would not be, under the English rule, but we think it was under our more liberal rule. If one who is no relative, and not an object of charity but able to earn wages, is proved to have been employed in the service of another for a year, or any other period of time, the law implies a promise to pay, on the implication of a contract. Certainly this presumption of a contract will stand until rebutted by facts to the contrary. But we are not without authority on the point. In Heidleberg <em>v. </em>Lyon, <a href="/whart/5/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Whart. 430" data-case-ids="8878425" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0430-01">5 Whart. 430</a>, Chief Justice Gibson, in treating of the point, said, <em>“ </em>Our law seems to consider service alone as the meritorious cause, and to require that there should have been a contract for it, only as proof that it was valuable, and distinguished in that respect from those feeble and trifling acts whieh are sometimes performed in requital of a gratuitous maintenance;” in other words, to show that the hireling had been a benefit to the township and a producer, and not a pauper from the beginning. “ It is therefore,” he says, “ enough for the purpose that the pauper has been in uninterrupted employment, whether under one contract or any number of contracts.” The proof was certainly to this effect. It is sufficient for a party to an action, primfi facie, to show labor performed to raise an implied assumpsit to pay for it: Swires <em>v. </em>Parsons, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 357" data-case-ids="478506" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0357-01">5 W. &amp; S. 357</a>. Cases are not necessary to prove this. The proof was primá facie here sufficient to raise a presumption of hiring and conclusive on the hearing, not being disproved or repelled. Of course, the judgment of the court was not conclusive on Benton township, <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>but only on Moreland township, in the contest with Davidson township. This being so, the decree of the court affirming the order of removal from Davidson to Moreland, together with expenses and costs, was altogether proper and right. It will be for the latter to take charge of the pauper until it finds her place of last legal settlement. I will not speculate on what might be the condition of affairs, if it should turn out eventually that she had no residence in Benton or any other township, excepting at her derivative settlement, which it seems was .Davidson township; we leave this until it occurs. One thing we regret to notice in this case, which we ought not to omit, that one at least of the overseers of Moreland township, acted like anything but the good Samaritan, in surreptitiously removing this poor lame woman in the wet and cold from the place of her injury, and in the nighttime, to the house of a very indigent brother, for the evident purpose of getting rid of the maintenance the township owed her until her true place of settlement could be ascertained. It was uncharitable, and I might add, unchristian conduct, to say the least of it.</p>
