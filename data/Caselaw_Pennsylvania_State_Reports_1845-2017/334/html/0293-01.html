Brown, as an individual, owned and operated the South Hills Lumber and Supply Company prior to its incorporation in 1930. He was then appellant’s husband, although by the time of the hearing in this case they had been divorced. J. T. Brady, whoi was interested in the business, placed securities belonging to him as collateral with the bank for a loan of !|15,000 to Brown in 1930, The understanding was that <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>a corporation was to be formed by Brown, and Brady was to receive shares of stock in the company. Brown gave his judgment notes to Brady to protect him against loss. The proceeds of the loans from the bank were immediately placed to the credit of the company, and in June, 1930, the corporation was formed as contemplated. The assets were turned over to the corporation, and Brown, president and director, received 1,200 of the 1,210 shares outstanding. The ten remaining shares were held by two of the other three directors.</p>
    <p id="b325-3" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[148,898,1152,970]]]'>Brady, dissatisfied with the arrangements, in September, 1930, threatened to force the corporation into receivership unless his collateral was released. The four directors apparently felt that Brady had a valid claim against the corporation, and to preserve the business they prevailed on appellant to replace Brady’s collateral with her own. On September 19, 1930, without any formal corporate action, Brown executed a new note to the bank for $20,000 in his own name, discharging the $15,000 obligation and Brady’s collateral, and appellant’s securities to the amount of $60,000 were pledged for payment of the $20,000 note. On the same day, the president and treasurer gave her a judgment note for $20,000 to protect her, the directors having informally consented to its execution. The proceeds of the $20,000 loan were used to pay the $15,000 obligation for which Brady’s shares had been pledged, and the balance for payroll and other corporate purposes.</p>
    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[147,1880,1152,534]],["BL_326.1",326,[284,354,1147,205]]]'>On October 19, 1931, appellant was given a note executed by the president and treasurer for $1,050 to cover interest to that date. One week later, another creditor of the corporation having objected to appellant’s preferred status by virtue of the power to confess judgment in her note, she was induced to surrender her judgment note in exchange for the corporation’s written agreement, signed by the president and treasurer to protect her against loss. There was evidence the latter instrument was executed upon formal action of the di<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>rectors, but the entry of this action upon tbe minutes had been neglected by the secretary. It appears that nothing has been paid to the bank or to appellant on these obligations.</p>

Appellant, having repeatedly but unsuccessfully requested him to pay her claim which she asserted against the corporation, filed an affidavit of claim in the court below on January 27, 1937, for $21,050, with interest from October 19, 1931, which, after hearing, the court dismissed on the ground that no properly authorized obligation of the corporation had been shown. The court also intimated that appellant was barred by laches in pressing her claim.</p>

Brown continued to dominate the business. The old name was retained. The assets of the old company were transferred to the new one. Under such circumstances, the courts will not permit the assets in the new company to escape the claims of creditors of the old. The corporate fiction will be disregarded and a continuing liability will be imposed on the business for obligations accrued before incorporation, at least to the extent of pursuing the assets transferred. See <em>Kulka v. Nemirovsky (et al.), </em><a href="/pa/321/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="321 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1165878" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0234-01">321 Pa. 234</a>, where the cases are collected and fully discussed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Nor will courts, permit such claims to be defeated where, in a close corporation, transactions concerning them are <em>apparently </em>made with corporate authority although none actually existed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The corporate liability comes through <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>the continuing liability of the assets for the debt prior to incorporation. This is one of those instances where courts will, for the purpose of effecting substantial justice and protecting innocent parties, look through the corporate form and regard the corporation and the individuals owning its stock as identical.

On the contrary, he not only contemplated corporate liability but undoubtedly pledged his collateral on that condition, and asserted corporate liability in his action toward receivership which brought about a release of his collateral by the bank.</p>

The fact she executed the hypothecation papers in blank does not alter her claim in the least.
