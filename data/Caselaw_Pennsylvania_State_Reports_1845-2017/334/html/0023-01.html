The chancellor found, and the findings are apparently supported by the testimony, that in furtherance of the purpose to unionize the employees of the plaintiff company, between thirty-five and forty pickets, with signs on their hats and carrying banners, falsely stating the existence of a “strike,” surrounded the factory of plaintiff company; in the course of the picketing, violence was resorted to; the plaintiff’s employees were accosted, insulted, reviled and intimidated; a number were set upon and beaten; their clothing was torn, and on one occasion a police guard was required to enable plaintiff’s employees to enter the factory. The pickets, by threats of violence and other expressions tending to intimidate, prevented automobile trucks transporting merchandise consigned to plaintiff, from making deliveries thereof, and from removing manufactured goods from the plant.</p>
