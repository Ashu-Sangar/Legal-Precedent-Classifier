It contends that the prothonotary was authorized to enter the judgment by section 28 of the Act of February 24, 1806, 4 Sm. Laws 270, 278, which makes it his duty “on the application of any; person being the original holder (or assignee of such holder) of a note, bond, or other instrument of Avriting, in which judgment is confessed, or containing a warrant for an attorney-at-law, or other person to confess judgment, to enter judgment against the person or persons, who executed the same for the amount, which, from the face of the instrument, may appear to be due, without the agency of an attorney, or declaration filed. . . .” It is settled that the act must be strictly construed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b532-9" data-blocks='[["BL_532.8",532,[267,1570,1153,695]],["BL_533.1",533,[99,350,1157,1791]],["BL_534.1",534,[312,356,1149,264]]]'>The learned court below was of opinion that the instrument did not clearly show the amount for which judgment was intended to be entered, that the prothonotary’s act was therefore unauthorized and that the judgment must be stricken off. We think that position cannot be maintained. The amount for which judgment was entered, and was intended to be entered, clearly appears by reference to the other side of the note and the prothonotary was justified in so considering it. Apart, now, from the question whether O’Boyle authorized any confession against him, a subject dealt Avith later, it is to be noted that payment was guaranteed and judgment was confessed “for the amount and col<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>lection fees, in the event same is not paid at maturity”; the “amount,” so referred to, appears on the face of the note to which reference was directed by the writing on the back. Such reference from one side of the paper to the other, if intended, is consistent with the construction placed on the statute: <em>Cooper v. Shaver, </em><a href="/pa/101/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="101 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="500900" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0547-01">101 Pa. 547</a>. When, on January 7, 1929, the bank presented the note to the prothonotary for the entry of judgment against the corporation maker at No. 915, January Term, 1929, (a judgment not challenged) and against James P. O’Boyle at No. 916, January Term, 1929, (the judgment stricken off) the note was past due as would appear by inspection. The note was in the possession of the bank; its possession was prima facie proof that the note was owing to it as holder,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to whom it had been specially endorsed. As it was past due, an averment that it had not been paid at maturity was unnecessary to advise the prothonotary of the fact; it already appeared; and the only amount involved was that stated on the face of the note.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The difference between the case, in this respect, and those relied on by the learned court below is plain. In <em>Meyers &amp; Joly v. Freiling, </em><a href="/pa-super/81/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="81 Pa. Super. 116" data-case-ids="655584" data-case-paths="/pa-super/81/0116-01">81 Pa. Superior Ct. 116</a>, the authority to confess judgment was “for any of the above sums, with cost of suit”; the words “above sums” referred to commissions to be earned; obviously a prothonotary could not determine from the paper what would be earned. In <em>Automobile Corporation v. Duffey-Mullen Motor Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/85/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="85 Pa. Super. 296" data-case-ids="665641" data-case-paths="/pa-super/85/0296-01">85 Pa. Superior Ct. 296</a>, the amount due on the note was to be reduced by payment of monthly installments so that the paper furnished no information to the prothonotary of the amount due at the time it was presented for the entry of judgment; <em>Lansdowne Bank &amp; </em>

In <em>Kalf v. Lieberman, </em><a href="/pa/282/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="282 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="1088348" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0479-01">282 Pa. 479</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20A.%20122" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="128 A. 122">128 A. 122</a>, an averment of default was held necessary because “on the face of the record no default is apparent.” Here it was apparent.</p>

    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[312,850,1151,1134]]]'>The note was negotiable. Being payable to “ourselves,” the maker’s obligation did not arise until the note was negotiated. The negotiation was by the special indorsement and delivery to the plaintiff bank. While O’Boyle may have been acceptable as guarantor the words on the back of the note do not include him in that category.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> If the bank regarded him as having joined in the guarantee and confession appearing on the back of the note, why did it leave blank the space provided for the purpose of inserting words showing pre^ cisely who was intended to be included? <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> O’Boyle was an indorser (Sections 17(6), 63 and 64 of the N. I. L. of 1901, P. L. 194, 56 PS sections 22(6), 154 and 155) and apparently an accommodation indorser, section 29, N. I. L., 56 PS section 66. Inspection shows that the bank did not indorse the note for transfér; O’Boyle probably placed his name on it before it was delivered to the bank. There is nothing to show that his indorsement, without more, constituted an agreement for the entry of judgment against him; in the absence of evidence that he agreed, the judgment is without support.</p>
