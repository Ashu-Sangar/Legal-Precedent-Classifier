The certificates, one <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>for 100, and tlie other for 40 shares, had originally been issued to and stood in the name of Mayer Silverman.</p>
    <p id="b243-3" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[166,458,1152,1399]]]'>On February 21,1936, Louis Sitnek, who is not a party to this suit which was brought October 26, 1938, presented the certificates and requested that new ones be issued to him. The corporation acknowledged their receipt, and, over its president’s signature, stated that “new certificates for an equal number of shares will be issued within ten days from this date.” They were, however, not issued, and in justification of the refusal, defendants, in their answer in this proceeding, denied that “the certificates were or are duly transferred and assigned to Louis Sitnek by Mayer Silverman. On the contrary said assignments, appearing on said certificates as purporting to be to Louis Sitnek, were and are obviously garbled and altered, the assignments having originally been made by said Mayer Silverman at a previous date, in the year 1933, to Sarah Silverman, now deceased, and her name as assignee having been partially obliterated thereon, and the name of Sitnek substituted therefor, without her knowledge or consent, and the original date of the assignment to her obliterated, garbled, and altered to February 24, 1936, being a date three days after their presentation for transfer to said Sitnek.” They averred that Sarah Silverman died March 23, 1936, without having consented to the change in the assignments, and that her personal representatives have not consented.</p>
