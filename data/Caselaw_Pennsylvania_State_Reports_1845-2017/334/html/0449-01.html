These acts are: 1, the Act (No. 323) of June 4, 1937, P. L. 1552; 2, the Act (No. 552) of July 2, 1937, P. L. 2714, called the “Occupational Disease Compensation Act”.; and 3, Act No. 20 of the Special Session of 1938, approved September 29, 1938, P. L. 52. “1” is an “amendment” to the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915, P. L. 736. “2” is a “supplement” to the Act of 1915. “3” amends Article II of the Act of 1915 “by adding a new section 201.1 thereto and imposing the presumption <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>of negligence upon employers; providing for admission of certain evidence; and providing for double damage under certain circumstances.” These acts are alleged to be unconstitutional. A motion was made for a preliminary injunction; a rule to show cause was granted; and testimony was later taken, showing, inter alia, the workmen’s compensation insurance rates under the Act of 1915 and by comparison under the acts challenged. These new rates, as fixed by the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau, represent an increase of 62% per cent over the rates under the old act. This would mean to one of the plaintiffs, the Morrisdale Company, a cost of 11% cents per ton of coal mined. It was also testified that the plaintiff just named considered rejecting the compensation system imposed by Act No. 323, but it was advised by insurance brokers that no insurance carrier in Pennsylvania would insure it against the liability in actions at law under the provisions of section 201, Article II of Act No. 323, which strips employers rejecting the compensation law of the following defenses: (1) the negligence of a fellow employee, (2) assumption of risk, (3) contributory negligence. (It should be noted in this connection that the hereinafter discussed Act No. 20, passed by the legislature after being called in special session, approved September 29, 1938, amending the Act of 1915, as reenacted and amended by the Act of June 4, 1937, P. L. 1552, No. 323, provides, inter alia, that “when injury results to an employee in the course of his employment it shall be presumed that the employer’s negligence caused said injury, which presumption may be rebutted by the employer.”) The other plaintiff, Rich Hill Coal Company, offered evidence that as to it the insurance rates under the new law represent about the same increase as the other plaintiff showed. The President of Rich Hill Coal Company testified as follows: “A. It is impossible for us to carry our own insurance, we are not large enough, the expense would be too great, we cannot reinsure, we <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>will have to carry our own rate below $10,000 or up to $10,000 and it is just putting tbe small operator out of business. Q. In other words, from a business standpoint you could not possibly afford to take the risk involved in rejecting the Act and carrying your own risk up to $10,000 per accident, is that correct? A. We couldn’t do it, one major accident would put us out of business. Q. Do I understand from that that you cannot get insurance for the first $10,000 of your liability? A. No, sir; we cannot.”</p>
    <p id="b485-3" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[128,919,1154,1293]]]'>Upon the conclusion of the testimony, the court heard arguments upon the constitutional questions raised by the bill. On December 29, 1937, the defendant filed preliminary objections to the bill. The next day a preliminary injunction was granted. On December 31, 1937, 43 anthracite coal mining companies presented to the court a petition asking leave to intervene as parties plaintiff. The petitioners, all of whom are taxpayers, averred that, though they had all elected to pay compensation under Article III of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915, they had “been compelled as a matter of economic necessity to reject the system imposed by Acts Nos. 323 and 552.” On December 31,1937, leave to intervene was granted and the enforcement of Acts Nos. 323 and 552 was restrained against these intervening plaintiffs upon their posting required bonds. On January 3, 1938, the Attorney General and the attorney for plaintiffs, respectively, filed the following stipulation: “The testimony adduced in support of the rule to show cause represents all the testimony the plaintiffs have to offer, and for the purpose of this case, shall be considered as if taken on final hearing of the bill of complaint. The defendant has no testimony to offer for the purposes of this case.”</p>

Counsel for plaintiffs then notified this court that counsel for the intervening anthracite operators desired to present certain additional facts to the court in support of their contention that Acts Nos. 323 and 552 were unconstitutional. The Attorney General declared that these facts would be stipulated by agreement. The defendant later asserted that the facts could not be stipulated. Thereupon, on May 12, 1938, certain of the intervening plaintiffs, to wit: Monarch Anthracite Mining Company, The Kingston Coal Company, Glen Alden Coal Company, The Lehigh Valley Coal Company and The Hudson Coal Company, filed a separate bill in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County setting up certain facts, inter alia, as follows: “The total number of persons employed in the anthracite industry in Pennsylvania is approximately 100,000. Between 1926 and 1935, the working capital of the anthracite industry shrank from $111,097,223 to $8,860,217. During the years 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1935, the industry suffered losses, respectively, of $10,-507,779, $8,572,586, $1,664,142 and $10,235,977. In 1934, the total amount of workmen’s compensation liability incurred by anthracite operators in Pennsylvania was $2,600,000. The anthracite industry was also conducted at a loss in 1937, and the workmen’s compensation liability for 1936 and 1937 was approximately the same as in 1934. The cost of workmen’s compensation to the anthracite operators of Pennsylvania would be increased by more than 100 per cent over the cost of workmen’s compensation under the Act of 1915, solely by reason of the increased schedules of compensation. The features of Act No. 323 other than its schedules would increase the costs of compensation by an additional 20 per cent. In many cases of total permanent disability and death from accident, Act No. 323 would increase the compensation benefits by approximately 200 per cent. The esti<a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>mated compensation liability of anthracite operators under Act No. 552 during the first year of its operation would be $8,640,000. This amount would be increased by $2,500,000 during each of the three successive years so that in the fourth year of the operation of the act the total compensation liability of anthracite operators under Act No. 552 would be $16,200,000. Under the provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915, the plaintiffs were exempted from the requirement that insurance be carried against their liabilities under Article III. Prior to January 1, 1938, anthracite operators who applied for an exemption from the duty of insuring against liability under Article III were required by the defendant to deposit with him securities of the value of many millions of dollars in order to obtain such exemption. They were also required to carry excess insurance against such liability. If the anthracite operators were to accept the provisions of Acts Nos. 323 and 552, they would be required to deposit additional securities in the amount of millions of dollars in order to obtain an exemption from the duty of carrying insurance against workmen’s compensation liability, and they would also be required to carry additional and greater amounts of excess insurance.” The defendant later filed preliminary objections to the bill of the five anthracite coal companies above named.</p>

Defendant adds: “This was never done.” In <em>Solar Elec. Co. v. Brookville Boro, et al., </em><a href="/pa/300/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="300 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1125884" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0021-01">300 Pa. 21</a>, <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a><a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.%2092" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="150 A. 92">150 A. 92</a>, this court held that when a bill is taken pro confess© for want of an appearance or answer, the prothonotary’s only function is to enter plaintiff’s order to that effect. Under Equity Rule No. 51 the court must enter the appropriate final decree. On December 15, 1938, there was filed “certiorari sur appeal to No. 35, May Term, 1939, from the Supreme Court.”</p>

(3) The acts authorized must provide for benefits to be paid by employers to their employees.

A decision as to this depends on the facts in the cases pre<a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>sented and when these cases reached us the essential facts had not been established. We are therefore sending these cases back to the court below for the full development of facts and for proper and ample findings. We may pertinently say at this point, however, that when the necessary facts are found it will be a matter for judicial determination whether the challenged compensation acts <em>are </em>reasonable. It is elementary that the money (i. e., the wealth) used in the payment of compensation benefits to employees must be produced by the joint endeavors of the capital and labor which have united their energies and effort in the production of wealth. If compensation rates are fixed so high that capital does not reap a fair share of reward from these joint endeavors or if the rate is fixed so high as to wipe out or unduly encroach on that margin of a just return to which capital is entitled, the compensation rate is unreasonable and therefore the act prescribing it is invalid and unconstitutional. There can be no more fatuous policy than one of so burdening industry as to kill the spirit of enterprise and to paralyze what would otherwise be normal initiative and energy. One of the earliest and most Avidely known and accepted fables is that of “killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.” In this venerable fable the man who committed this act of folly is held up as an archetype to be avoided. The courts of this state and nation have in countless decisions recognized and enforced the right of those who invest and manage capital to a fair share of the fruits of such investment and management. It has been held by the United States Supreme Court that even the owner of a business dedicated to the public service, such as a railroad, is entitled to “fair or reasonable profit”: <em>Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. U. S. Interstate Commerce Com., </em><a href="/us/263/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="263 U.S. 456" data-case-ids="6142808" data-case-paths="/us/263/0456-01">263 U.

Serv. Com. v. Beaver Valley W. Co., </em><a href="/pa/271/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="271 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="295632" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0358-01">271 Pa. 358</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20A.%20373" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="114 A. 373">114 A. 373</a>, this court declared that if the rates allowed to a public service company are inadequate to provide a reasonable return on the property invested in the corporation, the result is confiscation. It is equally true that if the rates of compensation which the legislature orders employers to pay injured employees prevents any return or a reasonable return on the property invested, the result is confiscation — a situation intolerable in a constitutional government. Laws should conserve property, not destroy it. The tragic experiences of the peoples of other countries today clearly demonstrate that the step from a government’s arbitrarily taking of property to its arbitrarily taking of life and liberty is a short one. In republics like ours the protection of life, liberty <em>and </em>property are the specific subjects of constitutional and judicial protection. The United States Supreme Court said in <em>Knoxville v. Water Co., </em><a href="/us/212/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="212 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="5711290" data-case-paths="/us/212/0001-01">212 U. S. 1</a>: “The courts, in clear cases, ought not to hesitate to arrest the operation of a confiscatory law, but they ought to refrain from interfering in cases of any other kind. . . . Our social system rests largely upon the sanctity of private property, and that State or community which seeks to invade it will soon discover the error in the disaster which follows.” In <em>Pierce, Governor of Oregon, v. Society of Sisters, </em><a href="/us/268/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="268 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="13076" data-case-paths="/us/268/0510-01">268 U.

On the other hand, a Workmen’s Compensation Law which places upon any industry a burden so crushing that it makes that indus<a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>try’s existence either impossible or, to its owners, economically undesirable, is a measure which the workmen themselves should emphatically condemn and reject, for it paralyzes the very activities on which their economic well-being depends. Unprofitable industries soon become idle industries; idle industries mean idle capital, and in all ages and countries idle capital has always meant idle men.</p>
    <p id="b491-4" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[134,794,1153,1459]]]'>There are many provisions of Act No. 323, which are alleged to be unreasonable. For example, under section 306 A of Act No. 323 the minimum compensation “for the first 500 weeks after the 7th day of total disability, . . . shall not be . . . less than twelve dollars per week, . . . provided that if total disability shall continue for a period of four weeks or more, the employee also shall be entitled to receive compensation for the first seven days of total disability. Should total disability become permanent, then, in addition to the compensation provided for 500 weeks, and beginning at the expiration of the 500 weeks, the sum of $30 per month shall be payable during such permanent total disability prior to death.” It is obvious that the above provision for compensation for life imposes a heavy burden on industry and if the complainants can prove that the minimum of $12 per week exceeds in a substantial number of instances the wages paid, the provision should be adjudged unreasonable. A law which requires an employer to pay a disabled employee, and particularly for a long period, more than the employee earned before his disability arose, does not conform to the constitutional test of reasonableness. The most earnest advocates of Workmen’s Compensation Laws never contemplated that the rate of compensation for disabled employees should be placed so high as to make idleness more remunerative than work.</p>
    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[135,2271,1151,155]],["BL_492.1",492,[286,337,1152,1897]],["BL_493.1",493,[117,335,1156,703]]]'>Another provision in Act 323 which is alleged to be unreasonable is that which gives to a widow of a deceased employee, “if there be no children, 44% of wages <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>but not in excess of twelve dollars per week.” This compensation shall be paid during 500 weeks, except that, in the case of a widow, if she shall remain unmarried, compensation shall continue after said period of 500 weeks, at the rate of $5 per week for life. If the widow remarries, if she be other than a nonresident alien widow, the compensation of such widow shall continue two years from the date of such remarriage. The rate of compensation for widows with children increases substantially. It is obvious that in mining or other pursuits in which there might be a high percentage of deaths resulting from injuries or occupational diseases, only those concerns which, even under the operation of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915, were left with a large margin of net income, would be able to continue their industrial operations. However, whether or not the challenged act is unreasonable in respect to a sufficiently large number of employers to make the act unconstitutional on that ground is primarily a factual question, which can be decided only on an ample record. Plaintiffs contend that during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th years of the operation of Acts Nos. 323 and 552, the cost to the anthracite industry of Pennsylvania will be, respectively, $14,360,000, $16,880,000, $19,400,000 and $21,920,000. It is said that the cost to this industry in 1937 before the passage of the challenged acts was $2,600,000. Plaintiffs in their brief declare as follows: “Stated differently, under the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1915, as amended prior to 1937, the cost of workmen’s compensation to the anthracite industry for the 4 years beginning with 1938, would have been $10,400,000; but under Acts Nos. 323 and 552 it would be $39,080,000. Of this amount, the employers would be obliged to pay at least $26,516,000. (The balance would be paid by the State, if, by any chance, Section 321<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> of Act No. 323 and Section <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>7(a)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> of Act No. 552 should be held valid.) ” If these or substantially similar facts are established, it will be a question for the courts to decide whether the acts which place such a heavy burden on one of the state’s major industries provide only for “reasonable compensation.” The reasonableness of the compensation prescribed in these Workmen’s Compensation Laws, with their multifarious provisions, must be determined, as the United States Supreme Court in <em>Interstate Commerce Com. v.

Under the old act, the “employee” of the subcontractor could not recover from the principal contractor unless he was injured on the premises of the latter or under his control. This propinquity between the primary employer and the laborer made it possible for the employer to supervise the conditions of the laborer’s employment and afforded some logical basis for holding that the former was liable to the latter for any personal injuries received on premises under the former’s control. Such a holding marked the utmost limit this court can go in giving the statuses of “employee” and “employer,” <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>respectively, to two persons who in fact have no such contractual relation to each other. Now we are asked to hold that an employee of a subcontractor “B” who anywhere on premises no matter how remote from and how far beyond the control of, contractor “A,” is injured, can recover from “A” in an action at law for such injury received by that employee in the course of his employment by subcontractor <em>“B.” </em>This imposes responsibility upon an employer without giving him reciprocal authority. We cannot judicially hold that when the people of this Commonwealth authorized the General Assembly to enact “laws requiring the payment by employers, or employers and employees jointly, of reasonable compensation for injuries to employees arising in the course of their employment and for occupational diseases of employees,” they intended to confer or did confer upon the General Assembly an authority to enact a law making an employer liable to the employee of a subcontractor employer on premises remote from the first employer’s premises and over which he did not have the slightest control.</p>

Thus, an election of the act would not avoid the operation of the amendment to Section 203, and cannot be considered a compulsion to accept the act.” Section 303 of the new act provides that acceptance of the compensation system shall constitute a surrender by the employee of his common law rights of recovery against the general contractor. But employees of a subcontractor who <em>have not entered upon the premises of the general contractor </em>have not (according to section 302(b) of the new act) accepted the compensation <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>system, as between them and the general contractor. Therefore, they may invoke the liability created by section 203 and in the ensuing suit the defendant will find himself denied of all his former common law defenses, and under section 201.1 of Act No. 20, passed September 29, 1938, P. L. 52, and amending the amending Act No. 323, passed June 4,1937, he would, if we did not adjudge most of its provisions unconstitutional (as we do hereafter), find himself confronted with the “presumption” that his “negligence caused said injury” and with the legislative fiat that “declarations, remarks and utterances made by the injured employee within twelve hours after the injury was sustained shall be admissible as competent evidence.”</p>

In that case, Mr. Justice Butler, speaking for a unanimous court, said: “Legislative fiat may not take the place of fact in the judicial determination of issues involving life, liberty or property. . . . The mere fact of collision between a railway train and a vehicle at a highway grade crossing furnishes no basis for any inference as to whether the accident was caused by negligence of the railway company or of the traveler on the highway or of both or without fault of anyone.

If, for example, ‘in the beginning,’ 100 human beings had been created, and sometime later 51% or more had died, there would then have arisen an inference that all men are mortal. Later in the course of time with additional data all supporting the same inference, it would become a presumption of law that all men are mortal. Judge Baldwin of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut has admirably characterized the nature of presumption as follows, in <em>Ward v. Metropolitan Life Ins.

It may, in course of time, become a presumption of law, and even an indisputable one. Its truth may be so universally accepted as to elevate it to the position of a maxim of jurisprudence.’ ”</p>

A government which recognized no such rights, which held the lives, the liberty, and the property of its citizens subject at all times to the absolute disposition and unlimited control of even the most democratic depository of power, is after all but a despotism. It is true it is a despotism of the many, of the majority, if you choose to call it so, but it is nevertheless a despotism. It may be doubted, if a man is to hold all that he is accustomed to call his own, all in which he has placed his happiness and the security of which is essential to that happiness, under the unlimited dominion of others, whether it is not wiser that this power should be exercised by one man than by many.” In <em>Murray’s Lessees v.

Neither, on the other hand, does ‘the law of the land’ or ‘due process of law’ mean anything which the legislature may see fit to declare to be such; for there are certain fundamental rights, which our system of jurisprudence has always recognized, which not even the legislature can disregard in proceedings by which a person is deprived of life, liberty or property. . . .

Even though A, the employee, wilfully made to B, a false statement about the injury or its cause and the false statement was repeated in court by B, neither could be prosecuted for perjury, for A did not make his statement under oath and B only repeated under oath what A <em>had told </em>him. A might not even be present in court when his case was tried. He might absent himself beyond the jurisdiction of the court and depend on his attorney “making out a case” for him by calling witnesses to whom he had made declarations within twelve hours after the injury. Under those circumstances A could not even be called “as for cross-examination” and interrogated about his “within-12-hours” statements, and if he had died, it would mean that “evidence” was received which, while not possessing the avouchment of truthfulness which the solemnity of dying declarations and the spontaneity of a res gestae declaration provide, was also not subjected to the test of cross-examination. Courts have repeatedly held that cross-examination is not a privilege but a right. Chief Justice Gibson said in <em>Bank v. Fordyce, </em><a href="/pa/9/0275-02" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="9 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="960626,960695" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0275-02,/pa/9/0275-01">9 Pa. 275</a>, 277: “A party is entitled to bring out every circumstance relating to a fact which an adverse witness is called to prove.” Wigmore on Evidence (2d ed.), Yol. 3, p. 26, sec. 1367, says: “For two centuries past, the policy of the Anglo-American system of Evidence has been to regard the necessity of testing by cross-examination as a vital feature of the law. The belief that no safeguard for testing the value of human statements is comparable to that furnished by cross-examination . . . has found increasing strength in lengthening experience. . . . It is beyond any doubt <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.” Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Queen v.

The relation between the evidentiary fact and a particular proposition is always the same.” Suppose the “proposition” to be established by legal evidence was that B committed a certain crime?

The framers of the Constitution were so fearful of even the possibility of such a thing that they provided in the Bill of Rights (sec. 9) that in all criminal prosecutions the accused “has a right to meet the witnesses face to face.” It was apparently never contemplated by those who framed and the people who adopted the Constitution that in civil actions (in which vastly more persons are directly concerned than are concerned as defendants in criminal cases), it was necessary to safeguard against arbitrary legislative action long-established rules of evidence other than in the general language of the Constitution which provides that “trial by jury shall be as heretofore” and that no person can be deprived of life, liberty or property “. . . unless by the law of the land” (sections 6 and 9, respectively, of the Bill of Rights).</p>

No rule as <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>to “hearsay testimony” was there laid down <em>for one party only </em>and the hearsay testimony had to be “relevant” and “material” and “not inconsistent” with the other testimony, and the action was not an action at law <em>but was under the Workmen’s Compensation Law, to which both employer and employee had voluntarily submitted. </em>The defendant also quotes from President Judge Keller’s opinion as follows: “The strict rules of evidence should not be insisted upon too rigorously, to the exclusion of a just claim. Otherwise, the legislature, on the ground of necessity, may feel obliged to relax the hearsay rule so as to permit the admission of declarations made by the deceased, within a reasonable time and under circumstances that negative premeditation and design, to his wife and family upon his return home.” Judge Keller was obviously referring to a possible change of the rules of evidence in proceedings under the Workmen’s Compensation Law (which law either the employer or employee did not <em>have </em>to submit to), and not to proceedings in actions at law as does Act No. 20, and the only “relaxing” of the “hearsay rule” he suggested even in Workmen’s Compensation cases was one which would admit declarations made by the <em>deceased </em>within a reasonable time and under circumstances that negative premeditation and design, to his wife and' family upon his return home. Act No. 20 makes admissible in <em>actions at law </em>declarations made by any injured employee, whether he lives or dies, to anybody and within twelve hours after the injury. Twelve hours affords ample time for the “designing” of testimony. In the same case Judge Keller said: “Awards in Workmen’s Compensation cases cannot rest wholly on hearsay evidence (unless not objected to: <em>Poluski v.

If an employer’s negligence is affirmatively established by evidence, it is <em>not </em>“arbitrary and unreasonable” to hold that he must answer for that fault even though the negligence of the employee’s fellow servant or of the employee himself <em>contributed </em>to it. An analogous rule has immemorially prevailed in the criminal courts where a defendant must answer for his negligence even though the victim of it also was negligent. But in common law actions of tort, it is “the law of the land” that liability cannot be imposed upon one who is without fault. To <em>legislate </em>a person presumptively guilty of either a crime or a tort is an attempted erosion of “the substance of original justice.”</p>

However, when the rates and periods of compensation have been materially increased, and persons affected thereby have challenged these new statutes as unreasonable and otherwise invalid, it becomes the duty of the judiciary to pass on their constitutionality. The question of the reasonableness of compensation is analogous to the question of the reasonableness of rates permitted to be charged by railroads and public utility corporations. If the rates fixed by state administrative bodies prevent an adequate return on investment, they are adjudged to amount to a confiscation of the company’s capital and property, and therefore to a denial of due process of law.

Even if the rates of compensation in any two states are anywhere near the same, <em>that </em>fact <em>standing </em>alone would throw little or no light on the problem of the reasonableness of the compensation here provided by a Workmen’s Compensation Law. Just as in physics, momentum means mass multiplied by velocity, so the “momentum” with which a Workmen’s Compensation Law bears down on industry depends on the compensation prescribed in <em>individual </em>cases multiplied by the <em>number </em>of cases in which the prescribed compensation is translated into dollars to be paid out of the product of the industry affected.</p>
