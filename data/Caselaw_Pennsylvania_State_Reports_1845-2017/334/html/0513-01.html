In 1897, the Works were leased for a term of thirty years to the United Gas Improvement Company under an operating agreement. On January 1, 1928, a new lease with the same corporation became effective, subject to termination, on certain conditions, on December 31, 1937, or at any ten-year period thereafter. This lease was assigned by the United Gas Improvement Company to the Philadelphia Gas Works Company with the consent of the City. The lease provided for an annual rental to be paid to the City of $4,200,000, subject to the terms <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>of the contract.

On March 13th, the Philadelphia Corporation submitted a modified proposal, offering $50,000,000 for the assignment of the rentals covering a period of approximately seventeen years from March 15, 1939, or longer if necessary to produce an aggregate return of $73,500,000 to the Corporation, with interest at 4% on rentals due and unpaid for any year. All the rights of the City under the lease are to be assigned, and the City is to agree not to dispose of, lease, or encumber the Gas Works during that time. Any insurance proceeds received by the.

    <p id="b549-6" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[110,1282,1156,798]]]'>It is argued that the City by selling the future rentals is disposing of future income to which it is now entitled, and is, in effect, borrowing on futures and thereby creating a debt. A debt within the meaning of the Constitution is created when an obligation is undertaken “to pay in the future for consideration received in the present”: <em>Keller v. Scranton, </em><a href="/pa/200/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="200 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="924409" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0130-01">200 Pa. 130</a>. It imports a present and actual creditor as an incident to the transaction.

    <p id="b549-7" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[117,2100,1155,318]],["BL_550.1",550,[296,351,1152,1666]]]'>In <em>Kelley v.

It does contemplate an existing obligation presently enforceable against the property or funds of the municipality generally, or an obligation presently existing enforceable in the future. In the event of a default in payment of any of the rentals, no property of the City, real or personal, can be taken for principal and interest. The default would be that of the lessee, the Gas Works Company, not the muncipality, and the City assumes no obligation or liability therefor. Under paragraph 3(e), the assignee has no right to recover any part of such defaulted sums from the general funds or property of the City, from its general tax levy, or by <em>attachment </em>or <em>sale </em>of any city property, including the Gas Works.

To illustrate the force of this observation: If the City of Philadelphia were solvent within the constitutional meaning, and wished to incur a bonded indebtedness, in making a statement of its assets and liabilities, it would be unable to list any figure representing its liability under this clause of the proposal relating to a deficit. The mere possibility of future liability to arise by reason of legislation that may be enacted, is so remote and contingent, that it does not create a present debt. This is apparent, for if it were otherwise, every authorized indebtedness of a municipality would have to be considered subject to the possibility of future legislative enactment, taking from the municipality a part of its property, diverting a portion of its property to uses not taxable, or lowering assessments. This Court has held that such contingencies cannot affect the validity of bonds issued or authorized: <em>Duane v.

Receipts of the City are placed in three categories: “(a) receipts from taxation; (b) money proposed to be borrowed and (c) receipts from sources other than taxation and loans, hereinafter designated as miscellaneous receipts.” It is clear this Article makes the proceeds of the sale of municipal assets fall into the category of “miscellaneous receipts.” The use of the word “current receipts” in the last sentence of the first paragraph of Section 1 of the Article (providing that the Mayor’s statement shall indicate “which of such liabilities and expenditures should be met from current receipts and which should be met from loan funds,”) will not support the construction contended for that the legislature intended only current receipts from taxation to be available for current expenses. It is also contended that this Court in <em>Woodward v. Philadelphia, </em>supra, used the words “receipts” and “revenue” synonymously and that therefore “miscellaneous receipts” means “miscellaneous revenues” or receipts from taxation. If “miscellaneous receipts” refers to receipts from taxation,-there would be but two classes of receipts available for budget purposes. The legislature separated “miscellaneous receipts” from “receipts from taxation.” Furthermore, in the passage quoted by intervenors from the Woodward case, the term “revenue” was used only with reference to receipts from taxation.</p>
