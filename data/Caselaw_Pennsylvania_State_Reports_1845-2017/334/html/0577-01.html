Jones, appellant’s decedent, was one of two accommodation endorsers for Frank E. Schaule. Jones having died before the note matured, appellee obtained several new notes from Schaule, endorsed by the survivor. This was done without the knowledge of appellant. Appellee continued to carry on its books the original note on which Jones was endorser. After default on the last new note given, appellee sued his estate for the balance due on the original instrument. Appellant contends that it was discharged by the acceptance of the new notes and by an extension of time to the maker. The <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>trial judge heard the case without a jury and entered judgment for the bank.</p>
    <p id="b609-3" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[142,452,1154,429]]]'>Three questions are presented which will be discussed. The contention that the note was rendered nonnegotiahle by the endorsers’ confession of judgment is sufficiently answered by the Negotiable Instruments Law of May 16, 1901, P. L. 194, Section 47. It is immaterial on this appeal, however, whether the instrument is negotiable or nonnegotiahle, considering the terms of the endorsement or assignment executed by decedent.</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[142,893,1155,1191]]]'>The evidence shows that the new notes were given as collateral security for payment of the original note. It is a customary practice of banks to take new notes in this manner, as collateral, where one of the endorsers dies and it is desired to hold his estate liable. The effect of the new notes was a question of fact, the presumption being that they were given solely as collateral: <em>Second National Bank v.

When the note was endorsed or assigned, although the blanks were not filled in, the writing gave the bank “the same right to collect from <em>me” </em>(payee, endorser, assignor) as the holder would have against the maker or makers of the note. As the court below said: “This language is equivalent to an expression of a promise to pay in the first person singular, and where, as here, such promise is signed by two persons the obligation is joint and several. This is especially so in view of the fact that the language of the endorsement sued upon does not indicate that the endorsers or assignors are not so bound.
