Mackey et al., </em><a href="/pa/295/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="295 Pa. 82" data-case-ids="1115128" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0082-01">295 Pa. 82</a>, 85, 86. It may issue to compel a public officer to perform a ministerial duty, but it cannot issue against such officer where there is any discretion to act remaining in him. Appellant necessarily concedes, by instituting mandamus proceedings against the full board, that, under the School Code, a contract to be binding upon the school district must be in writing, executed by the proper authorities and that to this end further action by the board is necessary; otherwise his remedy at law for breach of contract would be adequate. “Where a statute prescribes the formal mode of making public contracts it must be observed; otherwise they cannot be enforced against the governmental agency involved”: <em>Luzerne Township v. Fayette County, </em><a href="/pa/330/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="330 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1182989" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0247-01">330 Pa. 247</a>, 251-252, and cases there cited. If a written contract is necessary to bind the school board, as the Code seems to provide,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> this requirement must be met, and until it is actually executed, the board has discre<a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>tionary power to revoke the award without liability to the school district.

We cannot possibly construe this resolution as having exhausted all the discretion of the board, since there is nothing to show that the board ever acted upon, or finally approved ■by resolution, the form and terms of the contract to be executed by appellant, or that the president and secretary were authorized to execute the contract in the manner required by the Code. Neither the ordering of the execution, nor the approval of the written contract can be said to be a ministerial duty; each is a discretionary part of the board’s function. The school board could not by its resolution awarding the contract declare it to be final, thus exercising all its discretion, when the Code expressly provides for execution. Until that is done, all acts leading thereto have the status of preliminary negotiations, and the board may rescind or revoke its award. It should be noted in addition that under <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>the terms of the bid, as submitted by appellant, he was not immediately bound by contract upon the making of the award, and if he revoked his bid, he merely forfeited his check or bond.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
