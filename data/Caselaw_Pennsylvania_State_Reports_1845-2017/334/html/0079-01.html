    <p id="b110-10" data-blocks='[["BL_110.10",110,[274,1058,1152,255]]]'>A motion to quash was made by the administrators of Warren A. Wilbur for violation of various rules of this Court and on the ground that — the award to appellant having been paid before the appeal was taken — the question was moot.</p>
    <p id="b110-11" data-blocks='[["BL_110.11",110,[273,1333,1152,425]]]'>Appellant’s answer to the motion to quash admits that payment was received, as averred in the motion, but asserts that the appeal should not be quashed for that alone; this contention is based on the fact that, in addition to complaining of the form in which the award to appellant had been made, a second point is presented for review, to wit: the refusal to sustain appellant’s exception to the auditor’s fee of $2,000.</p>
    <p id="b110-12" data-blocks='[["BL_110.12",110,[273,1769,1149,142]]]'>The payment to, and acceptance by, appellant of the dividend awarded, of course makes the first question moot.</p>
    <p id="b110-13" data-blocks='[["BL_110.13",110,[271,1933,1150,263]]]'>As the only matter for review, when the appeal was taken, was the refusal to sustain an exception to the auditor’s fee of $2,000, the appeal should have been taken to the Superior Court: section 7, Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 212, as amended, 17 PS section 184.</p>
    <p id="b110-14" data-blocks='[["BL_110.14",110,[320,2207,916,44]]]'>The appeal is certified to the Superior Court.</p>
