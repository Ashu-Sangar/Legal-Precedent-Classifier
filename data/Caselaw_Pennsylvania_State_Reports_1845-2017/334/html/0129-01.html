We said— “Among the persons to whom interests in the mortgage are directed to be assigned are several persons whose claims did not come into existence until long after February 18, 1932. They would of course not be entitled to interest from February, 1932. We have no doubt this fact was overlooked through inadvertence but it is an error that may be corrected. On the return of the record the parties should have opportunity to be heard on <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>the subject in order that proper adjustment may be made.” (328 Pa. at 155.)</p>
