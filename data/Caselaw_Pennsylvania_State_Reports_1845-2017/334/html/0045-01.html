Wilbur Trust Company, named as testamentary trustee by himself and his wife. By his will he gave his property to his wife for life, remainder to their sons for life, subject to spendthrift trust provisions, and with general powers of appointment by will. On his death, letters testamentary were granted, June 20, 1910, to his widow Stella, and their eldest sons, Warren and Rollin, Warren being then president of the trust company. They prepared a first and final account but did not file it. The inventory showed gross personalty of $1,295,165.32, as of January 4, 1912. This property was transferred on January 5, 1912, to the testamentary trustee, together with a cash income balance of $2,348.52. No account was filed until September, 1933, when the trustee filed its First and Partial Account covering administration to January 15, 1932, the date of Warren’s death.</p>

She left written instructions, not probated, for the disposition of certain personal property which was thereafter (May 27, 1920) made the subject of agreement by all the sons, pursuant to which it was distributed among them, the exceptant participating, a fact <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>of importance to be mentioned later. The administrators c. t. a. filed their First and Final Account May 14, 1921, confirmed absolutely, and showing a net balance of $293,646.53. In this account, credit was not taken for federal estate taxes approximating $20,000, nor for the distribution of the personal property under the agreement referred to above, appraised at $59,987.25, nor for certain other items subsequently shown in a Reconciliation Statement filed in the proceeding below. While the administrators c. t.' a. filed their account May 14, 1921, it was not until early in 1922 that they formally turned over the assets to the testamentary trustee, as of December 31, 1921. Prior to the transfer, they delivered to the trustee two supplemental statements of receipts and expenditures showing on hand, as of December 31, 1921, a net balance of $283,231.42, which, it will be observed, is $10,415.11 less than the net balance shown in the earlier account of May 14,1921. Each year the trustee rendered to each of the sons a statement of the trust administration, showing corpus, changes from time to time, income and disbursements. Such accounts were furnished annually until and including 1932. None of the sons ever made any objection. The obvious irregularity, complained of, in the performance of the duties of the personal representatives of the decedents and of the duties of the trustee, was doubtless the result of the intimate family relationship and of the control of the management of the trust company and its affairs by members of the Wilbur family. These facts constitute no excuse but are elements for consideration in the problems now presented.</p>

L. 403, 20 PS section 223, the devise and bequest to his widow executed the powers vested in him by his parents’ wills, as appointments to his widow.

Under the rule applied in those cases, what Raj Wilbur did with regard to the trust estates bound his appointee. If we correctly understand the position of the learned court below on this point, it was thought that the rule was not applicable because each will contained a provision devising and bequeathing to the appointee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Provisions to that effect in wills are common.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The phrase in the will “the right to appoint” is a technical term; it means the power to name the taker who, when named in the manner prescribed* becomes the taker in the same way as if the maker had named him a beneficiary. The appointment under the power is read into the will creating it. But that fact does not minimize the control of a life tenant with a general power of appointment. “The share of the trust fund” was appointed to the exceptant. The question is, What was the share of the trust fund when the appointment took effect, i. e., on the death of Ray Wilbur?</p>

As Stella Wilbur was life tenant under her husband’s <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>will, it was perhaps not until her death in 1920, that Ray should have been expected to give special attention to the trust estates; at all events, he was then in position to demand an accounting.

The exceptant, since her husband’s death, expressed no dissatisfaction with the administration of the trusts prior to requesting the account. In considering laches it is also important to note that since 1920, Warren Wilbur, Arnon P. Miller and M. K. Huffman, who had been respectively President and Chairman of the Board, Vice President and Trust Officer of the trust company, have died, so that their evidence, which obviously would have been enlightening because of their participation in challenged transactions, has not been available to the trustee or to appellants or to the surviving sons. Not only is the long delay in failing to challenge the trust administration a complete bar,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> but we think the conduct of Ray Wilbur and of the exceptant is evidence of acquiescence.</p>

The administrators c. t. a. continued their admin<a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>istration until early in 1922, apparently after having gone through the form, of turning over the assets to the trustee as of December 31, 1921. Thereafter, the trustee charged itself with $283,231.42, as the balance received, though it is $10,415.11 less than the balance shown in the administrators’ account of May 14, 1921, as the amount that would ordinarily be payable to the trustee. The auditor surcharged the trustee with this difference of $10,415.11. He declined to consider the trustee’s proposed corrections, said to explain the difference between the two amounts, on the ground that such restatement of the account was not within his powers as auditor. It is unnecessary to lengthen this opinion by reciting the details of the reconciliation given in the record, because an answer to the request for the surcharge, and one that should have been accepted by the learned court below, is that laches is so completely established that it would be inequitable, in any view, now to allow the claim. The first one of the annual statements referred to above, that for 1922, rendered to Eay Wilbur, is entitled “Statement of the E. P. Wilbur Trust Company, Trustee of the Estate of Stella M. Wilbur, and List of the Securities received from Warren A. Wilbur and Eollin H. Wilbur, Administrators, c. t. a.” In this statement the first item in the income account is dated January 20, 1922; credits are taken for expenditures out of income; the result shown for the year is an overdraft of income of $7,574.01. The statement also contains a “List of securities held by E. P. Wilbur Trust Co., Trustee.” It, with a small item of cash, totals $283,231.42, which, it will be noted, is the amount used as a basis of the surcharge. The total of the securities in that list is $282,991.90. The statement for the year 1923 begins December 31, 1922, “balance as per statement rendered $282,991.90,” identified as “Last item in Principal Account”; an income account follows and again a list of securities is given. The next statement, for 1923, begins where the last one left off, etc. This <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>informal annual accounting for the purpose of advising the sons — the only beneficiaries — continued during the lifetime of Ray and thereafter. As showing his familiarity with the fact that the administrators c. t. a. continued their administration after filing their account in May, 1921, appellants point to the fact that, on December 7, 1921, Ray Wilbur, with the others, received a payment of income in the sum of $1,500, an item to be referred to later. They also point to evidence that a conference of members of the Wilbur family was held shortly after the death of Mrs. Wilbur concerning the equalization of advances made by her to her sons. An exhibit showing- the distribution of these advances (in all $84,000) is contained in the record. Ray Wilbur also participated in the distribution of the personal property referred to in the letter left by his mother; the exceptant testified that at the time of that distribution she received a part of the property. There is no dispute of these facts.</p>
    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[152,1395,1153,703]]]'>The argument made against the effect of laches is that the accounts were not sufficient to give notice of the fact now in dispute. It must be rejected because an examination shows that in the circumstances Ray Wilbur must be regarded as having been sufficiently advised of the facts, or of what he would have learned if he had inquired as to any subject on which he considered the statements inadequate. We have not found it necessary to predicate any conclusion on that portion of appellants’ argument to the effect that the difference in the two amounts was satisfactorily explained by the trustee’s Reconciliation Account filed at the audit.

At that time, nothing had been received on the account. Thereafter, the sum of $48,-745.33 was received in distribution of assets. The subject was brought to the attention of the auditor by the trustee during the course of the audit. A witness testified : “Our first and partial account is filed as of January 15, 1932. Nothing had been realized [on this mining account] up to that point. There have been several payments received since that time and those payments as received are set up in the Stella Wilbur estate and we charged ourselves with them as they were received. Q. And they appear, do they not, in the supplemental account which you have here? A. Yes, there are several items that appear in the account.” After testimony explanatory of the situation, counsel for the trustee said: “The trustee asks to be charged with these assets consisting of indebtedness due from the London Mines &amp; Milling Company, one of the face value of $5,915.33 and the other $42,830.00, the amounts already charged by the trustee in its accountings filed during the course of the audit subsequent to the first and partial account. ...” Counsel for the exceptant then stated: “The exceptant agrees that the auditor shall award to the exceptant a one-seventh interest in kind.”</p>

He said: “But here is a note made by one of the administrators, the proceeds of which did not go to the benefit of the estate but went to pay income to beneficiaries who were not entitled to income until it was earned and then were not entitled to receive this income from the administrators but from the trustee. This is just another sample of what financial wrong can be done when the trustee tries to administer an estate which it is not its duty to administer, and the payment by the trustee of moneys which it is not its duty to pay but which should be paid by the personal representatives of the estate.” If they borrowed to pay income before it was received and thereafter from income repaid what they <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>borrowed with no resulting loss to the beneficiaries, this exceptant has no ground for complaint. Ray Wilbur, who profited by the transaction, had never complained; the exceptant was not injured. But the accountant was not entitled to the credit for $9,000 as principal, credit having been taken in the income account rendered to the sons in 1922; appellants’ brief states that at the audit the auditor was asked to restate the account to make the correction, to accord with the fact. This should have been done.</p>

It was a demand note of November 19, 1917, signed “Stella M. Wilbur by W. A. Wilbur and Arnon P. Miller, attorneys,” payable to “myself.” By letter of attorney dated June 25, 1910, Stella Wilbur had appointed Warren A. Wilbur and Arnon P. Miller her attorneys with authority, inter alia, to make promissory notes in her name. The auditor found there was “no satisfactory explanation in the evidence to show what became of the $25,000. It is for those two agents to explain what became of the $25,000, the proceeds of said note. ...” But both the agents were dead at the time of the audit. The auditor said: “from all the circumstances surrounding this note, the auditor will have to find that this note was not a valid claim against the trust estate of Stella M. Wilbur, deceased. ...” Why wasn’t it a valid claim? There is no doubt about the authority of the attorneys in fact to make the note. It was produced. The transaction was considered by the auditor in connection with two similar notes, one of $50,000 and one of $12,500, payment of both being approved, on the ground that exceptant had suffered no loss. He said that “while the transaction may have been wrongful and unlawful in the first instance, it resulted in no injury to the estate or impairment of its assets.” In the circumstances we think the evidence shows that the accountant was obligated to pay the note <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>of the testatrix made by her attorney in fact and in the possession of accountant.

The auditor erred in applying the general rule to the facts. It is to be observed, first, that the only exceptant is Mrs. Hazzard and that her only interest is in % of the estate and not in the <em>%. </em>It is next to be noticed that, in reviewing a penalty for the mismanagement charged in the general terms used by the auditor, the facts must be considered and that, as they appear, it would be inequitable to surcharge the trustee for anything done with the approval or acquiescence of the exceptant’s husband in his lifetime and of her after his death. The will, quoted later, gave extensive powers to the trustee. The annual statements rendered and their effect have been referred to. Except-ant testified that she received them. She was asked, “Q.

Did you ever question any of the officers or representatives of the E. P. Wilbur Trust Company as to any of the items in any of these annual statements which you received following your husband’s death? A. Only one that I can recall at the moment. Q. What was that? A.

Sport Island was a summer place on the St. Lawrence River used by members of the Wilbur family. On April 30, 1928, the trustee leased it for three years to W. A. Wilbur, R. H. Wilbur and E. P. Wilbur, Jr., on, what the auditor describes as, “terms very disadvantageous to the trust estate, so much so that from December 1928 to January 1932 the trustee expended $4,621.35 out of the income of the trust estate for the maintenance of this summer home which was leased to three of the remaining six children of Stella M. Wilbur, deceased. ...” In opposing the surcharge, the accountant referred to the yearly statements rendered to exceptant showing the Sport Island transactions, contending that in fact she approved what was being done. These statements showed detailed monthly expenditures <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>of the items now complained of and were the statements which exceptant had before her when she testified she had received them and was satisfied; they covered the years 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932. If she had expressed dissatisfaction when she received the first statement it is probable that some other arrangement might have been made for the later years more satisfactory to her. Sport Island property was an asset of the trust estate; there was no market for it though they tried to sell it; it had to be maintained; it had appeared in the accounts sent to her husband with which she had also been familiar, so that the subject was not new to her. The lease to three members of the Wilbur family produced some rent and reduced the carrying charges accordingly. Appellants concede that out of this item the accountant should be surcharged with $67.20, the amount of an insurance premium paid on premises not part of the trust estate.

This is not a case in which interest should be allowed from the date of the death nor from the expiration of one year thereafter. The evidence shows the exceptant agreed with the trustee that no distribution be made at that time and that the trust property should be administered as a unit as it had been before her husband’s death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> During the <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>period until she requested an account to be filed by December 31, 1932, she received her share of the income. She is therefore not entitled to interest prior to that date. After December 31, 1932, she received her share of the income, as before, until the distribution to her of the one-seventh share of both trust funds August 29, 1935. In the brief filed on her behalf, it is conceded that, on the amount of the property then received, she is entitled to no interest. On income producing property then remaining for distribution she would be entitled to her share of the income received; on other property the court will apply the statute. The Fiduciaries’ Act of 1917, P. L. 447, section 44(b), 20 PS section 812, provides: “The amount of interest to be paid in all cases by fiduciaries shall be determined by the orphans’ court, under all the <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>circumstances of the case, but shall not, in any instance, exceed the legal rate of interest for the time being.” While the statute fixes the maximum the minimum depends on the circumstances. The learned court below fixed the rate at six per cent. While the ordinary rule is that where the trustee has made no profit for himself the interest rate should be such as will equal the return which would have been received had the trustee performed his duty, it is well known that few trust investments now return the legal rate of interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> The record here contains no evidence on the subject and, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, we shall approve the rate.</p>

Wilbur, who died in 1910. The first surcharge complained of is of a distribution in 1912 by Jefferson Coal Company, of which the trust was a shareholder, of a dividend of $12,945.00; at this late date, there is some difference of view, on the evidence now available, as to whether it was a capital distribution by the coal company, an ordinary, or an extra dividend. The auditor thought it was an extra dividend not reducing capital. At all events, the trustee treated it as a dividend distributing capital and charged itself with it and at the same time made an entry to show that the capital asset had been reduced by the amount of the dividend. Exceptant’s husband, in his lifetime, received his share of the dividends paid by this company to the trustee. On August 29,1935, as part of her distributive share in the trust estate, exceptant received <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">
        <em>1</em>
      </a>
      <em>A </em>of this coal company stock, 123 shares. The difference between the parties on this account again appears to be largely one of bookkeeping. No property was lost. It is said in the argument for the exceptant that “It was a regular dividend, for the Jefferson Coal Company was not in liquida<a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>tion. It continued to operate for years, in fact, during the period of the administration of this estate. This Jefferson Coal Company continued to pay dividends, as will appear . . . [pages given] . . If the distribution was a regular dividend or an extra dividend, the beneficiary was Stella Wilbur, who was then living. If it was not distributed to her the trust estate retained it and all the beneficiaries have profited by it. When ex-ceptant took one-seventh of the coal company’s stock in 1935 she received her full share of that stock without regard to the amount at which it was carried on the books. In the circumstances shown, after the lapse of time since 1912, without the evidence of trustee’s officers who have died, the learned court below should have applied the equitable rule that laches prevents the surcharge. The assignment is sustained. The same conclusion must be reached on the surcharge of $75,960.00, growing out of the legacy to Elisha P. Wilbur under the will of Asa Packer. Wilbur died before the final distribution of the Packer estate. The legacy was $84,908.98. At that time Stella Wilbur owned 360 shares of the trust company; the trust company, as trustee of Elisha Wilbur’s estate, bought from Stella Wilbur her shares in the trust company and delivered in payment so much of the Packer legacy as was required to pay for the stock. She then distributed among her seven sons what she had received, Ray Wilbur receiving $6,918.76 and knowing the source from which his mother had received it. The auditor says that “the proper orderly course to pursue was to pay the distributive share [under the Packer will] to the executors of E. P. Wilbur, deceased, and then have the executors pay over and distribute same to the trustees.” Referring to the securities received, he said they were “readily marketable stocks and bonds,” and then proceeds: “The plan suggested itself to someone, ostensibly W. A. Wilbur, that by manipulation the cash and securities received from the Asa Packer Estate could be distributed among the seven sons of E. P. Wilbur and thereby to <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>some extent thwart the purpose of the creator of the trust fund. . . . ” He says this was done by using the proceeds to buy Stella Wilbur’s 360 shares of the trust company stock for the trust and then having Mrs. Wilbur distribute the consideration so received, and then adds, “When this plan was completed, the seven sons of E. P. Wilbur had distributed by a roundabout way the distribution received from the Asa Packer Estate, and the E. P. Wilbur Trust Company, the testamentary trustee under the last will and testament of Elisha P. Wilbur, deceased, had 360 shares of questionable E. P. Wilbur Trust Company stock, representing an investment in the trust fund of approximately $76,000.00 . . .” and not a legal investment. The difficulty, for present purposes, is that the beneficiaries were advised of the transaction twenty-five years ago when it occurred, participated in the distribution, and received annual statements for years after the death of Stella Wilbur in which the dividends paid by the trust company on its own stock were reflected. Ray Wilbur is therefore barred. After his death the exceptant, with like notice of the investment, received dividends on the same stock; in the distribution of 1935 she received her % share of this stock at $125 per share and made no claim for shrinkage in value. At this point, reference may be made to another element requiring consideration in this case; both Wilburs made similar provisions in their wills: each permitted the retention of stock left by decedent; each left stock of this trust company. This is another transaction that cannot be adequately presented to the court because of the deaths of Warren Wilbur, President, of Arnon P. Miller, Vice President, and of Milton Hoffman, the Trust Officer. Laches and acquiescence are a bar; the assignment of error complaining of this surcharge is sustained.</p>

P. Wilbur<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> was a large shareholder. On January 5,1912, the trust held 2,188 shares of the stock appraised at |568,880.00. It was not an operating, but a coal-land holding company. It was necessary to pay taxes on and take care of it. Advances for such purposes were made by the trust estate from 1911 to 1931 on evidences of indebtedness of the company, which now have no value. There is evidence that Wilbur, in his lifetime, regarded his holdings in this company as his most valuable asset and that it was so regarded after his death by some of his sons. A number of witnesses testified that it was desirable that the trustee make these advances. Some of them were charged against principal, some against income. During the lifetime of Stella Wilbur, who was entitled to all the income, no complaint was made although her income was substantially affected by these advances; after her death none of her sons, who succeeded her as life tenants, complained. Four of them, during various times, when loans were made, were members of the Board of Directors of the trust company. To show that what was done was prudently done, evidence was received that the executors of the estate of Robert <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>Sayre, a large stockholder and one of the original incorporators with Elisha P. Wilbur, had made similar advances. Ray Wilbur and the exceptant acquiesced. For example, on November 16, 1928, the president of the trust company wrote to the six Wilbur sons, then surviving, and to the exceptant, referring to the investment in this coal company, and the necessity of increasing it. Five days later the exceptant wrote to the trust company saying “I approve of the above plan.” Before doing that she went to the trust company and discussed the subject of the letter with the company.

The stock was not redelivered and on January 5, 1912, the accountant valued the claim at $111,000.00.

A. Wilbur account U. S. Steel agreement, and asks that the accountant be surcharged with interest according to the tenor of said agreement. ...” By the agreement under which Warren borrowed the Steel stock, he agreed to pay interest at the same rate and at the same time as dividends were declared and paid by the Steel Corporation. A statement <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>in the record shows that between the 29th of November, 1922, and the <em>18th </em>of January, 1932, he was credited with the sum of $132,855.51. The exceptant contended that the income so received should have been distributed to the seven beneficiaries. The auditor, in dealing with this, says: “The E. P. Wilbur Trust Company, either directly or indirectly diverted $97,407.88 from moneys belonging to the estate of E. P. Wilbur, deceased, or the trust fund created under the last will and testament of E. P. Wilbur, deceased, under the guise of a ‘Suspense Account,’ for the benefit of persons and purposes entirely unrelated to the Estate of E. P. Wilbur, deceased, or the trust estate created by the last will and testament of E. P. Wilbur, deceased.” It will be observed that while the exceptant complained about % of the income received from the Steel Corporation dividends which were turned over to the trust company under the agreement, the auditor makes a surcharge in a much larger sum than that representing her interest and makes it on the ground of a diversion of trust property. The exhibit in the record which shows the dates of the payments to the trustee begins with November 29, 1922. If from E. P. Wilbur’s death, January 14,1910, to November 29, 1922, Warren paid no interest, the loss was of income which, until her death in 1920, would have been payable to Stella Wilbur. No complaint is made on her account. Thereafter, Ray Wilbur had an interest in the income but as he was satisfied with the administration of the trust to the time of his death, exceptant has no complaint on that ground. Her only interest therefore would be in <em>% of </em>the income received after her husband’s death. The evidence does not justify a finding of diversion. The important question is, Was there a loss, and if so, was it a loss for which the trustee was chargeable? If the witnesses, whose deaths have been referred to, had been available, we should doubtless have more information on the subject than the record contains. The auditor reports that out of the cash that went into this account there were pay<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>ments to the trust company of a demand note of Stella M. Wilbur; a payment of a Kenneth Wilbur note endorsed “Estate of Stella Wilbur” for $5,000; a payment of $2,153.97 of Federal Inheritance Taxes due by the estate of Stella Wilbur; that another note of Kenneth Wilbur for $4,405.37 was paid together with interest of $1,259.12; that payments out of the account direct to beneficiaries amounted to $35,197.63. The auditor then deducted from the total sum received, as shown in this account, this sum of $35,197.63 which had been paid to beneficiaries, and surcharged for the difference $97,-407.88. As appellants point out, not by way of excuse or in defense of what was done, but for the purpose of showing that there was no loss, the trust company was the trustee of both trust estates; the beneficiaries of both estates were the same persons and in the same proportions; they contend that, for the purposes of the proceedings below and the review here, it was immaterial from which funds the payments were made so long as one or the other of the trusts was liable, and that in the end proper debits and credits were made. But these so-called diversions, as the dates given show, happened long before the exceptant’s interest attached and were excused by her husband’s laches and acquiescence.</p>

So far as appellee’s contention was predicated on the validity of the surcharge, it fails for want of support. We do not minimize the services of counsel for the exceptant, but the controlling rule is clear; save in the exceptional circumstances mentioned, the litigant is responsible for the fees of counsel employed.

In this case, too, the time element— the period between appointment and report — is not as significant as might appear. Late in 1935, the trust company was known to be in financial difficulty; a reorganization was proposed and got under way when, on November 16,1935, it assigned nearly all its assets to a successor bank known as Union Bank &amp; Trust Company and to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. A few days later the Secretary of Banking, as receiver, took charge. Early in November the auditor joined with the exceptant in a request to the court that the accountant be required to deposit security for the expenses of the audits, etc. For more than seven months thereafter the auditor was not called upon to do anything. In October, 1936, the exceptant reported to the court by petition that the auditor advised that before he could perform the duties of his appointment a sufficient sum of money should be “impressed or allocated by E. P. Wilbur Trust Company, Trustee in said estate, to cover the expenses of said audit. ...” Such an order was made on December 16, 1936. In the following July one of the reports was filed and in September the other. The time elapsing between appointment and report is therefore not of much importance. The auditor offered no proof of the amount or the value of his services. We can therefore only judge by what is in the record. The appellants in their brief submitted “that a maximum fee would be $15,000 for the two cases.” In the circumstances, we all agree that the sum of $15,000 will be ample compensation for the auditor’s services in both estates, and that on the completion of his labors that sum shall be paid to him as follows: $1,000 by the exceptant<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> and, in each estate $7,000 out of principal.</p>

The assignment was made by Warren’s son, Robert, to secure his indebtedness to the trust company (a balance of $103,600), evidenced by his note of October 1, 1929, endorsed by his father and authorizing the trust company, upon Robert’s default, to sell or assign these interests. At the audit of the trust accounts, the trust company claimed a one-seventh distributive share from each estate pursuant to the assignment. The trust company had also filed a claim against the Warren Wilbur estate on his endorsement of Robert’s note. The administrators of Warren Wilbur’s estate, which was insolvent, also claimed these shares in the trust estates for the benefit of Warren’s creditors. These rival claims had not been adjudicated, when, November 16, 1935, the trust company transferred Robert’s note, with the assigned claims against the three estates, held as collateral, to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as collateral security for a $2,862,644.90 loan. A few days later, as has been stated, the Secretary of Banking took over the E. P. Wilbur Trust Company.</p>

A. I wouldn’t say that I requested them to do so. I would say that they suggested such a thing and I acquiesced. Q. Who suggested it? A. Mr. Hartzog and Mr. Toohey. Q. How soon after your husband’s death? A. The following week. Q. Did both make this request? A. Yes, they both made the request. Q. Was it a.request or was it a suggestion? A. I would say it was a suggestion. Q. Was any reason given? A. Yes, the reason was given that they were much more capable of handling it than I was. Q. Was that the only reason given? A. I don’t recall at the moment. Q. You were advised at that time that you were entitled to the principal of the Stella M. Wilbur estate? A. I was. Q. Don’t you recall that at the time this suggestion was made to you, the undesirability of selling E. P. Wilbur Trust Company stock and other securities in the estate, was pointed out? Anything of that nature said to you? A. No, not that way. I was advised very strongly by Mr. Hartzog particularly, that although I had the privilege of taking my share of the estate at that time he strongly advised to leave it intact for the benefit of myself and the rest of the heirs. Q. One of the investments was the Franklin Coal lease, was it not, a fractional interest? A. A fractional interest, I understand. Q. In effect, did the suggestion along that line amount to this — that the assets could not be converted into cash advantageously at that time? A. So they told me. Q. Did Mr. Hartzog act as attorney for you in the settlement of your husband’s estate? A. Yes, he did.”</p>
