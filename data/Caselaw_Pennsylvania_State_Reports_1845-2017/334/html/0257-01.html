Shepler as to which of them is entitled to death benefits payable by virtue of his membership in the Pennsylvania Railroad Voluntary Relief Department. Originally, in 1902, his mother had been named as beneficiary, but in 1910 he substituted his wife, Minnie G. Shepler. In September, 1936, he obtained a divorce, and in February, 1937, married Mary E. Shepler. In April, 1937, he withdrew the name of Minnie G. Shepler as beneficiary and directed that the benefits should be payable to his wife, Mary E. Shepler. He died in May, 1937. The Relief Department disclaimed all interest, and, by agreement of the parties, retained the fund merely as a stakeholder pending judicial decision as to the party entitled.</p>

Shepler admits that in the absence of special circumstances she would have no standing to contest the change of beneficiary. She had no vested interest during Shepler’s lifetime, but only an expectancy contingent on his death and subject to the possibility that another beneficiary might meanwhile be named as permitted by the regulations of the Relief Department. In the absence of any rule of the Department to the contrary, Shepler’s right to make the substitution was unqualified, and her assent was not necessary: <em>Brown v.

A different situation is created, however, when the member agrees, for consideration, to name a certain person as beneficiary, or, if one has already been named, not to make a substitution. Illustrations are to be found in <em>Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Wolfe, </em><a href="/pa/203/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="203 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="994773" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0269-01">203 Pa. 269</a>, and <em>Supreme Lodge, Knights and Ladies of Honor v.

Even if no binding contract exists, the member may become irrevocably obligated by force of what amounts in effect to a promissory estoppel. Thus in <em>King v.

Davis, a member of the bar, that he represented Shepler in the divorce proceedings, that he prepared “exhibit A” and perhaps “exhibit B,” that the witness Margaret Bender was his secretary, that Shepler signed “A” in his presence, and he, Davis, signed “B” as a witness to Shepler’s signature. John McCormick, also a member of the bar, testified that he was counsel for Minnie G. Shepler, that he was present when “B” was signed and witnessed the signature of Minnie G. Shepler but was not present at the signing of “A”; both papers, he said, were prepared in Mr. Davis’s office. Margaret Bender testified merely to signing as a witness to Shepler’s signature on “exhibit A.” No further evidence was offered to explain <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>the circumstances attending the execution of the two documents, hut it is stated by the chancellor in his adjudication that at the time of the hearing before him both papers were fastened together and enclosed in a coyer bearing the name of Mr. Davis.</p>

Shepler as beneficiary, reveals no consideration for such promise, nor was there any testimony tending to prove any. It is Minnie G. Shepler’s contention that “exhibit A” is legally integrated with “exhibit B” as part of one and the same transaction, and that “B” supplies the needed consideration, not only because the seals attached thereto import it, but because Shepler’s promise therein was supported by his moral and legal obligation to maintain his wife even though living apart from her <em>(Lineaweaver’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/284/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="284 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1092021" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0384-01">284 Pa. 384</a>, 391). Unfortunately for the soundness of this position there is no indication of any connection between “A” and “B” other than their unexplained presence in the one cover. The fact that they bear the same date does not prove legal relationship or contemporaneous execution: <em>Dutton’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/181/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="181 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="891383" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0426-01">181 Pa. 426</a>, 436. “Exhibit B” is a bilateral agreement; “A” is signed only by Shepler, and there are different witnesses. Mr. Davis, who was apparently the one person, other than Shepler himself, who had anything to do with both papers or who saw both of them executed, did not testify as to any arrangement or circumstances from which it could be inferred that the two documents were not wholly independent of one another. In order to make “exhibit A” legally enforceable the burden was upon Minnie G. Shepler to prove that there was consideration for the promise not to remove her as beneficiary, and she did not sustain this burden merely by producing in evidence another document of the same date signed by her and her husband, there being no internal evidence in the papers, nor any evidence aliunde, that they constituted a single transaction and that the consideration which supported <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>the one was intended to be carried over into the other. Nor is there any suggestion in the record that Minnie G. Shepler paid out money or otherwise acted or forebore to act in reliance upon the promise that she was to remain the beneficiary. Indeed there is no evidence that “exhibit A,” in which this promise was made, was delivered to her, or as to when she first learned of its existence, or that it ever left the possession of Mr. Davis who had prepared it and who was Shepler’s attorney.</p>
