This order of payment was challenged by interested parties. After hearing, the learned court below adopted a different classification of creditors, as appears by the final decree in the reporter's statement of the case; distribution, after allowances not now challenged, was directed in the following order: 3. To Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, as an administration expense; 4. to the Nice Ball' Bearing Company, a judgment creditor; 5, 6 and 7, to certain claimants and nonassenting stockholders who were allowed the status of general creditors.</p>

In the liquidation, the creditors who have been shareholders are placed, because of the partnership characteristics of such shareholding, in a different class from the creditors who have never been stockholders, and are therefore not entitled to take anything until the general creditors are paid. So much will perhaps not be questioned. The same order of payment applies in the liquidation of an association created by merger. Such a corporation may have creditors who were not creditors <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>for money loaned to it, but for <em>obligations </em>imposed upon it as tbe result of resorting to tbe merger legislation to obtain its charter. Counsel for tbe receiver proposed that shareholders in constituent corporations who refused to become shareholders in the New corporation, and so became its creditors, should be called shareholder creditors of the New corporation. The description is not important; the fact is that they never were shareholders in and sustained no shareholder relation to the New corporation; in consequence of the merger they became creditors by operation of law. Only a corporation created by merger or consolidation can have this class of creditors.</p>

Being general creditors, they, of course, share <em>pari passu </em>with the other general creditors of the New corporation, because the law has made no distinction in the priorities of payment demandable by general creditors of a constituent, subject to whose unsecured debts the merger took place, and those who, after merger, became general creditors of the New corporation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

L. 565, 71 PS section 733-719, the proceeds taking the place of the land. On May 7, 1932, when the judgment was entered in court of Common Pleas No. 2, the New corporation appealed to this court and, to make the appeal a supersedeas, furnished the bond of Union Indemnity Company. The judgment was affirmed January 18,1933, but was not paid because on January 6,1933, the surety company went into liquidation. It appeared that, to obtain the surety bond, the New corporation had provided counter indemnity by depositing $45,000 of government bonds with Tradesmen’s National Bank &amp; Trust Company under a written arrangement “to secure the Union Indemnity Company ... as Surety on our behalf on a certain Appeal Bond ...” and also providing for the return of the bonds to the appellant if its appeal succeeded. After the appointment of receivers for the New corporation by the federal court in February, 1933, the Tradesmen’s National Bank was ordered to deliver the bonds to the Receiver without prejudice to the rights of the Nice Ball Bearing Company; later the bonds were called for payment and others were substituted. The Nice Ball Bearing Company asked to have the bonds applied in payment of its claim and the learned court below followed <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>the general rule<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> that a “creditor is entitled to all the securities taken by the surety of his debtor, either for the purpose of securing the payment of the debt to the creditor, or for the purpose of indemnifying himself against the payment of it.” Some objection was made to the allowance of interest, but the learned judge concluded: “Nice Ball Bearing Company has a judgment which under our law bears interest. By operation of law it secured a lien on certain assets of the New Mortgage Association. It is entitled to receive from the proceeds of those assets both principal and interest to date of payment.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

It did not and could not affect or impair the liens or contractual rights of the creditors of the merged company or of any of the constituent companies: <em>Galey v.

The appointment of a receiver for property does not affect preexisting liens upon the property, or vested rights or interests of third persons therein.

We think that when the facts are examined there is no basis for the inference that it is inequitable. If, for example, the New corporation had paid all its debts except this dissenting stockholder’s judgment and had then borrowed money from one of the appellant trust companies and, thereafter, had failed with these two creditors unpaid, no one would suggest that the subsequently loaning creditor should take priority in distribution over the judgment creditor, merely because the judgment represented the value of a dissentient’s stock interest in a constituent; yet that is what the argument comes to. The association was solvent at the time of the merger. Presumably, every creditor for money loaned could then have obtained his money; he <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>could have reduced his claim to judgment and have obtained his lien. Such creditors, we must assume, knew of the merger and had available means of knowing that some stockholders dissented. The creditors knew that the merged association must assume the obligation of paying the value of the dissenters’ shares and that, as the priority which the money loaning creditor had over a shareholder applied only in the constituent corporation, there would be no priority over such creditors if the merged corporation went into liquidation. The judgment creditor never was a shareholder in the New corporation. The assets of the constituent of which the Nice Ball Bearing Company had been a stockholder were transferred to the New corporation. The shareholder could not prevent the transfer; all that it could ultimately require was that the transferee should pay him the value of his interest. In the light of such considerations, the result cannot be considered inequitable. Referring to such transfers of assets, the statute, Act of 1909, P. L. 408, as amended, 15 PS section 423, in section 3, imposes a provision that “all rights of creditors and all liens upon the property of each of said corporations shall continue unimpaired, limited in lien to the property affected by such liens at the time of the creation of the same, and the respective constituent corporations may be deemed to be in existence to preserve the same; and all debts not of record, duties, and liabilities of each of said constituent corporations shall thenceforth attach to the said new corporation, and may be enforced against it to the same extent and by the process as if said debts, duties, and liabilities had been contracted by it.”</p>

It is obvious that if an amply solvent corporation merged with one having no surplus that the latter’s creditors would be in <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>much better position as the result of the contribution of the solvent corporation’s assets than they would have been without the merger. These considerations led to discussion in some of the arguments of what the parties called “tracing” the assets of the constituents. Some of the appellants contend that the term is applicable only to the pursuit of property wrongfully diverted for the purpose of reclaiming or recapturing on the theory of a constructive trust. Here there was no wrongful diversion; no one suggests that the merger was not lawful. On the other hand it was suggested that all that was meant by the term was to describe the pursuit of assets from the constituent into the merged corporation for the purpose of applying the provision quoted above “that all rights of creditors and all liens upon the property of each of said corporations shall continue unimpaired. . . .” As the court based no priority on “tracing,” it is not necessary now to discuss it; the subject may be left until presented with relation to controlling facts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

The plaintiff of course had never been a shareholder in the new corporation. By taking over the property of the constituents, the merged association necessarily assumed the obligation of paying to the dissenting plaintiff the value of his property.

Selig, who complains that he was not held to be a general creditor in virtue of having declined to assent to the merger. The evidence is meager. It appears that Mr. Selig was a shareholder in four of the constituents, Dannenberg, Realty, Academy and Hoover, holding nine books on which dues had been paid in the sum of $3,622.50. The merger value was $2,623. He contends that he did not assent to the merger, but the fact is that subsequent to the merger he made payments on shares represented by four of the books and then gave notice to the New corporation that he desired the withdrawal value. The witness who testified about Mr. Selig’s shares, after mentioning the nine books and the constituents which issued them, was asked this question — “Q. Was a notice of withdrawal given on these books? A. Yes. Q. When was the date? A. There was a notice of withdrawal given on all books as of May 31, 1932.” The merger, it will be recalled, occurred April 7, 1931. In the account of the Secretary, Mr. Selig was treated as a stockholder in the New corporation. The learned court held: <em>“A notice of </em>withdrawal sent to the new association after the merger, if sent knowingly, is- a recognition of ownership of shares in the New association, and is, therefore, inconsistent with a claim as a nonassenting stockholder. In this case we are of the opinion that the payment of dues on some shares after the merger, plus the notice of withdrawal of all shares after the merger, effectually estops claimant from asserting that he is a nonassenting stockholder as to any of his shares. Claimant is en<a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>titled merely to a stockholder’s status.” That conclusion is affirmed.</p>

The receiver’s contention, briefly stated, is that, as the mortgagee was in possession pursuant to the terms of the mortgage, it ought to pay the taxes. The title was in the receiver. He had the option of abandoning the <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>property but preferred to hold it, and his brief concedes liability. He says: “By reason of his failure to abandon the property in an endeavor to protect an apparent equity the receiver became liable for the payment of the taxes assessed after the receivership, but this liability does not become an administrative expense until it is shown that he was administering the property.” While the claimant was exercising rights under the mortgage it was nevertheless also acting in the interest of the receiver; the protection of the “apparent equity” for the receiver’s estate — a part of his administrative obligation ■ — was obtained by the mortgagee’s carrying on the business on the premises; the property, with the hotel in operation, was of greater value than an idle plant.

The claims of the nonassenting stockholders, which became payable as of the date of the merger, carried interest from April 7, 1931, the date of the merger. As to interest accruing thereafter Judge Lamberton said: “In regard to interest accruing after the receivership, the question is more difficult. There are many decisions which hold that interest ceases when the receiver is appointed. But the prevailing rule appears to be that this is a rule of convenience to be adopted only in the case of insolvent estates, and that where the estate turns out to be in fact solvent, interest is allowed on all claims until the date of payment. This is nowhere better stated than in <em>American I. &amp; S. Mfg. Co. v. Seaboard A. L. R.

But that is not because the claims had lost their <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>interest-bearing quality during that period, but is a necessary and enforced rule of distribution, due to the fact that in case of receiverships the assets are generally insufficient to pay debts in full. If all claims were of equal dignity and all bore the same rate of interest, from the date of the receivership to the date of final distribution, it would be immaterial whether the dividend was calculated on the basis of the principal alone or of principal and interest combined. . . . For that and like reasons, in case funds are not sufficient to pay claims of equal dignity, the distribution is made only on the basis of the principal of the debt. But that rule did not prevent the running of interest during the receivership; and, if, as a result of good fortune or good management, the estate proved sufficient to discharge the claims in full, interest as well as principal should be paid.’ And again: ‘Principal as well as interest, accruing during a receivership, is paid on debts of the highest dignity, even though what remains is not sufficient to pay claims of a lower rank in full.’ See also <em>Jamison’s Estate, Boyer’s Appeal </em>(supra) [<a href="/pa/163/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="163 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="859082" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0143-01">163 Pa. 143</a>]; <em>McGinnis v.
