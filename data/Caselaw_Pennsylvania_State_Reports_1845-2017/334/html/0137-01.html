An employee, William H. Cody, received a certificate in which he named his wife beneficiary. The certificate was dated August 30, 1928. He died January 2, 1935. In March, 1932, he and his wife separated and thereafter lived apart; he retained a key to the house in which she continued to live and was visited by her in a hospital shortly before his death. On June 23,1934, he called on F. W. Kelsey, Superintendent of Safety and Welfare, of Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation and stated that he wished to change the beneficiary. Kelsey supplied him with a proper form which <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>Cody filled out, designating as the proposed beneficiary, “Elizabeth Steeson, friend,” and leaving the document with Kelsey who produced it at the trial. The policy provided: “Section 9. CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY. —Any Employee insured hereunder may, from time to time, change the Beneficiary by filing written notice thereof with the Employer accompanied by the Certificate of such Employee. Such change shall take effect upon endorsement thereof by the Employer on such certificate, and unless the Certificate is so endorsed, the change shall not take effect. After such endorsement, the change will relate back and take effect as of the date the Employee signed said written notice of change, whether or not the Employee be living at the time of such endorsement or not, but without prejudice to the Company on account of any payment made by it before receipt of such written notice.”</p>

After his death, more than six months later, the insurance was claimed by his widow as the beneficiary <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>designated in the certificate, and also by Miss Steeson. After the money was paid into court, Miss Steeson became plaintiff in the interpleader and the widow, defendant. The jury would have been justified in finding from the evidence that the policy was kept by the widow in an unlocked box in her residence; that Cody had access to the house but made no effort to get the certificate for the purpose of having the change completed by the required endorsement and therefore abandoned the intention.</p>

The insurance company discharged its obligation by paying the money into court.</p>

The sixth assignment complains that the court sustained an objection to a question asked of Mrs. Cody. Having testified that on or about June 23, 1934, “there were no communications” between her and her husband, she was asked whether “the only communication that indirectly existed between the two of you was between the respective attorneys.” We think the question should have been allowed but we also think that the refusal to allow it could not have harmed plaintiff and for that reason dismiss the assignment.</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[260,952,1155,1337]]]'>Other assignments complain of confusion or ambiguity in the instructions to the jury to aid in determining whether the insured did what was reasonably necessary to make the proposed change effective. Criticism is made of part of the sentence quoted in the 7th assignment, in which the learned trial judge said, “There is no evidence here that the paper [the certificate of insurance] was kept any other place than in its usual place, and there is no evidence at all that during the six months he lived after June 23rd he made any effort to make his intention of change of beneficiary final and effective.” Without what followed, this quotation does not give an adequate idea of the entire instruction. The complaint is directed to the statement that there was no evidence of any effort, etc. But, taking a larger view, and dealing, as we should, with the charge as a whole, we think that what the jury would understand from it was that, while Cody had a key to the house and knew where the unlocked box containing the policy had been kept, the evidence was that he had done nothing between June 23rd and January 2nd of the following year when he died; that his omission in this respect would support a finding that he had changed his mind about depriving his wife of the benefit of the insurance. We find no reversible error in the instructions.</p>
