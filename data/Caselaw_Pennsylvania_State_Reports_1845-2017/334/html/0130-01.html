    <p id="b161-11" data-blocks='[["BL_161.18",161,[134,1560,1153,588]]]'>Plaintiff appeals from judgment on a case stated. The question is whether a sinking fund payment to the mortgage trustee shall be applied to the redemption of bonds generally or to bonds of a particular denomination. The bonds Avere issued by a corporation, Sprout, Waldron &amp; Company, in three denominations, designated M, D and C bonds; in all, $413,000 par value are outstanding. The M bonds Avere numbered from 1 to 160. The plaintiff holds $132,000 M bonds. The mortgage securing the bonds was dated October 1, 1930, to mature October 1, 1960. The defendant is the mortgage trustee.</p>

It contained the following: “Briefly, the plan asks from bondholders that past due sinking fund payments be waived and that sinking funds for the next three years also be waived. Provisions are made for renewal of sinking fund payments in the fourth and fifth years on a reduced basis, and the full sinking fund payments required by the mortgage would be resumed during the sixth year.”</p>
    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[315,850,1152,806]]]'>The creditors’ agreement, Avhich was executed to put the plan in operation, provided accordingly: “1. Sinking fund payments required by the provisions of the mortgage . . . heretofore due and unpaid shall be waived, and future sinking funds shall be waived for a period of three (3) years, or until January 1, 1938. For the year 1938 the Company shall be obliged to pay $10,000 into such sinking fund for the retirement of bonds; for the year 1939 such sinking fund payment shall be $15,000, and thereafter at the rate of $25,000 per year, the amount provided in the mortgage.” The use to be made of such payments was not specifically provided for. The rate of interest on the bonds was conditionally reduced to 3% and provision was made for funding back interest at the same rate.</p>

The plaintiff, as holder of $132,000 M bonds, demanded that it be applied to the redemption of M bonds. The trustee refused. The purpose of the case stated was to determine whether the sum should be used “only for the retirement and redemption of bonds numbered from Ml to M160, inclusive, or for the retirement and redemption of all bonds secured by said mortgage, irrespective of number.” The learned court below was of opinion that it was the duty of the trustee to use the money paid, as has been stated, after January 2,1937, for the retirement of bonds generally and not for the retirement of M bonds oniy.</p>

While the mortgage provided that on the request of the holders of “25% in amount of the then outstanding bonds” the trustee might declare a default, none was declared. The mortgage, in article 4, provided for annual sinking fund payments until 1960. It provided that sinking fund payments made “between January 2, 1931, and January 2, 1937, both dates inclusive, shall be applied by the Trustee to the payment and redemption of bonds numbered Ml to M160, inclusive. ...” It also provided that sinking fund payments after January 2, 1937, might, at the option of the mortgagor, be made in bonds or cash. Article 4, section 1, paragraph (c) contained the following: “(c) In making any Sinking Fund payments after January 2, 1937, the Company may, at its option, deliver to the Trustee, any bond, or bonds [outstanding, which] . . . shall be accepted by the Trustee, in lieu pro tanto, of cash to <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>the extent of the redemption price thereof, for the year when so tendered, and of interest accrued thereon, to the date of redemption, in the case of every Bond so delivered in lieu of a cash payment required to be made pursuant to the provisions in paragraph (a) hereof, and for the purposes of this section, such Bond shall be deemed to be a Bond redeemed through the operation of the Sinking Fund payment in respect of which it was delivered to the Trustee by the Company.</p>

In the event any of said bonds numbered Ml to M160, inclusive, shall have been retired by the operation of paragraph (b) hereof, the succeeding payment to the Sinking Fund required by paragraph (a) hereof shall be reduced in an amount corresponding to the aggregate face value of the bonds so retired. .</p>

The creditors’ agreement provided “10. All of the provisions of the mortgage indenture securing the First Mortgage Bonds of the Company, including the operation of the sinking fund, shall be and remain in full force and effect, except as modified by this Agreement.” We think the intention expressed is clearly inconsistent with the intention which plaintiff contends should be inferred; if the purpose had been that suggested by the plaintiff, it could and doubtless would have been stated in a few words. The court may not supply them. The mortgage and the bond, which must of course be read as part of the mortgage in which it is set forth, provided that sinking fund payments made to January 2, 1937, inclusive, should be used to redeem M bonds. The fact is that the sinking fund payments were not made and that, instead of having a default declared and proceedings to collect, the creditors’ agreement was made. They agreed that past sinking fund defaults “shall be waived, and future sinking funds shall be waived for a period of three years, or until January 1, 1938. For the year 1938 the Com<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>pany shall be obliged to pay $10,000 into snch sinking fund for the retirement of bonds; for the year 1939 such sinking fund payment shall be $15,000, and thereafter at the rate of $25,000 per year, the amount provided in the mortgage.” Such payments would not satisfy the original requirement of the mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[263,679,1156,906]]]'>The creditors’ waiver is definite. The waiver was a relinquishment of the right. The second agreement was a substitution for the first, as far as it went, and is consistent with the intention stated in the reorganization plan. The M bonds outstanding were less than half; the plan was not to be operative until 95% of all the creditors agreed to it; bondholders would have been justified in assenting on the understanding, from the papers submitted to the creditors, that the provision for the priority of redemption of the M bonds before January 2, 1937, was no longer to be enjoyed by holders of such bonds, an advantage calculated to induce assent to the creditors’ agreement. It is quite possible that a sufficient number of bondholders refrained from requesting the trustee to declare a default, thinking that the waiver of the prior right of redemption of M bonds improved the value of their D and C bonds.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[257,1605,1155,810]],["BL_167.1",167,[136,348,1151,155]]]'>The appellant quotes a portion of the bond stating that the mortgagor will redeem the M bonds yearly until all are redeemed. But, as has been said, the provision must be read with other provisions of the mortgage, some of which have been referred to above, and as affected by the creditors’ agreement. The provision was modified by the creditors’ agreement which specifically dealt with the sinking fund, the only source from which the bonds could have been redeemed. The appellant says the sinking fund payment is in trust and that the trustee may not discriminate between classes of bonds in applying the sinking fund. The proposition is sound <em>(Struthers Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Union Trust Company, </em><a href="/pa/227/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="227 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="1008531" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0029-01">227 Pa. 29</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.%20986" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="75 A. 986">75 A. 986</a>), but has no application to the facts.
