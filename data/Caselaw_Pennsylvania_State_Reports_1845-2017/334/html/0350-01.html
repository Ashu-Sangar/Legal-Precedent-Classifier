    <p id="b381-9" data-blocks='[["BL_381.14",381,[131,1340,1152,371]]]'>This appeal is from judgment for defendant on an affidavit of defense challenging the sufficiency of the statement of claim pursuant to section 20 of the Practice Act of 1915, P. L. 483, 12 PS section 471. Plaintiff claims damages for the conversion of stocks and bonds pledged by him as collateral security for the payment of six demand notes made by him and held by defendant.</p>

The notes were given for money loaned to the plaintiff. Each contained a provision<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> authorizing the bank to demand <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>additional collateral and, on plaintiff’s failure to comply with the demand, to sell.</p>
    <p id="b382-4" data-blocks='[["BL_382.6",382,[290,451,1151,796]]]'>On October 16, 1937, the bank demanded additional collateral which plaintiff did not supply within the time required by defendant who thereupon sold the collateral. Plaintiff contends he should have been given more time. He avers that, while arranging to borrow money to meet the demand, defendant, on October 19, 1937, called on him for cash which, at the moment, he was unable to produce but that defendant “orally agreed that it would continue to carry said loans during all of October 19, 1937, without the deposit of additional securities or cash, and that defendant would take no action with respect to the sale of plaintiff’s securities held by defendant.” He avers that, on the same day, he learned that defendant was offering the collateral for sale though he does not aver when it was sold.</p>
    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.7",382,[287,1267,1153,519]]]'>Plaintiff, in his notes, had agreed to increase the collateral on demand and had authorized a sale for default. If, as alleged, defendant made and broke its promise to give him all of October 19, it was a promise for which he gave no consideration, having all along been under the obligation stated in his notes.
