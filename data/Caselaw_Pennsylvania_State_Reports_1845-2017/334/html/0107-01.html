United had issued and outstanding two kinds of stock: 389,963 shares of common and 58,212 shares of 7% cumulative preferred stock redeemable at 110 and accrued dividends. If United had then converted the Steel stock into cash and used the proceeds to redeem its preferred shares, its treasury would have had remaining a large surplus for the benefit of its common stockholders. When United declined to do this, William B. Schiller and others holding 6,610 shares of preferred stock, on March 14, 1931, filed their bill against United to compel redemption. The plaintiffs in that suit were William B. Schiller, George Harting, George E. Shaw, Maria T. Hunt, Ascalot Company, a Delaware corporation, Jennie King Mellon, Kate J. Beed, Kerfoot W. Daly and Minnie G. Sands and were represented by counsel who now appeal at number 42. In March, 1932, when Steel common was selling at 40, the litigation was settled by a contract called the Schiller agreement. If the proceeds of Steel common at 40 had been applied to the redemption of the preferred stock, the common stockholders would have received nothing. Accordingly, the agreement provided that United should have until March 1, 1937, to pay its debts and redeem the preferred stock. Schiller and his co-plaintiffs became the parties of the first part to the agreement; defendant, United, and Peo<a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>ples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, as Trustee, became the parties of the second and third parts respectively. For their services in bringing about the Schiller agreement, counsel (present appellants at number 42) were paid by United the sum of 125,00o;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> United’s counsel received the same amount.</p>

United informed the trustee that it was advised by counsel that the existence of these suits would prevent compliance with the agreement. To meet that situation, the trustee, on March 6, 1937, filed its bill, in substance, for specific performance and in the course of the litigation was represented by its own counsel. It named as defendants not only United but also a number of holders of preferred stock (the parties of the first part to the Schiller agreement) and the common stockholders who had brought the suits to restrain United from complying with the agreement. The appellants at number 42 accepted service and appeared for preferred stockholder defendants and filed a joint answer on their behalf admitting the averments of fact contained in the bill and joining in the prayers for relief. At the same time, Lillian Levin and William C. McEldowney, holders of preferred stock of United, by counsel now appellants at number 48, filed a bill also asking specific performance. On a petition filed by the same counsel on her behalf, Helen Jacobs, holder of preferred stock not stamped (a term defined later) pursuant to the Schiller agreement, was allowed to intervene; in consequence of that representation, they claim fees as for services to holders of unstamped preferred stock.</p>

In addition, separate appeals were taken by preferred stockholder defendants, represented by the present appellants at number 42, and by the plaintiffs, Levin and McEldowney and the intervener Helen Jacobs, then represented by present appellants in number 48.

Dean, J., said: “But, it is urged, that Mr. Quincy, from his argument, and some evidence produced by him, induced the auditors to reject many thousand dollars of spurious claims on the fund, and thereby all holders of certificates, whether purchased by or originally issued to them, were benefited. Admit it; but he did only what he was bound to do under his professional obligation to his own clients; if he had done less, he would have failed in duty to them; in this particular he owed no duty to other claimants and performed none to them, although an incidental benefit may have resulted to them from the performance of a duty to his own clients. This, however, gives Mm no claim on them for contribution to his compensation. Suppose, as there might easily have been from the large number of claimants, thirty lawyers representing thirty separate claims, and fifty unrepresented certificate holders before the auditors, and every lawyer had urged successfully a point which induced the rejection of some unfounded claim, then compensation to each, at the rate here allowed, would have swept away the whole fund. That this claim being only for one lawyer, in no degree under the facts raises an equity in his favor. It would have been otherwise if the fund in the beginning had been raised or saved by him as counsel for his particular clients” (pp. 243-244).</p>

There is no evidence that anything out of the ordinary routine of legal procedure was required.

If the trustee had refused or neglected to proceed and had made action by appellants’ clients necessary to enforce the agreement, appellants would have brought themselves within the rule charging the value of their services on the fund.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> But there is no suggestion that the trustee failed in any respect to perform any duty imposed on it by the trust or otherwise. The sufficiency of its bill in equity and the competency of its counsel are conceded by appellants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Some of the property was in <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>the possession of tlie trustee and the rest was potentially within its grasp; it was a condition which directly resulted from the Schiller agreement for the achievement of which appellants had been paid. There is evidence that appellants rendered service to preferred stockholders during the five-year period following the execution of the agreement but, in the circumstances, compensation is not payable out of the fund but by the parties to whom the service was rendered. After that agreement came into effect, it was unnecessary to procure the restoration of any trust property because none had been diverted; none was in jeopardy. The trustee had not omitted to do anything required to be done by it. By its suit, the property and affairs of United were brought under the control of the court. The trustee necessarily brought in as defendants the other parties to the agreement, preferred stockholders, parties of the first part, and United, of the second part. As we understand it, when the cases were tried, holders of 53,254 shares of preferred stock had had their certificates stamped, leaving 4,958 shares unstamped.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Holders of unstamped shares were affected by the intervention of Helen Jacobs; it is immaterial, for present purposes, whether such shareholders were plainitffs or defendants; the fact is that sufficient parties were brought on the record to support the decree for the retirement of all the preferred stock. It is clear that the record shows no necessity for supplementing, at the expense of the fund, the services of the <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>trustee’s counsel by the service of other counsel whether acting, in the one case, for defendant holders of stamped preferred stock or, in the other, for the intervening holders of unstamped certificates. The .appellants brought no property under the control of the court which was not already there as the result of the trustee’s act. In the argument it is said that appellants appeared for a class, but that is not enough to bring them within the rule applied in cases cited, because the record shows that the trustee’s proceeding was in all respects adequate.</p>
