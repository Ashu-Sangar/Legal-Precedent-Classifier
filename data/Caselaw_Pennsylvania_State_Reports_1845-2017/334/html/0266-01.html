Crisswell instituted in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County an action of replevin against Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company in which she alleged that at the time of Crisswell’s death there were certain stock certificates of which he, in his lifetime, was the owner, and which were contained in a safe deposit box in the vault of that company; that, in expectation of his impending death, he delivered to her, on November 18, 1936, the key of the box, thereby transferring to her title to the contents; and that the Trust Company refused to give her access to the box. Elliott, as executor of the estate, intervened, and, by filing a counterbond, prevented her from obtaining possession of the certificates. In his affidavit of defense he denied that decedent had given her the key in expectation of impending death or that the contents of the box had ever become her property; he alleged that she had not been married to decedent, that her proper name was Anna Pierson, that for a long time prior to his death decedent was non compos mentis and incapable of transacting any business or making any valid gift, and that on November 18, 1936, the date of the alleged delivery of the key, he was removed from his home to the psychopathic ward of a hospital where he remained until the time of his death. The affidavit of defense also denied the jurisdiction of the court in the replevin proceedings.</p>

She alleged that the certificates of stock had been in the possession of decedent at the time of his death, were now in the possession of the executor, and were included in the inventory of the estate. An answer was filed by Anna Pierson, or Anna Pierson Crisswell, setting out the facts upon which she relied to establish a gift of the certificates causa mortis, and asserting that the court of common pleas had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the title.</p>

Superior Ct. 350</a>, 355. The first question for consideration, therefore, is where the possession of the disputed property was at the time of decedent’s death and thereafter. If the property is fairly to be regarded as having been in decedent’s possession, either actually or presumptively, at the time of his death, but there is a substantial factual dispute as to ownership, the orphans’ court has no power, sitting as a fact-finding tribunal, to determine this question, but may submit the issue for a trial by jury, and a verdict so found will properly constitute the basis of a decree by that court settling the controversy: <em>Keyser's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/329/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="329 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1181416" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0514-01">329 Pa. 514</a>, 518, 519.</p>

Mere denials or assertions are not in themselves sufficient. “If at testator’s death the property is shown to have been in his possession, or if for any other reason it was presumably his, a mere denial of his ownership unsupported will not oust the court [orphans’ court] of its jurisdiction, but the court may proceed with the investigation so far as to inform itself whether the denial is made in good faith and a substantial dispute exists”: <em>Cutler’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/225/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="225 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="965391" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0167-01">225 Pa. 167</a>, 171; <em>Hermann’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/226/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="226 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="967905" data-case-paths="/pa/226/0543-01">226 Pa. 543</a>; <em>Walkinshaw Estate, </em><a href="/pa/275/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="275 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1075720" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0121-01">275 Pa. 121</a>, 125; <em>Messmore’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/290/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="290 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1104405" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0107-01">290 Pa. 107</a>, 116; <em>In re Estate of Eliza Gallagher, </em><a href="/pa-super/109/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="109 Pa.

It is true that if, as appellant alleges, decedent handed her the key of the safe de<a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>posit box with the intent to make a gift causa mortis, this may have been enough to establish a constructive delivery of the property to which the key gave access: <em>Elliott’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/312/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="312 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1150686,1150711" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0493-01,/pa/312/0493-02">312 Pa. 493</a>, 500. But it is denied by the executor that such a gift, vesting possession in her, was made, or, if made, that decedent was of sufficient mental competency validly to effectuate it. Moreover, the certificates, being in the name of decedent and unendorsed, imported ownership in him up to the time of his death, and therefore established a prima facie title in his estate: <em>Paxson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/225/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="225 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="965348" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0204-01">225 Pa. 204</a>, 210; <em>Keysets Estate, </em><a href="/pa/329/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="329 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1181416" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0514-01">329 Pa. 514</a>, 521. When appellant produces evidence before the orphans’ court in support of her claim, that court may conclude that a substantial dispute as to title exists and therefore submit the issue for a trial by jury, but, her possession not being admitted nor reasonably apparent, the question whether, under the circumstances, a substantial dispute exists is one to be decided by the orphans’ court in limine, and appellant cannot short-circuit the case into the court of common pleas merely by pleading facts which, if true, may establish her title, but which are seriously controverted by the executor and a residuary legatee of decedent’s estate.</p>
