The Court of Common Pleas, on appeal to it from the assessment fixed by the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes, reduced the assessment from $551,540 to $544,540. Appellants urge upon us that a further substantial reduction should be made. The questions raised are similar to those in the preceding case: Park\u2019s Appeal, 334 Pa. 193. We are not convinced from a study of the briefs and record that the figures fixed by the court below are not supported in the testimony or are too high.\nOrder affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost.",
