Everyone knows that a priest would not have advised Maseiantonio to get a lawyer to draw his will if Maseiantonio had been in the stuporous mental condition described by Dr. Rappaport. On July 19th and again on July 20th, Maseiantonio told DiGiacomo <em>in detail </em>— in the course of numerous questions and answers — exactly what he wanted in his will; what each person and the Church was to receive; and he told DiGiacomo the address of each house which he owned and the relative to whom he wished to give it. DiGiacomo knew Rose Maseiantonio Benedict very slightly; he did not know testator’s devisees, or who were the testator’s relatives or their names, or what real or personal property he had; so that it would have been impossible for Mm to have fabricated such a will unless the testator or Rose Benedict gave him the information. DiGiacomo testified that testator gave him all the detailed directions about the gifts and provisions he wanted to make in his will, and the person to whom he wanted to give each of his properties; and that no one prompted the testator or made any sugges fcions to him. The hearing Judge, sitting as Judge and Jury, believed DiGiacomo, and Rose Benedict, who corroborated him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">**</a>

I am convinced that the Rule now means this: Any finding or conclusion or decision made by a hearing Judge or a Chancellor or a trial <em>Judge </em>— even <em>if it is based wholly or in substantial part on the credibility of the witnesses </em>whom he saw and heard and we did not — constitutes a manifest palpable abuse of discretion, if it differs from what we would have reached. Of course I very strongly oppose and disagree with such a test, or with any other test which changes or overrules the interpretation or meaning which a host of prior decisions of this Court had established.</p>
