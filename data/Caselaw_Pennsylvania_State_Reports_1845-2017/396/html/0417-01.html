Blumenstein was indicted and, at his trial, he agreed to have the case heard by a judge without a jury. The Judge viewed two reels of the motion picture and, after hearing all the evidence, concluded that: “The pictures depicted a series of dancing acts, which were definitely cheap, lewd, obscene and indecent. By their very nature they would corrupt the morals of the immature and the weak, appealing only to those of depraved taste and the lowest of human instincts.

That day is vanishing like the American Indian because recently courts have been fighting windmills over the definition of the simplest words. Any urchin on the street, any illiterate immigrant only in America a few months, any uneducated laborer will tell you the meaning of the word obscene, but there are courts which still cannot define or describe obscenity without employing polysyllabic words enmeshed in complicated verbiage of unending modifications and nuances which finally leave the reader or hearer as confused as one listening to an aboriginal incantation in an equatorial jungle.</p>

One would have reason to expect that in a decision striking down <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>a solemn act of the Legislature, one would find lan&lt; guage which, if it did not overawe and overwhelm with its massive proofs and irresistible logic, would at least satisfactorily convince the reader of the imperative need of taking to the chopping block, no matter with what anguish of mind and soul, a creature of the sovereign body of the State. But one does not find such language in the Majority Opinion. One finds three legal size sheets of cryptic utterances, studded with digits and names of cases, none of which, as I have shown, impel this Court to the tragedy of executing a long respected and long-serving statute of the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b468-4" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[265,1031,1147,1093]]]'>So that I may not appear to be unfair with this seemingly harsh observation, I will quote the words the Majority employs in laying to rest for all time the body of Section 528 of the Act of 1939. The Majority Opinion says: “In this 'posture of the law our conclusion in <em>Hallmark </em>is dispositive:”. I assume that the Majority intends to say here that a quotation from the <em>Hallmark </em>decision, which is to follow, disposes of Section 528 completely, finally and irrevocably. I quote from the Majority Opinion as it quotes from <em>Hallmark: </em>“The picture involved in the present case was disapproved by the Board of Censors because it was ‘indecent and immoral and, in the judgment of the Board, tended to debase and corrupt morals’. In view of the foregoing decisions of the Supreme Court [not including Both &amp; Alberts, which was written later], individually and collectively, we are of opinion that these terms must be held subject to the same fatal objections as those which invalidated the statutes held unconstitutional by the Court.”</p>
    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[266,2137,1146,262]],["BL_469.1",469,[143,365,1147,252]]]'>It will be noted that the “dispositive” quotation says nothing about the “obscene.” It will be noted that the dispositive quotation says nothing about The Penal Code. It will be noted also, if one looks at the first page of the Majority Opinion that <em>Hallmark </em>also said: “It <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>need hardly he added that even if all precensorship of motion picture films were to be held invalid this would not in and of itself affect the right to suppress objectionable films if exhibited, or to punish their exhibitor.”</p>
    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[140,640,1150,486]]]'>Thus, <em>Hallmark </em>is <em>not </em>dispositive of Section 528 of The Penal Code. On the contrary <em>Hallmark </em>says that The Penal Code <em>is alive and effective. </em>In fact, on the second page of the Majority Opinion we find the statement that the indictment in this case “was brought under the statute” of 1939, which is the very statute which <em>Hallmark </em>says is alive. How then can <em>Hallmark </em>kill off Section 528 when the Majority Opinion itself quotes <em>Hallmark </em>as saying that Section 528 is alive?.</p>
    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[139,1138,1148,430]]]'>Moreover, it will be noted that the Majority Opinion has bracketed within the quoted paragraph from <em>Hallmark </em>the phrase “not including <em>Roth &amp; Alberts, </em>which was written later.” Since <em>Roth &amp; Alberts </em>followed <em>Hallmark </em>then this Court is bound by <em>Roth &amp; Alberts, </em>is it not? And what does <em>Roth &amp; Alberts </em>say: It says that the word “obscenity” does not fail to give the public “adequate notice of what is prohibited.”</p>
    <p id="b469-6" data-blocks='[["BL_469.6",469,[138,1580,1149,432]]]'>Upon what, then, does the Majority stand in striking down Section 528? It stands on a platform of enigma and ambiguity, aiming at a target with more will than reason, and then, failing to pierce the objective with logic and precedent, it proceeds with sheer arbitrariness of power to end the career of a statute which has been the champion of decency, the guardian of youth and the upholder of public morals.</p>

    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[262,755,1146,862]]]'>I would respectfully suggest further that the Legislature might assign to an appropriate committee or committees the task of reading opinions of this Court as they are filed so that the General Assembly may be kept informed on what is happening to measures it enacts into law. Such committees might come to the conclusion that occasionally this Court misreads the Legislature’s intentions. I believe that the Court misread the Legislature’s intentions when it interpreted the Act of May 14, 1925, (see <em>Commonwealth v. Cleveland </em>Thompson, <a href="/pa/389/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="389 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1274027" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0382-01">389 Pa. 382</a>) ; I believe this Court misinterpreted Section 701 of The Penal Code of 1939 on the subject of the so-called felony-murder doctrine (see Commonwealth v. <em>Bolish, </em><a href="/pa/381/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="381 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1258899" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0500-01">381 Pa. 500</a> and <a href="/pa/391/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="391 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1276899" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0550-01">391 Pa. 550</a>); and of course, I believe it has badly misread Section 528 of the Act of 1939.</p>
