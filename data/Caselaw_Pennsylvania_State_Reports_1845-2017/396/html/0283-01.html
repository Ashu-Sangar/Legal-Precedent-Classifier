The entire tract is zoned Residential-3, which prohibits the erection of a gasoline station.</p>

After a hearing, the board <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>granted the variance and appellants, taxpayer-owners of real estate in the immediate vicinity, took an appeal to the County Court of Allegheny County. A full hearing was held and after additional testimony had been presented the court sustained the board. This is an appeal from the court’s order.</p>

The rule about granting a variance is well stated in <em>Richman v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/391/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="391 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1276863" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0254-01">391 Pa. 254</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20280" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="137 A.2d 280">137 A. 2d 280</a> (1958) :</p>

He who seeks a variance has the burden of proving justification for its grant. The ‘hardship’ which must be proven must be an ‘unnecessary’, not a ‘mere’ hardship, as well as ‘unique or peculiar to [the property involved] as distinguished from- the impact of the zoning regulations on the entire district’. The fact that an increase or decrease in value will result from the grant or refusal of a variance will not, standing alone, constitute a sufficient hardship.</p>

He testified that he offered it for residential sale and got no takers, and that he even tried offering it at a throwaway price in order to test the market. He said: “A. Well, it has been going on for almost a year, and I offered the property at a ridiculous figure to try to sell it, but they were not interested. And if you have a piece of property which the contractors, recognize to be at a ridiculous figure, they would take it real quick. Q. How much did you ask for it? A. Well, we started at $3500 and had it down to $2500, but nobody was interested. . . . Q. Has it any value for residential purposes that you would put dollars and cents into? A. In my opinion and experience it doesn’t. Q. Does the <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>topography lend itself to any residential use? A.

    <p id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[140,587,1147,649]]]'>The instant case certainly stands on its own bottom. The effect of the zoning ordinance and the development of the area is to destroy the value of these peoples’ land altogether, or at least to the distress level where buying sharks can always be found: that is not real value. It is not a case like <em>Pincus v. Power, </em><a href="/pa/376/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="376 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1246158" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0175-01">376 Pa. 175</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="101 A.2d 914">101 A. 2d 914</a> (1954), where there was basic value but the siren voice of progress made a variance seem a luscious thing to have. Here there is not only no value above a “distinct sacrifice” that is a “ridiculous” figure, but there is no market at all. These people would become land-poor indeed.</p>
