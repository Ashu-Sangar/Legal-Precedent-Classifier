    <p id="b418-4" data-blocks='[["BL_418.4",418,[239,536,1144,530]]]'>We should not be cavalier with such rights, which may be long settled. It is a temptation to look to other states for their solution, as we did when <em>Conneaut </em>was written, but there is now a discernible policy in Pennsylvania. That of a state with ten thousand lakes may be different from ours with only 254, especially if the foreign state lately entered the Union with a state-wide application of its eminent domain. It is less for us than for the Legislature to create another policy if it should seem desirable.</p>
    <p id="b418-5" data-blocks='[["BL_418.5",418,[235,1096,1148,703]]]'>We think that the concept of navigability should not be limited alone by lake or river, or by commercial use, or by the size of water or its capacity to float a boat. Rather it should depend upon whether water is used or usable as a broad highroad for commerce and the transport in quantity of goods and people, which is the rule naturally applicable to rivers and to large lakes, or whether with all of the mentioned factors counted in the water remains a local focus of attraction, which is the rule sensibly applicable to shallow streams and to small lakes and ponds. The basic difference is that between a trade-route and a point of interest. The first is a public use and the second private.</p>
    <p id="b418-6" data-blocks='[["BL_418.6",418,[233,1820,1146,478]]]'>We are of opinion that Sandy Lake is a small lake or pond and is not navigable. As we said in <em>Conneaut: </em>“The use to which the body of water may be put is the true criterion. If the body of water is sufficiently large and deep to serve the public in providing transportation to any considerable extent upon its bosom, it is sufficient to give the public an easement therein, for the purpose of transportation and commercial intercourse.” That is not the case before us.</p>
