I mean if we had another type of history and we saw this record in this child we could assume this was a variant that would not have any significance. . . . [W]e are relying not only on the history that the parents tell us, but the history of the accident, the severity of the blow. This is assuming all this is correct. T'he fact that the child was apparently confused for at <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>least 36 hours. ... It was reported that the child was unconscious, at least in our records, for about a half hour. ...

Q. test in a district where the score of 100 is considered very good. Furthermore, his teacher’s entry on the record concerning his behavior was: ‘Talkative; takes directions well.’ ”</p>

The record further reveals that the medical history as given to the medical witness was not only inaccurate but contrary to the facts as disclosed by the evidence.

It just sounded like that.” . . . “He flew up in the air, hit on the left hand side of the car, flew up in the air, hit come down.

He continued to receive medical care after he left the hospital. Dr. Yale David Koskoff testified that the boy sustained a cerebral contusion, <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>also called a cerebral concussion. Ever since the accident Maxwell has been assailed by night terrors. His mother testified: “Q. Describe that experience at night. A. He gets up at night. Q. About what time of the night? A. Well, he just hits the bed, I would say. He goes to bed between 8:30 and 9 o’clock. About a quarter to 10 he gets up hollering, sits up in bed or either walks around. We just have to take a damp cloth to him and all. It takes sometimes 10 minutes, 15 minutes to pull him out of it. . . . Q. Now, from the time that he came home in August of 1954 to the present day have you observed whether there is any improvement in his condition about these night terrors? A. No. They are getting worse. First they would be maybe one a month. It seems to get worse now as time goes on. He is losing weight over it. I know it. Even with the tonic he takes it doesn’t seem to help. Q. He is still under the care of Dr. Eoskoff? A. Yes, sir.”</p>
    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[264,1379,1149,981]]]'>It appears that the boy will need medical and neurological attention for some years. Dr. Eoskoff testified: “Q. About how long woiild you say it would be before you could honestly professionally say that the boy has no further need for any medical or neurological examination or follow-up? A. I think ideally this child should be under the supervision of a person in the psychological field, not necessarily a psychiatrist but a person trained in psychology. I say easily through his adolescence, to see how he handles his adolescence period as a result of what is now going on with him. Q. Why is that, Doctor? A. First of all, it gives us a follow-up of another several years. And the stresses of adolescence could give him more problems as a result of his present behavioral difficulties. I would like to see this kid go through his adolescence before I would be sure just what is going to happen with him emotionally.”</p>

The amount must not only be greater than that which the Court would have awarded, but so excessive as to offend the conscience and judgment of the Court . . . The imperative test of excessiveness of the verdict is whether it shocks the sense of justice of the Court.”</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[138,980,1148,375]]]'>My sense of justice is not shocked by a verdict of $10,000 for a boy, now only nine years of age, who suffers night terrors and has a brain involvement which may develop into serious complications, not excluding epilepsy. In fact, I am shocked that tliis Court is shocked by a verdict which, I believe, under the circumstances, is actually modest.</p>
    <p id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[139,1367,1149,985]]]'>I am also shocked at the inconsistency of this Court and by that expression I do not mean the contrasting of today’s position with some enunciated principle of years ago. I refer to a decision handed down during this very session of Court, which contradicts what is being done here today. In the case of <em>Elza v.

Today the Majority Opinion affirms the Trial Court wMch declared that the verdict was excessive and orders a new trial. Why should the Court be shocked when the Trial Judge orders a new trial because the verdict is excessive and not be shocked when the Trial Judge orders a new trial because the verdict is inadequate? What is the standard to apply in considering the amounts of verdicts. Does too much of an award shock more easily than too little?</p>
