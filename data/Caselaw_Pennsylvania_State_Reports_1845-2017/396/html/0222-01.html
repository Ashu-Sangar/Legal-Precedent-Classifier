A third indictment charged that on May 19, 1957, he contributed to the delinquency of Marion, and a fourth charged the same offense in respect of a young lad, Donald Meier, aged 15. The sufficiency of the evidence has not been attacked and it is unnecessary that we set it forth at length. It is stated in the opinion of the Superior Court, which is reported at <a href="/pa-super/187/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="187 Pa. Super. 521" data-case-ids="741646" data-case-paths="/pa-super/187/0521-01">187 Pa. Superior Ct. 521</a>. All charges were tried together resulting in a verdict of guilty. Motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment were overruled and the defendant was sentenced on the indictment for rape to imprisonment for not less than two nor more than five years. Sentences on the other indictments were suspended and the defendant was ordered to pay costs. Upon appeal to the Superior Court all judgments of conviction were reversed. We <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>allowed an appeal because of tbe importance to tbe administration of criminal justice of one of the questions involved. However, even though this is an appeal from the Superior Court, the whole proceeding is brought before us and we must consider it. Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 212, §9, par. 4, 17 P.S. §195.</p>
    <p id="b247-3" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[152,699,1149,650]]]'>At the trial police officers were permitted, over objection, to testify in detail as to statements made to them by Donald Meier (in the absence of the defendant) during the course of their investigation. These statements were incriminatory of the defendant and their admission constituted prejudicial hearsay unless they were admitted for some legitimate purpose. The trial court, while carefully ruling that the statements were not admitted to show their truth, nevertheless held them to be admissible on the ground stated by the prosecuting attorney, that they were “facts elucidated in the course of an investigation by the state police”.</p>
    <p id="b247-4" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[149,1367,1151,762]]]'>It is true that this testimony related only to the two charge's of corrupting morals of the minor children and had nothing to do directly with the charges of statutory rape and incestuous adultery. The trial court, in its disposition of the motion for new trial, held that the testimony was not hearsay because it was not offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the statements but “merely to outline to the jury the investigation made by the officer which culminated in the arrest of the defendant”. For support the Court quotes from our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Ricci, </em><a href="/pa/332/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="332 Pa. 540" data-case-ids="1186562" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0540-01">332 Pa. 540</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20404" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 A.2d 404">3 A. 2d 404</a>, in which we said “Whenever the fact that the utterance was made is in issue rather than the truth of what was said, the utterance is not hearsay”.</p>

The trial court also supported the admission of such testimony “because it showed that the <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>officei’ acted in good faith and with reasonable cause”. The good faith or the reasonableness of the prosecution was not in issue either. The policemen were not on trial for their actions and they were not being sued for slander. Hence the fact that the statements were made out of court and out of the presence of the defendant were incompetent and, as the trial court correctly stated, they were inadmissible hearsay to prove the truth of the facts stated. The error was compounded in the charge of the court in which the out-of-court statements of Donald Meier were referred to as “facts”, were repeated in detail, and the jury was informed that they were received “in evidence to show that statements were made on the basis of which this prosecution was initiated”. There was no justification for the admission of these statements and the Superior Court has correctly disposed of the point.</p>

The offense is alleged to have been committed while she was living at White Haven, Pennsylvania. The trial judge excluded the testimony on the ground that defendant is restricted to showing bad reputation in the community in which she lived at the time of the offense. Obviously the evidence, if admissible, was important to the defendant on the charge of statutory rape. The Superior Court has correctly held that the admissibility of such evidence does not depend upon any hard and fast rule in a case where a minor has recently come into the community in which the offense is alleged to have occurred and much must be left to the discretion of the trial judge in this case. That discretion was abused since a rigid application of the rule would, under the circumstances of this case, defeat the right of the defendant to have it <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>considered under the specific provisions of the applicable Act of Assembly of June 24, 1939, P.

In criminal cases there is a continuing presumption of innocence which does not exist in civil cases. Hence, in the latter, although the original burden is upon the plaintiff, the duty of producing evidence may shift from side to side. In a criminal case this situation cannot exist. It is the presumption of innocence which prevents it. The presumption of innocence grew up as a policy of law and is not based upon probabilities at all.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It represents the law’s humane approach to the solution of a dispute which may result iii the loss of life or liberty. Because of this concern the law has ordained that any government which seeks to take from any person his life or liberty has the burden of proving justification for doing so. It is the continuing presumption of innocence which is the basis for the requirement that the state has a never-shifting burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Holgate, </em><a href="/pa-super/63/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="63 Pa. Super. 246" data-case-ids="456968" data-case-paths="/pa-super/63/0246-01">63 Pa. Superior Ct. 246</a>. Since this presumption is with the defendant not only at the beginning of the trial but throughout all its stages, and even while the jury is considering its verdict, it is obvious that no contrary presumption can be indulged. Hence it has been said that all presumptions independent of evidence are in favor of innocence. <em>Watkins v. Prudential Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/315/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="315 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1156742" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0497-01">315 Pa. 497</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20644" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="173 A. 644">173 Atl. 644</a>. <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>It is the law that in a criminal case, unlike a civil case, no binding instruction may be given in favor of the prosecution. This is true whether the evidence upon which the prosecution rests is oral or documentary and is equally true no matter how strong the proof proffered by the prosecution may be. It is because of this never-shifting burden upon the Commonwealth to prove every essential element of the charge it makes against the defendant that it cannot logically be said that the Commonwealth has the burden to prove the presence of such element while the defendant, at the same time, has the burden of proving its absence. Hence, whenever the prosecution relies upon proof that the defendant is present at the commission of the crime, it cannot be said with any show of reason that the defendant, who asserts he was absent, has any burden of proving it.</p>
    <p id="b252-4" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[249,1258,1148,1092]],["BL_253.1",253,[151,379,1149,764]]]'>Although we held in an earlier case that a defendant who offers an alibi is said to have admitted the commission of the crime by someone, including all its essential elements, <em>Fife, Jones and Stewart v. The Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/29/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="29 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="982739" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0429-01">29 Pa. 429</a>, we have long ago discarded that notion. An alibi, in modern jurisprudence, admits none of the proof of the prosecution and specifically denies that the defendant did the criminal act. It is utterly inconsistent, therefore, for courts to hold the prosecution has the burden of proving every essential element beyond a reasonable doubt even where the defendant offers no evidence; but that if he does offer any evidence the prosecution is relieved of the burden to prove that one of the essential elements he challenges. This is equally true of what is called the risk of non-persuasion and of the burden of going forward with evidence. The courts of Pennsylvania have wrestled long and unsuccessfully with this question of burden of proof. Years ago it was error for the trial judge to fail to call to the attention of the jury the na<a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>ture of tlie affirmative defense of alibi and to fail to tell the jury that defendant had the burden of proving it only by a preponderance of the evidence. We have gone so far as to say that this was error even though the defendant made no request for such a charge and during the trial may not have wanted such a charge. <em>Commonwealth v. Stein, </em><a href="/pa/305/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="305 Pa. 567" data-case-ids="1134667" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0567-01">305 Pa. 567</a>, 571, <a href="/citations/?q=158%20A.%20563" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="158 A. 563">158 Atl. 563</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

Both groups of Judges, although they come to contrary conclusions, rely upon our decisions as their authority. Since the trial of the present case Mr. Justice Bell pointed out in <em>Commonwealth v.

Following that suggestion we deem it our duty to set forth explicitly the rule which shall be followed hereafter in this jurisdiction. The Commonwealth has the burden of proving every essential element necessary for conviction. If the defendant traverses one of those essential elements by evidence of alibi, his evidence will be considered by the jury along with all the other evidence. It may, either standing alone or together with other evidence, be sufficient to leave in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt which, without it, might not otherwise exist. It will be the duty of the trial judge to carefully instruct the jury <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>as to the relationship of the evidence of the prosecution and the evidence of the defendant as each bears upon the essential elements of the crime Charged.

      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a> that where a defendant offers proof of an alibi in a criminal case, in order to avoid confusing tbe jury, it is imperative that we <em>direct </em>the trial Judge to <em>omit </em>from his charge any reference to the fact that defendant has the burden of proving an alibi by a preponderance of the evidence, and merely charge the jury <em>substantially </em>as follows: “The Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime of . . . was committed, and that defendant committed or participated in the commission of it. Defendant has offered evidence of an alibi, that is, he offered evidence to prove that he was not present at the place where the crime was committed but was in . . . Defendant’s evidence in support of his alibi, either alone or together with any other evidence in the case, may be sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of defendant’s guilt. If you have a reasonable doubt of defendant’s guilt you must of course acquit him.”</p>
