Lupi.purchased several drinks, (one for Joe Keenan); and placed a twenty dollar bill on the bar. He then went to the lavatory. On his return to the barroom, Joe Keenan, who had in the meanwhile absorbed the drink which Lupi had purchased from the Keenans for a Keenan, struck Lupi on the head. He then threw his arm around Lupi’s neck, dragged him outside and <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>hurled him to the pavement. Here he jumped on him, pinned his arms to his side, and rained blows in his face. Keenan, Sr., followed Iris son outside to the pavement and when he saw that someone was making an effort to pull Joe off Lupi, he ordered him away. “Don’t interfere with my son,” he commanded. And the beating continued.</p>

The men scuffled and wrestled, but Lupi knew he was getting the worst of it, and he tried to get away. Testifying later he said: “A. I was wrestling with Joe; 1 was trying to get away from Joe. I had enough. I knew I couldn’t take any more. Q. Had enough of what? A. Of the beating. I just wanted to get my money and go home.”</p>

A factual controversy has been fairly tried and fairly concluded. The evidence sustains the verdict. The Majority Opinion of this Court quotes the trial judge as saying that the “plaintiff failed to ‘describe, picture, or visualize what actually happened.’ ” This is a strange statement coming from the trial judge who, in charging the jury, had no trouble in describing, picturing, and visualizing what happened. In his charge the trial judge said: “The plaintiff further says that he got to his feet, that he wanted to go home and that he <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>said to Keenan ‘Give me my money, give me my change’, which he says he had left on the bar after having given the bartender a twenty-dollar bill to pay for certain drinks he had bought, and which he had not picked up and put in his pocket; he says that Keenan, Jr., refused to give him the money, that he did not have any money coming to him; the plaintiff says that he attempted to go back into the barroom to get it and that Keenan, Jr., prevented him and that, in the struggle he was, to use his words as I recall them, he backed into the window in such a way that his arm was cut.”</p>

Later on, the trial judge said to the jury: “So that we come to a very simple question here: How did this man’s arm get hurt; if it was hurt the way he said it was hurt, he has a right to recover but if he was hurt as the defense says he was hurt, no matter how pitiful a thing this is, — he has no right to recover.”</p>

Lupi said his arm was crippled because Joe Keenan violently threw him out of the taproom, beat him, punched him, and then, as he was trying to defend himself, pushed him into a glass window. The defendants’ story is that Lupi was evicted from the taproom, that the door was closed on him, and that somehow he drove his fist through the window.

The Majority, I suppose, refers to the bartender as one of these seven witnesses, but it will be noted that the bartender’s testimony, as quoted in the very Majority Opinion, is very vague and inconclusive. The bartender testified: “I believe he [Keenan] was inside when I heard the crash and I thought someone had thrown a bottle through it [the window] or something.”</p>

Then he said “I thought someone had thrown a bottle through it” [the window]. No one in the whole trial suggested that Lupi threw a bottle. And then, on the summit of this objective reliability, which seems so very much to have impressed the Majority, the bartender added the shining capstone of convincement— “Or something.”</p>

Where was the crash? A. <em>So I didn’t know what happened. </em>There was a crash and I looked up and I saw Mr. Keenan, Joe, Jr., and about a few minutes after that someone came running in and he said there was a boy out there bleeding to death, so I ran out and this young boy here. . .”</p>

The testimony of the three persons who said that they saw the plaintiff put his fist through the window was exceedingly suspect, and the jury could well have been justified in disbelieving it. One of these witnesses, Jacob Hartzell, could have been biased in favor of the defendants since he was a tenant of the defendants at the time of the trial. Nor was the testimony of Richard Taylor easy to believe. He said that when he was some 30 feet away from Keenan’s tavern (this was at night) he saiv Lupi standing alone and that suddenly Lupi put his fist through the window. Hartzell said that no one else was around. The evidence is overwhelming that other people were present.

The jury could further reject as unacceptable the theory that Lupi, a <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>young man in possession of his faculties, would suieidally thrust his arm into mangling plate glass.

Ruckert </em>case the defendant was charged with having negligently driven his automobile into a pedestrian and killing him. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. The trial judge in ordering a new trial pointed out that the defendant was clearly guilty of having run down the pedestrian since he had entered “a plea of guilty in the Court of Quarter Sessions to a charge of hit and run growing out of the same accident.” The evidence showed that the decedent, a 71-year old man, was walking along the berm of a country road when he was run down by the defendant who struck him with such violence that the body was hurled 40 feet. The verdict of the jury in that case was so utterly contradictory to the evidence and so entirely unsupportable that the trial judge almost fell out of his chair with astonishment when it was announced. The trial judge graphically described his reaction as follows: “When the jury’s verdict, at the time of its rendition, causes the trial judge to lose his breath, temporarily, and causes him to almost fall from the <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>bench, then it is truly ‘shocking to judicial conscience’ . . . That is the effect the jury’s verdict had on the trial judge in the present case, and we. can truly say it was the first such shock so experienced in almost ten years of trial experience on the bench.”</p>

However, there can be no doubt in my mind that the figure of Justice totters on her pedestal as she sees the action of this Court requiring the plaintiff Lu-pi, all so unnecessarily, to undergo the ordeal of another tidal, of once more being hit on the head, again being thrown into the street, again being beaten, again being denied his own money, again being pushed violently into mutilating glass, again watching the blood spurt from an arm now rendered useless for life, and again wondering and worrying whether the Court will allow him to keep the verdict which a jury may award him. The figure of Justice may well be shocked that a new trial should be ordered on the supposed authority of a past decision where the facts were as different from the ones in the present case as a church is from a beer saloon where twenty-dollar bills are accepted but never changed.</p>
