One of the improvements on the condemned portion of appellees’ tract was a multiple dwelling which dwelling was relocated subsequently by appellees on a portion of their land which was not condemned.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.8",548,[231,967,1145,425]]]'>The parties being unable to agree on the amount of damages, viewers were appointed, and the viewers awarded $57,000 to the appellees. An appeal from this award was taken by the Commonwealth to the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County and a jury trial resulted in a verdict in appellees’ favor in the amount of $55,650. From the refusal of a new trial the Commonwealth has taken this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b548-6" data-blocks='[["BL_548.9",548,[227,1405,1147,706]]]'>At the pre-trial conference in the court below, the Commonwealth contended that the measure of damages should be the difference between the value of the entire 20.3 acre tract before the condemnation, including all buildings situated thereon, and the value of the remaining tract after the condemnation, including the multiple dwelling as relocated by appellees. A written offer of proof of such values was submitted at trial and refused, and the jury was instructed that the multiple dwelling was to be considered in fixing the value of the land prior to condemnation, but was to be excluded from its consideration in determining the value of the remaining uncondemned portion of appellees’ land.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[239,861,1148,872]]]'>With the “taking” by the Commonwealth of appellees’ land it acquired title, subject to appropriate compensation therefor, to all the improvements thereon, including the multiple dwelling.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Upon the' “taking” the owner-appellees acquired the right to be compensated for the difference in the value of their land, including the improvements thereon, <em>immediately </em>before and <em>immediately </em>after the “taking”; such right to compensation was not subject to qualification by the fact that between the time of taking and the time of actual construction of the limited access highway the multiple dwelling had been removed to another location on the uncondemned portion of their land. To hold otherwise would be to ignore well-recognized and established rules in eminent domain proceedings and would add ■ confusion in an already complicated field of the law.</p>

The Commonwealth, however, does not lack a remedy in this situation. The owner-appellees are subject to an action in trespass for the removal of the multiple dwelling, title to which had <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>been acquired by the Commonwealth. Furthermore, if, as the owner-appellees contend, the Commonwealth had agreed to the removal of the building — denied by the Commonwealth — the Commonwealth would have an action for the fair value thereof. In discussing this issue the court below correctly stated: “Most assuredly the Commonwealth has a remedy for recouping the value of the apartment house which the [appellees] removed from within the right-of-way, and counsel were so advised at the pre-trial conference. If the edifice was removed without authority or permission, an action of trespass would lie. If there was an agreement for removal, but no price agreed upon, then a recovery could be had on the quasi-contractual theory of quantum valebat. We need not consider the situation where a fixed price was involved, because the Commonwealth does not contend that such conditions existed here.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

If appellees’ action in removing this multiple dwelling after the “taking” has resulted in a loss to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth has its remedy to recoup such loss. On the other hand, to permit the establishment and the recoupment of such loss in this condemnation proceeding would be not only contrary to our salutary and well-established “before” and “after” rule but would be productive of an impractical and unworkable measure of damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
