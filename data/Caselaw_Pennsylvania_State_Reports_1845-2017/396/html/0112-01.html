A jury may not eliminate pain from wounds when all human experience proves the existence of pain, and it may not withhold lost wages when the evidence in the case uneontradictedly establishes the loss of wages as the result of the negligence which they, the jury, have adjudicated against the responsible defendant.

The government found, after taking X-rays and making other tests, that Elza did not have that kind of a disablement which entitled him to a pension. Moreover, it is to be noted, which the Majority Opinion also failed to state, that Elza’s claim for a pension was not based alone on an alleged ailing back. The claim was predicated on “fungus condition of ears, back condition November 1943, stomach condition October, 1945, hernia, 1946, and athlete’s foot 1943.” Thus, the so-called back condition was only one item in a list of complaints.</p>

Thus, when Elza was asked at the trial whether he had had any trouble with his back he said that he did not. The United States Government had said that his back was normal, it found that he had no “musculo-skeletal” defect. Was he to enter into a dispute with the finding of the government? Moreover, he had another good reason to believe that he had a strong back in spite of an evanescent discomfort which he felt seven years before.</p>

A structural iron worker must scale girders, climb over beams, swing out into space at the end of a cable, “shinny up columns”, dangle over an abyss of emptiness while driving rivets and bolts.

Of what relevancy, therefore, I would like to inquire, is it whether he had a weak back seven years prior to the accident? He had a good back on April 23, 1953. <em>That </em>is the back which the defendant injured, strained, and disabled. <em>Thai </em>is the back which caused the plaintiff to be hospitalized, <em>that </em>is the back which caused him to walk on crutches for many weeks, and <em>that </em>is the back which compelled him to wear back braces.

Moreover, to haggle over this one week’s pay is sheer waste of time because the lower court, in ordering a new trial, proceeded on the basis that he was entitled only to eleven weeks’ lost wages, the period admitted by the defendant. The wrangle over whether the plaintiff was disabled eleven weeks or thirteen weeks amounts to counting seeds in a watermelon since the <em>defendant’s </em>own medical expert testified that even a <em>fifteen-week </em>incapacitation after the injuries described would not be an unreasonable period for the plaintiff to remain away from work.</p>
