The jury’s verdict was for the defendant. Plaintiffs’ motion for new trial was based on instructions to the jury which, the plaintiffs contend, amounted, erroneously, to binding instructions for the defendant. The court below refused the motion for new trial and directed the entry of judgment on the verdict. The plaintiffs have appealed. It is a well settled principle of law that the granting or refusal of a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and this Court will not reverse the trial court unless the record shows that this discretion was clearly and palpably abused. <em>Streilein v.

Both parties filed an agreed statement of facts in lieu of printing the Record. From that statement we learn that a fire hydrant in front of the plaintiffs’ premises ■had been struck and damaged by an automobile truck, necessitating its removal and replacement by employees of the city’s water department. In order to replace the broken hydrant, it was necessary for the workmen to excavate around it to a depth sufficient to reach the connection between the hydrant and the water main. •The work was not completed on the first day, and when the city’s employees returned on the morning of the <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>second day the premises of the plaintiffs were flooded with water, causing substantial damage.</p>

Plaintiffs contended and introduced evidence to prove: (1) that the repairs were not adequately made so that the hydrant leaked during’ their course; (2) that, at the close of the work day the hydrant was not properly shut off; and (3) that no adequate precautions were taken at the close of the work day to assure that the condition in which the hydrant was left, assuming it to have been proper, was not disturbed.</p>
    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[229,1265,1148,701]]]'>There was conflicting testimony as to whether water was still leaking from the hydrant when the employees of the City left for the day, and as to whether there was water in the excavation made by the City. The damage to plaintiffs’ premises admittedly could have been found by the jury to have been caused during the night following the City’s first day’s work when water from the hydrant leaked into the ground floor of the plaintiffs’ property. The Trial Judge carefully reviewed all the evidence in his principal charge to the jury. The jury returned for further instructions and it is the Judge’s replies to these inquiries which are the basis for this appeal.</p>

It is, therefore, with no diminution of admiration for his juristic attributes that I conclude that in this case he was in error. This conclusion is certainly no reflection on his laudable trial record, because it will be remembered that even Homer nodded.</p>
    <p id="b330-7" data-blocks='[["BL_330.8",330,[221,1198,1148,818]]]'>The issue in the trial was a simple one. A fire hydrant in front of the premises owned by the plaintiffs was struck by an automobile and sheared off at ground level, bringing to the children in the area the joy of a gushing geyser and to their parents the threat of an inundation. The City hurried to the aqueous scene with its workmen who shut off the valve on the water main servicing the hydrant and then proceeded to make the complete repairs necessary to restore water service. Since they could not complete the job by nightfall, they reopened the valve in the main, closed the valve leading to the hydrant and departed for their homes, apparently satisfied that all would be well until the following morning when they would return to complete their operation.</p>
    <p id="b330-8" data-blocks='[["BL_330.9",330,[221,2029,1145,318]],["BL_331.1",331,[178,362,1145,101]]]'>However, during the night the plunging waters in the pipes broke their bondage and flooded the basement of the premises belonging to the plaintiffs who brought suit against the City of Philadelphia for the damages they suffered.

    <p id="b331-3" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[178,471,1147,875]]]'>The City denied negligence and the cause came to trial. After the issue had been submitted to the jury for deliberation and verdict, the jury returned to the courtroom to ask the Judge two questions. We are concerned only with the second question, namely, “Does taking sufficient care mean guarding against a third party tampering with the fire hydrant?” The Court answered: “The city would not be expected and could not be required to have some guard stand there all night and see that nobody disrupted or interfered with what they had done. What duty the City, however, would be required to do would be to reasonably protect and warn people from going near it by putting up the barricades, setting up the lights.

Then the following ensued: The Court: “You may have it. That is what I think about the law. If I am wrong, why I will have to be corrected. You are not suggesting the City ought to put a policeman there all night, are you?” Mr. Bank: “No, sir. But I am suggesting the stem or the fire hydrant could have been capped off so nobody could touch it.” The Court: “I do not agree with that, members of the jury. I believe that stem could be and is protected in the barrel. It is underground. It is covered by a board. In my opinion, the City did everything it should under those circumstances, and the valve that eventually was put in place and set, and was set throughout according to the testimony of the City’s witnesses, was set after noon, because they said they dug in their shoes, without boots, because there was no water in there.

    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[232,529,1148,762]]]'>It must be obvious here that by these instructions the Court took the whole question of negligence away from the jury. In his main charge the Judge had said that the City was required <em>“to </em>exercise due care in making the repairs in order not to injure the property of others.” Did the City use due care? Until the Judge answered the question put by the jury, the problem of due care was to be solved by the jury. However, after the Judge spoke, the jury had nothing to say about due care, it had nothing to say at all about the case. The Judge spoke for them when he said: “The City would not be expected and could not be required to have some guard stand there all night and see that nobody disrupted or interfered with what they had done.”</p>

If the danger was great, if the surrounding area could be flooded to a depth which might endanger life, it would certainly have been the duty of the City to post a guard.- If there had been a fire at this point and shaky walls had been left standing, the City would certainly have been required to station a fireman or policeman there to see to it that no third persons tampered with the walls, imperiling people and property in the area.</p>
    <p id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[226,1908,1146,421]]]'>The Judge said that if the City put up barricades and set up lights, that that would be enough to disobligate the City from responsibility for any ensuing damage, but the City could barricade and light up the hydrant spot and still be negligent because it would be a question for the jury as to whether the barricade and lights had been properly installed and were adequate under all the circumstances.</p>

      <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>But the Judge went further. With great respect I say that he waded deeper into error when he said: “In my opinion, the City did everything it should under those circumstances.” If the City did everything it should under the circumstances, that was the end of the case. When a jury comes into the courtroom and asks for specific instructions, and the Judge tells them that the defendant has done all that can be expected of it under the circumstances, there is only one thing for the jury to do and that is to render a verdict for the defendant, which the jury here promptly proceeded to do.</p>
    <p id="b333-3" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[185,1024,1147,706]]]'>The Judge did not say that his opinion was not binding on the jury. Categorically he said that it was his opinion the City was not liable. He emphasized his view when he said: “That is what I think about the law. If I am wrong, why I will have to be corrected.” Since no one stood up and corrected the Judge at that point, the jury could well conclude that the Judge stood uncorrected. It is unnecessary to add that the jury had no reason to assume that the correction had to come from an appellate court. Even so, it was bound by what the Trial Judge said to them and not what they might imagine, speculate, and guess as to what an appellate court would do, many months later.</p>
