The druggist, Mr. Wallfield, had come from the back to the front of the store and was behind the soda fountain chopping ice when, noticing Green in the rear of the fountain, he ordered Green to get from behind the fountain. Green without further ado shot Mr. Wallfield in the abdomen. Green and the other boys then ran out of the store. No money was taken by them from the store. Mr. Wallfield was later removed to a hospital where he died the same day of the gunshot wound. The gun was found in the backyard of Walker’s home under a pile of debris.</p>

The instant petition for a change of venue was based upon the publication of certain newspaper articles concerning the homicide, the recent death of another druggist under similar circumstances and certain activity of the Retail Druggists Association of Philadelphia condemning the occurrence of such crimes. The Commonwealth having filed an answer, the court below took testimony and the testimony, very meager, revealed that three Philadelphia newspapers had published news articles concerning the crime at or about the time of its commission, that the Mayor of Philadelphia had appointed a three man commission to study juvenile delinquency without any mention of this particular offense, that the Retail Druggists Association was aroused because of the killing of Mr. Wallfield and a Mr. Viner, both retail druggists, and that the District Attorney, allegedly, stated his disbelief of Green’s age. The court below very properly dismissed the petition. When we consider the entire absence of <em>any </em>proof whatsoever of bias or prejudice on the part of the three judges who acted as triers of the facts, the appellant pleaded guilty to this felony murder and that appellant utterly failed to offer any proof “that there is a combination against [Green], instigated by influential persons, by reason of which <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>he [could] not obtain a fair trial”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the court below could not have done otherwise than refuse a change of venue.

The record demonstrates the complete lack <em>of </em>merit in such contention. When the written confession was introduced during the direct examination of Detective Hammes appellant’s counsel made no objection whatsoever. On the other hand, appellant’s counsel not only conceded the absence of any duress in securing this confession but emphasized the voluntary nature of the confession so that the court might be impressed by the fact that Green made no effort to hide the crime. The objection now made that Green, a 15 year old boy, was not <em>specifically </em>warned that he might incur the death penalty, although he was warned that he was charged with murder and robbery and that anything he said would be used against him, does not render inadmissible a written confession of guilt concededly made voluntarily and truthfully.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Cf: <em>Com. v. </em>Smith, <a href="/pa/374/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="374 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="1241485" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0220-01">374 Pa. 220</a>, 232, 233, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.2d%2025" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="97 A.2d 25">97 A. 2d 25</a>; <em>Com. v.

Approximately a month later, represented by the same counsel, Green withdrew his original plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty to murder generally. Prom that time until the time of Green’s <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>resentencing, neither in the court below nor in this Court at the time of the original argument, was there any request or suggestion- on Green’s part that he desired to change once again his plea. At the time of resentencing appellant’s counsel petitioned • for permission to withdraw a plea of. guilty and enter a plea of not guilty; the ground for such request was that he, as counsel, after a conference with Judge Milner, counsel for Crowson and Walker , and an assistant district attorney, “drew the conclusion” that Green’s sentence would be no greater than life imprisonment and that he so advised his client. An examination of the record reveals no misapprehension of facts or law on the part of Green or his counsel, no doubt of the appellant’s guilt, no defense whatsoever to the homicide and certainly no justifiable reason to submit this cause to a jury at this time. Such tactics have no place in the criminal law. As aptly stated by the Commonwealth, appellant now complains because of his “attorney’s mistaken foresight .made clear by the cold realities of hindsight.” .</p>

One judge stated he concurred with the- sentence only with a “great” and “definite” reluctance indicating some reservation on his part as to the propriety of the penalty. A second judge was so strongly in favor of the imposition of the death penalty that he made a <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>statement of record addressed to the Board of Pardons opposing any commutation of the sentence by the. Board, characterizing Green as “mercenary and heart-, less” and expressing the opinion that, since there were “frequent killings by boys of 16, 15 and 14 years of age, and even younger”, the “protection of society urgently demands that they [such youths] be held fully accountable for their vicious actions and that they realize clearly they will no longer be dealt with as mere delinquents.” The third judge, after a recitation of the facts which led to the finding of first degree murder, assigned no other reason why death, rather than life imprisonment, was the appropriate penalty. When Green was resentenced, the third judge then justified the imposition of the death penalty upon the ground that Green was “the most culpable one, the one who was the brutal killer.” The second judge then indicated that he considered Green <em>relatively </em>more culpable morally and possessed of greater hardness of heart than the other two defendants.</p>

      <em>r </em>A famous commentator of the law once wrote: “But by the law, as it now stands, and has stood at least ever since the time of Edward the Third, <em>the capacity of doing ill, or contracting guilt, is not so much measured by years and days as by the strength of the delinquent’s understanding and judgment.”</em>

      <em> </em>(Emphasis supplied). To what extent, if any, did the court below measure the understanding and judgment of this 1 15 year old boy? An examination reveals that Green! had an I.Q. of 80, a dull-normal classification. Beyond his age, the manner of the crime and his I.Q. rating the court below — unless the record contains grave omissions — knew nothing and made no inquiries to determine the background of this boy or what made him “tick.” To the possible argument that Green could have but did not present such evidence, the answer is clear: when a court sits in judgment to determine whether a 15 year old boy who has committed an atrocious crime shall die in the electric chair it is the duty of the court to inquire and exhaust every avenue of information that would inform it of the type of individual represented by that boy. Both the criminal act and the criminal himself .must be thoroughly, completely and exhaustively examined before a court can exercise a <em>sound </em>discretion in determining the appropriate penalty.</p>

Of these things the court below was without knowledge and made no inquiry. It is manifest from this recoiM that two factors only led to the imposition of the death penalty — the manner of the murder and the placation of, what at least one judge conceived to be, the public plaint. The court below in determining the appropriate penalty considered the criminal act, but not the criminal himself and in so doing committed an abuse of discretion. That the criminal act was alone considered is readily seen from an examination of the statements of at least two of the three judges: from the fact that Green was the “trigger man” it was concluded that only the death penalty could be imposed. In arriving at this conclusion no consideration was given to the age, the mentality or the background of Green himself.</p>

An appropriate exercise of judicial discretion as required by the statute contemplates that the death penalty be imposed where <em>all </em>the facts surrounding the criminal act and the criminal actor have been exhaustively considered and where, after such consideration, no other conclusion can be justified than the extermination of the convicted criminal by death.

In the opinion of many experienced persons the death penalty is both wise and necessary for the protection of society and as a deterrent to the crime of murder. It is a fact which is frequently ignored in dealing with dangerous young criminals that 46 out of every 100 arrests for major crimes in Philadelphia in 1957 were of young persons between 13 and 18 years of age (Civic Affairs, May 1958). Moreover, according to the information supplied by the District Attorney of Philadelphia, 55% of all major Grimes committed in Philadelphia in 1957 — murder, arson, rape, robbery, burglary and assault with intent to kill — were committed by persons under 18 years of age. It must be apparent that youthful dangerous criminals can no longer be treated as juveniles.</p>
