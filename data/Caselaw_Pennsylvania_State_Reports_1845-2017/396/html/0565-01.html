Due to an increase in school enrollment the public schools in the area have become seriously overcrowded and approximately 2,000 children are affected by these overcrowded school conditions. For the purpose of building a new high school to alleviate this situation, on August 23, 1956 the seven school districts and a joint school district comprising all seven school districts (herein called joint district) formed a municipal authority, known as the Northampton Area Joint School Authority (herein called Authority).

(herein called Luria) the general contract; John F. Miles (herein called Miles) the heating contract; George F. DeLallo (herein called DeLallo) the plumbing contract; William A. Donmoyer Co. (herein called Donmoyer) the electrical contract. Luria, Miles and DeLallo were so-called “union contractors” in that they employed only union labor, while Donmoyer was a so-called “non-union contractor” in that he employed no union labor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Although appellants urge that the purpose of the picketing was not coercive, but organizational, not a single one of the three employees of Donmoyer during the entire period was ever personally approached, contacted, or requested, either directly or indirectly, by the Union or the Trades Council to join any union. The known effect of the picket line combined with veiled, but nevertheless real, threats of its utilization on the premises of the school district, without even a token attempt on the part of the Union to personally contact or approach the employees it was purportedly seeking to organize, convincingly and clearly reveals that the purpose of the instant picketing was to coerce the employer Don<a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>moyer into the formation of a union shop, a purpose which our prior decisions declare unlawful and as constituting conduct which is properly enjoinable.</p>

Nevertheless, the court below held that such picketing was enjoinable because (1) after the bids had been received and opened but before the contracts were awarded, one Toman, business agent for Bricklayers Local 15 of Allentown, Pennsylvania, (a union in no way involved in this dispute) who is also Vice-President of District 2 of Pennsylvania State Building Trades, (not a defendant in this suit) informed a meeting of the Southampton Area Joint School Authority that he represented the trade unions; that he hoped the contracts would be awarded to union contractors; and, as the <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>court below found, “either stated or intimated that ‘there might be trouble if the union wasn’t satisfied’ ”; (2) Parks, who is a defendant and is a business agent of the defendant union, together with Toman, advised the general contractor, Luria Engineering Company (not a party hereto) that if the Donmoyer Company, a non-union contractor, was awarded the electrical contract there would probably be trouble and there would probably be a picket line when that contracting company commenced working. From these facts the court below has concluded that the purpose of the union was to compel the Donmoyer Company to coerce its employees to join the union.</p>

A mere prediction that there would be trouble, or that there would be a picket line when the non-union men would commence working, is not sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the purpose was to coerce Donmoyer to do anything. No direct or indirect demand was made upon Donmoyer to put his men into the union nor was any direct or indirect demand made upon the employees of Donmoyer to join the union. The only legitimate inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that the union men objected to working along with non-union men; that they believed that they had an interest in the wages and working conditions of both union and non-union men since they were both engaged in the same trade or occupation; and hence were entitled to picket and to attempt to persuade all other union men to refuse to work with the non-union men and thus protect their own economic status. It is immaterial and <em>damnum absque injuria </em>that such self-protection would exert economic pressure upon the employers, the Authority, or both. Such conduct does not become unlawful simply because no strike was ever called or because the work on which the em<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>ployees were engaged was a public school building being constructed by a School Authority.

The Court has no power to enjoin conduct protected by the public policy of the Labor Anti-Injunction Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> It is only necessary, under the public policy declaration of that Act, that the union or its membership has a direct or indirect interest in a “labor dispute” as defined therein and, as I have noted above, a “labor dispute” <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>exists wherever union men have a direct or indirect interest in the employment of non-union men where they are competitively engaged in the same trade or occupation. In my view, therefore, the court below was without power under the evidence in this case to grant a preliminary injunction even though the injunction on its face enjoins conduct not protected by the Labor Anti-Injunction Act. This Court should not be niggardly .in its interpretation of this act for the purpose of finding the case within the exceptions rather than within the coverage. In speaking of the rights of the individual workman the Act provides: . wherefore, though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows, it is necessary that he have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing to negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment, and that he shall be free from the interference, restraint or coercion of employers of labor or their agents in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.”</p>

The Act of March 10, 1949, P. L. 80, art. VII, §752, 24 PS 7-752 provides as follows: “All contracts, hereafter awarded and entered into by any school district, shall contain a clause or stipulation requiring that no person shall be employed to do work under such contract except competent and first-class workmen and mechanics. No workmen shall be regarded as competent and first-class, within the meaning of this act, except those who are duly skilled in their respective branches of labor, and who shall be paid not less than <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>such rates of wages and for such hours’ work as shall be the established and <em>current rates of wages paid for such hours by employers of organized labor </em>in doing of similar work in the district where work is being done.” (Emphasis supplied.) This policy specifically binds a school district; it equally binds authorities, such as herein involved, which are created by one or more such school districts. These union men, therefore, have a direct interest in seeing to it that their own union employers are not put at a competitive disadvantage, thus threatening their own livelihood. The record is silent as to whether Donmoyer paid union scale. Presumably, therefore, the Union was acting lawfully since the plaintiffs, who had the burden of proof, did not produce evidence which would make this Act ineffective in the present case even apart from the Labor Anti-Injunction Act.</p>

County of Door. </em>It is perfectly clear, under the <em>Garmon </em>case, that activities regulated by §§7 and 8 of the Labor Management Relations Act, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7157-8" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §§157-8">29 U.S.C.A. §§157-8</a>, are not subject to regulation by any state administrative agency or equitable injunction in any state or federal court.

      <em> </em>by it, state courts are without jurisdiction to decide the controversy but the matter must be settled by the National Labor Relations Board. Hence, in this case, assuming interstate commerce, the court below was without power to decide if plaintiff or defendant was right. <em>Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em><a href="/us/348/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="348 U.S. 468" data-case-ids="6931860" data-case-paths="/us/348/0468-01">348 U. S. 468</a>, 481. It seems to me that the <em>Door </em>case is on all fours with the present one, even accepting the findings of the court below. There, as here, a municipal corporation hired a general contractor who let out eight individual sub-contracts. Among the successful bidders for one of the sub-contracts was a non-union employer. This disturbed the union which attempted to induce him to sign a union agreement. When he refused the union peacefully <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>picketed and thereby effectively stopped all the work since union members employed by other contractors refused to cross the picket line.</p>

I believe that the majority has reached a wrong result in concluding that the silence of the record in this case on the issue of interstate commerce justifies an affirmance of this preliminary injunction. These decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States were not filed until after the Chancellor had issued his preliminary injunction. Therefore, understandably, he didn’t inquire into the issue of interstate commerce involving this tremendous building operation. It must be decided sooner or later in this case because it involves jurisdiction of the subject matter which may not be conferred by acquiescence of the parties who did not raise it. It is not enough to say that he may make that determination upon final hearing and <em>continue the injunction until that determination. </em>I believe the holdings in these cases require us to remand the matter to him to take testimony forthwith in' the light of those cases and relevant principles governing what constitutes an effect upon interstate commerce.
