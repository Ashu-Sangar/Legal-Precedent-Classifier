Reeser, John Doe, Plumbers, Steamfitters &amp; Apprentices, A.F.L. Local 517, Vincent Zimmers, Richard Roe, to restrain the picketing which was carried on by defendants.

These contracts were for the construction of, and the plumbing, heating and electrical work in, an elementary school for 400 children to be built on the premises owned by the Authority in West Penn Township. In accordance with the Act of May 2, 1945, P.L. 382, §10, as amended, 53 PS §312, contracts had to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. Kline, Waice and the Donmoyer Co. were respectively the lowest responsible bidders.</p>

Tbe Authority has no labor contracts with any labor union. Kline has twenty-nine employees, including carpenters, masons, and laborers, all union members but none a member of a defendant union. Waice has four employees who are plumbers, none of whom is a member of any union. Donmoyer Co. has two employees who are electricians but are not members of any union.</p>

Reeser, business agent or manager for the International Brotherhood, notified the Authority (according to the testimony) that “if they hire nonunion contractors there would be trouble”. Reeser also told the Authority that he was there to have Donmoyer join the union, and that Donmoyer did not pay the prevailing union wages. Reeser also protested, by telegram, any award to Donmoyer because he was a nonunion contractor and did not pay the prevailing wage rates. Defendant Zimmers, prior to the final awarding of the bids, urged the Secretary of the Municipal Authority to reconsider the award of contracts to nonunion contractors and award them instead to union contractors, even though the Act required the Authority to accept the lowest, qualified, responsible bidder. The testimony also showed that Reeser told Donmoyer he was there to have Donmoyer join the union. Zimmers told Waice that if he wouldn’t sign as a union contractor for the West Penn School project “I’ll take the necessary steps to see that you wouldn’t work the West Penn Township job.”</p>

As a result of the picket line, those employees of Kline, the general contractor, who were union members,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> refused to continue working on the school building, and since the general contractor was not able to proceed with his work, the work to be performed by Waice and Donmoyer could not be performed. It is conceded that as a result ox the picketing, all work on the school building has come to a halt and today the school is less than one-third completed. Irrespective of where the fault lies, the picketing has caused very substantial loss of time, money and material to the Authority and to the School District and to Kline and Waice and Donmoyer Co., and was highly detrimental to the welfare of the cMldren and the community of West Penn Township.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">**</a>

As this constituted unlawful picketing within the contemplation of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act, it is of no present relevancy that the picketing may also have been for organizational purposes, as the appellees contend. The picketing should, therefore, have been preliminarily enjoined by the Court below pending final hearing and decree.</p>
