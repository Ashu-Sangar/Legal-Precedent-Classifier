The prosecuting attorney’s cross-examination served as a convenient sounding board upon which was echoed and reechoed the fact that defendant had a criminal record and could not have failed to create a prejudice against defendant in the minds of the jury. If this type of cross-examination is to be condoned and to receive the imprimatur of approval by this Court, neither the clear mandate of the Act of 1911, supra, nor the rigid limitations long and consistently imposed by this Court upon the use in homicide cases of records of a defendant’s prior convictions have any practical significance. The frequent and persistent references to defendant’s past made such past a vital factor in determining defendant’s guilt. We have two alternatives: either to approve this type of cross-examination and thus ignore the Act of 1911 and the many pronouncements of this Court on the subject of the use of records of prior convictions or to disapprove such cross-examination and adhere both to the letter and spirit of the Act of 1911 and our previous decisions.

If the print in the Act of 1925 were placed under a battery of conflicting lights, the resulting shadows could never possibly be interpreted to read what Chief Justice von Moschzisker read into it.

The present Chief Justice, in his dis<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>sent in <em>Commonwealth v. DePofi, </em><a href="/pa/362/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="362 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="477333" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0229-01">362 Pa. 229</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20649" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="66 A.2d 649">66 A. 2d 649</a>, and Justice Musmanno, in his dissent in <em>Commonwealth v. Thompson, </em><a href="/pa/389/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="389 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1274027" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0382-01">389 Pa. 382</a>, 417, <a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20207" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="133 A.2d 207">133 A. 2d 207</a>, and Justice Bell in <em>Commonwealth v.

It is clear, therefore, that at least a majority of this Court believes that this procedure is unfair. It is my firm conviction that experience in the application of the rule during the years which have passed since the Act of 1925 has convincingly demonstrated that this unfair rule ought no longer be followed. It was Mr. Justice Holmes who opened his classic Avork on the Common Laiv by telling us: “The object of this book is to present a general view of the Common Law. To accomplish the task, other tools are needed besides logic. It is something to show that the consistency of a system requires a particular result, but it is not all. The life of the hrw has not been logic: it has been experience.”</p>

Even as a matter of logic the rule has been supported on the grotind that the jury ought to know just Avhat the judge ought to know in pronouncing sentence ; but it must be remembered that upon conviction of murder in the first degree prior to 1925 there was no discretion on the part of a judge to impose a punishment less than death. It did not matter how much or how little he knew of the defendant. Even judges, hearing a plea of guilty, should not know a man’s criminal record until they have first determined the degree of his guilt. Only then, if ever, can that criminal record play its <em>proper </em>part on the question of sentence without the necessarily attendant uncertainty as to whether it plays an <em>improper </em>part on the issue of guilt or innocence. It was tMs Court which created that rule only 34 years ago; it is this Court which should <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>now abandon it. Stare decisis is one of tbe great principles of jurisprudence but its. application here would be unjust. I join with Justice Musmanno in Ms concurring opinion.</p>

It was apparently not argued in the court below and was not presented to us; but in my view, it is too fundamental to be disregarded. <em>Commonwealth v.

The respective functions of the court and jury are carefully stated therein.

Where the defendant pleads guilty the court “shall, at its discretion, impose sentence of death or imprisonment for life”. In this case the trial judge correctly charged the jury as follows: “If you conclude that the defendant is guilty of murder of the first degree a further duty rests upon you, and that is of fixing the penalty. You will have to, if you come to such a conclusion, state in your verdict whether he shall suffer death in the manner provided by law or undergo imprisonment for life.”</p>

The record then states “The foreman of the jury read the verdict of said jury, finding the defendant guilty of murder of the first degree, and recommending the death penalty”. A separate entry says that “Upon request of counsel for defense the jury was polled, and each juror when his or her name was called, stated that he or she had found the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree with the death penalty”. This latter entry, however, does not purport to contain the exact language of the court officer or the response of each member of the jury. We must look at the formal verdict specifically placed of record and signed by its foreman. That is as follows: “And now, to-wit: June 21, 1957¿ we, the Jurors empaneled in the above entitled case, find Robert Tallie Davis guilty of first degree murder and recommend the death penalty. Roy G. Westwood, Foreman”. The court below, in its opinion, reciting the proceedings in the case, says: “Upon trial of the case the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree, with the recommendation of the death penalty.” Upon that “verdict”, after overruling motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, neither of which concerned it<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>self with, the present point, the court sentenced the defendant to death.</p>

It merely “recommended” the death penalty: it did not fix it. It showed no consciousness that its decision was irrevocable as it is under our law. The statute provides: “The court shall impose the sentence <em>so fixed, </em>as in other cases.” But the trial jury fixed no sentence; it merely recommended it. To whom was this recommendation made? Certainly not the trial judge, because he had no power to act upon a recommendation. His duty as to the imposition of sentence is purely ministerial. Certainly not to this Court, for we have denied to ourselves, mistakenly I think, the right to modify a death penalty fixed by a jury. <em>Commonwealth v. Carluccetti, </em><a href="/pa/369/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="369 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1232336" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0190-01">369 Pa. 190</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20391" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="85 A.2d 391">85 A. 2d 391</a> (1952); <em>Commonwealth v. Simmons, </em><a href="/pa/361/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="361 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="476381" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0391-01">361 Pa. 391</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20353" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="65 A.2d 353">65 A. 2d 353</a> (1949). The recommendation by the jury of a death sentence is a decision completely unknown to our law and should not have been received by the court nor acted upon. The jury did not exercise its sole “discretion”; it passed it on, or at least shared it, with others. If on a plea of guilty the court determined that the homicide was murder of the first degree and entered an order “recommending” the death penalty, surely such a finding could not be accepted by this Court. Nor could the Governor of the Commonwealth accept it as the basis for a warrant of execution. Yet there is no difference between that situation and the present one. It seems to me that a decision which spells the difference between life and death must avoid the least possible uncertainty. I agree that it may reasonably be argued that the jury’s recommendation may <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>have been meant by them to be tantamount to a “fixing” of the penalty; but I insist that it may also be argued that the jury was recommending the death penalty in the belief that some power existed elsewhere to accept or refuse such recommendation. The point I make is that the meaning of the jury’s “true deliverance” must not be made the subject of reasonable debate; it must be put beyond differences of opinion.</p>

We correctly held that this was not the same thing as fixing the death penalty; but in that case we said that the situation was cured by virtue of the fact that the crier, in repeating his understanding of the jury’s verdict, used the word “fix” instead of “recommend” and the jury assented. Believing, as I do, that the trial judge should not have left such an important matter to the crier, I do not agree with the reasoning in that case; but in any event, it is no authority for what was done here.</p>
