Tarr and William Killeen, the appellants in the Superior Court, were police' officers of the City of Pittsburgh. As a result of a certain incident in which they had been participants in some capacity, each of them was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer. They were tried before a Police Trial Board in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Act of 1951, supra, which is applicable to Second Class Cities. The Police Trial Board found the accused guilty of the charges against them and recommended their dismissal from the City’s service. The recommendation was duly approved by the Mayor. The police officers thereupon severally appealed to the Civil Service Commission of the City from the respective orders of dismissal. The Commission, after hearing, affirmed the recommendations of the Police Trial Board, as approved by the Mayor. Each of the police officers then appealed from the action of the Civil Service Commission to the County Court of Allegheny County. See Act of September 29, 1951, P.

Even this restriction on the Superior Court’s issuance of writs of mandamus and prohibition for purely ancillary use is further confirmation of the fact that the Superior Court does not possess the powers of King’s Bench in general which include the power to issue common law writs of <em>certiorari. </em>It follows, therefore, that the Superior Court is without authority to review the work of an inferior tribunal as on <em>certiorari </em>where no right of appeal to that court is conferred by statute. <em>Walker’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/294/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="294 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1113405" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0385-01">294 Pa. 385</a>, 388, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20288" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="144 A. 288">144 A. 288</a>.</p>

For uniformity, no doubt, the Superior Court adopted this court’s appeal form for directing a lower court to send up for review the record, there pending, in an appealed case. Such form, called a certiorari, is but the means used for initiating appellate review in any instance and is not the common law writ of <em>certiorari </em>issued under the King’s Bench powers which this court alone is authorized to exercise in this State. In fact, the Act of June 24, 1895, P.

It did not in any way obliterate the characteristics of the several writs or the scope of appellate review afforded by each. In <em>Rand v.

The use in Section 7(e) of the word “criminal”, in defining the type of cases to which its provision was to be applicable is superfluous and of no effect. That is plainly evident. The immediately preceding Sections 7(a) and (b) of the Act of 1895, supra, respectively conferred appellate jurisdiction on the Superior Court in proceedings in the court of quarter sessions and in the court of oyer and terminer except cases of felonious homicide.

If the objection is made, the Superior Court shall hear and decide it speedily, and if it is sustained and the appeal is certified to the Supreme Court the prothonotary of the Superior Court shall, in addition to the appeal costs already paid, be paid by the appellant the sum of three dollars as further costs in the cause.” Here, likewise, no additional jurisdiction of subject matter is created.

Nevertheless, the court forthwith assumed jurisdiction on the basis of Section 11 of the Act of 1899, supra, saying, in that connection, that “This defect [want of jurisdiction in the Superior Court] was called to the attention of counsel at the bar of this Court, and appellee expressly waived objection to our jurisdiction. Accordingly, we have decided the appeal.” In other words, a court, which concededly lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, can go ahead and adjudicate the merits. The error of such a proposition is self-evident. Under the rationale of the <em>Rader </em>decision, a case involving the right to a public office, which is cognizable in the first instance in the court of quarter sessions and is, by Section 7(a) of the Act of 1895, made appealable to the Supreme Court, could be appealed to the Superior Court if the appellee failed to object to the jurisdiction. Again, a defendant convicted of murder in the first degree could take an appeal to the Superior Court and, unless the district attorney filed with the prothonotary objection to the jurisdiction of the court, the prosecuting attorney would be held to have waived his objection to the jurisdiction and the Superior Court would proceed to hear and decide the matter although Section <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>7(b) of the Act of 1895 expressly provides that cases of felonious homicide shall be appealed directly to the Supreme Court.</p>

The same would be equally true where the parties stipulate, under Section 7(e) of the Act of 1895, as to the appellate jurisdiction to be invoked, unless that provision be held applicable only when the Superior Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter but is prevented from exercising it because of the amount in controversy.

The Superior Court, conceding the limitation on its power to review the quarter sessions’ orders on <em>certiorari, </em>dismissed the appeals in the <em>MeGettigan Case. </em>That case is, therefore, non-decisional as to what the Superior Court’s jurisdiction to review would have been had the Liquor Control Act been silent with respect to an appeal from the order of the court of quarter sessions. True enough, there are dicta in the opinion for the Superior Court which imply that, in such circumstances, that court would have reviewed the proceedings on the merits.

The Superior Court is not clothed with such powers and is, therefore, without jurisdiction to review the proceedings of a lower court on <em>certiorari. </em>The Superior Court’s appellate jurisdiction rests exclusively in direct appeal to it when expressly authorized by statute.

In all those years they have never been insubordinate, they have never flinched from danger, they have never failed to measure up to what is expected of a good police officer.

He must also carry the side arms of daring, initiative, and aggressive resourcefulness if he is to successfully fight bandits, burglars, thieves, and other malfeasors of the underworld who are formidably equipped and trained to wage their ungodly war against society.

The cumulative dangers and hardships which these three men of the law have sustained over a collective incumbency of 61 years entitle them to a showing of kindness which they have undoubtedly often displayed toward others, in entire keeping with the majesty of the law and the dignity of man, which, all combined, make America the land of true and understanding justice.</p>

      <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>The legislature, when it gave to the Superior Court in 1895, exclusive and final appellate jurisdiction of all “appeals” which were there allowed to the Supreme Court in the enumerated classes of cases, did not mean thereby to exclude review by it on writ of error or certiorari. In view of the fact that in 1889 the legislature preserved review in all three specified modes, by using the word “appeal” to cover all of them, there is no reason to believe it intended any different meaning to be attached to the word “appeals” when it used it six years later in 1895. I believe that where the legislature specifically provides for an appeal in any case falling in any of the specifically enumerated classes provided for by the Act of 1895, as amended, the Superior Court may afford appropriate review whether it be by writ of error, appeal or certiorari, in the same way as this Court previously had jurisdiction to do. However, the Act of August 10, 1951, P.L. 1189, 53 P.S. §23537, et seq., under which the present proceeding was brought, as noted above, neither authorizes nor forbids any appeal from the County Court and although under the Act of March 2, 1923, P.L. 3, §1, 17 P.S. §187, a review of all<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> appealable proceedings of the County Court of Allegheny County is given to the Superior Court no right'of appeal is thereby given in any particular case.

In an able discussion the court held that it had statutory power to review by certiorari even though an appeal in cases of criminal contempt is not specifically authorized. This Court entertained an appeal which is reported <em>sub nom Kelly’s Contested Election, </em><a href="/pa/200/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="200 Pa. 430" data-case-ids="924394" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0430-01">200 Pa. 430</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.%20248" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="50 A. 248">50 A. 248</a>.

Thus it is seen that for twenty-four years the Superior Court, without attempted correction by this Court, consistently exercised the right to review the orders of inferior courts by <em>narrow certiorari. </em>And then, by the Act of April 18, 1919, P.L. 72, 12 P.S. §1165, the legislature for the <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>first time created in any appellate court the right to review by what is now called <em>broad </em>certiorari.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a>

This is the very act invoked by this Court in the assertion of its own power to review by broad certiorari. Without it we would have no such right. No serious contention can be made that the specific inclusion of the Superior Court along with this Court was meaningless. Presumably the legislature had full knowledge of the consistent position taken by the Superior Court since its creation in the cases cited in this opinion. The need was felt that both appellate courts should not be restricted to “certiorari to review the regularity of the proceedings in the court below”. Where an appeal is specifically allowed all three modes of review are open. Therefore this enlarged scope of review obviously was intended to apply in the class of cases where appeals tvere neither authorized nor forbidden, otherwise there would have been no reason to provide that the testimony would be considered “with like effect as upon an appeal from a judgment entered upon the verdict of a <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>jury in an action at law . .'Since the Act of 1919 both this Court and the Superior Court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a> have reviewed by broad certiorari cases within their respective competence where the statute neither- authorizes nor forbids an appeal. It is to be noted that these cases are not all liquor license cases as the majority opinion indicates.

He there encountered a man who excitedly told him that Ms automobile had been stolen and that he was trying to get a policeman to do something about recovering his ear. It would appear that angry words were exchanged between the man and Killeen in which the man addressed Killeen by name, whereupon Killeen, without any apparent justification so far as the record discloses, assaulted the man and beat him severely with his night stick. Killeen then took the man to the police call box which was close by and called for a police wagon. About the time the patrol wagon arrived at the scene another police officer, George Tarr (with fifteen and a half years of service on the police force of the city) arrived and stood approximately twenty-five feet from the call box. In addition to the patrol wagon crew and some civilians who quickly gathered, Acting Lieutenant Joseph Bell (with twenty-eight years of experience on the police force of the city) arrived at the scene, got into the patrol wagon which then departed for the Allegheny General Hos<a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>pital so that medical attention could be given to the injured man. Prior to its departure, Killeen had advised the wagon men to “book” the man on a disorderly conduct charge. At the hospital, where the injured man was given first aid, he gave his name as Joseph Morro (as shown by the Aided case report). He gave the same name to the wagon officers. After he was treated the officers then took him to the desk sergeant at No. 1 police station where he was slated for disorderly conduct under the name he had given. This Aided case report was later signed by Bell, the acting lieutenant. The prisoner then, in accordance with the usual custom, posted a $10 cash bail to appear for a hearing in the morning. Killeen having gone about his duties in the meanwhile, appeared at the time fixed for the hearing. When the defendant did not appear his bond was directed to be forfeited by the magistrate and no hearing on the charge has ever been held. After the forfeiture Killeen was informed by someone at the police station that the man he had arrested was in reality Tony Grosso. On July 9, 1957, a newspaper reporter of the Pittsburgh Sun Telegraph, named Chester Harris, an experienced police reporter and rewrite man, received information from his night city editor that Tony Grosso, a numbers racketeer, had been beaten by patrolman <em>George Tarr </em>and he commenced an investigation.</p>

Harris thereafter talked with Killeen who admitted that he had struck Tony Grosso claiming, however, that he had the impression that Grosso was preparing to attack him and that he was justified in striking him with his fist. Although Harris testified that Grosso was reputed to be one of the biggest numbers racketeers <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>in Pittsburgh and was known to him as such for ten or fifteen years, he made it perfectly clear that Killeen, although he spoke of the man he arrested as Tony, did not say that he knew at the time he arrested him that his name was Tony or that it was Tony Grosso. Grosso, in fact, was a resident of a township in Allegheny County known as Mt. Lebanon Township and had not been arrested in Pittsburgh at least for a great number of years although he had been arrested in other places in Allegheny County and had used not only his real name, Tony Grosso, but also as aliases: Anthony Grassi and Joseph Russo. It would appear that Officer Foley, the driver of the patrol wagon, with fifteen years service; Officer Moceika, with ten years service; Sergeant Caplan, with eighteen years of service, the Acting Sergeant at the police desk at No. 1 Police Station, with eight years of service; and the Turnkey at No. 1 Police Station (otherwise unidentified) had not known the identity of the man at the time of the arrest.</p>

He there observed one Tony Grosso, a known gambler and numbers operator.” But there is nothing in the testimony to show that at that time Killeen knew who Grosso was. There is no showing whatever that Grosso was known to anyone in that neighborhood, was himself familiar with it, or that he had spent any time around it or that there was any reason whatever for Killeen to know his identity. The court makes a finding of fact that “Grosso reported to Killeen that his car had been stolen. Words were exchanged between Killeen and Grosso and Killeen hit Grosso several times with his night stick”. So far as this finding rests upon an assault committed by Killeen upon <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>Grosso it has no relevance whatever to the central question whether Killeen knew that it was Grosso whom he hit. It was well within the province of his superiors to have charged Killeen with an unjustified assault; but they did not do so. While it is true that specifications need not'be drawn with the niceties applicable to criminal pleading, nevertheless, Killeen was entitled to “notice” of what it was he would be called to defend against. This was his statutory right. We cannot invoke this wholesome rule on behalf of all other citizens and deny it to policemen. This finding, therefore, as a separate ground for dismissal, must be wholly disregarded and under the record in this case has no probative value against him on the only specification that was made. The court’s further finding was “Although Grosso was booked at the police station under the alias of 'Joseph Morro’, Killeen never made any effort to have the incorrect booking changed”. There was not even any evidence that at the time of arrest Killeen knew what name the man would give. Certainly, under the circumstances, the waiting patrol wagon and the desire to have him taken to a hospital for examination, it does not seem legally significant that he would insist on personally getting the name since he knew both the hospital and the patrol wagon crew would get it. The evidence is that he contented himself with merely stating the nature of the charges to be placed against the arrested man, that is, disorderly conduct. Besides, there is no evidence that Grosso would have given Killeen any other name than the one he gave at the hospital and to the patrol crew.</p>

In my opinion the evidence was insufficient to justify the findings made by the court. Furthermore, the court below misconceived its function. It said that the basic question involved in all three appeals is “Did the City have sufficient justification for its action in dismissing the officers and have just cause for said dismissals?” In other words, did the evidence taken before it justify the City’s decision? That was not the question before the court. True it is that under the statute the issue before the court was whether the action of the police trial court (oddly enough not the Civil Service Commission) should be affirmed, modified or dismissed. But in coming to its conclusion the court was required, <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>under the law applicable to removal of policemen in second class cities, to review the case <em>de novo </em>and come to its own conclusion on the basis of the evidence without regard to whether its conclusions differed or accorded with that of the police trial court or the Civil Service Commission. Thus the court misapprehended the full scope of the Act of 1951. In this respect the law applicable to second class cities is different from that applicable to other municipalities. It is not for us to say why this is so or that if we so interpret it we will get more appeals.

Even if it be assumed, however, that he did know that Grosso was being arrested by Killeen there is no evidence that Tarr had any connection whatever with the case after that or knew that Grosso had given the false name “Morro” to the hospital, the wagon crew or to the desk sergeant. Since he did not participate in the arrest it was not his duty to be present on the following day and there is no evidence that it came to the attention of Tarr at any time prior to the investigation by the newspaper reporter, Harris, or the knowledge of the Superintendent of Police that Grosso had misstated his name to be “Morro”. His own evidence that he was not present and the corroborating evidence that he was assigned to a special detail at another place may still be disregarded without leaving any evidence whatever that Tarr had anything to do with the misidentification of Grosso. The fifth finding that “George Tarr told his superior officers that he was not present at the time of the arrest” has not support in the record if it is meant to apply to an investigative phase of the matter since Tarr was not even interviewed. In any event, it is clearly not within the specification relied upon to support the charge.</p>

In addition, it must be noted the City called Bell for cross-examination and he denied that he knew that the man arrested was actually Tony Grosso at any time prior to being told by Harris, the newspaper man. The court apparently found Bell guilty because he had been on the. police force for twenty-eight years and rode in the wagon along with Grosso and did not know his identity. It is true that if Bell knew it was Grosso then he could <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>not justify Ms signing of the record which showed that the prisoner was Morro. Although the County Court found that Bell knew Grosso’s identity, I have searched the record in vain to find support for this statement, unless it be in the bland assumption that any policeman on a metropolitan police force for twenty-eight years knows each and every habitual law breaker at, in or near that community. At the scene of the arrest no name was given. There seems to be no evidence whatever that would charge Bell with knowledge as to the identity of Grosso at any time that would impose an affirmative duty upon him to do something about it.</p>
