As this Court stated in <em>James v. Jarrett, </em>(p. 372) : “The rule deducible from all of [the cases] whose authority is binding on us, is that where a party has a debt against another evidenced by a specialty or a record, and to which no statute of limitations applies, the burden of proving it unpaid is not thrown upon him who claims it, even in a suit brought more than twenty years after it has become <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>payable, if witbin the twenty years a fair effort, though an unsuccessful one, have been made to recover it, by suing out legal process for that purpose. <em>But a former legal proceeding will not be allowed to have this effect if it was instituted for the sole purpose of repelling the presumption} and not in good </em>faith, <em>with the sincere object of recovering the debt claimed. </em>Nor can it be said that the mere impetration of an original writ (I do not speak of a scire facias) without service on the defendant, is the institution of a legal proceeding. The rule must also be understood with this further and very obvious modification, namely, that the suit relied on to repel the presumption of payment must have been commenced before the expiration of the twenty years, and not afterwards . . . because, although the effort to recover a debt is a circumstance strong enough to prevent the presumption from arising, it is not sufficient to repel that presumption after it has acquired the full force which twenty years’ supineness of the creditor would give it.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[252,1471,1146,371]]]'>The crucial issue is: is proof of the issuance of the writs of fieri facias, returned “nulla bona” in 1927 and the issuance of the writs of scire facias in 1942 and 1947, — where the sheriff was expressly directed not to serve the writs — sufficient to bring the present factual situation within the exception in <em>James v. Jarrett, </em><a href="/pa/17/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="17 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="967600" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0370-01">supra?</a></p>

Furthermore, the burden of proving the absence of good faith in the institution of legal process upon a judgment in <em>all </em>instances where the debtor has not been notified of the institution of such legal process, or where a writ of scire facias has been returned “nihil habet” should not be placed on the judgment creditor. A return of “nihil habet” can reasonably support two conclusions: that the debtor could not be found by the sheriff or that the judgment creditor issued the writs to prevent the creation of the presumption of payment.</p>

Our examination of the instant record discloses that the judgment creditor— the appellee — failed to assume and sustain this burden; furthermore, the appellee advanced no sufficient reason why no attempt was made to serve the judgment debtor, particularly where the record indicates that Harry Bess remained in the retail business in the same area during most of the time in question.</p>
