Rather, we may take judicial notice of the historical and ethnic fact that the word “Dutch” itself is wrongly used, since it refers not to the only people who have a right to it, namely, the citizens of The Netherlands, but to those whose ancestors were Swiss or Palatinate Deutsch, or German. It cannot, therefore, follow irresistibly that everything connected with the central Pennsylvania area which loosely uses the word “Dutch” must be of one type and not of another. The Dutch girl and the windmill involved here may depict the local variety or the Netherlands, the German, or the Swiss.</p>
    <p id="b128-4" data-blocks='[["BL_128.4",128,[266,1088,1145,920]]]'>Even without such precision of origin, there are the differences in shape, style, color, size, and arrangement of the restaurants, including the marquees, the windmills, the signs, the Dutch girls, and the shrubbery beds. And in dealing with a colorful and concentrated area such as the “Pennsylvania Dutch country”, the use of the key word, “Dutch”, raises at once the possibility of establishments, if they otherwise resemble each other, being under the same management. It might even be regarded as a word ordinarily belonging to the public but through special local circumstances acquiring a secondary meaning: <em>Golden Slipper Square Club v. Golden Slipper Restaurant &amp; Catering, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/371/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="371 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1237107" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0092-01">371 Pa. 92</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20734" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="88 A.2d 734">88 A. 2d 734</a> (1952).

That issue is peculiarly one of fact, since it represents a congeries of sense perceptions in the traveler. Such an issue rarely lends itself to summary judgment. After the <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>trial and the establishment of the comparative facts, the applicable rules may have to be applied more strictly than they can be at the present stage of the proceedings, when we face nothing more substantial than the impossibility of being dogmatic about factors over which men may disagree.</p>
