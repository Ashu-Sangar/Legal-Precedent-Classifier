A portion of that land was condemned at the instance of the Highway Depart<a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>ment of Pennsylvania. At that time Harry D. Meneher, a New York lawyer, had represented these four corporations. His Pennsylvania correspondent was Rodney T. Bonsall of Philadelphia. Cadwallader represented two persons who were mortgagees of the property, and in order to protect the interests of his clients in the condemnation award, requested that the appearances of Meneher and Bonsall, as attorneys for the owner corporations, be withdrawn and that he be permitted to act for all the parties interested in the proceedings. Meneher and Bonsall, having done work in the matter, indicated, in writing, their willingness to withdraw their appearances if Cadwallader would see to it that professional fees claimed by them, particularly from two of the real estate corporations, would be retained by him and not forwarded to the clients unless specifically released by them. Cadwallader, in writing, specifically agreed to withhold the sum of $34,486.17 ($30,-000 of which was for Meneher and the balance for Bonsall) from the condemnation moneys which it was expected would pass through his 'hands until such fee claim had been satisfactorily adjusted. In consideration of this undertaking Meneher and Bonsall withdrew their appearances.</p>

Meneher commenced suit in the United States Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, setting up the agreement recited above and averring that the condemnation proceeding resulted in an award of not less than $200,000 which was paid over to Cadwallader but that Cadwallader, <em>in violation of his </em>agreement, paid out to the various clients represented by him, exclusive of his own fee, the full sum but did not retain, as he had agreed to do, the funds with which to pay Meneher. Having averred this failure Meneher went on to allege that there was an unlawful conspiracy and collusive arrangement between <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>Oadwallader and Ms clients that they would maliciously circumvent the intent, design and effect of the escrow promise.</p>

Shortly thereafter the insurance company exercised its right under the policy to investigate the situation and sent an interviewer to see Oadwallader who furnished him with a detailed statement showing that the money was mistakenly and negligently forwarded to the clients in violation of the agreement. T-'he insurance company then refused to defend Oadwallader and he was compelled to retain counsel to defend him in the federal court action. Thereafter, the federal court action was settled by the payment of $2,500 to Mencher. In addition, Oadwallader paid his counsel $2,500 for defending him and expended the sum of $50 for a bond in that litigation. The accuracy and fairness of these payments is not in dispute. Oadwallader then brought suit against the insurance company for the $5,050 which he had paid.</p>

He testified, as noted above, that this fact had been communicated to the insurance company prior to its decision not to defend him. In addition, Olarke testified in corroboration of Oadwallader. The insurance company introduced no evidence. This oral <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>testimony therefore stands unrebutted.

The insurance company, according to the terms of the protective policy, had a duty to defend “claims made against the insured arising out of the performance of professional services for others ... as a laivyer and caused by any negligent act, error or omission of the insured . . .” It cannot seriously be contended that the breach did not arise out of the “performance of professional services”. In paragraphs 1 to 16 of his complaint Mencher alleged that Cadwallader failed to retain control of the funds which came into his hands in his professional capacity as a lawyer representing clients and which he had agreed to hold in his own possession to assure performance by Mencher’s clients of certain commitments. Cadwallader’s undertaking of April 21, 1955 to retain the funds was set forth in paragraph 13 of the Mencher complaint. In paragraph 15, the omission to retain was <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>recited as follows: “Fifteenth: No part of the aforesaid sum of not less than $200,000 was retained in fact by the said defendant, T.

The complaint was in two counts, the first seeking relief for a judgment which plaintiff was forced to pay to an injured party and the second seeking his costs in defending that suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, speaking through Judge Learned Hand, held that the insurer was not obligated to pay the amount of the judgment recovered against the insured as the recovery was not one within the coverage of the policy. However, the Court went on to grant the insured his costs of defending that suit. The insurance policy in that case, as in this one, required the insurance company to defend only those claims covered by the policy. The court said, that so long as the complaint filed by the injured party covered an injury which “might or might not” fall within the coverage of the policy the insurance company was obliged to defend. In the course of the opinion they said: “. . . the injured party might conceivably recover on a claim, which, as he had alleged it, was outside the policy; but which, as it turned out, the insurer was bound to pay. Such is the plasticity of modern pleading that no one <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>can be positive that that conld not happen. In such a case of course the insurer would not have to defend; yet, even then, as soon as, during the course of the trial, the changed character of the claim appeared, we need not say that the insured might not insist that the insurer take over the defence. When, however, <em>as here; the complaint comprehends an injury which may be within the policy} we hold that the promise to defend includes it.</em>

In that case this Court held that the insurance company was justified in not defending an action brought against the insured taproom owner by a patron for personal injuries because the taproom owner had attached the pleading filed by the patron against him as part of his complaint against the company. The patron had unequivocally alleged assault and battery at the instigation of the insured in the original complaint, an offense clearly excluded under the terms of the policy. The majority held that the complaint against the insurance company, incorporating by reference, as it did, the patron’s complaint, revealed that the cause of action was based upon facts which did not come within the scope of the policy. We said, that under no theory of laAV could the insured prevail against the insurance company because it would not be possible for the injured patron to recover on a claim of negligence when the suit was founded on the theory of intentional tort. Just as the pleading in that <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>case fixed the insurer’s right, since neither amendment nor variance in proof could possibly establish a cause of action which would be cognizable under the insurance contract, so does Mencher’s pleading fix the insured’s right in this case. In the <em>Wilson </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the complaint of the injured party alleged <em>only </em>an injury which clearly was not within the coverage of the insurance policy. In this case, the complaint filed by Mencher contained two separate causes of action, one for simple breach of the undertaking and the other for conspiracy. If the one for the breach of the undertaking is due to a negligent act or omission this would constitute a claim within the scope of the policy and, as Judge Hand said in <em>Lee v. Aetna Cas. Co., supra, . . </em>It was the duty of the defendant to undertake the defense until it could confine the claim to a recovery that the policy did not cover.”</p>

However, under our interpretation of the insurance contract and the complaint filed by Mencher, it is unnecessary to consider whether this liberality of amendment under the Federal Rules would distinguish this case from that of <em>Wilson v.
