Dunmore, the appellant, was operating his 1957 Ford automobile in a southerly direction on Tilghman Street. As appellant approached 7th Street a stop sign was located approximately 17 feet from the intersection. Appellant stopped at or near the stop sign, looked to his left and right and, observing no approaching vehicles, proceeded into the intersection. While in the intersection appellant’s automobile came into collision with appellee’s 1956 Oldsmobile automobile which <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>•was proceeding in a westerly direction on 7tli Street. Subsequent to the collision appellant’s automobile struck a car parked on the westerly side of Tilghman Street south of the intersection and appellee’s car struck an automobile parked, on the southerly side of 7th Street west of the intersection.</p>

Appellant further testified “I did not see nothing coming, no cars approaching, no lights. So I looked and I started to cross.. When I got out in the street a piece, I kept looking going out in the street, going across. And when I got about the middle of the street, something hit me.” Appellant was without further recollection of that which then happened. To appellant’s left, in the direction from which appellee proceeded, he had an unobstructed view of 650 feet along 7th Street. One Susie Harper testified that she was walking on 7th Street when she saw appellant’s “red and white Ford”, that appellant stopped for the stop sign, that she saw him “look both ways” and, <em>before she had taken “two or three steps” </em>the collision occurred and “the noise of the collision was almost instantaneously after [she] . . . saw [appellant] stop and look in both directions.” There was further testimony that appellee’s automobile, which struck a parked vehicle on 7th Street, came to rest 71 feet west of the west curb line of Tilghman Street and that appellant’s <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>car, which also struck another parked car on Tilghman Street, came to rest on the westerly side of Tilghman Street 50 feet south of the south curb line of 7th Street.</p>

Although averred in appellant’s complaint, the record completely lacles any evidence of excessive speed, failure to operate appellee’s vehicle with due regard to the traffic conditions existing, operation of the vehicle in a reckless or wanton manner, failure to have the vehicle under proper or adequate control, lack of attention on appellee’s part, failure to have properly lit headlights, or any other negligent conduct. Appellant’s principal reliance is on the testimony: “I did not see nothing coming, no cars approaching, <em>no lights . </em>. .” (Emphasis supplied). From the latter it is argued that appellant was in a position to see and was paying special attention watching for automobiles approaching from his left and that the testimony that he saw “no lights” constituted positive testimony that appellee failed to have his headlights illuminated. Appellant further argues that the only reasonable conclusion is that appellee’s lights were not lit and such conduct constituted negligence. The court below adequately and properly characterized this testimony: “We think this testimony is too vague, indefinite and fragmentary to support a finding that defendant was in fact operating his automobile without the headlights burning and was therefore guilty of negligence. The testimony is not only ‘negative’ in the full sense of that term; it is not even clear that it refers to vehicular lights at all. While the vexed question of ‘negative’ testimony as opposed to ‘positive’ or ‘affirmative’ testimony has been greatly clarified by our Supreme Court in Costack v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, <a href="/citations/?q=376%20Pa.%20341" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="376 Pa. 341">376 Pa. 341</a>, we do not understand that a plaintiff can establish defendant’s negli<a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>gence on any such meagre and equivocal testimony as that contained in the present record”.</p>

The record lacks <em>any </em>evidence indicating negligent conduct on appellee’s part and the court below was thoroughly justified in refusing to submit the question of appellee’s negligence to the jury. To have submitted such an issue would have permitted the jury to guess and speculate rather than to rely on proof of that which actually occurred. All appellant proved was the happening of an accident; absent further proof, he was not entitled to have his case submitted to a jury.</p>

When he came to the point where Tilghman Street is intersected by Seventh Street (a through highway), he stopped at the Stop sign, looked to the right and left to be assured that traffic was clear, and, then being so assured, he entered into the intersection. When halfway through he was struck by an automobile coming from his left on Seventh Street and driven by the defendant, Charles McMillan, thereby sustaining serious injuries. In the ensuing lawsuit which he brought against McMillan he was nonsuited on the averred basis that he did not prove that McMillan was negligent. This appeal followed.</p>

Even without inferences the testimony of the plaintiff showed McMillan to have been negligent. McMillan was driving at night without lights, this in direct violation of The Vehicle Code provisions. In addition, he drove his car into an automobile which was directly in his path. And then, even though he was on a through highway, he still was required to observe the rules of the road with regard to ears committed to an intersection before his arrival at the intersection. In addition, he operated his car at such a rate of speed that after hitting the plaintiff’s car broadside he still had enough momentum to travel some 70 feet, climbing the curb and hitting a parked car with such force as to propel it '6 or 7 feet into the street.</p>

In seeking to justify his nonsuit the Trial Judge said: “Plaintiff’s principal contention seems to be that the evidence showed that defendant’s headlights were not burning, and thereby established negligence. This contention is based entirely on a casual, almost chance, remark made by the plaintiff on direct examination: ‘I did not see nothing coming, no cars approaching, no lights.’ In the course of his cross-examination, plaintiff stated that his eyes were ‘good’, that he ‘never had any trouble’ with his eyes.</p>

His testimony was by no means casual. The Trial Court said further that Dun-more’s testimony was “vague, indefinite and fragmentary”. Would the Court have been more satisfied if the plaintiff had spoken in perfect English and had emphasized an'd embroidered the simple story of his disaster? If the plaintiff had been an educated man, he might have said: “Being thoroughly aware of my responsibilities as a careful driver, I stopped at the Stop sign a sufficient length of time for me to appraise the entire traffic situation. I looked to the right and I looked to the left to make certain that nothing was moving in the intersecting streets which might imperil my passage through the intersection. There were no cars within my view, and I do have excellent vision. However, since it was nighttime I made it a point to look searchingly for headlights of cars because I knew that if there was a car anywhere close, I would be sure to see its lights. However, I saw no lights, and I thus assured myself that there were no cars approaching the intersection, and I thus passed into the intersection.”</p>

Was it not for the jury to say whether the defendant was travelling at a high rate of speed if, even assuming he had lights, he sped into the intersection from a far away invisible point during the seconds which elapsed between the moment the plaintiff stopped and <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>looked and the moment that he was hit by the defendant?</p>

Let us suppose a situation where in fact there were no cars on a certain street at night and a university president was asked if he had seen any cars. Let us suppose he replied to that question: “I saw no lig’hts.” Could there be any doubt that he meant by that reply that there were no cars moving?

He was still a disabled man when he testified. He was a man of few <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>words. How did the accident happen? Why didn’t he avoid the disaster which overtook him? He did all that a careful man could do. He stopped and looked east and looked west, saw the intersection, but he saw no cars, he peered into the darkness and he saw no lights. What more should he have done?
