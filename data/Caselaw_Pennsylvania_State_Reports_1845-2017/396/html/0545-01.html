    <p id="b570-7" data-blocks='[["BL_570.9",570,[253,1059,1147,906]]]'>Antonio Gianfelice was employed by Warner Company on January 1, 1918, although he claims to have begun working for the company as early as 1909. He worked continuously until January 31, 1956, on which date he was separated from his employment pursuant to an agreement entered into and subsisting between his union and his employer. Section V of that agreement incorporated a company pension plan referred to as Supplement “A”, and Section IY of Supplement “A” stated as follows: “1. Each participant who, while an employee of the Company has attained age 65 on July 1, 1950, or attains age 65 thereafter, shall be eligible to retire on July 1, 1950, or his attainment of age 65, whichever is later, and, if he has completed 10 or more years of continuous service, shall be eligible for retirement income benefits computed in accordance with Section V hereof.</p>
    <p id="b570-8" data-blocks='[["BL_570.10",570,[252,1985,1146,373]],["BL_571.1",571,[121,363,1146,97]]]'>“2. A participant may remain in service of the Company after his attainment of age 68 or July 1, 1952, whichever last occurs, only with the consent of the company and upon his retirement thereafter, if otherwise qualified, he shall be entitled to receive retirement income benefits.” Gianfelice became 68 on January 14, 1956. There is no dispute that he personally <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>wished to continue in his work; the Superior Court so recognized.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b571-3" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[121,472,1148,540]]]'>Gianfelice filed an application for unemployment benefits and registered for work with the Bureau of Employment Security on February 1, 1956. His waiting week was served; and on February 9, 1956, the bureau issued its determination that he was eligible for benefits. The employer then appealed, and the referee reversed the bureau. A further appeal by the claimant to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review resulted in a reversal of the referee’s decision, and the employer then appealed to the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[120,1024,1148,979]]]'>In reversing the Board of Review, the Superior Court divided 3-2. The majority interpreted the labor-management contract and pension plan as an agreement by Gianfelice not to remain employed after age 68. The Warner Company’s privilege not to enforce compliance with this agreement did not affect Gianfelice’s status. The Court relied on several of its prior decisions to support its conclusion that a union member is bound by his union’s actions in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with the employer. While recognizing that Gianfelice’s retirement was not <em>actually voluntary </em>on his part, the Court concluded: “. . . claimant’s retirement in the case at bar was . . . voluntary. in the legal sense since his services were terminated under the provisions of a contract negotiated by his bargaining agent.” <em>Gianfelice Unemployment Compensation Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/186/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="186 Pa.

Therefore, the retirement was involuntary.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[242,480,1145,533]]]'>The disagreement within the Superior Court arose mainly from the interpretations placed upon the option clause in the contract. There is no doubt that the option clause is ambiguous; that is, it says neither (1) that Gianfelice must retire at age 68 only if the company affirmatively acts to invoke the clause, nor (2) that Gianfelice must retire and may continue only if he secures permission to do so from the company. However, we need not resolve this ambiguity in order to decide the present issue.</p>
    <p id="b572-7" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[241,1034,1145,424]]]'>The major premise of the Superior Court that an employee is bound by his union’s agreement with his employer as expressed in a collective bargaining agreement is unexceptionable on its face. However, in the present context the Superior Court has used this premise to disqualify persons for benefits under the Unemployment Compensation Law who otherwise would be eligible. We do not believe that this result is correct.</p>

Were he so discharged, however, he would be entitled to unemployment compensation. Conversely, absent the agreement, Gianfelice could have quit at <em>his </em>pleasure but would have been ineligible for unemployment benefits as a “voluntary quit.” This latter situation led to a proper denial of benefits in <em>Campbell Unemployment Compensation Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/180/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="180 Pa.

Such agreements <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>usually restrict tbe employer’s right to dismiss at will until the employee reaches a certain age; they thus protect the employee from arbitrary dismissal. It would be anomalous to say that, in gaining this protection against his employer, an employee has lost a benefit which he otherwise would receive from the state — the right to receive unemployment benefits if dismissed — on the theory that he has voluntarily agreed to quit. The pressures of the collective bargaining process are too complex to permit this over-simplified theory to govern a determination here. They would require an inquiry into each case to determine the position of each side at the bargaining table, and even then a clearcut answer would undoubtedly not be forthcoming.</p>

In construing the federal “Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended,” the United States Supreme Court has held that a labor-management agreement cannot be relied upon to bar a recovery of overtime pay. <em>Martino v. Michigan Window Cleaning Company, </em><a href="/us/327/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="327 U.S. 173" data-case-ids="413870,413982" data-case-paths="/us/327/0173-01,/us/327/0816-04">327 U.S. 173</a>, <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>177-8 (1946). Again, that Court, in determining the meaning of “work” in underground iron ore mines under the same act, stated: “But in any event it is immaterial that there may have been a prior custom or contract not to consider certain work within the compass of the workweek or not to compensate employees for certain portions of their work. The Fair Labor Standards Act was not designed to codify or perpetuate those customs and contracts which allow an employer to claim all of an employee’s time while compensating him for only part of it. Congress intended, instead, to achieve a uniform national policy of guaranteeing compensation for all work or employment engaged in by employees covered by the Act. <em>Any custom or contract falling short of that basic policy, like an agreement to pay less than the minimum wage requirements, cannot be utilized to deprive employees of their statutory </em>rights.” <em>Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; Railroad Company v.

Suffice it to say, in answer to this contention, that nothing in the Unemployment Compensation Law disqualifies a recipient of a pension from receiving unemployment compensation if otherwise eligible; in fact, the opposite seems the case. Under §4(u) of the act, 43 P.S. §753(u), an individual is deemed unemployed if he performs no remunerated services during the claim week and if he is paid or owed no remuneration with respect to such week. Here, Gianfelice certainly has performed no services for which he was compensated; so he has qualified under the first condition. As to the second — that he be paid or owed no remuneration with respect to the claim week — the act is devoid of a definition of “remuneration”; and we must decide whether pension or retirement benefits are remuneration on the basis of existing legal principles. “Remuneration” is generally defined as a payment for services performed; and unless the pension here can be considered as such payment with respect to the claim week, Gianfelice qualifies under the second condition.</p>

If a pension is involved, Gianfelice is receiving a gratuity from his employer; thus, no remuneration is being paid. If he is receiving retirement pay, he may be receiving remuneration; but it is being paid with respect to those prior weeks of service in which it was earned. Under either possibility Gianfelice remains eligible for benefits as an “unemployed” individual.</p>
