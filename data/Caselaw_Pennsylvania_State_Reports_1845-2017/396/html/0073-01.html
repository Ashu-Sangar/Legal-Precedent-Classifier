L. 1011, as amended by the Act of June 12, 1931, 53'P.S. §22762 et seq. In 1947, the said Planning Commission, pursuant to the authority of the aforesaid Act, made and adopted a master plan for the City of Pittsburgh in which one of the main arteries or radials for traffic to and from the City of Pittsburgh passes through the said property, now or formerly owned by the defendants. Plaintiff avers that the defendants, during the years in question, owned a 12.25 acre parcel of ground situated entirely within the confines of the 20th Ward of the City of Pittsburgh. Although fully cognizant of the existence and requirements of the City Planning Commission and its master plan, and of the existence of the statute and its requirements, and after numerous conferences with the <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>City Planning Commission regarding the approval of the subdivision planned by the defendants, the said defendants, during the years 1958, 1954 and 1955 sold four lots out of the said 12.25 acre tract to four separate purchasers and transferred one other lot, apparently without consideration, to another grantee. In so doing the defendants acted in violation of the said Act of 1927, supra. The defendants have never secured approval of the City Planning Commission for the plan of subdivision which they have implemented, nor have they submitted a final tracing of their plan of subdivision in accord with the requirements of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b97-4" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[182,1032,1147,424]]]'>“This case involves, inter alia, the constitutionality of the Act of May 13, 1927, P. L. 1011, as amended, 53 P.S. §22762 et seq., creating an executive department in cities of the second class to be known as the Department of City Planning and a City Planning Commission, and conferring upon them certain powers and duties. It is our opinion that this act is constitutional.</p>

During the years 1953, 1954 and 1955, the. defendants transferred and sold certain lots or parcels of ground out of their twelve acre tract without having first secured the approval of the Planning Commission and without recording said plat. The transfer of any lot or parcel of gi’ound in a subdivision as defined by the Statute without a plat of the subdivision having been approved by the City Planning Commission and recorded in the Recorder’s Office of <em>the </em>County may be enjoined by a Court of Equity. Said Statute also pro<a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>vides for a civil action to recover penalties. These provisions are in the alternative. The City, to enjoin the defendants from transferring any lots ont of their remaining parcel of land, instituted an action for penalties and now seeks an injunction.</p>

No evidence has been presented that any such sale is contemplated. While it is true the defendants previously failed to observe the requirements of the Act, that in itself is not sufficient to authorize an injunction to issue now. We believe this action is premature. We are convinced that the defendants should reopen negotiations with the City Planning Commission for the purpose of having their plan approved. We believe that honest efforts were made in the past to secure approval, and failure to attain this lies in part in the dilatory tactics of the Planning Commission. The defendants acted in good faith and informed the Commission of pending sales of property while awaiting approval of their plan. Then they acted in violation of the Statute.</p>
