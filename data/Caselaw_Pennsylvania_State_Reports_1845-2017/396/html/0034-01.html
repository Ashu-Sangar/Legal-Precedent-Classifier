The same is equally true of rules of court. In <em>Tribune Review Publishing Co.

What is thus true in-regard to a <em>statute </em>is equally true of a <em>rule of court.” </em>This jurisdictional situation is not one bit different when judicial opinion is sought with respect to an unapplied regulation which a governmental administrative body, acting pursuant to its statutory authority to prescribe in relevant regard, has promulgated.</p>

Thus, it is, that orders of the Public Utility Commission are appealable to the Superior Court.

A proceeding before the Commission is instituted with the filing of a complaint. If the complaint be to a regulation promulgated by the Commission, it is cognizable only after the regulation has been applied to the complaining and allegedly aggrieved party. Section 1001 of the Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1053, 66 PS §1391, provides that “Any public utility . . . may complain of any regulation or order of the commission, <em>which the complainant is or has been required by the commission to observe or carry into effect.” </em>(Emphasis supplied). No such order was ever entered in this case. The appellant railroad had not been directed by an order of the Commission either to observe or carry into effect any ruling of the Commission under Rule 10 with respect to the appellant’s scheduled train service. It is plain enough that there is no statutory authority •for an appeal to the Superior Court from a regulation promulgated by the Public Utility Commission which has not been applied to the party seeking to invalidate it.</p>

The question of whether the elimination of some trains amounts to “an abandonment of service in whole or in part”, or merely “a curtailment”, will often depend on the facts and may at times be difficult to determine. On the other hand, we cannot find any merit in the contention of the Railroads that abandonment of service occurs, under the Act, only upon the removal or elimination of the <em>last </em>train. This contention crashes head-on with the language of the statute, which, we repeat, requires a certificate of public convenience whenever “any public utility abandons . . . in whole or in part, any service . . .” Were the Railroad’s contention on this point to prevail, the statutory words “in part” would be not only unnecessary but meaningless.</p>
    <p id="b64-5" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[238,1254,1145,539]]]'>However, before we reach the merits, the question arises whether Rule 10 can be appealed from.

    <p id="b64-6" data-blocks='[["BL_64.5",64,[235,1806,1146,541]]]'>Rule 10 is clearly and undoubtedly a formal directive rule or order which is neither procedural nor interlocutory, and requires no further implementation by the Commission. Moreover, by its terms and under the Public Utility Law it has an important and punitive effect on the Railroads. Section 907 of the Law requires every public utility to “obey and comply with such regulations or orders”; and §1301 et-seq. provides penalties for violation of or failure to comply with any regulation or final order of the Commission.</p>

I believe that the majority are incorrect about the Court’s jurisdiction. The Public Utility Law expressly gives to the Superior Court jurisdiction of appeals from <em>“any </em>rule, regulation or order” of the Public Utility Commission. Jurisdiction of the Court means jurisdiction of the cause of action and of the parties; it relates not to the merits of the controversy but solely (a) to jurisdiction over the defendant and (b) to the competency of the particular Court to determine controversies of the general class to which the case then presented for its consideration belongs, i.e. in this case the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to determine the powers and rules of the Public Utility Commission.

It is clear (a) that the Superior Court had jurisdiction over the defendant and (b) that that Court first had, and we in turn have, jurisdiction to determine whether the Public Utility Commission has in Rule 10 exceeded its statutory authority, and whether the Rule was -for any reason invalid or unconstitutional. Whether an appeal will lie in this case directly- from Rule 10 does not, in my judgment, go to the question-of jurisdiction, but is akin to the question of whether' an appeal should be considered by the Court because it is premature, or involves a matter that is interlocutory, or moot. In other words, the Superior Court clearly and unquestionably had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; the present appeal is not void for lack of jurisdiction in the Superior Court and subsequently <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>in our Court; the appeal should not be quashed or the judgment of the Superior Court be vacated, but the appeal can and may be dismissed if we do not choose to exercise our jurisdiction until additional facts are presented in an actual case or until further action is taken by the Commission or by the Superior Court.</p>
