The opinion expressly so declared as follows: “It is obvious, then, that Act No. 3 merely confirms in statutory form the possession by the Attorney General of a power Which had theretofore been enjoyed by him under the usage and traditions of the common law.” Thus, what had been deemed in the <em>Minerd </em>case, supra, as a common law power of the Attorney General with respect to his right to supersede elected district attorneys became by the Act of 1938 a part of the statute law of the State. But (and this is of paramount importance), at the very next session of the General Assembly, the Act of 1938 was “repealed absolutely” by the Act of March 20, 1939, P.

But in an opinion written by our late revered colleague Justice Chidsey, this Court said: “While grand juries take an oath to keep their counsels secret and their deliberations are legally sealed from divulgence, the so-called secrecy rule does not prevent it being shown that the defendant’s rights were violated by the introduction of testimony in direct contravention of constitutional inhibitions . . . The impenetrability of grand jury proceedings is subject to exceptions and we think that the instant case presents a justifiable exception. If ap<a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>pellant’s constitutional safeguards were ignored as contended, it was a flagrant transgression of the letter and spirit of our organic law.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">*</a>

He could not flee the jurisdiction. He was in jail. Never could prosecution authorities be surer of a person’s whereabouts than they were of O’Brien’s whereabouts.

They saw also the need of adopting practices peculiarly applicable to a country and a people that was growing and expanding by leaps and bounds in population, trade, agriculture, manufacture, and so on. By 1850, counties and regions which at the period of the Revolution were only sparsely populated, now contained enough people almost to justify statehood. Thus, not only did we need to get away from the monarchial British idea that the Attorney General was the last word on law enforcement in the State but we found it absolutely necessary, because <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>of the demands of the swelling population and commerce, that the larger counties should have their own local prosecuting officer who lived there, knew the community, and would be responsible to the people there. The people of Pennsylvania demanded a voice in determining who would exercise the tremendous power of prosecution. Accordingly, on May 3, 1850, the General Assembly created the elective office of District Attorney, an office wholly unknown at common law. That law provided, inter alia, that: “ ‘The officer so elected shall sign <em>all </em>bills of indictment, and conduct in court <em>all </em>criminal and other prosecutions in the name of the commonwealth, or when the state is a party, which arise in the county for which he is elected, and perform all the duties which now by law are to be performed by deputy attorney generals, and receive the same fees or emoluments of office.’”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">*</a> (P.

Over two printed pages he enumerates the virtues of patience of the then incumbent Attorney General. He tells us how the Attorney General long-sufferingly sat back and watched official abuse, corruption and inefficiency in government in Allegheny County. The Justice relates how the Attorney General saw the “widespread misuse of public property,” how he saw “faithlessness in the performance of public duties,” how he saw confidence of the citizenry in certain officials of the city government “being dangerously undermined”, how he saw that no investigations were being made [except by the city solicitor, except by the city controller, except by the city council]; he saw that, “while the District Attorney could not properly request a grand jury investigation until he had obtained reliable evidence of the commission of a general series of crimes, the District Attorney had not attempted on his own behalf to obtain such evidence until the eouncilmanie inquiry began and had then merely sent county detectives to check on the testimony there given.” [Merely? How does a district attorney obtain information ex<a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>cept through his county detectives?] It is amazing what the Attorney General saw without benefit of telescope. And then, his patience exhausted, being unable to stand any longer the collapse of government in Allegheny County, he came on to Allegheny County and, by the authority of this Court, he superseded the district attorney. I-Ie began what was called a “free work” probe, he hired a large staff of deputy attorneys general, investigators, clerks, stenographers, and so on; he brought in state troopers; he called an investigating grand jury which was then followed by an indicting grand jury.</p>

When it was publicly charged that certain officials and employees of the city government had had private work done at city expense, investigations, as already stated, were initiated by the city solicitor, the city controller, and the city council. T'he district attorney assigned his second assistant to attend the hearings before the city council and to obtain a copy of all the testimony. On the very day that the council made its report, the district attorney moved with expeditiousness and proficiency. He impounded the city supply records and sent them to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for examination to discover if they had been tampered with, he assigned ten county detectives and four assistant district attorneys to obtain evidence to present to the June Grand Jury, for whose recall he immediately petitioned the court. The court granted the petition and subpoenas issued for witnesses to appear before the grand jury.</p>

He said he would supersede the district attorney “in any and all matters ivhatsoever relating to the criminal acts of any and all public officials and public employees <em>within the jurisdiction of the Courts of Oyer and Terminer and Quarter Sessions of Allegheny County, </em>including the investigation of charges, the proceedings before the Grand Jury, the trial or trials, and any and all matters relating thereto.”</p>

The district attorney resisted this petition, and the court brought the controversy to issue by holding hearings. Witnesses testified, documents were examined, records were introduced and read, briefs were filed and arguments made. During the arguments the district attorney scarcely overstated his case when, in speaking of the attempted supersedure, he said: “The action of the Attorney General is so offensive to the principle of democratic action, so repugnant to the concept of home rule, as to constitute a blanket indictment of this court, the grand jury already summoned, and the entire population of Allegheny County.”</p>

He proved this sartorial puissance by quoting the errors of Justice Schaefer and Chief Justice Kephart, and he quoted also from his own opinion in the case of <em>Dauphin County Grand Jury Investigation Proceedings (No. 3), </em><a href="/pa/332/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="332 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1186569" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0358-01">332 Pa. 358</a>, where he had originally expressed Ms faith in the errors of Justice Schaffer and CMef Justice Kephart.

Justice Jones (now Chief Justice) and Justice Ladner filed dissenting opinions to the opinion of the Court. Justice Jones properly inquired on what basis this Court put at naught the findings of the judges of Allegheny County in the case of <em>Margiotti Appeal, </em>supra. He said: “The findings of the court below are ignored by the majority in plain disregard of a well-settled and time-honored rule of law that the findings of fact of a trial court, approved by a court en banc, have the weight of a jury’s verdict and are conclusive on appeal if there is any evidence to support them . . . The Attorney General’s charges impugning the honor and integrity of the District Attorney were found by the court below, and now by this court, not to have been sustained. What, then, is there left to support the majority’s opinion that the Attorney General’s order of <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>snpersednre was a proper exercise of his discretion? Only that official’s bald assertion that the District Attorney had lost public confidence and would, therefore, be unable to conduct a thorough and effective investigation, — an allegation which the court below rejected as not having been sustained by evidence.”</p>
    <p id="b297-3" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[141,698,1149,707]]]'>In his brilliant and devastating dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Jones pointed out the wholly un-American concept of allowing an Attorney General to displace a district attorney at his pleasure: “The idea that a mere political appointee, beholden to his appointer and not to the people for his tenure, can, of his own volition, set aside and supersede a duly elected constitutional officer runs counter to even the most limited conception of the republican form of democratic government which this Commonwealth was established to secure and maintain and which the National Government is charged by the Federal Constitution (Art.

Thus, with the exception of a nine-months in-, terregnum, the Legislature has always been against conferring upon the Attorney General any general powers of supersession. Chief Justice Jones said and I subscribe heartily to Ms conclusion: “The plain intent of the legislature by the repeal of 1939 was to make an end, once for all, of the idea that an appointed Attorney General could, of Ms own motion, supersede and set aside a duly <em>elected </em>constitutional officer.
