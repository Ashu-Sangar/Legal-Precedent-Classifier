Helen Lewis had never been married, and the identity of the child’s father is unknown. On August 7, 1953, Helen Lewis purchased a home in Upper Mount Bethel Township in Northampton County. On December 8, 1958, Helen Lewis was hospitalized, and Erica was placed with Helen’s consent in the custody of Mr. and Mrs. James Shoemaker, who lived on the neighboring farm. Plelen Lewis died on December 21, 1958. On January 19, 1959, Mrs. Vivian Elizabeth Weaver, an aunt of Erica by marriage, who lives in Garden City, Long Island, New York, petitioned the Orphans’ Court for appointment of herself as guardian of the person of Erica Lewis. At the same time Mr. and Mrs. Shoemaker filed a Notice of Intention to Adopt Erica, in accordance with the Act of June 5, 1941, P. L. 93, §1 as amended.</p>

After a full hearing, the Court entered an Order appointing Mrs. Weaver as guardian of the person of Erica and granting her custody of Erica. From this Order the Shoemakers have appealed.</p>

The Shoemakers have desired' to adopt children for some time, and as soon as they learned of Helen Lewis’ death on December 21, 1958, they informed their doctor that they wished him to take immediate steps to enable them to adopt Erica. They love Erica very much and she apparently reciprocates this love, calling Mr. Shoemaker “Dad” and Mrs. Shoemaker “Mom”. During the six months that Erica lias been living with the Shoemakers, she has greatly improved in appearance, in neatness, in cleanliness, in her school work and in her ability to get along with other children.</p>

She did not attend Helen Lewis’ funeral. She never has sent a Christmas card or a post card or a present to Erica, and she showed not the slightest interest in Erica’s existence until nearly one month after the death of Helen Lewis. Mr. Weaver has never yet seen Erica and his fondness for the child is apparent when he testified “I think when there are five children already, one more will not he an intolerable burden.” Both the Shoemakers and the Weavers have nice homes, and each family is qualified by character and reputation to have the custody of Erica. However, the above summary demonstrates, without the necessity of referring to any authorities, that the best interests and the welfare of Erica would be in the community where she has always lived and in the custody of the Shoemakers who have demonstrated their affection and love for her.</p>
