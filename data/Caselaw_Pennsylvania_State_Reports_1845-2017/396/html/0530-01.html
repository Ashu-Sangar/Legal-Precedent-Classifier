A hearing was held and an adjudication filed, denying the injunction and receiver, without prejudice, since plaintiff- again appealed at once, to the ultimate merits. At <a href="/pa/385/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="385 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1267078" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0342-01">385 Pa. 342</a> (1956), we affirmed the denial of preliminary relief.</p>
    <p id="b553-10" data-blocks='[["BL_553.17",553,[141,1751,1149,209]]]'>Another hearing was then held on the merits, and an adjudication, supplemental adjudication, and final decree were filed, dismissing-the complaint. Plaintiff has appealed.</p>

Since the parties are man and wife, separated but not divorced, counsel agree that there is no case for partition of the three parcels of real estate, which are all held by the entireties. The court below also ordered defendant to account from August 15, 1954, and she did so. Counsel further agree that the parties have an <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>equal right to possession and use of the properties, and that defendant is entitled to proper support.</p>
    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[233,458,1145,155]]]'>Plaintiff now argues two questions. The first is the need for an injunction and for the appointment of a receiver: the second involves the amount of support.</p>
    <p id="b554-5" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[230,625,1146,427]]]'>The properties are all in Langhorne, Bucks County, and are known as 210 South Bellevue Avenue, a five-family apartment house; 221 South Bellevue Avenue, a dwelling rented to the parties’ married daughter and her family; and, adjoining 221, 111 Flowers Avenue, the matrimonial domicile and now the residence of the defendant. She manages these properties and retains the rentals for her living.</p>
    <p id="b554-6" data-blocks='[["BL_554.6",554,[227,1065,1145,319]]]'>The parties separated in 1949. From his wool business they once had a substantial income, but in 1953 the business failed and plaintiff, after several years of menial labor, was making from $30 to $40 per week as a plumber’s helper at the time of trial. He is now sixty-six and his wife a year older.</p>
    <p id="b554-7" data-blocks='[["BL_554.7",554,[223,1397,1147,373]]]'>The record is in a parlous state. We regard the solution of the court below as basically unfair to the plaintiff because there are three valuable properties in which he has an entireties’ interest but from which he is effectively excluded and from whose rental he gets nothing. He must subsist altogether on his laborer’s wage.</p>
    <p id="b554-8" data-blocks='[["BL_554.8",554,[218,1783,1147,544]]]'>The chancellor suggested that plaintiff or his counsel acted in bad faith by bringing suit with the motive of forcing a sale or settlement and raising a cash fund. It is true that plaintiff waited for six years before suing, but while he had his business it was natural enough to keep the profits and let defendant keep the rents. He did not sue until his business was gone and he had nothing. Then he had every right to try to reach by the only method available to him a right in property that was undeniably his.</p>
    <p id="b555-2" data-blocks='[["BL_555.3",555,[139,379,1147,597]]]'>
      <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>Plaintiff had the burden of proof in seeking to redress his wrongs and he sagged under it in several important particulars. One of these was in giving evidence of the value of the properties and another was in giving evidence ol‘ their rental value, for the chancellor’s findings on these points, especially the latter, stand at the base of his present trouble. He could give persuasive testimony about what the properties cost him and what he put into them, but as a wool merchant and not a real estate broker, his ideas of market value and rental value are not very useful.</p>
    <p id="b555-3" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[135,988,1150,587]]]'>The same may be said of defendant’s notions of value. Her renting the properties at certain figures does not mean that those figures are the going rates. The rentals show no increase since 1949, and it is incredible that these properties and their rental value should not have advanced with the general market. This conclusion is strengthened by the rental of one entire property to defendant’s daughter and family for only $75. We regard her testimony of both the income from the properties and the expense of operating them with considerable disbelief.</p>
    <p id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.5",555,[135,1597,1146,143]]]'>There should be competent testimony about rental values before there can be a practical solution of this case.</p>
    <p id="b555-5" data-blocks='[["BL_555.6",555,[133,1762,1148,374]]]'>Beyond this, nothing can be made to move without a receiver when the parties are at sword’s point and one of them cannot get into the properties or have a word about their rental and expense. It is regrettable to incur the expense of a receiver, but the parties have created the impasse that requires one and there is no other way to remove the obstacle to final solution.</p>

The chancellor chose to dismiss evidence of which we could almost take judicial notice, namely, that after the textile business in this area almost dried up, plaintiff tried to get work and even took an examination for insurance adjuster, but that there were then nearly half a million people out of work in Pennsylvania and he was passed over for younger men.
