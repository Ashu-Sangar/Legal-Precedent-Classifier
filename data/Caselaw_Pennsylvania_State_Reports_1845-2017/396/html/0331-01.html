It was incorporated May 10, 1906; its assets at the present time exceed $10,000,000, and its aggregate reserves and undivided profits exceed five per centum thereof. On January 21, 1957, Cumberland Valley’s application to establish a <em>branch </em>office in the Borough of Lemoyne,, Cumberland County, was granted. Within six months, viz., on July 1, 1957, this Association filed an application for a second branch office in the vicinity of 32nd Street and Trindle Road, Camp Hill, Cumberland County, 1.6 miles from the location of its first branch office. After investigation and hearing, this application was <em>disapproved </em>by the Department of Banking on August 23, 1957, for two reasons: (1) there was no need, and (2) the Department was of the opinion that the branch could not generate sufficient business to operate at a profit there and at Lemoyne, and therefore the establishment of this second branch office at the time of the application would be harmful to the interests of the shareholders, and would be prejudicial to the safe and sound conduct of the Association’s business.</p>

Cumberland Valley, by letter dated October 11, 1957, objected to State Capital’s ap<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>plication for this branch office, and requested reconsideration of its own application, which, we repeat, had been denied on August 23, 1957. The Department of Banking wrote Cumberland Valley on October 14, 1957, advising it that it was reviewing its study of the need for building and loan services in that area. By letter dated November 15, 1957, the Department of Banking advised Cumberland Valley that it had reviewed its application for a branch at the aforesaid location and concluded that its disapproval thereof was proper. The Department also advised Cumberland Valley in and by ■this letter that it had approved the application of State Capital for a branch at the aforesaid location. Cumberland Valley contends that the action of the Department of Banking in each case was arbitrary, unwarranted, grossly discriminatory, unjustifiable and illegal.</p>

The Department of Banking, contending the appeal should have been taken from the Department’s Order of August 23, 1957, moved to quash this appeal because it was not “taken within three calendar months from the entry of the sentence, order, judgment or decree appealed from . .

No such branches shall be estab<a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>lished unless the association has aggregate assets of at least $1,000,000 and aggregate reserves and undivided profits equal to at least five per centum thereof. The applicant is then required (by Section 204B) to file its application with the Department of Banking, irrespective of whether the proposed branch is within the county or in a contiguous county. Section 204B then provides that if the Department finds upon investigation that “there is <em>a </em>need<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">*</a> for the [contemplated] services or facilities, ... it shall <em>approve </em>such application and forward it to the Building and Loan Board for review; . . . and the Board, after such additional investigation or hearing as it may deem advisable, shall either approve or disapprove the action of the Department . . . and [its] decision shall be binding upon the Department.” It will instantly be noted that the Department of Banking is directed to approve an application for a branch if it finds that there is a need for the contemplated services or facilities (and that all requirements of this section have been complied with).

In <em>Delaware County National Bank v. Campbell, Secretary of Banking, </em>378 Pa., supra, this Court specifically decided (1) that there is no provision in either the Banking Code or the Department of Banking Code which prohibits an appeal or judicial review from an Order entered by the Banking Board in approving a branch bank, and (2) that an appeal from such an Order is in the nature of a broad certiorari, and (3) that the Banking Board will not be reversed if there is adequate evidence to support its findings of fact and the conclusions drawn therefrom, and the proceeding is free from error of law, and there has been no clear abuse of discretion.</p>

Banking Board, </em>383 Pa., supra, this Court once again dismissed a motion to quash, and again held (1) that this Court has jurisdiction to review on a broad certiorari a final Order of the Banking Board approving or disapproving an application for a branch office, and (2) that the test in this Court is whether the evidence supports <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>the Board’s findings, and whether the findings justify the Board’s conclusions. In that case this Court reviewed the evidence and held that the Banking Board’s disapproval of the application for a branch office was arbitrary and unwarranted, and must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b363-3" data-blocks='[["BL_363.4",363,[177,647,1147,929]]]'>The evidence presented by State Capital was adequate to support the Board’s findings and conclusions, and its approval of the proposed branch office in Camp Hill, on the West Shore of Cumberland County. The West Shore of Cumberland County is largely residential, and is growing very rapidly both in population and in new housing and residential units. As of September 9, 1957, State Capital had $4,464,000 of share capital from the West Shore, and held $1,165,000 of mortgages on properties in West Shore. During the prior year, State Capital received from West Shore $837,000 in new share capital and $528,800 in new mortgage loans. The convenience of the proposed branch office to these and future shareholders and borrowers in Camp Hill is obvious, and we are convinced that the <em>need </em>for this branch office for loan services and facilities was demonstrated by the evidence.</p>

It is not correct, however, when it contends that it is <em>mandatory </em>upon the Department of Banking to <em>disapprove </em>an application for a branch in a contiguous county if an in-county association has notified the Department of its bona fide intention to establish a branch in the same city, borough or township in which the proposed branch of the out-of-county association is to be located. The interpolated proviso in §204B upon which Cumberland Yalley relies provides “that the Department in its <em>sole </em>

The words “in its sole discretion” must be construed in connection with the amendment to the Department of Banking Code by Act of July 3, 1957, P. L. 463, §.202B, which provides:</p>
