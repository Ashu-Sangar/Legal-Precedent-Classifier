        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bok,\nPreliminary objections have been sustained in both of these cases, and since the legal principles are the same and only the pleaded facts differ somewhat, we will consider them together.\nIt should be made clear at the outset that the scope of our review is narrowed to the question of whether or not summary judgment was proper. The law is plain that such disposition should be made, especially when it has the effect of putting the plaintiff out of court, only in cases that are clear and free from doubt: London v. Kingsley, 368 Pa. 109; 81 A. 2d 870 (1951); Adams v. Speckman, 385 Pa. 308; 122 A. 2d 685 (1956).\nIt is interesting to note that none of the cases cited by the court below to support its action or by counsel for appellee in No. 141 to support its argument was disposed of by summary judgment. All were decided after hearing. Counsel for appellee in No. 140 has cited some older Federal cases to the effect that a motion to dismiss should be granted when it is clear that under no state of the evidence could plaintiff make out a case of infringement and hence it would be idle to go farther. T'he monitor that he cites for this rule is Van Camp Sea Food Co. v. Westgate Sea Products Co., 28 F. 2d 957, C.C.A. 9th (1928).\nApplying this measure to the pleaded facts, it is obvious that the court below was in error.\nIn both cases the court has taken from the Restatement, Torts, \u00a7729, the following apparatus by which to determine whether the defendants\u2019 designations are confusingly similar to the plaintiff\u2019s:\n\u201c(a) The degree of similarity between the designation and the trademark or tradename in (i) appearance; (ii) pronunciation of the words used; (iii) verbal translation of the pictures or designs involved; (iv) suggestion; (b) The intent of the actor in adopting the designation; (c) The relation in use and manner of marketing between the goods or services marketed by the actor and those marketed by the other; (d) The degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers.\u201d See also Thomson-Porcelite Co. v. Harad, 356 Pa. 121, 51 A. 2d 605 (1947).\nThe complaint in No. 140 lists some of the points of similarity between the two restaurants as follows:\n\u201cA. The name of your plaintiff\u2019s restaurant is the \u2018Dutch Pantry\u2019 and that of the defendants is \u2018Dutch Kitchen Restaurant\u2019;\n\u201cB. The object of both restaurants is precisely the same, to wit, the preparation and serving of foodstuffs to the public generally;\n\u201cC. The names of both restaurants appear on the marquees and are of the same color, size, and design;\n\u201cD. The outward appearances of both restaurants are similar in that both have constructed marquees, under which the public is required to enter their respective restaurants;\n\u201cE. Both restaurants employ, for design, a trough or space filled with shrubbery throughout the front o\u00ed the respective buildings;\n\u201cF. Both restaurants employ the use of a Dutch girl figure prominently displayed on the front of the respective buildings;\n\u201cG. Bath restaurants employ the same type and color of wood, glass, and plastic in their respective marquees ;\n\u201cIT. Both restaurants are located in Snyder County, Pennsylvania, along U. S. Highway Route 11-15.\u201d\nThe complaint in No. 141 has a similar list:\n\u201cA. The name of your plaintiff\u2019s restaurant is \u2018Dutch Pantry\u2019. That of the defendant is \u2018Miracle Dutch Treat\u2019; with another name prominently displayed entitled \u2018Dutch Kitchen Cookin\u2019 \u2019;\n\u201cB. The object of both restaurants is precisely the same, to wit, the preparation and serving of foodstuffs and meals to the public generally;\n\u201cC. The names of both restaurants appear prominently on the premises and are of the same size;\n\u201cD. Defendant has constructed and maintained a windmill on her premises,. and plaintiff has a trademarked windmill on its premises;\n\u201cE. Both restaurants are located in Monroe Township, Snyder County, Pennsylvania, on the eastern side of U. S. Routes 11-15;\n\u201cF. Defendant has de-emphasized the name \u2018Miracle\u2019 in her fictitious name of \u2018Miracle Dutch Treat\u2019.\u201d\nThe court below limited its consideration of similarities in both cases to the names, and it assumed the duty of the fact-finder in saying, also in both cases: \u2018\u2018there is no similarity in appearance, pronunciation, sound, or meaning.\u201d These are not matters of law.\nWe are unwilling to take judicial notice that the phrase \u201cPennsylvania Dutch\u201d has only one meaning or that it is a compound of factors whose meaning can be apprehended in only one way. Rather, we may take judicial notice of the historical and ethnic fact that the word \u201cDutch\u201d itself is wrongly used, since it refers not to the only people who have a right to it, namely, the citizens of The Netherlands, but to those whose ancestors were Swiss or Palatinate Deutsch, or German. It cannot, therefore, follow irresistibly that everything connected with the central Pennsylvania area which loosely uses the word \u201cDutch\u201d must be of one type and not of another. The Dutch girl and the windmill involved here may depict the local variety or the Netherlands, the German, or the Swiss.\nEven without such precision of origin, there are the differences in shape, style, color, size, and arrangement of the restaurants, including the marquees, the windmills, the signs, the Dutch girls, and the shrubbery beds. And in dealing with a colorful and concentrated area such as the \u201cPennsylvania Dutch country\u201d, the use of the key word, \u201cDutch\u201d, raises at once the possibility of establishments, if they otherwise resemble each other, being under the same management. It might even be regarded as a word ordinarily belonging to the public but through special local circumstances acquiring a secondary meaning: Golden Slipper Square Club v. Golden Slipper Restaurant & Catering, Inc., 371 Pa. 92; 88 A. 2d 734 (1952). In Hartman v. Cohn, 350 Pa. 41; 38 A. 2d 22 (1944), the name \u201cDundee\u201d was held to have acquired a special meaning and was given protection.\nThe other features of the restaurants therefore acquire critical importance in the basic issue of whether the public has been misled and confused. That issue is peculiarly one of fact, since it represents a congeries of sense perceptions in the traveler. Such an issue rarely lends itself to summary judgment. After the trial and the establishment of the comparative facts, the applicable rules may have to be applied more strictly than they can be at the present stage of the proceedings, when we face nothing more substantial than the impossibility of being dogmatic about factors over which men may disagree.\nIn short, it cannot be said that under no state of the evidence as foreshadowed by these complaints could plaintiff make out a case.\nAs Mr. Justice Bell said in KoolVent Metal Awning Corp. v. Price, 368 Pa. 528; 84 A. 2d 296 (1951) : \u201cAll that is necessary is that the court shall find from the evidence that the name or mark or label, or the conduct and practices of the defendant actually confused and deceived or that it is reasonably likely that the average purchaser will be deceived.\u201d There should be a hearing to fix such elements of fact.\nThe judgment is reversed in each case, with a procedendo.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell:\nIn KoolVent Metal Awning Corp. v. Price, 368 Pa. 532, the Court said: \u201cThe law in this class of cases is well established; its application to different facts and circumstances is sometimes difficult. Descriptive, geographical and generic words, as well as words of common usage or general belong to the public and are not capable of exclusive appropriation by anyone . . . Even though a word a phrase or mark has acquired a special or secondary meaning [and there was no averment by complainant that its name had acquired a special or secondary meaning], the right of protection does not extend a monopoly to every word in the name, but the protection will be afforded only against names or marks which are deceptively similar thereto and consequently are likely to confuse the public: Quaker State Oil v. Steinberg, 325 Pa. 273.\u201d\nNo one can possibly acquire an exclusive right, appropriation, trade-mark or trade name in or to the use of the word \u201cDutch\u201d, especially in Pennsylvania Dutch country, nor, I believe, to the figure of a Dutch windmill, or even a Dutch girl.\nThe similarity or dissimilarity of the names is the most important factor or test in determining the basic issue of violation of a trade name. An example will make this strikingly clear. If the Washington \u201cSenators\u201d filed a bill to enjoin the New York \u201cYankees\u201d from using that name since it would likely mislead, confuse and deceive baseball fans, because both teams play baseball; they use the same baseballs and the same ball parks; their gloves and bats are of the same design, color and size; they have the same number of players; they play under the same rules and at times under the same lights; and they have the same umpires. In spite of all these similarities, any judge could decide from the name alone \u2014 without the aid of a jury, and without watching the teams play \u2014 that the buying public would not be misled or deceived into mistaking the Yankees for the Senator's, or even vice versa.\nThe name, \u201cMiracle Dutch Treat,\u201d is so very dissimilar to \u201cDutch Pantry, Inc.\u201d, as to enable the Court to say that it is clearly not deceptively similar to \u201cDutch Pantry, Inc.\u201d, and it certainly is not likely to confuse or deceive the eating public. In other words, even a stranger in Pennsylvania Dutch country would instantly know \u2014 without the aid of a jury or even a judge \u2014 'that a \u201cPantry\u201d is very different from a \u201cMiraacle Treat.\u201d\nPor these reasons I would affirm the judgment of the lower court in Dutch Pantry, Inc. v. Miracle Dutch Treat.",
