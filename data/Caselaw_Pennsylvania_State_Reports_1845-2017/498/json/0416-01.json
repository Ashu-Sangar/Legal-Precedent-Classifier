        "text": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from the order of the Honorable Evan S. Williams, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County, denying appellant relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (\u201cPCHA\u201d).\nOn December 9,1974, after a lengthy jury trial, appellant, Gerard Paul McKenna, was convicted of rape and first degree murder in connection with the brutal slaying of a sixteen year-old girl. The jury prescribed the death penalty for appellant\u2019s murder conviction. On direct appeal to this Court, we upheld both convictions, but vacated appellant\u2019s death sentence and remanded the case for resentencing on the murder conviction. See Commonwealth v. McKenna, 476 Pa. 428, 383 A.2d 174 (1978) (\u201cMcKenna I\u201d). Appellant was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment for his first degree murder conviction on April 17, 1978. These PCHA proceedings followed.\nPost conviction hearings were held on August 21 and October 3, 1979. The court of common pleas, per President Judge Williams, denied the requested relief and appellant appealed to this Court. The Commonwealth and appellant submitted the case on their briefs, and, on January 29,1982, we filed an opinion and order reversing the PCHA court. We subsequently granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for reconsideration and, on April 2, 1982, we ordered that the parties prepare the case for oral argument during our April session. See Pa.R.A.P. 2311(b). Having carefully considered the entire record, the briefs and the able oral arguments of both sides, we now vacate our order of January 29, 1982 and affirm the order of the PCHA court.\nBefore this Court appellant most strenuously argues his claim that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to present a material and favorable defense. The gravamen of this contention is that trial counsel had material witnesses to offer in support of appellant\u2019s alibi defense but did not call them, because he believed a new trial would be granted on appeal.\nAt the PCHA hearing, appellant\u2019s chief trial counsel, Thomas Walrath, Esquire, did in fact testify that he believed the errors of the trial court sufficient to require a new trial and that he had, therefore, substantially abandoned the alibi defense. See generally, N.T. PCHA 8/21/79 pp. 60-80. We shall refrain from comment, for the purposes here, upon such unprofessional conduct, as there is no merit to appellant\u2019s contentions.\nDefense counsel Walrath testified that, if he had fully presented the alibi defense, he would have called Dr. Irving Sopher, the defense\u2019s forensic pathologist, to fix the time of death, a consideration relevant to the alibi. Dr. Sopher was called at the PCHA hearing, not by appellant, but by the Commonwealth, and he testified as follows:\n[SPECIAL PROSECUTOR]: Do you know why it was that you were not called as a witness in this case?\n[DR. SOPHER]: I think one of the main ... my main impression is after discussing with Mr. Walrath by phone as to whether I would be brought to testify or not was the fact that my testimony in view of the fact that I could not exclude a six-day postmortem interval, that this would merely corroborate prosecution evidence in this particular case and that perhaps it may be in the best interest of the defendant that I not testify. * * * * * *\n[I]t was the final decision of Mr. Walrath that my testimony in this case I think primarily would corroborate the prosecution evidence and would, therefore, substantiate the prosecution evidence on time of death and it may be in the best interest of the client that I not testify.\nN.T. 10/3/79 pp. 83, 96 (emphasis supplied). The PCHA court, which heard all the evidence, expressly credited Dr. Sopher\u2019s assertion that his testimony would have merely corroborated the Commonwealth\u2019s position. Opinion of Williams, P.J., at 6. (Opinion filed April 22, 1980). Not only would Dr. Sopher have fortified the Commonwealth at trial, but he specifically contradicted Mr. Walrath\u2019s PCHA testimony as to the reason he was not called. The soundness of Judge Williams\u2019 findings on Dr. Sopher\u2019s credibility cannot be faulted by reviewing the synthetic testimony of Mr. Walrath.\nThe same note of artificiality pervades Mr. Walrath\u2019s testimony concerning the contention that there were other exculpatory witnesses who might have been called, including appellant himself, State Trooper John P. George, Deputy Coroner Arthur B. King and \u201cfive or six other witnesses\u201d whom Mr. Walrath was unable to identify. N.T. PCHA 8/21/79 p. 59; N.T. PCHA 10/3/79 pp. 20-23.\nNone of these allegedly exculpatory witnesses was ever produced by appellant during the PCHA proceedings. Appellant has utterly failed to sustain his burden of proving that the testimony of the witnesses would have strengthened the defense. See Commonwealth v. Robinson, 292 Pa. 633, 435 A.2d 255 (1981); Commonwealth v. Pettus, 492 Pa. 558, 424 A.2d 1332 (1981). In fact, as the PCHA court noted, what evidence there was indicated that the testimony of the allegedly favorable witnesses would have had a harmful effect or no effect at all on the defense.\nAppellant cannot meet his burden of proof in a PCHA proceeding with the bare assertion by trial counsel that the defense might have been handled differently or that an unsubstantiated defense was not fully presented. See Commonwealth v. Pettus, 492 Pa. at 563, 424 A.2d at 1335; Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967). The lower court properly looked beyond the self-serving statements of appellant and trial counsel, to ascertain if there was any substance to appellant\u2019s claim. A thorough review of the evidence presented in the PCHA hearings demonstrates, as the PCHA court explicitly held, appellant\u2019s \u201calleged withheld defense is really no defense at all and trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to present the same.\u201d Opinion of Williams, P. J., at 6 (Opinion filed April 22, 1980). See Commonwealth v. Pettus, 492 Pa. at 563, 424 A.2d at 1335; Commonwealth v. Giknis, 491 Pa. 215, 420 A.2d 419 (1980). Appellant is thus not entitled to relief on his unsupported claim that he was deprived of a material and favorable defense through the ineffectiveness of trial counsel. His contention is without merit simply because, as the record shows and the PCHA court held, the evidence trial counsel deliberately withheld was best left in the closet.\nAppellant\u2019s second contention is that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to file a motion to dismiss the indictments under Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100, which, at the time appellant was charged, required that trial commence within 270 days of the initiation of a criminal prosecution. In the instant case, the criminal complaint charging appellant with rape and murder was filed on November 20, 1973. At that time, however, appellant was in the custody of New York State authorities, to whom he had surrendered in connection with an assault, which had occurred in New York prior to the events leading to the instant prosecution. The trial court expressly held that appellant was unavailable to Pennsylvania authorities until July 9, 1974, when he consented to extradition after apparently pleading guilty to the New York charges. Due to appellant\u2019s unavailability, the period for Rule 1100 computation did not begin until July 9, 1974. See Commonwealth v. Morgan, 484 Pa. 117, 398 A.2d 972 (1979); Commonwealth v. Cohen, 481 Pa. 349, 392 A.2d 1327 (1979); Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 472 Pa. 553, 372 A.2d 826 (1977); Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(d). Appellant\u2019s trial, which began on November 18, 1974, was well within the 270 day period mandated by Rule 1100. Appellant thus cannot prevail on his Rule 1100 claim.\nAppellant next attacks his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to allegedly inflammatory remarks made by the prosecutor. Appellant is entitled to no relief on this claim because it was addressed by this Court on appellant\u2019s direct appeal. The very same remarks challenged here were raised in part IX of appellant\u2019s direct appeal brief. See Appellant\u2019s Direct Appeal Brief at 125-128. There can be no doubt that this Court considered and rejected the claim:\nMcKenna alleges some nine trial errors, any one of which, he argues, requires the grant of a new trial. Having carefully reviewed the record, we find merit in none of these claims of error and affirm the convictions of murder and rape.\nMcKenna I, 476 Pa. at 431, 383 A.2d at 176. Appellant cannot seek further review through these PCHA proceedings of a claim which has been fully and finally litigated. Commonwealth v. Slavik, 449 Pa. 424, 297 A.2d 920 (1972). See also, Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 15, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1077, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).\nAppellant\u2019s final claim is that a new trial is required due to evidence discovered after his original trial. Appellant contended at the PCHA hearing that he could produce two witnesses who would testify that a Commonwealth witness had partially recanted his trial testimony in their presence. A third witness would have stated that he had seen a blouse similar to the victim\u2019s near where the same Commonwealth witness had been staying. The PCHA court refused to allow this impeachment testimony on the grounds that the allegedly recanting Commonwealth witness had not been shown to be unavailable.\nThe PCHA court correctly recognized that appellant\u2019s proffered testimony would not have passed muster under the three-pronged test articulated by this Court for after-discovered evidence:\n[T]he evidence must have been discovered after the trial and must be such that it could not have been obtained at the trial by reasonable diligence, must not be cumulative or merely impeach credibility, and must be such as would likely compel a different result.\nCommonwealth v. Schuck, 401 Pa. 222, 229, 164 A.2d 13, 17 (1960), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 884, 82 S.Ct. 138, 7 L.Ed.2d 188 (1961). See also Commonwealth v. Swanson, 432 Pa. 293, 248 A.2d 12 (1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 949, 89 S.Ct. 1287, 22 L.Ed.2d 483 (1969). Appellant thus is not entitled to a new trial on the grounds of after-discovered evidence.\nWe have considered fully appellant\u2019s arguments and have reviewed thoroughly the record of these proceedings. We find that none of appellant\u2019s claims warrant the grant of a new trial. Accordingly, we vacate our order of January 29, 1982 and affirm the order of the PCHA court.\nROBERTS, J., files a dissenting opinion, in which O\u2019BRIEN, C. J., joins.\nFLAHERTY, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. 1580, \u00a7 1 et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 et seq.\n. Appellant was sentenced to a term of ten to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment on his rape conviction.\n. See Pa.R.A.P. 2311.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722. This statute was amended subsequent to appellant\u2019s conviction, removing this Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from homicide convictions. Act of September 23, 1980, P.L. 686, No. 137, \u00a7 1.\n. The record clearly shows that appellant\u2019s defense to the rape and murder charges was that he was not in the Bradford County area when the crimes were committed. The time of the victim\u2019s death, which the Commonwealth and appellant vigorously disputed, thus became a crucial issue at trial. Appellant contended that the victim was murdered around November 1, 1973, only one day before her body was found. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, presented extensive evidence to show that the victim died on October 28 or 29, 1973, shortly after her family had last seen her and while appellant was still in the vicinity. See generally, Opinion of Williams, P. J., at 4 (Opinion filed October 8, 1975).\n. Mr. Walrath, appellant\u2019s private counsel, was appointed by the trial court at appellant\u2019s request to represent him in this case. See N.T. PCHA 8/21/79 p. 42. Mr. Walrath was assisted by two other court-appointed attorneys, three special investigators, a professional legal research group and a medical expert. See N.T. PCHA 8/21/79 p. 44.\n. Mr. Walrath admitted at the PCHA hearings that he did present the alibi defense, at least in part. See N.T. PCHA 8/21/79 p. 75; N.T. PCHA 10/3/79 pp. 18-19. This statement is strongly supported in the record. His introduction of several exhibits, his thorough and aggressive cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses and his exhaustive summation demonstrate a relentless and forceful attack on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as to the time of death.\n. It is well-settled that the credibility of witnesses in PCHA proceedings is exclusively within the province of the hearing court. Commonwealth v. Williams, 496 Pa. 486, 437 A.2d 1144 (1981); Commonwealth v. Alston, 473 Pa. 40, 373 A.2d 741 (1977); Commonwealth v. Smith, 454 Pa. 256, 312 A.2d 396 (1973). The hearing court\u2019s evidentiary findings are entitled to great weight on appeal. Id. See also, Commonwealth v. Lee, 478 Pa. 70, 385 A.2d 1317 (1978); Commonwealth v. Hauser, 450 Pa. 388, 299 A.2d 218 (1973).\n. Appellant himself, while not actually testifying, presented a closing argument at the second hearing in which he did not indicate in any way how his testimony would have aided the defense. N.T. PCHA 10/3/79 pp. 156-161. Moreover, whatever appellant\u2019s testimony might have been, he was not denied the opportunity to offer it at trial.\nWith regard to Trooper George, the record is barren of any potentially favorable evidence which could have been elicited from him. See Opinion of Williams, P. J., p. 6 (Opinion filed April 22, 1980). Furthermore, regarding Dr. King\u2019s testimony, Mr. Walrath admitted at the PCHA hearing that Dr. King had changed his opinion by the time of the trial, and agreed with the Commonwealth\u2019s expert concerning the time of the victim\u2019s death. N.T. PCHA 8/21/79 pp. 95-96.\n. We identified the issues on direct appeal more completely in a footnote:\nIn appellant\u2019s brief the following nine issues are raised: (1) the indictment was improper; ... and (9) the special prosecutor was guilty of misconduct. We see no jurisprudential need to discuss any of these assertions of error in this opinion.\nAdditionally, we have an independent responsibility to review the evidence to determine whether the record is sufficient to support a finding of murder in the first degree.... This we have done and are satisfied there is sufficient evidence to support the verdict.\nCommonwealth v. McKenna, 476 Pa. 428, 431-32 n.3, 383 A.2d at 174, 176 n.3 (1978).\n. In fact, appellant assumed the Commonwealth witness was available, but chose not to call him to testify. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 25.",

Shall we wait?\u201d\nThis prosecutorial tactic, of directing the jury\u2019s attention to the rear of the courtroom to await the \u201carrival\u201d of the deceased victim, is perhaps the most offensive tactic which has been subject to this Court\u2019s review over the past decade. This tactic has necessitated the vacation of numerable judgments of sentence. E.g., Commonwealth v. Cronin, 464 Pa. 138, 346 A.2d 59 (1978); Commonwealth v. Lark, 460 Pa. 399, 333 A.2d 786 (1975). See Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, 455 Pa. 525, 317 A.2d 205 (1974). Moreover, it is a tactic which this Court has repeatedly held to be so inherently prejudicial as to require defense objection. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Black, 480 Pa. 394, 390 A.2d 750 (1978); Commonwealth v. Evans, 479 Pa. 100, 387 A.2d 854 (1978). \u201cTrial counsel could not have had a reasonable basis designed to effectuate [his client\u2019s] interests when he failed to object to [these] prejudicial and inflammatory remarks.\u201d Commonwealth v. Black, supra, 480 Pa. at 397, 390 A.2d at 750.\nDespite appellant\u2019s entitlement to relief, the majority deems appellant\u2019s contention \u201cfinally litigated\u201d solely on the basis of the following passage from the Opinion of the Court filed upon the disposition of appellant\u2019s direct appeal:\n\u201cMcKenna alleges some nine trial errors, any one of which, he argues, requires the grant of a new trial. Having carefully reviewed the record, we find merit in none of these claims of error .... \u201d\n476 Pa. 428, 431, 383 A.2d 174, 176 (1978). Although the record establishes that appellant had indeed sought this Court\u2019s review of the prosecutor\u2019s prejudicial tactic, the record also establishes that appellant had failed to comply with the mandates of Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974) (timely objection required to preserve claims of error for appellate review). Thus, when in this case the Opinion of the Court stated that there was \u201cno merit\u201d to appellant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct, it must be concluded that that disposition meant only that appellant could not prevail on the claim because of its improper procedural posture.\nAs in Black and in Evans, where trial counsel failed to interpose objection in the face of an identical prosecutorial tactic, appellant must be granted relief.\nO\u2019BRIEN, C.

        "text": "FLAHERTY, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent. Trial counsel is alleged to have been ineffective for failing to present certain testimony favorable to the defense. Specifically, the available, albeit omitted, testimony consisted of, inter alia, the opinion of a forensic pathologist, Dr. Sopher, indicating that no scientific evidence, collected from the victim\u2019s body or from the crime scene, identified appellant as having committed the rape and murder in question. The opinion authored by Mr. Justice McDermott omits mention of this, the primary reason to have called Dr. Sopher to testify, and creates the impression that Dr. Sopher would have testified only as to the time of the victim\u2019s death. In the PCHA hearing, appellant\u2019s trial counsel testified as follows regarding his reasons for not presenting certain witnesses on behalf of the defense.\nQ. [W]as one of the other factors you considered the nature of Dr. Sopher\u2019s testimony?\nA. No.\nQ. Was it not a fact that Dr. Sopher could not establish a specific time of death but only give you a range as Dr. Catherman had already indicated?\nA. I think on the issue on the time of death Dr. Sopher\u2019s testimony would have been helpful to the defendant. I think it would have contradicted the testimony of the Commonwealth. I did not believe ... that Dr. Sopher\u2019s testimony would be strong enough to overcome the effect on the jury of the court\u2019s ruling not only on the prior crimes but other rulings throughout the case.... I felt that the defendant was protected enough on the record that it would be useless to present a ease on his behalf because I don\u2019t think it would have done any good.... I thought the record was replete with errors by the court that were prejudicial to the defendant that would deny him the right to a fair trial and it was senseless and useless to go on. That is exactly the basis of why we didn\u2019t call Dr. Sopher or any of the other witnesses.\nQ. [A]s of the time the Commonwealth completed its case was it your judgment that there was so much error on the record that a conviction could not stand up on appeal?\nA. It was my judgment, yes.\nQ. You\u2019re saying then you quit?\nA. It\u2019s not a question of quitting. It\u2019s making a conscious decision not\u2014\nQ. Not to fight?\nA. Not to put on an affirmative defense because the law does not require it. The Court has made so many errors, let the record stand the way it is. Maybe somebody will read the record. Maybe somebody will see the errors that were committed.\nQ. Did you see any advantage to Mr. McKenna in not presenting a full defense?\nA. I thought that the less the record was cluttered up by the defense by Mr. McKenna the more chance the Supreme Court would have to read the actual errors committed and discuss them and come to a ruling on them.\nQ. In other words you felt that a more extensive or complicated defense might cloud the issues that were already established. Is that what you\u2019re saying?\nA. That\u2019s correct.\nQ. Would it be accurate to say you felt that his best chance of an ultimate acquittal was a reversal in that case and a new trial under other circumstances?\nA. My aim was not so much acquittal, my aim was to protect Mr. McKenna\u2019s rights and see that he got a fair trial and when I reached the point where I felt he was not being given a fair trial and there was nothing more I could do to see that he got a fair trial, I felt the Court and everybody else was entitled to us taking the position we\u2019re going to stop right here.\n******\nQ. And you felt that way because you felt in that way you could best preserve the uncluttered record for appeal. Is that right? If in fact he was convicted.\nA. Well, I felt there was no question we\u2019d get a new trial. I don\u2019t know about cluttering up the record. I just didn\u2019t want to waste any more time. I felt that the trial was a complete waste of time and I so conveyed my feelings to Mr. McKenna, and he had conveyed them to me on numerous occasions throughout all the proceedings.\n******\nQ. Did you just say to him, Mr. McKenna, there\u2019s nothing we can do. Let\u2019s stop putting on a defense?\nA. I said, Mr. McKenna, as far as I\u2019m concerned right now they\u2019re going to find you guilty.... I don\u2019t want to be sacrilegious but I don\u2019t think if the Good Lord himself took the stand right now that jury would find you not guilty. They\u2019ve got this thing so screwed up, there\u2019s been so many errors and so many mistakes made in this case that there\u2019s nothing the jury can do.\n(Emphasis added.)\nIn short, trial counsel decided that the trial was so unfair that any conviction resulting therefrom would be reversed on appeal and that it was, therefore, futile to proceed with a defense directed at achieving an acquittal, which, in view of the errors alleged, counsel perceived to be unattainable. In so doing, however, counsel presumed to know what the effect upon the jury would be of the evidence which he refrained from presenting, thereby denying appellant the benefit of having testimony considered by the jury. This evidence, although perhaps not determinative of guilt, would nevertheless have contributed to the defense\u2019s position. Trial counsel articulated no legitimate tactical reason for the failure to present the testimony in question, and counsel provided ineffective representation by, in effect, taking it upon himself to terminate the trial while elevating his judgment to that of an appellate court in evaluating the ramifications of the errors alleged.\n. The situation presented in this case is not one where counsel, after consideration of recognized tactical alternatives, determined that certain witnesses should not be called to testify. Counsel\u2019s realm of discretion over the choice of tactics employed is broad, and that discretion necessarily includes the exercise of judgment about whether the presentation of particular witnesses\u2019 testimony would, considering all relevant factors, be beneficial to the client\u2019s case.
