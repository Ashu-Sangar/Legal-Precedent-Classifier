        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThe Commonwealth seeks allowance of appeal from an order of the Superior Court granting respondent a new trial on burglary, robbery, kidnapping, and related charges. Respondent was found guilty of the charges by a court sitting without a jury. The Superior Court granted relief on the ground that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to object to a defective jury-trial-waiver colloquy.\nOur Rules of Criminal Procedure require a trial judge to ascertain whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to trial by jury \u201cis a knowing and intelligent waiver, and such colloquy shall appear on the record.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1101. For the waiver to be \u201cknowing and intelligent,\u201d the defendant must know \u201cthe essential ingredients of a jury trial\u201d\u2014\n\u201cthe requirements that the jury be chosen from members of the community (a jury of one\u2019s peers), that the verdict be unanimous, and that the accused be allowed to participate in the selection of the jury panel.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 454 Pa. 368, 373, 312 A.2d 597, 600 (1973).\nThe record is clear that respondent\u2019s understanding of these \u201cessential ingredients\u201d is not reflected in the on-the-record colloquy mandated by Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1101. Although the judge explored respondent\u2019s understanding of the fact that \u201ca jury would consist of twelve people who would be selected and sworn from a larger panel of jurors from all over [the county],\u201d he did not explore respondent\u2019s understanding of either the fact that the jury\u2019s verdict would have to be unanimous or the fact that respondent could participate in jury selection.\nDespite the deficient colloquy, the record also is clear that, at the close of the colloquy, respondent signed a written form which states that respondent \u201cfully understand^]\u201d the ingredients of a jury trial, including the unanimity and defendant-participation requirements which were not explained in the colloquy. This form was also signed by respondent\u2019s counsel and by the trial judge who had conducted the colloquy.\nAlthough the Superior Court acknowledged that respondent had signed the form reflecting respondent\u2019s full understanding of the right to a jury trial, the Superior Court felt obliged to order a new trial under this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Morin, 477 Pa. 80, 383 A.2d 832 (1978). There, a new trial was granted on a record that contained nothing other than a colloquy which was manifestly defective under the requirements of Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1101. Thus \u201cthe only conclusion possible [was] that [the defendant\u2019s] previous counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue of the validity of the jury trial waiver.\u201d 477 Pa. at 86, 383 A.2d at 832.\nHere, although the colloquy did not include an explanation of the unanimity and defendant-participation requirements, the written form signed by respondent, his counsel, and the court states that respondent was indeed fully aware of these requirements. This form must be accorded prima facie validity. Cf. Commonwealth v. Myrick, 468 Pa. 155, 161, 360 A.2d 598, 601 (1976) (either colloquy or signed statement reflecting defendant\u2019s waiver of rights pursuant to Pa.R. Crim.Proc. 1100 \u201cwould by themselves be sufficient record indication that the waiver was, prima facie, informed and voluntary\u201d).\nFrom the record, including the brief of respondent filed with the Superior Court, it is clear that respondent has in no respect questioned the validity of the signed waiver form. Therefore, we must conclude on the basis of the present record that respondent was aware of his rights, and that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to defects in the colloquy. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Rice, 456 Pa. 90, 318 A.2d 705 (1974) (counsel not ineffective for failing to pursue baseless claim).\nPetition for allowance of appeal granted. Order of the Superior Court vacated, 297 Pa.Super. 63, 443 A.2d 299, and record remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nThe Superior Court did not consider other claims in support of a new trial which had been presented by respondent. Thus our disposition does not affect respondent\u2019s right to renew these other claims in further proceedings before the Superior Court.",
