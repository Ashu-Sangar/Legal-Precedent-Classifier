        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nTestator Lewis A. Riley died on April 23, 1925, leaving a will dated October 25,1922, and a codicil dated June 3,1924, establishing a trust from the residue of his estate. At issue on this appeal is whether appellees, two adopted children of one of testator\u2019s grandchildren, are entitled to share in the trust principal. We agree with the unanimous determination of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia that appellees are so entitled and, accordingly, affirm.\nItem Fifth(d) of testator\u2019s will provides:\n\u201cWhen and as any grandchild of mine receiving income as aforesaid who may have been bom in my lifetime, shall die, said Trustees shall pay over, transfer, and convey such part or share of the capital or principle of said Trust as may have been held as aforesaid for the use and benefit of such grandchild so dying, absolutely, clear of all trusts, per stirpes and by representation, unto the then living issue of such grandchild so dying as aforesaid . . .. \u201d\nUpon the death in 1977 of appellees\u2019 adoptive mother, Jean B. Croft, the trustees filed an accounting, recommending that the one-third share of trust principal from which Mrs. Croft had been receiving income be distributed to appellees pursuant to the above testamentary direction. Appellants, other grandchildren and great-grandchildren of testator, objected to the proposed distribution. They argued that testator\u2019s references to beneficiaries in other paragraphs of his will and codicil as \u201cissue born ... of children of mine\u201d and \u201cgrandchildren . .. born in my lifetime\u201d demonstrate a clear intent to exclude adopted children from participation in the trust.\nAs the auditing judge, Pawelec, J., correctly noted, these references cannot be read to indicate a clear intent to exclude adoptees as beneficiaries even within these paragraphs. A fortiori, they cannot support the argument that testator intended to exclude appellees from their share of trust principal as directed in Item Fifth(d), where the only direction is that principal be distributed to \u201cliving issue.\u201d See Farmers Trust Co. v. Bashore, 498 Pa. 146, 445 A.2d 492 (1982).\nWhere, as here, a testator has expressed no clear intent with regard to adopted children and directs only that a distribution be made to \u201cissue,\u201d it is a settled canon of construction that the testator intended to include adopted children within his bounty. Estate of Sykes, 477 Pa. 254, 383 A.2d 920 (1978) (bequest to \u201cissue\u201d presumed to include adopted children); Estate of Sewell, 487 Pa. 379, 409 A.2d 401 (1979) (same). See Tafel Estate, 449 Pa. 442, 296 A.2d 797 (1972) (adopted children permitted to take under bequest to testator\u2019s \u201cchildren\u201d); Estate of Flinn, 479 Pa. 312, 388 A.2d 672 (1978) (bequest to \u201cchildren\u201d of testator\u2019s children presumed to include adoptees); Estate of DeRoy, 481 Pa. 403, 392 A.2d 1355 (1978) (adopted child permitted to take under bequest to \u201cchildren\u201d of testator\u2019s children); Estate of Biddle, 487 Pa. 616, 410 A.2d 782 (1980) (adopted child permitted to take under bequest to \u201cchildren and issue\u201d of testator\u2019s grandchildren). See also Farmers Trust Co. v. Bashore, supra (conveyance to \u201cchildren\u201d of settlor\u2019s children in inter vivos trust presumed to include adoptee). Thus, as the orphans\u2019 court correctly concluded, appellees are entitled to their mother\u2019s share of trust principal.\nDecree affirmed. Costs on appellant.",
