On October 17,1978, the court of common pleas directed Wells Fargo to commence construction of a theatre building within thirty days or post a supersedeas bond in the amount of $200,000. Wells Fargo then appealed to the Superior Court, but did <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>not file a bond or seek an alternate stay. See Pa.R.A.P. 1732. While the appeal was pending, appellee sought to have Wells Fargo held in contempt for its noncompliance with the decree. On December 11, 1978, the court of common pleas denied appellee’s request, concluding “that it is not in the best interest of either side for construction to commence pending appeal ... [and] that a supersedeas bond is the least burdensome remedy.” Nonetheless, Wells Fargo continued to refuse to file a bond or begin construction.</p>

Wells Fargo also seeks a remand of the record for the fashioning of additional “appropriate relief.” Presumably the latter request for relief reflects Wells Fargo’s belief that it has been harmed by its having to construct the theatre at 1979 prices, instead of prices in effect in 1973, when the building was to have been built.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

We perceive no basis for addressing the merits of the controversy on a theory that collateral estoppel would be asserted to prevent Wells Fargo from initiating any future civil action against Easton Theatres. The only determination of the Superior Court from which Wells Fargo has chosen to appeal is that relating to the decree of specific performance. Wells Fargo has not challenged the Superior Court’s conclusion that Wells Fargo’s breach of the lease agreement may entitle Easton to recover lost profits. See supra note 2. Thus, any possibility of collateral estoppel arising from a dismissal of this appeal is a possibility of Wells Fargo’s own making, and may not influence this Court’s decision on whether to address the issue of specific performance long after the theatre has been built.

The dispute arose from a construction-lease executed by the parties in February of 1972 and amended in July of that year. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, within sixty days of execution, Easton would submit plans for the construction of the theatre and Wells Fargo would attempt to secure financing for the construction. If Wells Fargo were not able to secure financing, Easton would then have sixty days to secure financing on the same terms as those sought by Wells Fargo.

Nevertheless, the parties agreed that Easton would attempt to secure financing, and in the fall of 1972 Easton obtained a mortgage commitment from an affiliated company. Wells Fargo rejected this commitment because it contravened the terms of the lease. <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>Negotiations continued, and in April of 1973 Easton obtained a permanent mortgage commitment from the Continental Bank in Philadelphia.

This order was based on the chancellor’s finding that while Wells Fargo did not breach the lease in rejecting the first mortgage commitment obtained by Easton, Wells Fargo did breach the lease in rejecting the commitment offered by Continental Bank. Further, the chancellor ordered that the parties share equally any cost of construction in excess of $215,000.00, but denied Easton’s claim for monetary damages. The <em>en banc </em>Court of Common Pleas of the Third Judicial District affirmed and adopted as its own the chancellor’s adjudication, and on cross-appeals to the Superior Court, the Superior Court affirmed the lower court as to the order requiring specific performance, but reversed, remanding to the chancellor, the denial of Easton’s claim for monetary damages, and remanding also for a redistribution of costs in excess of $215,000.00 based on responsibility for the delay.

It is clear from the record and the lease that the parties intended the mortgagee’s recourse in the event of default to be limited to the leased premises. Whether such a bargain is ordinary or wise is not our inquiry. Our function and the proper function of the chancellor is to enforce the terms of the agreement insofar as they may be determined with certainty. Wells Fargo committed no breach of the terms of the lease by declining to agree to provide the <em>additional security, </em>to wit, a bond or a note, required by Continental Bank as security in excess of that provided for in the lease.</p>

At 1372-1373. Although a bond executed in connection with a mortgage does not always involve personal liability of the mortgagor (see discussion <em>supra) </em>personal liability on the bond is the rule and its absence the exception. <em>See </em>Ladner, <em>Conveyancing in Pennsylvania, </em>§ 9.01, § 9.22 (3d Edition, 1961). It was reasonable, therefore, for Wells Fargo to assume that personal liability was intended and to have refused the offer for that reason. If Continental Bank did not intend that Wells Fargo be personally liable on the bond, it could have communicated that intention clearly.</p>
    <p id="b632-5" data-blocks='[["BL_632.5",632,[270,1279,1145,372]]]'>The majority also implies that Wells Fargo may not have been harmed by having to construct the theatre at 1979 prices under mortgage terms to which it did not consent. At 1373, n.3. It is sufficient to respond that Wells Fargo’s realization of greater tax advantages in depreciating the building goes to the amount of loss it suffered, not to the existence of damages.</p>
    <p id="b632-6" data-blocks='[["BL_632.6",632,[269,1687,1147,643]]]'>Additionally, in dismissing this appeal, the majority misplaces its reliance on the principle that “Ordinarily, a party who consents to, or acquiesces in, a judgment or order cannot appeal therefrom,” At 1373. To no extent can the timely appeal taken by Wells Fargo challenging the validity of the trial court’s order be regarded as manifesting consent to and acquiescence in the order in question. As the majority itself observes, Wells Fargo did not begin construction until after the Superior Court affirmed the decree of specific performance and the court of common pleas held Wells Fargo in contempt. This can hardly be called acquiescence or consent to a judgment order.</p>

      <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>By holding the instant appeal to be moot, the majority places a new limitation on appeal rights not heretofore in existence. While Wells Fargo refrained from pursuing its option under Pa.R.A.P. 1732 of seeking a stay, and the alternative of posting a supersedeas bond, it acted within its rights in so doing. The record in the present case does not establish the reason for Wells Fargo’s decision to build the theatre rather than post a supersedeas bond. It may be that the cost of the bond, coupled with the conviction that the lower courts were in error on the merits of the case, and the business decision that it would be less costly to build a theatre under adverse contractual conditions than to tie up the land with no use at all for an additional extended period of time, pending appeal to this Court, led Wells Fargo to build the theatre rather than post the bond.</p>
    <p id="b633-4" data-blocks='[["BL_633.4",633,[215,1152,1141,590]]]'>In any case, as the majority correctly points out, Wells Fargo was given the choice by order of the court of common pleas of building the theatre or posting a $200,000 supersede-as bond. The purpose of the bond is to protect the interests of the judgment creditor, and so long as that interest is protected, the choice of how it shall be protected — by specific performance or by the posting of a bond — is that of the judgment debtor. Appeal rights are not cut off merely because the judgment debtor exercises one of the options offered by the trial court, unless, of course, the case becomes moot as a result of an action by that party.</p>

Wells Fargo will, in the language of the <em>Carros </em>case, continue to suffer detriment from the lower court’s decision, and the case should not be dismissed as moot for this reason alone.
