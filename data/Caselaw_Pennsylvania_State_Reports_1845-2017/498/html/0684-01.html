Cusma, Secretary of the State Employees’ Retirement System and Robert E. Casey, Treasurer of the Commonwealth.

In <em>Baker, </em>the employee retired from the City of Pittsburgh in 1929 and began collecting a pension. Almost immediately thereafter, he commenced employment with Allegheny County. In 1937, the county pension law was amended to prohibit any county employee from qualifying for a pension if that employee was receiving another governmental pension while in the county’s employ. When Baker retired from the county, he was denied pension benefits because of the 1937 amendment. Despite the fact that Baker had neither worked the necessary number of years nor reached the required age to qualify for a pension from the county at the time of the 1937 amendment, the Court held that the changes wrought by the amendment did not apply to Baker.</p>

I believe the analysis used for plaintiffs’ impairment of contract claim is apt here. It must be remembered that total compensation has two components, i.e. present and deferred. While the deferred portion may be reduced, the decreased present contributions will give the judges an increase in presently spendable income. Further, Art.

      <em>Cf. Allen v.

The right of plaintiffs Catania, Sweet, and Beckert to participate under the benefits package of the Code of 1959 is of course conditioned upon their willingness to pay into the retirement fund in accordance with the provisions of the Code of 1959. Throughout the history of our Commonwealth’s retirement system, the benefits payable to a pensioner have been directly proportional to the contributions which the pensioner has made to the retirement system during active state service. Under the Code of 1959, a member of the judiciary is eligible for benefits on the basis of a “class of service multiplier” of 2.00 for the first ten years of service, and 1.50 for those years of service in excess of ten. The member is subject to the same multiplier of 2.00 and 1.50 for purposes of calculat<a id="p703" href="#p703" data-label="703" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*703</a>ing contributions. When in 1974 the Legislature adopted its new retirement Code, and reduced the benefits multipliers by 25%, the contribution multipliers were reduced by an identical percentage. Under the Code of 1974 both the benefits multiplier and the contributions multiplier were reduced to 1.50 for the first ten years of service and to 1.125 for years of service in excess of ten. Thus it is obvious that plaintiffs would reap a substantial windfall directly affecting the integrity of the fund if they could elect to receive benefits under the Code of 1959 while contributing only at the rates prescribed under the Code of 1974.</p>
