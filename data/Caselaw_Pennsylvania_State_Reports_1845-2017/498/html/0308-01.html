Moreover, the police had a legitimate basis for being virtually certain that appellant already knew the purpose of their visit and that an announcement would have been a useless gesture. The police were aware in this instance that just a few hours before, appellant had telephoned the victim and threatened to harm her if she reported the crime to the police. Thus, when the police arrived, knocked on the door, identified themselves and received no response, they were justified in concluding that appellant was inside, was not going to respond and was aware of the officers’ presence and purpose. The failure of the officers to expressly announce their purpose prior to entry was therefore justified. <em>Cf. United States v.

The suspect was found hiding within the residence. The court held that an announcement of purpose would have been a useless gesture). The twenty minute delay, considered by the dissent conclusively to preclude a finding of exigency, is indicative of nothing more than an extremely cautious and circumspect approach to a potentially violent situation and in no way vitiated the underlying exigency.</p>

    <p id="b390-6" data-blocks='[["BL_390.6",390,[292,607,1146,667]]]'>The majority has erroneously treated two separate, independent searches of appellant’s bedroom as one and hence has erroneously concluded that evidence in “plain view” was constitutionally obtained. The knife which the victim identified at trial as having been used by appellant was recovered by police not during a protective search “to insure their safety” but during the same unjustified search of the bedroom which the majority holds resulted in the unconstitutional seizure of the gun. The conclusion is inescapable that not simply the gun but also the knife seized during that search was unconstitutionally obtained and that the admission of both of these weapons into evidence was reversible error. Thus I dissent.</p>

Where, as here, the police unjustifiably intrude upon a person’s privacy, any evidence seized during that unconstitutional intrusion whether concealed or in “plain view” is unconstitutionally obtained.
