Konz and Stephen R. C. Erikson, subsequent to their being found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in a trial by jury. The prosecution of Dorothy Konz arose from her failure to comply with an alleged duty to seek medical assistance for Reverend David G. Konz, her husband, when he was stricken with a diabetic crisis which proved fatal. The prosecution of Erikson rested upon his alleged role as an accomplice in that breach of duty.</p>

      <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as verdict winner, the following facts were established at trial. In September, 1973, Reverend Konz, while serving as a teacher, counselor, and chaplain at United Wesleyan College, became acquainted with Erikson, a student at the College. A close friendship, based on their common interest in religion, formed between Erikson and Reverend Konz as the former became a regular visitor at the latter’s residence.</p>
    <p id="b707-5" data-blocks='[["BL_707.4",707,[193,734,1142,679]]]'>Reverend Konz was a thirty-four year old diabetic and had, for seventeen years, administered to himself daily doses of insulin. On March 4,1974, however, following an encounter on campus with a visiting evangelist speaker, Reverend Konz publicly proclaimed his desire to discontinue insulin treatment in reliance on the belief that God would heal the diabetic condition. He assured the president of the College and members of the student body that he would carefully monitor his condition and would, if necessary, take insulin. On only one or two occasions did the Reverend thereafter administer insulin. On March 18, 1974, however, Erikson and Reverend Konz formed a pact to pray together to enable the latter to resist the temptation to administer insulin.</p>
    <p id="b707-6" data-blocks='[["BL_707.5",707,[190,1430,1143,789]],["BL_708.1",708,[262,296,1147,1533]]]'>Mrs. Konz was informed of the prayer pact, and, on the morning of Saturday, March 23, 1974, when her husband evidenced symptoms of insulin debt, she removed his insulin from the refrigerator and concealed it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Later that day, the Reverend attempted to obtain insulin from the refrigerator, and, upon discovering that the medicine had been removed, strongly indicated that it should be returned. He then attempted to proceed from room to room but his passage was blocked by Erikson. Harsh words were exchanged, and Erikson, after kneeling in prayer, forced the Reverend into a bedroom where, accompanied by Mrs. Konz, Erikson and the Reverend conversed for approximately one half hour. During that time, the Reverend tried to telephone police to obtain assistance but was prevented from doing so by Erik-son and Mrs. Konz, who, during a struggle with the Rever<a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>end, rendered at least that telephone permanently inoperable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Immediately after this confrontation, the Reverend, his wife, and Erikson returned amicably to the kitchen for coffee, and no further request for insulin was ever made. In addition, the Reverend approached his aunt who resided in the same household and stated, in an apparent reference to the preceding confrontation with Erikson, that “It’s all settled now,” and told her that there was no cause for concern. He also told his eleven year old daughter that “Everything is fine,” and indicated to her that he did not intend to take insulin. The Reverend then departed from the house, accompanied by Erikson, and returned an hour later. As the day progressed, Reverend Konz cancelled his speaking commitment for the following day and drove his wife to an institution having hospital facilities to pick up a close friend who was a practical nurse. Late on Saturday night, while waiting inside the institution for the nurse to complete her duties, the Reverend appeared very fatigued and complained that he was developing an upset stomach. Both of these conditions were symptomatic of lack of insulin, but neither the Reverend nor his wife requested that insulin, which was available at the institution, be administered. With regard to the Reverend’s condition at that time, the nurse observed that he travelled with unimpaired mobility, and that he was conversant, rational, and cognizant of his environs. Nevertheless, he made no mention of a need for insulin, and the nurse made no inquiry as to such a need because the Reverend had on a previous day become very upset at her inquiry as to his diabetic condition.</p>
    <p id="b708-5" data-blocks='[["BL_708.4",708,[262,1845,1147,365]],["BL_709.1",709,[213,283,1139,569]]]'>Upon returning home from this errand, Reverend Konz experienced increasing illness, vomiting intermittently Saturday night and Sunday morning, and remained in bed all day Sunday except for trips into the bathroom. On Sunday afternoon visitors arrived at the Konz residence. The Reverend, recognizing their voices, called to them from his room to inquire whether they wished to see him; having <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>been informed of the Reverend’s nausea, however, the visitors declined to stay. As the Reverend’s condition worsened and he became restless, his wife and Erikson administered cracked ice but did not summon medical aid. The Konz’s eleven year old daughter then inquired as to why a doctor had not been summoned but Mrs. Konz responded that her husband was “going to be getting better.” Late Sunday night or early Monday morning everyone in the household fell asleep. On Monday morning at approximately 6 AM, while the others were still asleep, Reverend Konz died of diabetic ketoacidosis.</p>
    <p id="b709-5" data-blocks='[["BL_709.4",709,[208,881,1143,1102]]]'>Appellants were found guilty by a jury of the crime of involuntary manslaughter pursuant to Section 2504 of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, which provides: “A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2504. To impose criminal liability for an omission as opposed to an act, the omission must be “expressly made sufficient by the law defining the offense.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 301(b)(1), or “a duty to perform the omitted act [must be] otherwise imposed by law.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 301(b)(2). Since the involuntary manslaughter provision of the Crimes Code does not expressly address omissions as a basis for liability, only 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 301(b)(2) has potential applicability. The determinative issue on appeal, therefore, is whether Mrs. Konz had a duty to seek medical attention for her spouse. Under the circumstances of this case, we find no such duty to have been present; hei ce, the conviction of Mrs. Konz, and that of Erikson as . er accomplice, cannot be sustained.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The inherent dependency of a child upon his parent to obtain medical aid, i.e., the incapacity of a child to evaluate his condition and summon aid by himself, supports imposition of such a duty upon the parent.</p>
    <p id="b710-5" data-blocks='[["BL_710.4",710,[287,1034,1148,1101]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that the marital relationship gives rise to a similar duty to aid one’s spouse. Spouses, however, do not generally suffer the same incapacity as do children with respect to the ability to comprehend their states of health and obtain medical assistance. We reject, therefore, the holding of the Superior Court that the marital relationship gives rise to an unrestricted duty for one spouse to summon medical aid whenever the other is in a serious or immediate need of medical attention. Recognition of such a duty would place lay persons in peril of criminal prosecution while compelling them to medically diagnose the seriousness of their spouses’ illnesses and injuries. In addition, it would impose an obligation for a spouse to take action at a time when the stricken individual competently chooses <em>not </em>to receive assistance. The marital relationship gives rise to an expectation of reliance between spouses, and to a belief that one’s spouse should be trusted to respect, rather than ignore, one’s expressed preferences. That expectation would be frustrated by imposition of a broad duty to seek aid, since one’s spouse would then be forced to ignore the expectation that the preference to forego assistance will be honored.</p>

Soon after giving birth, however, she suffered complications; the defendant then summoned a physician, but the physician was unable, at that point, to prevent the wife’s death. Finding that the defendant had acted in good faith and at his wife’s competent request in not obtaining aid sooner, the court found no breach of duty to the wife. Reversing the conviction, the court stated:</p>

Hence, assuming that one spouse owes the other a duty to seek aid when the latter is unwillingly rendered incompetent to evaluate the need for aid, or helpless to obtain it, that duty would not have been breached under the facts presented.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The Reverend not only remained silent as to a desire for insulin, however, but even took the initiative to <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>reassure his aunt and daughter that there was no cause for concern. This course of behavior is inconsistent with any conclusion other than that the Reverend, by Saturday evening, had become firmly resolved to abstain from the administration of insulin. Had the Reverend been dissatisfied with his treatment, as a diabetic would be in the event of being forcibly denied insulin, he presumably would have attempted to obtain the medication or to call his dissatisfaction to the attention of persons with whom he came in contact. Yet, the record is devoid of any evidence that such an effort was made. Nor can the Reverend’s acquiescence be attributed to a lack of mental competency to comprehend and militate against his plight. The testimony of the nurse with whom the Reverend conversed on Saturday night, as well as the Reverend’s reaction to the presence of visitors in his home on Sunday, indicate clearly that the Reverend was in an alert and rational condition. Hence, the conclusion is inescapable that Reverend Konz, having been a diabetic for seventeen years, was aware of the importance of insulin to the preservation of his life but competently chose to forego treatment. Under this circumstance, we find no breach of duty to have been incurred by Mrs. Konz in her failure to seek medical aid for her husband.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

However, the dissent fails to mention that the trial court gave numerous additional instructions which would have permitted the jury to return verdicts of guilty notwithstanding Reverend Konz’s rational decision to abstain from seeking medical assistance.</p>

The <em>r </em>made him the unwilling prisoner of the resolve he had ab idoned. Appellants’ determination, <em>their </em>faith and <em>their </em>hope were substituted for his. From the evidence as accepted by the jury, there can be no question that appellants recklessly sacrificed the life of David Konz for <em>their </em>belief. They purposely isolated him and denied him access to help; they watched and ministered to his last extremity and brought ice packs to tide him over the gap between <em>their </em>faith and the miracle. He had pain and vomited. Visitors were told simply that he was resting. Wherever he went, one of the appellants went also. Help, but a needle point away, was discouraged and denied. His eleven year-old daughter, a witness to his forceable imprisonment, asked why a physician was not summoned. Reverend Konz died at 6:00 a. m. on Monday, March 25,1974, the victim of a ruthless, reckless determination that he be cured.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>
