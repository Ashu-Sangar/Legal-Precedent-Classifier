If the original decision is not disturbed by the finding of the subsequent tribunal, this interest of double jeopardy is not offended.

In that opinion the Court sought to determine what decisions were in fact made by the first jury passing upon the facts. Thus the question was reduced to a determination of what issues were decided by the initial factfinder in reaching its result. In <em>Ashe, </em>where the question was one of issue preclusion (also referred to as collateral estoppel) the Court fashioned the rule that collateral estoppel bars a redetermination of those issues <em>necessarily </em>determined between the parties in the first proceedings. <em>Commonwealth v. Hude, </em><a href="/pa/492/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="492 Pa. 600" data-case-ids="1767214" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0600-01">492 Pa. 600</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="492 Pa. 600" data-case-ids="1767214" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0600-01">425 A.2d 313</a> (1980). Following this analysis the court below concluded that the <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>acquittal of the assault charge was limited to a determination that appellant was not guilty of the confrontation with the victim that occurred inside the establishment. From this premise the court reasoned that the acquittal of the assault charge inside the tavern would not preclude a second jury’s finding that appellant was responsible for the homicide that occurred thereafter outside of the tavern.</p>
    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.4",184,[263,737,1147,816]]]'>The fallacy of this analysis is that the <em>Ashe </em>approach is required where there is <em>a </em>general verdict and the question to be answered is which issues were necessarily decided in defendant’s favor by the first jury in reaching that verdict. Where, as here, a verdict was returned to a specific information such an analysis is not appropriate. The language of the information is controlling as to the meaning of the jury’s finding. The instant information does not make the distinction sought to be drawn. To the contrary, the information clearly and unambiguously covered any assault on the person of the deceased on the day in question occurring in the county of Delaware. The acquittal entered on this information speaks for itself and is the finding by the original jury that appellant did not assault the victim at the time and place the homicide occurred.</p>
