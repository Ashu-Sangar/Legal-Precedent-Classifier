The record indicates that voir dire commenced that day, the 263rd day after the filing of the complaints, and that the presentation of evidence began on July 17, the 264th day.</p>

In denying relief, the post-verdict court proceeded on the belief that trial had commenced in 238 days. This 238-day figure reflected the court’s view that Rule 1100’s 180-day period had begun to run on November 20, 1974, the date on which the indictments against petitioner were returned, and ended on July 16, 1975, when voir dire began.</p>

This assumption reflected the view that the start of the Rule 1100 period was marked by the filing of the written complaints, rather than the return of the indictments, with the end of the Rule 1100 period being marked by the presentation of evidence, rather than the commencement of voir dire.</p>

The seventy-six excluded days represent the duration of all defense-requested continuances that were accompanied by “waivers” of Rule 1100 rights. Not excluded were the days between the expiration of the second of the two defense continuances and the commencement of trial. While the trial court had excluded these days on the basis of the belief that appellee had “unconditionally” waived his Rule 1100 rights, the Superior Court held that appellee’s waiver was effective only through June 30, 1975, the date to which the matter had been continued a second time at the request of the defense.</p>

    <p id="b452-7" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[283,714,1149,1072]]]'>In interpreting subdivision (1), this Court has made it clear that the period of excludable days is not necessarily measured by the length of time that a defendant was “unavailable.” Instead, once it is determined that the defendant was unavailable, the critical inquiry is whether actual delay resulted from the defendant’s unavailability. “If the ‘unavailability’ results in an actual delay in the proceedings, that delay is automatically excluded.” <em>Commonwealth v. Millhouse, </em><a href="/pa/470/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="470 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1723880" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0512-01">470 Pa. 512</a>, 517, <a href="/pa/470/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="470 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1723880" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0512-01">368 A.2d 1273</a>, 1276 (1977). So, too, under subdivision (2) it must be concluded that although a defense-requested continuance which exceeds thirty days serves as a triggering device for exclusion, the number of days to be excluded is not governed solely by the length of the continuance. Rather, as under subdivision (1), the number of days to be excluded is that “period of delay ... as results from” the continuance. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Wade, </em><a href="/pa/475/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="475 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="1734075" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0399-01">475 Pa. 399</a>, 405-406, <a href="/pa/475/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="475 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="1734075" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0399-01">380 A.2d 782</a>, 785 (1977) (excludable delay caused by open-ended continuance measured from date of continuance request to end of delay).

That continuance necessitated the placement of the matter on “backup” status behind two cases. Consistent with the court’s business, those two cases were disposed of without undue delay, in sixteen days, and the trial of this case commenced immediately thereafter. The sixteen-day period during which the matter was on “backup” status must, therefore, be attributed to appellee.</p>
