Appellant challenges the sufficiency and weight of the evidence to sustain his conviction for murder of the third degree, his competency to stand trial, trial counsel’s failure to raise an insanity defense, numerous trial court rulings and the severity of his sentence. As none of appellant’s claims merits relief, we affirm.</p>

Viewed in <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, the evidence established that, approximately an hour before the offense, the victim’s daughter overheard a telephone conversation between the victim and appellant in which appellant said that “he was going to go to [the victim’s] house and hit [the victim] and put her in the hospital.” Appellant arrived at the victim’s home shortly after 4:00 p. m., and said to the daughter, “I just came here to kill your mother.” Appellant then took a .38 caliber revolver from his car and fired several shots, killing the victim. After the shooting appellant argued with the victim’s daughter and then drove to the home of a friend, a local constable. He gave the constable the gun and asked to be taken to the police department. Upon appellant’s arrest, a .38 caliber live cartridge was found in his pants pocket during a pat down search of his person. After being taken into custody, appellant consented to a dermal nitrate test, which subsequently showed gunpowder patterns on his hands.</p>
    <p id="b456-5" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[284,1303,1147,730]]]'>The defense introduced expert testimony that at the time of the offense appellant was suffering from hypertension and chronic alcohol abuse. Appellant testified that he had drunk several “shots” of whiskey and several beers during the morning and afternoon immediately preceding the shooting. In his testimony, appellant attributed the shooting to an accident. He said that, although he could not recall the shooting itself, he recalled having seen the daughter come out of the house carrying the revolver. The daughter pointed the gun at him, and he then grasped the daughter’s hand to push the gun away. After the gun had discharged, shooting the victim, the daughter threw the gun to the ground. According to appellant, he picked up the gun and took it with him to the home of his friend, the constable.</p>

The remaining claims of ineffective assistance <em>concern </em>trial counsel’s failure to object to the court’s instruction to the jury on the charge of voluntary manslaughter. The court instructed the jury, in relevant part: “A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter if, at the time of the killing, he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual killed or by another whom the actor endeavors to kill, but negligently or accidentally causes the death of the individual killed.” As this instruction reflects the statutory requirements for voluntary manslaughter, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2503, appellant’s claim that counsel should have objected to the reference to “serious provocation” is without merit. Appellant’s second claim is that counsel should have requested the court to instruct the jury to consider whether the victim had aroused sufficient passion in appellant to support a verdict of voluntary manslaughter. The court did instruct the jury to consider whether the victim’s daughter had seriously provoked appellant into sudden and intense passion, causing him to endeavor to kill the daughter but resulting in the negligent or accidental death of the victim. In light of the dearth of evidence at trial regarding any provocation by the victim, counsel’s failure to make such a request, as well as her failure to object to the court’s comment that “there is no evidence at all that [the victim] did anything except be there,” had a reasonable basis.

The trial court also acted within its discretion in giving a cautionary instruction to the jury, and refusing to grant a mistrial, when the prosecutor improperly assumed facts not in evidence in questioning a witness. The court’s refusal to give all appellant’s requests for charge to the jury was similarly within the court’s discretion, as was the court’s denial of appellant’s request for daily transcripts.</p>
