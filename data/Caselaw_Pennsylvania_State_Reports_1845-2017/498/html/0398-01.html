The conflict is between the law of this Commonwealth and that of our sister, the garden state of New Jersey. The controversy is directly stated: until 1978, the state of New Jersey denied an attesting witness to a will any benefit under that will. Pennsylvania did not. Nancy M. Janney, a Pennsylvania domiciliary, executed a will leaving her entire estate to her sister, Carolyn Case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Ms. Case was named executrix and subscribed as one of two attesting witnesses. The estate consisted of various assets situate in Pennsylvania, and realty located in New Jersey. During the course of administration, the property was sold. Distribution of the proceeds of the sale of that real property, the subject matter here, was excepted to by intestate heirs in the Orphans Court of Monroe County, Pennsylvania. They excepted alleging that since the testatrix died in 1974, the law then extant in the state of New Jersey denied an attesting witness benefit under the will. The exceptions were sustained, and an intestacy as to the proceeds of the New Jersey property was declared.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ms. Case, executrix and beneficiary appeals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We reverse.</p>

    <p id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[246,1421,1150,786]]]'>Three considerations lead to the conclusion that New Jersey would give effect to testatrix’s clear intent: first, as the property has been sold, the marketability of the New Jersey title is unimpaired; second, New Jersey no longer bars an attesting witness from benefiting under a will, N.J.S.A. 3A:2A-7; and third, New Jersey now considers valid a will executed in another state if the will is in compliance with the requirements of that state, regardless of any formal deficiencies which may exist under New Jersey law, N.J.S.A. 3A:2A-8. As no present New Jersey interest would be offended by the distribution to appellant of the proceeds from the sale of the Bound Brook property in accordance with testatrix’s intent, the decree of the orphans’ court must be reversed.
