The basis for the confession of judgment was Mulach’s alleged failure to make repairs to the leased premises and equipment as required in the lease agreement. Judgment was subsequently entered in the amount of $41,738.94, however, that judgment was opened. On January 23, 1979 a jury returned a verdict in favor of Rochester in the amount of $47,300.00. The trial court denied Mulach’s motion for a new trial. A panel of the Superior Court reversed and granted Mulach a new trial on the ground that the trial court erred in admitting certain correspondence between the parties’ attorneys. <a href="/pa-super/287/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="287 Pa.

    <p id="b614-4" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[312,1094,1147,828]]]'>The background of the case is as follows: On November 14,1975, Mulach leased certain premises from Rochester for a period of one year. The lease was subsequently extended to November 14, 1977. On August 31, 1977 Rochester, through its attorney, sent a letter to Mulach which presented an itemized list of damages said to be caused during Mulach’s occupancy. The letter demanded immediate payment of the estimated cost of repairs. On October 31,1977, Mulach replied by way of a letter from its attorney. The letter consisted of an item by item response to each claim for damages asserted in Rochester’s letter of August 31. With respect to some of the items, Mulach stated “Mulach accepts responsibility.” With respect to several others, Mulach declined to accept responsibility, generally offering instead a brief explanation as to why it was not liable for the claimed item.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Dever, </em><a href="/pa/374/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="374 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1241471" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0370-01">374 Pa. 370</a>, 376, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.2d%20777" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="97 A.2d 777">97 A.2d 777</a>, 781 (1953). Our threshold inquiry, then, is whether the correspondence between Mulach and Rochester can be fairly characterized as relating to an offer of compromise. Although this Court has not, heretofore, defined an offer to compromise, it is generally defined as the settlement of differences by mutual concessions; an adjustment of conflicting claims. <em>Kelly v. Steinberg, </em><a href="/cal-app-2d/148/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="148 Cal.

Under such a definition the demand by Rochester stating items of damages caused by Mulach and demanding the estimated amount for their repair cannot be construed as an offer to compromise a disputed claim. <em>See Gallagher v. Viking Supply Corp., </em><a href="/ariz-app/3/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Ariz. App. 55" data-case-ids="1243087" data-case-paths="/ariz-app/3/0055-01">3 Ariz.App. 55</a>, <a href="/ariz-app/3/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 Ariz.

Likewise, <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>Mulach’s response cannot be construed as a settlement offer or as a counter-settlement offer. Mulach’s response, accepting “responsibility” for some items of damage while refusing “responsibility” for others, does not in any way suggest that it is an offer to compromise a disputed claim. Rather it is nothing more, or less, than what it purports to be, an admission of liability with respect to some items of damages and a disclaimer of liability with respect to others.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> There is no suggestion in the letter of efforts to negotiate a compromise. In fact, Mulach’s letter suggests an exactly opposite intent. That is to say, Mulach’s letter suggests that it is unwilling to compromise or to negotiate the disputed items.</p>

The theory which a particular court adopts will determine the scope of the exclusion. The first theory is grounded in a privilege protecting as confidential all overtures of settlement made to the opposing party. The privilege is based on the belief that expeditious and extrajudicial settlements are to be encouraged and that privacy of communication is necessary in order to encourage them. Under this view, all statements made in the course of settlement negotiations must be excluded.
