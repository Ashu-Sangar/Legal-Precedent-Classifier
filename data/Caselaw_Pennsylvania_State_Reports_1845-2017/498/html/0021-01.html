Employers Commercial Union Insurance Co., </em>59 D. &amp; C.2d 371 (1972) (complaint dismissed on grounds of prematurity, citing <em>Hocking </em>cases and <em>Fratto </em>). There is a question as to whether, under the facts as interpreted by the majority, the insurer here could have been excused for not having obtained an appraised or arbitration award prior to the commencement of suit, which is a condition precedent to an action by the insured. <em>See, Ice City, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N.A., </em><a href="/pa/456/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="456 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="584413" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0210-01">456 Pa. 210</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20236" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="314 A.2d 236">314 A.2d 236</a> (1975); <em>Chauvin v.

Certainly the possibility of the Schreibers having a claim which does not become payable before the expiration of twelve months next from the date of the inception of the loss (date of the fire) depends largely upon the pleasure of the insurer and its asserted defenses.</p>
