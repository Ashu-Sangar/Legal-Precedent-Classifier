Both <em>Wohlgemuth </em>and <em>Bowen </em>dealt with a regulatory presumption on the issue of need that the income of legally responsible relatives is available to dependent children in situations where the children are deprived of parental support and care by reason of either the absence or the disability of the parent, the statutory test on the threshold issue of eligibility under Section 406 of the Social Security Act, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20606" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 606">42 U.S.C. § 606</a>.

Section 407 of the Act was added June 28, 1968, for the purpose of providing aid to an additional class of dependent children, those who were deprived of parental support and care by reason of the unemployment of their father. The issue here is the eligibility of dependent children when their father is present in the home, gainfully employed and not disabled. Until we have determined whether the Molyneaux children are eligible under the statutory classification of Section 407 (unemployment), we do not reach the issues of need and availability of income, on which latter issues only <em>Wohlgemuth </em>and <em>Bowen </em>teach us that irrebuttable presumptions cannot be used.</p>

Such analysis is inappropriate, however, where the threshold issue is the interpretation of the statute to determine whether applicant’s children fall within the legislative classifications Congress intended to benefit. If applicant’s children are not within the benefited class the regulation simply follows the legislative intent to deny benefits to such persons.</p>
