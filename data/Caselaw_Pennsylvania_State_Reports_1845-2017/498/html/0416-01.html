In the instant case, the criminal complaint charging appellant with rape and murder was filed on November 20, 1973.

The Commonwealth, on the other hand, presented extensive evidence to show that the victim died on October 28 or 29, 1973, shortly after her family had last seen her and while appellant was still in the vicinity. <em>See generally, </em>Opinion of Williams, P.

    <p id="b492-7" data-blocks='[["BL_492.8",492,[285,1101,1148,726]]]'>I dissent. Trial counsel is alleged to have been ineffective for failing to present certain testimony favorable to the defense. Specifically, the available, albeit omitted, testimony consisted of, <em>inter alia, </em>the opinion of a forensic pathologist, Dr. Sopher, indicating that <em>no scientific evidence, collected from the victim’s body or from the crime scene, identified appellant as having committed the rape and murder in question. </em>The opinion authored by Mr. Justice McDermott omits mention of this, the primary reason to have called Dr. Sopher to testify, and creates the impression that Dr. Sopher would have testified only as to the time of the victim’s death. In the PCHA hearing, appellant’s trial counsel testified as follows regarding his reasons for not presenting certain witnesses on behalf of the defense.</p>

I think on the issue on the time of death Dr. Sopher’s testimony would have been helpful to the defendant.

I did not believe ... that Dr. Sopher’s testimony would be strong enough to overcome the effect on the jury of the court’s ruling not only on the prior crimes but other rulings throughout the case.... <em>I felt that the defendant was protected enough on the record </em>that it would be <em>useless to present a ease on his behalf </em>because I don’t think it would have done any good.... <em>I thought the record was replete with errors </em>by the court that were prejudicial to the defendant that would deny him the right to a fair trial and <em>it was senseless and useless to go on. </em>That is exactly the basis of why we didn’t call Dr. Sopher or any of the other witnesses.</blockquote>

In so doing, however, counsel presumed to know what the effect upon the jury would be of the evidence which he refrained from presenting, thereby denying appellant the benefit of having testimony considered by the jury. This evidence, although perhaps not determinative of guilt, would nevertheless have contributed to the defense’s position. Trial counsel articulated no legitimate tactical reason for the failure to present the testimony in question, and counsel provided ineffective representation by, in effect, taking it upon himself to terminate the trial while elevating his judgment to that of an appellate court in evaluating the ramifications of the errors alleged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

The situation presented in this case is not one where counsel, after consideration of <em>recognized </em>tactical alternatives, determined that certain witnesses should not be called to testify. Counsel’s realm of discretion over the choice of tactics employed is broad, and that discretion necessarily includes the exercise of judgment about whether the presentation of particular witnesses’ testimony would, considering all relevant factors, be beneficial to the client’s case. <em>See Commonwealth v.
