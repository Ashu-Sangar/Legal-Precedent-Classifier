That court reversed the order of the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, affirming the referee’s award of benefits to appellant and remanded the case for recomputation.

It was also contended that employment in a more hazardous occupation would be unfair to the employer providing a less hazardous employment. The illusory quality of the latter concern is readily apparent. Whether the concurrent employment is risky or safe in no way affects the impact of the concurrent employment wage rule on the employer in whose employment an injury has actually occurred.</p>
    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[202,991,1144,996]]]'>Equally as transparent is the first objection. It is obviously repulsive to legislation, that is remedial in intent, to construe such legislation as relegating a claimant to a part-time wage basis, although his actual earnings are that of a full-time member of the labor force. Moreover, any isolated example of an injustice will be eradicated by an overall view of the situation. It is legitimate to consider the employer’s sector as a composite, since that is the perspective used to determine premiums for workmen’s compensation coverage. It is not fair to apply such a perspective to the individual workman whose entire life and that of his family may be dependent upon the award received in a given case. Most state legislatures have, as has Pennsylvania,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> deleted limitations and permitted wages from all employers to be considered in determining the rate of compensation due.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Thus, today, the question before us would not have arisen and appellant clearly would be entitled to have his wages from the concurrent employment calculated in arriving at the appropriate compensation rate.</p>

In so ruling, that court ignored the long and well established tradition in our law that certain relationships between parties requires the knowledge of one to be imputed to the other. A prominent example of this principle is the relationship between a principal and agent.</p>
