(Supp.1981) (effective July 1, 1980). The Court of Common Pleas of Chester County refused the request of appellant Lena Troiani Bacchetta, pursuant to section 401(d) of the Code, for equitable distribution of property acquired before the Code’s effective date on the belief that the requested distribution would unconstitutionally deprive appellee Vincent Louis Bacchetta of his property rights. Upon application of appellant, this Court assumed plenary jurisdiction. We conclude that the Legislature’s clear direction that all property acquired during the marriage of the parties shall be subject to the equitable distribution provision of the Divorce Code is a constitutionally permissible exercise of the Legislature’s authority to regulate the marital relationship. Hence we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

There is no basis in the statute to qualify this legislative mandate by restricting the applicability of the equitable distribution requirement to only that marital property acquired after July 1, 1980, the effective date of the Code. Indeed, of the seven specific exceptions to the equitable distribution provision, none demonstrates the slightest legislative intention that the date of acquisition during marriage shall be at all relevant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a>

      <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>Moreover, the stated purpose of the new Divorce Code is to deal effectively with the “realities of the matrimonial experience” by giving “primary consideration to the welfare of the family,” “mitigating] the harm to spouses and their children caused by the legal dissolution of the marriage,” and effectuating “economic justice” as well as “a fair and just determination and settlement of . . . property rights.” 23 P.S. § 102(a). Where, as here and in most cases for years to come, the parties were married before the enactment of the Divorce Code, it would be unreasonable to interpret the Divorce Code as providing for equitable distribution of only that property acquired after the Code’s effective date. Such an interpretation would impose the unmanageable burden on courts and litigants of determining which properties were acquired before, and which after, the effective date of the Code. Such an interpretation would also substantially deny the benefits of the Divorce Code to spouses in marriages in existence at the time of the Code’s enactment, thereby prolonging for at least a generation the very inequity the Legislature sought to remedy. In view of the stated purposes of the Code, it must be concluded that the Legislature’s definition of marital property as “all property acquired by either party during the marriage” includes property acquired before the effective date of the Code.</p>

The Community Property Law deemed the income from properties acquired and owned by one spouse prior to the Law’s effective date to be the common property of both spouses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a> The statute applied to all marriages, and automatically bestowed upon each spouse an “undivided one-half interest” in income from property owned separately by the other spouse.

    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[253,955,1148,787]]]'>In enacting the equitable distribution provision of the Divorce Code, the Legislature sought to accomplish far different objectives than were sought in enacting the Community Property Law. Prior to the enactment of the Divorce Code, in many marriages a nonworking spouse contributed years of service to the family, but did not realize any significant economic gain. Thus, upon divorce, nonworking spouses, who frequently had no marketable skills, were left with few, if any assets of their own and faced the risk of becoming public charges. By providing for the distribution of property acquired during the marriage, the Divorce Code permits the correction of the economic injustices which often arose under former law and allows nonworking spouses to become self-supporting with the least financial hardship possible.</p>

Likewise, a spouse’s interest as a joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety, could be extinguished by being transferred to the other spouse. Prior to the Code’s effective date, the statutory and common law of the Commonwealth governed the status of spouses’ assets upon divorce.

By defining the subject “marital property” as “all property acquired by either <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>party during the marriage”, 23 P.S. § 401(e) fails to clarify whether “acquired” means theretofore acquired, thereafter acquired, or both.

Nowhere in the property distribution provision, or elsewhere in the Code, is there contained language which “clearly and manifestly” sets forth legislative intent in a manner <em>so clear as to preclude all question </em>of retroactive intendment. See 1 Pa.C. S.A. § 1926, <em>supra; Smith v. Fenner, supra. </em>Indeed, the contemplated retroactive or prospective application of the property distribution provision is simply not addressed in the statute. The guide to construction set forth in 23 P.S. § 103, which merely establishes that pre-Code events may constitute grounds for divorce under the Code, provides in pertinent part: “The provisions of this act shall apply to all cases, <em>whether the cause </em>for divorce or annulment <em>arose prior or subsequent to enactment </em>of this act.” (Emphasis added.) This guide to construction is not to be interpreted so broadly as to require that the property distribution provision of the Code shall, in addition to being applicable regardless of the date when grounds for divorce arose, be interpreted as having a retroactive, as opposed to solely prospective, effect upon properties acquired. Specifically, the construction accorded 23 P.S. § 103 is governed by the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, which provides: “All provisions of a statute of the classes hereafter enumerated shall be strictly construed: ... (2) Retroactive provisions.” Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1339, No. 290, § 3, 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1928(b) (Supp.1981). “Even where the General Assembly intends a retroactive construction, the statute is to be ‘strictly construed.’ ” <em>Commonwealth v.
