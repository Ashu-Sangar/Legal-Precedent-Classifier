      <em>decision </em>of this jury that the information as presented by ... the Assistant District Attorney is insufficient” (emphasis added) is susceptible only to the interpretation that the jury unanimously decided that the prosecution did not satisfy its burden of proof. Although the jury did not expressly label its “decision” a “verdict,” it did, nevertheless, decide the question that it had been called upon to decide: whether the prosecution had presented sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Had the jury merely announced, without elaboration, that it had been unable to reach a verdict, declaration of a mistrial would have been in order. In the present case, however, the jury went much further than to decline to announce <em>what it regarded </em>as an express “verdict”. Rather, by setting forth a decision upon the fundamental issue in the criminal trial, i.e., sufficiency of the Commonwealth’s evidence, the jury, in effect, found appellant not guilty. The fact that the jury also regarded the evidence presented by defense counsel as insufficient is of no significance, since the defense in a criminal proceeding, having the benefit of the presumption of innocence, has no affirmative duty to present evidence of innocence.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[278,1498,1146,429]]]'>After announcement of the jury’s decision that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of proof, issuance by the court of a further instruction to the jury to secure an express “verdict” would have created a risk that the jury, given the opportunity to deliberate once again, might return a verdict of guilt. This, after the jury’s in effect having declared appellant not guilty, would in itself have exposed appellant to double jeopardy.</p>
