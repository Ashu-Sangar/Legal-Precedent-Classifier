To accommodate this end the Superior Court developed a concept of good cause. <em>Crib Diaper Service v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-super/174/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="174 Pa.

The rationale upon which this concept of good cause was developed was that where the action of the employee is justifiable or reasonable under the circumstances it can not be considered wilful misconduct since it can not properly be charged as a wilful disregard of the employer’s intents or rules or the standard of conduct the employer has a right to expect. <em>Crib Diaper Service v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em>supra. We find this reasoning persuasive.</blockquote>

Appellant testified at the hearing before the referee (the employer did not appear) that she had been on sick leave since June 13, 1977. Appellant had accumulated enough sick leave through the years to cover this period of illness. In compliance with the written sick leave policy of the University, appellant submitted a doctor’s certificate from her physician stating that she was under his care and would be out for an indefinite period of time. The University asked for additional doctor’s <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>verification which appellant had her doctor forward. Appellant further testified that it was not University policy to require an employee out on sick leave to be examined by a University physician, although such a policy did exist in cases of long-term disability. (As appellant was out on sick leave, not long-term disability, the latter was not applicable.)</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[282,723,1152,1301]]]'>Nevertheless, the referee and the Board found “[s]ince the employer did not receive conclusive medical information” and since the “[claimant did not comply with the employer’s request”, appellant’s refusal amounted to willful misconduct. In reaching this conclusion (that there was inadequate medical information), the referee relied solely on a letter written by the University to appellant which stated that she was expected to report to the University Health Evaluation Center for physical examination by a certain date or be terminated. The letter then stated this “action has been necessitated by your excessive rude and crude responses to our numerous requests for physician certification of your illness and expected duration of same. This has caused extensive disruption in the routine of [appellant’s supervisor’s] office and in the section as a whole.” Because this letter was hearsay and was uncorroborated, it cannot be deemed competent evidence of the reasonableness of the employer’s request. <em>See Unemployment Compensation Board of Review v.
