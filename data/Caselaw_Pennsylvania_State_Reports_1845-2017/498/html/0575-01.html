      <em> </em>In arriving at its determination, the Court in <em>Grayson </em>emphasized the importance and impact of perjured testimony at trial with respect to the trial court’s evaluation of a defendant’s demeanor and rehabilitative prospects. Thus the Court held that neither due process nor fifth amendment rights would preclude a sentencing court from considering, as one factor, deliberate false testimony of material facts as reflective of a defendant’s character for purposes of sentencing. This holding should not be extended to include a discarded notice of alibi defense. Therefore, although a sentencing court, where it has observed false testimony as to a material fact at trial, may consider the defendant’s perjury as one factor in imposing an appropriate sentence, it may not so consider an abandoned, albeit fabricated, notice of alibi defense.</p>

This doubt dissipated when the trial judge belatedly learned of appellant’s alibi scheme. N.T. Post Trial Motions 3/12/79 at 8.
