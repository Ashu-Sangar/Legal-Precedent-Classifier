The Authority also contends that there was no taking because there was no permanent interference with access to Mrs. Woodring’s property within the meaning of § 612 of the Eminent Domain Code, 26 P.S. § 1-612, and because Mrs. Woodring’s petition contained no claim for consequential damages. However, these contentions deal only with a property owner’s right to receive consequential damages in appropriate cases, a right which is not at issue on this appeal. Since they have no bearing on the existence or absence of a compensable taking, they merit no further discussion.</p>

This conclusion is further supported by the facts that it was the Authority who invited Elm Street property owners to the meeting of August 12, 1976 to discuss the impact of the redevelopment plan, and that it was the Authority’s consulting engineer who drafted and circulated the memorandum of August 13, 1976 which outlined the positions of the various parties affected by the plan. These facts indicate that at all times relevant in this case, the Authority was directing and controlling the implementation of its plan.</p>

Mr. Lewis testified that Mrs. Woodring’s electrical system violated § 230-72 of the National Electrical Code, 1975 edition, which requires that service disconnects be accessible to tenants in case of fire. This violation was based on the fact that five disconnects were located inside a jewelry store protected by a burglar alarm. Since the other tenants in the building could not reach the service disconnects without setting off the jewelry store’s burglar alarm, Mr. Lewis was of the opinion that these disconnects were inaccessible and that this inaccessibility constituted a violation of the National Electrical Code.</p>

    <p id="b257-9" data-blocks='[["BL_257.10",257,[197,1693,1142,631]]]'>The record reveals that, prior to appellant’s decision to relocate existing power lines underground as part of its redevelopment plan, appellee’s tenants did not have individual access to a means of disconnecting their electricity in the event of a fire or other emergency. According to appellee’s own witness, Frank Lewis, a Pennsylvania Electric Company meter supervisor, this condition constituted a violation of the National Electrical Code, section 230-72 (1975 edition). Supervisor Lewis further testified that if appellee had at any time desired to alter or add to her existing system, she would have been required by Oil City ordinances nos. 2119 and 2223 to bring her system into compliance with the Code.</p>

Although appellant’s decision to relocate power lines precipitated the change in appellee’s electrical system which made her subject to the ordinances, the fact remains that a part of appellee’s expenses in converting her system were incurred not to satisfy the Redevelopment Authority’s desire for aesthetic improvement but rather to satisfy Oil City’s legitimate concern that appellee’s tenants be safe. Accordingly, the Board of Viewers should be directed to exclude from compensation all amounts paid by appellee to bring her electrical system into compliance with the National Electrical Code.</p>
