The Ethics Commission now seeks clarification as to what constitutes the “practice of law” under that <em>per curiam </em>order. Because the case involves important and delicate issues relating to the division of power within our tripartite system <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>of government, I believe the Commission is entitled to clarification.

In a dictum this Court acknowledged the statute was probably unconstitutional as applied to attorneys who seek to practice in Pennsylvania’s courts. Of course, practice in the courts of Pennsylvania constitutes the practice of law and to that extent Pa.R.D.E. 103 gives this Court exclusive power to supervise the conduct of attorneys and judges. <em>But see infra </em>p. 615.</p>

      <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>However, the <em>Wajert </em>opinion did not address the question presented in this case: (1) Whether representation of clients before the Public Utility Commission, an entity created by the legislature, constitutes the practice of law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and, if it does not, (2) Whether Article V, section 10 grants this Court exclusive jurisdiction over all professional activities of attorneys or. whether the scope of our “exclusive” jurisdiction is restricted to those activities which constitute the practice of law.</p>
    <p id="b658-4" data-blocks='[["BL_658.4",658,[279,794,1147,934]]]'>The Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that <em>all </em>activities of attorneys are subject to exclusive regulation by the Supreme Court is patently absurd. Taken to the extreme it would mean that the Legislature could not provide criminal sanctions for the defalcative acts of attorneys. The principle, as applied to the present facts, means the Legislature, which created the Public Utility Commission by statute,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> cannot impose reasonable restrictions on its attorney employees. On its face, that order precludes the legislative branch from imposing any economic strictures on conflict of interest upon the legal profession beyond those imposed by members of that profession itself. Without casting aspersions on the sincere and laudable efforts of this Court to guard against unethical conduct by members of our profession I believe the people of this Commonwealth, through their elected representatives, are entitled to adopt <em>reasonable </em>prophylactic rules to guard against the perceived evil of conflict of interest.</p>
    <p id="b658-5" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[278,1753,1146,202]],["BL_659.1",659,[240,311,1140,828]]]'>The Code of Professional Responsibility, which this Court has adopted as the standard of conduct for attorneys of all the Courts of the Commonwealth, expressly recognizes the virtue of such a prophylactic policy by requiring that attor<a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>neys avoid even the appearance of impropriety. <em>See </em>D.R. 9-101. However, the Code imposes only a hortatory general restriction on the conduct of lawyers after they leave public employment. D.R. 9-101(B) provides only that “(a) lawyer shall not accept private employment in a matter in which he had substantial responsibility while a public employee.” There is no apparent contradiction between the Code of Professional Responsibility and the Ethics Act. The legislature has merely exercised its authority to enact a more stringent rule addressing the same subject as D.R. 9-101, declaring that a particular private employment within a specified period presents the appearance of impropriety we generally condemn. A determination that such employment is offensive in appearance is not manifestly unreasonable. Furthermore, it gives specific content to our rule’s appeal to conscience.</p>

If legislation has been duly enacted by the General Assembly and is within the scope of legislative power, challengers bear a heavy burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that it clearly, palpably and plainly violates the Constitution. <em>Shapp v.

The Rule, without elaboration or reasoning, reads the expression “exclusive jurisdiction” into article V, section 10. That Rule is, of course, subject to the test of a constitutional challenge raised <em>via </em>the litigation process. The word “exclusive” was not placed in the text of the <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>Constitution by its framers.
