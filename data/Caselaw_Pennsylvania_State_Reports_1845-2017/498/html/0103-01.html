Following the close of the pleadings the parties entered into stipulations of fact which provided the basis of subsequent motions for summary judgment.

During his employment, Miller made total contributions as an active member of the State Employees’ Retirement System in the amount of $11,669.34. This total consisted of $9,420.28 from direct contributions and $2,249.06 which represented interest on that contribution. During this period the Commonwealth made contributions to appellee’s account, as a result of his employment, in the amount of $55,448.60. Appellee Miller retired from state employment on July 14, 1976 and thereafter on March 30, 1977 entered a plea of guilty to the charge of theft by <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>extortion, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3923(a), before the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County for a crime which occurred while appellee Miller was an employee of the Commonwealth.</p>

Appellee Fineman, as an active member of the State Employees’ Retirement System, contributed $43,441.70 to the system through payroll deductions. On June 13, 1977 a Judgment Order was entered against Fineman for his conviction of obstruction of justice under Federal law, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="18 U.S.C. § 1503">18 U.S.C. § 1503</a>.</p>
    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[268,957,1151,1162]]]'>On July 8, 1978 the Legislature enacted the Public Employees’ Pension Forfeiture Act, Act 1978-140 (hereinafter Act).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Act became effective as of the same date of its passage and provided for the forfeiture of pension benefits being received by a retired state employee if the employee is convicted or pleads guilty or no defense to a crime related to public office or public employment. Section 7 of the Act directed that the provisions shall be retroactive to December 1, 1972. Acting pursuant to this Act, the State Employees’ Retirement Board (hereinafter SERB) discontinued payment of pension benefits to both appellees. In both cases the appellees had elected to receive the lump sum payment of their direct contributions with interest and to have the balance of the retirement benefits received through monthly annuity payments which were to continue throughout the lifetime of the retired employee and the lifetime of the retired employee’s wife. In each case the lump sum payments had been received prior to the action of SERB. Thus, the issue related to the propriety of the termination of the annuity benefits. Both appellees sought relief from the Commonwealth Court. That court reversed the decision of SERB after concluding the Act’s provision for retroactivity was unconstitutional.</p>
    <p id="b172-6" data-blocks='[["BL_172.6",172,[267,2144,1146,94]],["BL_173.1",173,[201,298,1140,397]]]'>The Chief Justice in his opinion for affirmance concluded that the stipulation of fact entered into by the parties <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>precluded further review of the merits of the case. Those members of the Court advocating a reversal of the Commonwealth Court’s orders argue that the stipulation was not one of fact but represented a legal conclusion which does not foreclose review by an appellate tribunal. I believe that framing the issue as to whether or not the stipulation was one of fact or of law misses the mark and obfuscates the true issues involved.</p>
    <p id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[200,720,1140,1604]],["BL_174.1",174,[283,296,1144,192]]]'>The issue as it was framed for the Commonwealth Court was whether the Act provided a basis for the termination of the instant appellees’ annuities. The court’s “stipulation” merely confirmed the fact that the parties had confined the issue to the constitutionality of the retroactivity provision of that Act. The “stipulation” clarified that no other basis was being offered to support SERB’s decision to terminate benefits to appellees. The Commonwealth Court addressed the issue presented and concluded that the retroactive provision of the Act was unconstitutional relying upon its reasoning in <em>Borello v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em>49 Pa.Cmwlth. 364, <a href="/citations/?q=411%20A.2d%20852" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="411 A.2d 852">411 A.2d 852</a> (1980). Notwithstanding, the members of this Court who seek reversal are now attempting to ignore the sole stated basis for the action of SERB, the single issue presented to the Commonwealth Court, and seek to justify their conclusion on the ground that the Act codified existing law. This is the clearest example of an attempt by members of an appellate tribunal to interject a theory foreign to the lawsuit in an effort to reverse the order of the lower court. This practice has been expressly condemned by this Court in numerous decisions. <em>Commonwealth v.
