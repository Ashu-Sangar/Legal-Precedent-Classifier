During the four-year period from the third quarter of 1973 to the second quarter of 1977, Lehigh Valley Cooperative Farms [hereinafter “Lehigh Valley”], a cooperative agricultural association, paid unemployment <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>compensation taxes totaling $357,733.42. At that time, Le-high Valley believed that it was legally obligated to pay those taxes. In 1977, Lehigh Valley applied for a refund but the Bureau of Employment Security [hereinafter “Bureau”] denied the request. Lehigh Valley appealed and the Commonwealth Court determined that Lehigh Valley was entitled to a refund.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Court, however, limited the refund to taxes paid within ninety days of the refund application. <em>See Lehigh Valley Cooperative Farmers v.

The Commonwealth Court was pursuaded by Lehigh Valley’s argument and concluded that the Cooperative Tax Act was “clear and free from all ambiguity” and that it was unnecessary to apply rules of statutory construction in this case. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(b) (words of a statute free from ambiguity are not to be disregarded).</p>

First, the proposition that unemployment compensation taxes are <em>excise </em>taxes is not controlling in this case because that finding was not required to decide the issue in any of the United States or Pennsylvania cases cited by Lehigh Valley. <em>See In Re Pew's Trust Estate, </em><a href="/pa/411/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="411 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="1885998" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0096-01">411 Pa. 96</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="191 A.2d 399">191 A.2d 399</a> (1963).

      <em> </em>Prior to this <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>case, the issue of whether unemployment compensation taxes are <em>excise </em>taxes has never been squarely presented to either Court.</p>
    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[222,459,1139,520]]]'>Second, it is necessary to apply rules of statutory construction simply because unemployment compensation taxes are not explicitly mentioned in the Cooperative Tax Act. It is interesting to note that the Act is sufficiently ambiguous in this regard to have prompted Lehigh Valley to pay unemployment compensation taxes for four years or longer, believing that it was legally obligated to do so. Moreover, the argument that unemployment compensation taxes are excise taxes is derived from case law, not from a straightforward application of any statute.</p>
    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[220,999,1142,560]]]'>A required rule of statutory construction provides that a statute exempting persons or property from taxation must be strictly construed. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Commw. 430" data-case-ids="1878357" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/28/0430-01">28 Pa.Commw. 430</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=368%20A.2d%20909" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="368 A.2d 909">368 A.2d 909</a> (1977); 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1928(b)(5). Consistent with this rule, a taxpayer has the burden of proving that he is entitled to an exemption from taxation. <em>See Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co. v. Hines, supra. </em>Lehigh Valley has failed to sustain its burden of showing that the legislature intended to exempt agricultural cooperatives from unemployment compensation taxes.</p>
    <p id="b591-6" data-blocks='[["BL_591.6",591,[219,1586,1139,468]],["BL_592.1",592,[270,299,1149,413]]]'>The legislature clearly had taxes other than unemployment compensation taxes in mind when it enacted the Cooperative Tax Act. In the original Act and subsequent amendment, the legislature specifically mentioned certain “excise” taxes, i.e. “income,” “property,” and “use” taxes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Generally, such taxes are imposed without regard to a taxpayer’s unique circumstances. By contrast, unemployment compensation contributions are based in part on an employer’s individual experience rating, i.e. unemployment compensa<a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>tion benefits actually paid to employees laid off <em>by that particular employer. </em>(The fewer the layoffs, the lower the tax.)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Then Judge Wilkinson recognized this difference in his dissenting opinion below, and found it strange that the legislature would contemplate “an excise tax in its traditional sense based on what is called a contribution rate”. <em>See Lehigh Valley v. Bureau, supra </em><a href="/pa-commw/55/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="55 Pa.

    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[267,734,1152,1203]]]'>Another required rule of statutory construction provides that in ascertaining legislative intent, the practical results of a particular interpretation may be considered. <em>See Commonwealth, Department of Transportation Bureau of Traffic Safety v.

Also, the legislature cannot be presumed to intend an absurd or unreasonable result to follow from its enactments. <em>See Valley Forge Industries, Inc. v. Armand Construction, Inc., </em>38 Commw.Ct. 603, <a href="/citations/?q=394%20A.2d%20677" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="394 A.2d 677">394 A.2d 677</a> (1978); 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1). In his dissent below, Judge Wilkinson stated that a possible consequence of the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of the Cooperative Tax Act would be to excuse Lehigh Valley from making contributions to the unemployment compensation fund while Lehigh Valley’s employees would still be entitled to unemployment compensation benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The Commonwealth Court dismissed this anomalous situation as “not one for the Courts, but for the legislature”. <em>See Lehigh Valley v.
