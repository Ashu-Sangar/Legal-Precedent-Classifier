The majority vacates the stay and erroneously concludes the decree of the lower court is sufficient to protect the public and does not constitute an undue burden on the District Attorney. The July 7, 1981 partial stay and modification was specifically designed to prohibit the release of pre-trial detainees charged with the most serious crimes of violence. The necessity for this stay and modification was occasioned by the very fact that pretrial detainees charged with such crimes would be released pursuant to the lower court’s decree. That protection has today been removed. Moreover, the majority’s conclusion that participation by the District Attorney is sufficient to protect the public’s interest ignores reality. The bail review procedure forces the District Attorney’s office to expend the valuable resources of an already overburdened staff for a second time after having participated in the original bail-setting process.</p>

The majority ignores that by its refusal to permit the District Attorney to participate it may in effect have left the people of this county without any effective representation in this extremely important matter. In its adjudication of the original City defendant’s exceptions to the Order of March 17, 1981, the lower court dismissed the exceptions, <em>inter alia, </em>on the grounds the City defendant failed to file a brief supporting its contentions within the time provided by Philadelphia Civil Rule 240. Should that ruling be upheld by the Commonwealth Court, the merits of this case will escape appellate review.</p>

Although the majority expressly purports merely to deny the District Attorney’s request for extraordinary relief, it nevertheless appears evident from the opinion that they have also concluded the merits of the appeal of the District Attorney presently before the Commonwealth Court seeking review of the order denying intervention by the court below. From footnote 12 of the opinion, the majority appears to conclude that the only resource now available to the District Attorney is to seek participation as <em>amicus. </em>Thus, <em>sub silentio, </em>they have exercised their extraordinary power and mooted the appeal of the District Attorney presently pending in the Commonwealth Court.</p>

To deny the District Attorney intervention in this case, for the petty tutorial reasons given, is to deny the court access to another source of argument and analysis. The issues in this case are of profound Constitutional and statutory import; they can only be resolved here. To delay them further by denying intervention and plenary jurisdiction is to use the rod to hurt the teacher.</p>
