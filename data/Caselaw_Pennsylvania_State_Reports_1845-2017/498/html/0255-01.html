Section 4(b) was the device designed to secure that information from those persons seeking public office. Section 4(d)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> anticipates that Section 4(b) would not be all encompassing in assuring that everyone prior to entering into public office will have submitted the desired information and adds a further requirement to reach those public officials who have not complied up to that point in time with the disclosure requirement. It must be emphasized that Section 4(b) is only a means used by the legislature to reach a goal and not the goal itself. The objective was the disclosure of the financial activities of the candidate, the requirement to file an affidavit attesting to compliance with the disclosure requirements was the means chosen to achieve that objective. Clear thinking requires <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>that we do not exalt the means to an extent that the end is obscured.</p>

Section 4(b) was not designed as positing a barrier to seeking public office, rather it was conceived as a way in which to obtain further information which could be available during the selection process. It cannot be presumed from the fact that the mechanical device used to obtain the information provides for its receipt prior to the filing of the nominating petition should necessarily require foreclosing access to the nomination process where the information is in fact received after the filing of the petition but is available for all of the purposes envisioned under the Ethics Act.</p>
    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[279,1182,1148,893]]]'>It is, of course, legitimate to argue that the development of a machinelike rule that forecloses access to the nomination process whenever there is non-compliance with the strict letter of the section, regardless of the reason for the non-compliance, will assist in obtaining the desired information. However, there is no basis for concluding that the legislature intended such a rule to implement its design in this area nor is there evidence that such a stringent approach is here necessary. Not only has there not been in this instance such a compelling necessity established for adopting such a per se rule, to do so would be in direct conflict with the well-established public policy of this jurisdiction to favor enfranchisement. <em>In Re: Recount of Ballots, </em><a href="/pa/457/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="457 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="478296" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0279-01">457 Pa. 279</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=325%20A.2d%20303" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="325 A.2d 303">325 A.2d 303</a> (1974); <em>Mellody Appeals, </em><a href="/pa/449/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="449 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1945683" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0386-01">449 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20782" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="296 A.2d 782">296 A.2d 782</a> (1972); <em>Weiskerger Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/447/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="447 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1942990" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0418-01">447 Pa. 418</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%20108" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="290 A.2d 108">290 A.2d 108</a> (1972); <em>James Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/377/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="377 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1249534" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0405-01">377 Pa. 405</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%2064" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="105 A.2d 64">105 A.2d 64</a> (1954).</p>
