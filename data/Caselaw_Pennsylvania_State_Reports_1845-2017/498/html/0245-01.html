Sometime between 7:30 p. m. and 8:00 p. m., appellant accompanied Edward and five other young men on a van trip from Ashland to Pottsville thence to Lykens, Gratz and Erdman. All the young men drank beer and appellant consumed about six cans. At about 11:45 p. m. the van returned to the Boyers’ residence and Norbert headed the quarter mile towards home at a high rate of speed.</p>

He observed a wound in the upper right shoulder and what appeared to be an exit wound in the upper left hand back area. He further observed a slug lying on the floor in the area of the exit hole. He testified that the living room had numerous broken or shattered pieces of glass. Trooper Keppick testified that he found four bullet holes in the wall which separated the west wall of the living room from the bedroom. He further testified that he found three bullets in the closet and one in the door jamb. He also testified as to a fifth hole, smaller than the others, which he concluded was not a bullet hole and for which no corresponding bullet was found.</p>

He set the time of death at 12:00 a. m. with an outside range of 15 to 30 minutes either way and stated the cause of death was a single bullet which severed the aorta.</p>

However, our inquiry does not end there. Dr. Campbell J. Martin, a pathologist who examined the victim, concluded that, as a result of the wound, severing her aorta, she would have lost consciousness very rapidly, become unresponsive within one or two minutes of having been shot and been unable to make coherent statements for more than a minute at the outside limit. N.T. 216. Appellant told Ivan, Sophie and Eugene Boyer that he was talking to the victim just before she died and she said “Darling, I love you,” “Goodbye,” and “I’ve been shot. Go get Mom.” N.T. 95, 102, 146.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In light of those statements and appellant’s testimony that he saw or heard no gunshots or any other individual in or around the trailer, appellant’s own words placed him at the trailer at the time of the murder.

N.T. 346. On this issue the chemist was called as a defense witness, after the Commonwealth had rested. Such an argument, <em>properly construed, </em>is in the nature of a motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. The decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Absent an abuse of discretion its denial of such a motion will not be disturbed. <em>Commonwealth v.

In exercising that discretion, the trial court had not only the defense testimony that no nitrates or nitrites were found, but also testimony elicited by the Commonwealth on cross-examination of the chemist that their absence did not rule out appellant’s having fired the fatal shot under the circumstances of the case. N.T. 349. As this Court stated in <em>Commonwealth v.

This conclusion is not affected because appellant also introduced the testimony of Dr. Mary Willard that her independent test of the murder weapon established it left nitrates and nitrites on a subject’s hands which could not be washed off even with a strong cleanser. Significantly, Dr. Willard was unable to conclude that the negative results of the paraffin test administered by the State Police chemist, Ms. Janice Roadcap, also called by defendant on this issue, ruled out appellant’s firing the murder weapon on the night of the murder.

The specific intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly instrument on a vital part of the body. <em>Commonwealth v.

The jury could have inferred from the Commonwealth’s evidence that the fatal shot was fired from a twenty-two caliber rifle aimed at the victim’s trunk rather than from a reckless shot fired through the living room wall. Had there been evidence introduced at trial tending to prove that the victim had been struck by an errant bullet passing through the wall, that evidence would tend to rebut the inference and it would be up to the jury to weigh the evidence. However, in light of the uncontroverted credible testimony of the Commonwealth’s expert witness regarding the bullets fired into the wall, any challenge based on either the weight or the sufficiency of the evidence on the specific intent issue would have been wholly without merit.</p>

Defense counsel failed to object to the admission of the photograph or to request, at the time of admission, that cautionary instructions be given limiting the purpose of the photographs. Appellant thus waived any objection to the <em>admission </em>of the photographs. At the time the photos were sent out with the jury appellant attempted to limit the purpose for the admission of the photographs by way of an instruction. This request was properly denied.</p>
