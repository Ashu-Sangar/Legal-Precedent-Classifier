However, nothing in this reallocation of jurisdiction over rate challenges from the P.U.C. to the courts of common pleas was designed to alter the manner in which the rate challenge is to be conducted.

In this case, the relationship between the parties is based on a written contract.

    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[210,558,1143,1274]]]'>The Commonwealth Court misinterpreted the Act when it concluded that the legislature intended that sewage rate cases be tried non-jury because they involve “intricate questions of law, of the interpretation of contracts, of economics, of engineering and of municipal management... ”. No reference to pertinent legislative history is provided, and the words of the Act certainly do not support this conclusion. An interpretation of a statute which operates to deprive an individual of a jury trial is not favored. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In fact, the words of the Act support the opposite conclusion. The Act expressly designates the court of common pleas as the forum for sewage rate cases involving municipal authorities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Jury trials have traditionally been available in actions at law in the court of common pleas, and designating the court of common pleas as the tribunal inherently includes the concept of a jury trial unless specifically excluded. Finally, the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion is completely inconsistent with the strong public policy which favors jury trials. <em>See Commonwealth v.
