Prior to trial there was an attempt by defense counsel and the office of the district attorney to reach a plea bargain on the case. The district attorney sought a plea of guilty to murder of the third degree and to one count of each of the firearms violations in return for a sentence recommendation of fifteen to thirty years on all charges while appellant sought a sentence recommendation of ten to twenty years on all charges. Because they were unable to reach an agreement on the sentence, appellant entered a plea of not guilty and waived his right to a jury trial, electing instead to be tried by a judge. Trial commenced the same day, July 14, 1975.</p>

Testimony established that the appellant, after rendering the victim’s car inoperable by dismantling the distributor, waited for her to leave a girlfriend’s home. He then shot her twice with a .357 Magnum which he was unlicensed to carry. As she lay wounded, he removed from her purse a .22 caliber Derringer he had given her and shot her with it, at close range, three times in the head, killing her instantaneously. He was apprehended immediately and detained until taken into police custody. At trial, several eyewitnesses who knew appellant testified to his prior repeated statements that he would “have to kill her” or that he was “going to kill her.”</p>

The court permitted withdrawal of the prior plea and conducted a colloquy to determine the voluntariness of the tendered plea, which was accepted. The court, however, did not explain to appellant the elements of the crimes to which the guilty plea was entered. Appellant was sentenced in accordance with the agreement with the district attorney, the same offer made to appellant before trial. Appellant filed a Petition for Reduction of Sentence which was denied by the sentencing judge on January 16,1976. No appeal was taken. On April 11, 1979, appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>Petition to Withdraw Plea of Guilty. After hearing and argument, where petitioner was represented by counsel, the court denied the relief requested.

Why then is it paramount that the elements of a crime be explained, on the record, to the defendant? In the ordinary case, where the defendant tenders a plea of guilty from a bargaining position which is devoid of finite knowledge of the evidence available against him, concern with an explanation of the elements of the crime is of greater significance than in the case where the defendant, as here, enters the plea after the Commonwealth’s case has been presented. Presumably, an explanation of the elements enables the defendant to assess the Commonwealth’s ability to prove that which he is admitting in pleading guilty by comparing the elements to the evidence he knows or has reason to believe the Commonwealth has available. Thus, he determines whether the prosecution has the ability to convict should he instead choose to exercise his right to trial. In the instant case, this decision of whether to go to trial and put the Commonwealth to its proof was no longer before the appellant. Trial was accomplished and presumably the defendant knew there was sufficient evidence to convict of murder of the first degree. A decision to plead guilty to murder of the third degree, in the face of overwhelming evidence of murder of the first degree, was a decision advantageous and opportune under the immediate circumstances and motivated by self-interest.</p>

After apparent satisfaction with the conviction for over four years, appellant relies upon <em>Ingram </em>in attempting to invalidate a plea of guilty which was entered at appellant’s request after viewing the Commonwealth’s case in chief and which was motivated by great concern over length of sentence. The trial judge, after hearing competent evidence and being empowered to find the defendant guilty of murder of the first degree, permitted him to withdraw his earlier plea of not guilty and take advantage of the plea bargain offered by the office of the district attorney. In so permitting the appellant to change his plea, the trial judge made the mistake of not explaining to the appellant the elements of murder of the third degree, including an explanation of malice, and the two firearms violations.

Although appellant promptly petitioned the court for a reduction of sentence, he sought no other relief, by appeal or otherwise, until April 11, 1979, when he filed the present petition to withdraw his guilty plea. Appellant has failed to explain his delay of three years and seven months in filing the petition to withdraw his plea. This unexplained delay bars consideration of the merits of his claim.

The essence of criminal procedure in this area, however, is the guilty plea colloquy itself, by which the voluntariness of a guilty plea is determined. This colloquy is the source of the guilty plea problem and should be the main focus of our attention. The standards by which the colloquy is judged are set forth in <em>Commonwealth v. Ingram, </em><a href="/pa/455/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="455 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="582195" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0198-01">455 Pa. 198</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=316%20A.2d%2077" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="316 A.2d 77">316 A.2d 77</a> (1974).

Our sister state of California has implemented one such alternative. There, in order to plead guilty, the defendant signs a written form, following a voluntariness hearing, which certifies that the waiver is made with a full understanding of all rights involved.

Moreover, the evolving patchwork of colloquy requirements places an onerous burden of uncertainty on the trial court, and affords numerous grounds for challenges to the content of the colloquy.
