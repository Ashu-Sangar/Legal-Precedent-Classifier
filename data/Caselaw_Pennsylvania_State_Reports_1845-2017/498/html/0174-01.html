    <p class="author" id="b242-6" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[329,547,406,42]]]'>FLAHERTY, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b242-7" data-blocks='[["BL_242.6",242,[283,612,1149,417]]]'>This is an appeal from the denial of appellant’s first Post Conviction Hearing Act (P.C.H.A.) petition. Following a jury trial, appellant was convicted of murder of the second degree. Post verdict motions were denied, and the conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. Thereafter, appellant, represented by counsel different from trial and direct-appeal counsel, filed a P.C.H.A. petition, which was denied. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b242-8" data-blocks='[["BL_242.7",242,[277,1051,1152,788]]]'>On appellant’s direct appeal, <em>Commonwealth v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">464 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">346 A.2d 48</a> (1975), this Court decided that appellant could not, for the first time on appeal, raise the new legal theory that his confession should have been suppressed as the result of an unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment in violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 118 (now Rule 130), where he had argued unsuccessfully at various stages of the proceedings below that his confession was involuntary, but did not raise the violation of Rule 130. In so deciding, this Court reversed its decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Wayman, </em><a href="/pa/454/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="454 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="579920" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0079-01">454 Pa. 79</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20784" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="309 A.2d 784">309 A.2d 784</a> (1973), which had permitted new legal arguments to be raised on appeal where (1) the new legal principles had been announced since the date of the prior proceedings or (2) the ground for relief was the same as that presented below.</p>

The authority for the new legal theory itself was this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Futch, </em><a href="/pa/447/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="447 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1942994" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0389-01">447 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%20417" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="290 A.2d 417">290 A.2d 417</a> (1972), that all evidence obtained during an “unnecessary delay” between arrest and arraignment, except evidence unrelated to the delay, is inadmissible. Relying on <em>Wayman, </em>appellant argued on direct appeal that the <em>Futch </em>decision should be <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>available for the first time on direct appeal as authority for a new legal theory (exclusion of confession because of “unnecessary delay”) in support of old grounds for relief (invalid confession) because <em>Futch </em>was handed down after trial in the instant case and because the grounds for relief had been raised below. As this Court stated on direct appeal, however, the Rule of Criminal Procedure prohibiting an unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment was in existence at the time of trial in this case. <em>Futch </em>merely explained the consequences of a violation of the rule. <em>Commonwealth v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">464 Pa. at 120</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">346 A.2d at 50</a>. Further, this Court expressly reversed <em>Wayman’s </em>rule that issues not “specifically raised” below could be raised for the first time on appeal. <a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">464 Pa. at 126</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">346 A.2d at 53</a>. The direct appeal argument that the confession should be excluded from evidence because of an unnecessary delay between arrest and confession was, therefore, waived. Violation of Rule 130 could have been raised below, but it was not.</p>
