All three of settlor’s children, appellee Herman B. Bashore, appellee Fleeta B. Matza, and Margaretta B. Moses, were living at the time of settlor’s death in 1952. In accordance with the terms of the trust, trustee Farmers Trust Company then began making periodic income payments to each of the three children. Upon the death of settlor’s child Margaretta B. Moses in 1979 the <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>present dispute arose between appellees, settlor’s two surviving children and their children, and appellant Chester L.

The orphans’ court concluded that the income distribution clause of the trust instrument demonstrates settlor’s intent to benefit, in addition to her own children, only those grandchildren who are children of a child who died before her. Because appellant’s mother was a child of settlor who died after settlor, the court held that appellant is not entitled to share in the distribution of income and that income is to be divided exclusively between the two surviving children. We disagree with the orphans’ court and conclude that settlor intended income to be distributed to the children of each of her children who should die prior to the death of her last child, in accordance with her intent to treat each of her children’s lines equally in the distribution of the trust.</p>

However, in the ascertainment of a settlor’s intent, it is fundamental that a clause must be read not in isolation but in the context in which it appears. See, e.g., <em>Hill Estate, </em><a href="/pa/432/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="432 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1919674" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0269-01">432 Pa. 269</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20A.2d%20606" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="247 A.2d 606">247 A.2d 606</a> (1968); <em>Clark Estate, </em><a href="/pa/359/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="359 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="473084" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0411-01">359 Pa. 411</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20109" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="59 A.2d 109">59 A.2d 109</a> (1948). A settlor’s intent is to be determined from all the language within the four corners of the trust instrument, the scheme of distribution and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the instrument. Only if a settlor’s intent cannot be ascertained with reasonable certainty will a court apply canons of construction, to attribute a reasonable intention to the settlor in the circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Estate of Houston, </em><a href="/pa/491/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="491 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="1765678" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0339-01">491 Pa. 339</a>, <a href="/pa/491/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="491 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="1765678" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0339-01">421 A.2d 166</a> (1980); <em>Matter of Tracy, </em><a href="/pa/464/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="464 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1710395" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0300-01">464 Pa. 300</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="464 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1710395" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0300-01">346 A.2d 750</a> (1975).</p>
    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.5",216,[281,1428,1148,465]]]'>The beginning of the disputed paragraph makes clear settlor’s intent that if, as in fact occurred, all of settlor’s children survived her, each was to receive an equal share of income. At the end of the paragraph, settlor makes clear that upon the death of her last surviving child, each line of her grandchildren is to take an equal, stirpital share of trust principal. Additionally, if any grandchild has died before the time of distribution of trust principal, the children of that grandchild are to receive his share by representation.</p>
    <p id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.6",216,[281,1910,1146,308]]]'>Thus, settlor’s scheme of distribution is to treat the lines of her children equally when all of her children are alive and when all of her children are dead.

He would not share in trust income if his parent died the day after settlor’s death. Accordingly, during the income distribution period, income payments would initially be made in one-third shares divided among all of settlor’s three children, with any predeceased child’s one-third share passing to his children by representation. However, upon the death of each child who happened to survive settlor, that child’s one-third share of income would not pass to his children, but instead would be divided among the initial takers who were still living. Thus, the children of the first child to die after settlor’s death would receive no trust income. Instead, the deceased child’s share would inure to the benefit of the two surviving children (appellees), increasing each of their shares of income one and one-half times, from 33V3% to 50% of trust income, until a second child died. At that time, the children of the second child to die also would receive no trust income. Instead, the child who happened to outlive the others would receive 100% of trust income for the rest of his or her life. Only upon the death of this last surviving child would children of children who had previously died be benefited by the trust, at which time each line of grandchildren would receive an equal, stirpital share of the trust principal.</p>

Appellees rely upon settlor’s stated purpose to make “provision for the support and maintenance of said Fleeta Bosler Bashore and her children” to argue that settlor was primarily concerned for her children’s support and maintenance. From this proposition appellees argue that settlor did not intend grandchildren in appellant’s position (the child of a child who died after settlor) to share in trust income because <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>“[p]ayment of income to a grandchild diminishes the income to the surviving children, thereby diminishing the ability of the fund to provide support, maintenance and benefits to each surviving child . ... ” Contrary to appellees’ argument, however, inclusion of appellant in the distribution of trust income would in no respect diminish appellees’ share of trust income: settlor’s two surviving children would each continue to receive the same one-third share of income that each received while appellant’s mother was living.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Thus, to interpret settlor’s inclusion in trust income of “children of children who have previously died” as restricting the class of grandchildren who may receive income to those whose parent (settlor’s child) happens to die before settlor’s death would be to impute an element of arbitrariness to settlor’s otherwise even-handed scheme of distribution. When the language, “in further trust, at the death of said Fleeta Bosler Bashore, to pay the net income to her surviving children and to the children of her children who have previously died ... so long as any of her children is living,” is read not in isolation but in the context of settlor’s entire <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>distributive plan, it must be concluded that settlor intended income to be paid to the children of each of settlor’s children who dies at any time previous to the end of the period when “any of her children is living,” that is, at any time during the income distribution period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
