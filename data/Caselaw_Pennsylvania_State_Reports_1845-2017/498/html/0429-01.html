      <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>The facts giving rise to the instant controversy can be summarized as follows. On May 31,1977, the School District of Philadelphia adopted a budget which required substantial reductions from the budget submitted by the Superintendent of Schools.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> As a result of the adoption of this reduced budget, the Board was required <em>inter alia </em>to demote approximately 240 professional employees as part of an effort to cut expenditures. Demotion notices, dated June 9, 1977, were sent out to the affected professional employees advising them that demotion hearings would be scheduled for June 20,1977. These hearings were subsequently rescheduled for June 30, 1977 because of the death of a member of the Board of Education.</p>
    <p id="b499-4" data-blocks='[["BL_499.4",499,[239,1042,1141,1104]]]'>On June 30,1977, the School Board conducted one massive hearing for all the demoted employees. During this hearing the Board presented general testimony from the administration setting forth the financial situation of the system and establishing the need for the proposed budgetary cuts. All persons demoted, who were present at the June 30, 1977 meeting, were represented by counsel. Requests for individual hearings were denied by the Board. Requests for a continuance of the hearing were denied by the Board. The opportunity to cross-examine was limited to questions about the general guidelines followed. Counsel were not permitted to ask questions relating to their clients’ individual rights or to address the question as to the arbitrariness or capriciousness of the demotion as it may have related to a particular permanent professional employee. The right to present witnesses was limited to the presentation of evidence related to the general criteria or guidelines employed to select those individuals who were to be demoted. The Board indicated its intention to provide future hearings wherein the due process requirements of §§ 1127 and 1151 of the Code would be met.</p>

      <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>The question to be decided in this appeal is a narrow one; whether under the facts the demotion of appellees could occur prior to a proper hearing before the Board of School Directors. It is conceded that appellees were entitled to an individual hearing to establish that the action was neither arbitrary nor discriminatory. It is further agreed that the proceeding held prior to the demotion did not satisfy the statutorily required hearing. It is also agreed that the Board, in good faith, intended to provide for a full hearing and, if the result was favorable to the demoted employee, reinstatement and reimbursement for loss in pay would be appropriate. Appellees argue the requirement for a hearing prior to a demotion is an absolute and inflexible mandate. The Board argues that where it is acting in good faith, attempting to accomplish that which it was legally compelled to do and the granting of a prior hearing would be impossible to provide, the procedures sought to be employed here satisfied the statutory requirements involved. A resolution of the controversy requires an analysis of the relevant statutory provisions to ascertain the controlling legislative intent.</p>
    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[253,1425,1146,306]]]'>By way of preface, the dilemma of the Board is virtually conceded. In the spring of 1977, the Board asserted that it was confronted with entering the 1977-78 school year with a deficit of $173 million dollars. Under the Educational Supplement to the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, the Board is charged to provide a balanced budget for each school year.</p>

These financial concerns could not in any way dilute the primary responsibility to maintain “a thorough and efficient system of public schools.” Pa.Const., Art. iii, § 14 (formerly Art. X, § 1). This observation, which should be obvious, apparently needs restating in view of the labor squabbles and disruptions all too frequently occurring today. Of equal importance is the fact that the maintenance of a public school system is primarily for the education and training of our youth and the incidental financial benefit of those participating therein is of secondary concern. <em>Smith v.

Rather, the <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>ambiguity has been resolved by this Court’s construction of the language in the Tenure Act of 1937, the Legislature’s reenactment of the identical language in the School Code of 1949, and the statutorily mandated presumption that this Court had thus correctly construed the Legislature’s intention that a hearing be held prior to demotion. Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(4), formerly Statutory Construction Act of 1937, 46 P.S. § 552(4). See <em>Commonwealth v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/469/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="469 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1722093" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0024-01">469 Pa. 24</a>, 27, <a href="/pa/469/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="469 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1722093" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0024-01">364 A.2d 886</a>, 887 (1976) (“statutes are not presumed to make changes in the rules and principles of the common law or prior existing law beyond what is expressly declared in their provisions”). Nonetheless, in complete disregard of the Legislature’s own statutory indication of its intention, the opinion of Mr. Justice Nix engages in a <em>de novo </em>grammatical analysis of the “ambiguous” provision tó arrive at the conclusion that the Legislature intended to permit demotions without prior individual hearings.</p>
    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[249,1305,1146,542]]]'>Not only is this conclusion contrary to established principles of statutory construction, but it also serves as the basis for a totally unnecessary remedy. Although acknowledging that the financial situation which gave rise to the present controversy no longer exists, the opinion of Mr. Justice Nix remands the record with directions to appellant School Board that it may demote appellees without a prior hearing “if present financial conditions so dictate.” As there has been no showing that the unusual set of facts on this record is likely to recur, this remedy is wholly advisory.</p>
    <p id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[249,1882,1146,211]]]'>Because the result reached by the opinion of Mr. Justice Nix is without support in law and without support on the record, I dissent and would dismiss the appeal as having been improvidently granted.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b508-6" data-blocks='[["BL_508.6",508,[250,2170,1145,99]]]'>O’BRIEN, C. J., and LARSEN, J., join in this dissenting opinion.</p>
