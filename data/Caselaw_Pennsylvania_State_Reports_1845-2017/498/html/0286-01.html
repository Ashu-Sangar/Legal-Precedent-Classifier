The resolution requires patrons to pay a tax at the rate of 15% of the consideration for each parking transaction. Operators of non-residential parking places are required to obtain a registration certificate at an annual cost of Ten ($10.00) Dollars, to collect the parking tax from patrons, keep chronological records of all transactions, and file monthly returns with the tax collector. Any operator’s failure to comply with certain conditions subjects the operator to a monetary penalty that may equal 100% of the proper tax as well as penalty and interest.

The argument of prematurity is particularly inappropriate in this case since under Section 6 of the Act, challenges to a tax imposed pursuant to the Act must be filed within the thirty (30) days following the adoption of the taxing ordinance or resolution, which thirty (30) days are a mandatory waiting period for the taxing authority. In other words, taxing authorities, when levying a tax for the first time, must allow thirty (30) days for taxpayer appeals <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>to be filed by prescribing an effective date at least thirty (30) days from the time of adoption of the taxing ordinance or resolution. If appellants were to succeed in their contention of prematurity, appeals not premature would be too late and no patron would be able to challenge the tax. All patrons able to file timely appeals from the tax are potential patrons.

In order to show transference of possession or a bailment, <em>Taylor v. Philadelphia Parking Authority, supra, </em>is cited. That case held that when the owner of an automobile parked on a commercial parking lot retains control of that vehicle by keeping the keys to it, the nature of the arrangement between the proprietor of the lot and the car owner is one of a lease of parking privileges. The nature of the legal <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>relationship was defined for the purpose of determining who assumes the risk of loss when a theft of contents of the parked automobile occurs. Mr. Justice McBride, speaking for the Court, commented, “The characterization of the relationship as a bailment or a lease ... is based solely on whether the alleged bailor delivered the custody and control of the item to the bailee.” <a href="/pa/398/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="398 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1289153" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0009-01">398 Pa. at 12</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20525" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="156 A.2d 525">156 A.2d at 527</a>. But the categorization of the transaction as a bailment, and thus a transference of possession of property, does not aid in analysis here. The emphasis in Section 8(4) is upon “retail sale” primarily, and upon the transfer of title or possession of tangible personal property secondarily. The “retail sale” component of Section 8(4) is constricted by the modifying phrase “involving the transfer of title or possession of tangible personal property,” not replaced by it. And since in bailment transactions the transference of possession is temporary, no ownership interest is transfered and the bailee’s possession is on behalf of the bailor,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> a bailment cannot meet this Court’s essential element inherent in the definition of a sales tax: a tax imposed upon a transaction whereby property is acquired. <em>Mellon Sq. G. Inc. v. Pub. P. Auth. of Pitts., supra; Blauner’s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/330/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="330 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1182979" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0340-01">330 Pa. 340</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20889" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="198 A. 889">198 A. 889</a>, 892 (1938). Neither in our definition of a sales tax nor under Section 8(4) was the acquisition or possession of property intended to be a temporary one for the benefit of another. Further examination of the secondary consideration of transfer of possession is unnecessary. We hold there has been no sale when a valet parking transaction occurs.</p>
