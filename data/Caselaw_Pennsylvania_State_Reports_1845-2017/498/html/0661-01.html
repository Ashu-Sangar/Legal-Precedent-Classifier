Respondent was found guilty of the charges by a court sitting without a jury. The Superior Court granted relief on the <a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>ground that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to object to a defective jury-trial-waiver colloquy.</p>

For the waiver to be “knowing and intelligent,” the defendant must know “the essential ingredients of a jury trial”—</p>

    <p id="b729-8" data-blocks='[["BL_729.7",729,[218,1120,1142,526]]]'>The record is clear that respondent’s understanding of these “essential ingredients” is not reflected in the on-the-record colloquy mandated by Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1101. Although the judge explored respondent’s understanding of the fact that “a jury would consist of twelve people who would be selected and sworn from a larger panel of jurors from all over [the county],” he did not explore respondent’s understanding of either the fact that the jury’s verdict would have to be unanimous or the fact that respondent could participate in jury selection.</p>
    <p id="b729-9" data-blocks='[["BL_729.8",729,[215,1680,1141,415]]]'>Despite the deficient colloquy, the record also is clear that, at the close of the colloquy, respondent signed a written form which states that respondent “fully understand^]” the ingredients of a jury trial, including the unanimity and defendant-participation requirements which were not explained in the colloquy. This form was also signed by respondent’s counsel and by the trial judge who had conducted the colloquy.</p>

Morin, </em><a href="/pa/477/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="477 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1738335" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0080-01">477 Pa. 80</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="477 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1738335" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0080-01">383 A.2d 832</a> (1978). There, a new trial was granted on a record that contained nothing other than a colloquy which was manifestly defective under the requirements of Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1101. Thus “the only conclusion possible [was] that [the defendant’s] previous counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue of the validity of the jury trial waiver.” <a href="/pa/477/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="477 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1738335" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0080-01">477 Pa. at 86</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="477 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1738335" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0080-01">383 A.2d at 832</a>.</p>

This form must be accorded prima facie validity. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Myrick, </em><a href="/pa/468/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="468 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1719722" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0155-01">468 Pa. 155</a>, 161, <a href="/pa/468/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="468 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1719722" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0155-01">360 A.2d 598</a>, 601 (1976) (either colloquy or signed statement reflecting defendant’s waiver of rights pursuant to Pa.R.

Therefore, we must conclude on the basis of the present record that respondent was aware of his rights, and that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to defects in the colloquy. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Rice, </em><a href="/pa/456/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="456 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="584461" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0090-01">456 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=318%20A.2d%20705" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="318 A.2d 705">318 A.2d 705</a> (1974) (counsel not ineffective for failing to pursue baseless claim).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
