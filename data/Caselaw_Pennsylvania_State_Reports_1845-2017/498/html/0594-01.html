The administratrix, the appellee on this appeal, seeks damages for the death of James Sherk, who died after having been struck in the head by a “B-B” fired from a Daisy Power King Model 880 pump-up air rifle by Robert Saenz, a friend of the decedent. At trial appellee proceeded against appellant on the theory that <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>appellant, the manufacturer of the air rifle, had failed to provide an adequate warning of the rifle’s lethal propensity and that the alleged failure to warn of the lethal propensity of the air rifle had caused James Sherk’s death.

See also <em>Kuisis v. Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., </em>supra. The claimed “defect” in the Daisy Power King Model 880 pump-up air rifle was the alleged failure on the part of appellant Daisy-Heddon to provide an adequate warning of the Power King’s lethal propensity. Although appellee proceeded on the theory that if the lethal propensity had been known, Robert Saenz would never have directed the Power King at James Sherk’s head, appellee’s proof established facts from which it must be concluded that Robert Saenz was legally chargeable with knowledge of the Power King’s lethal propensity.</p>

Robert Saenz was aware that “depending] on how many times you pumped <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>[the rifle] up,” the BBs fired from the rifle could shatter the bottles and pierce through the cans. He also testified that he had known that the air rifle was “some[what more] powerful” than the spring BB guns he had previously used. Moreover, he knew that a BB fired from the Power King could blind a person and that he should never point a gun at anyone. Indeed, Robert Saenz testified that he had expected to use the Power King to kill rabbits and rats. He had been told by his father and mother not to use the Power King until his father had instructed him in its use. On the day of the shooting, Robert Saenz used the gun without permission and without having read the instructions accompanying the Power King.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

He knew that in order for air to be pumped into the rifle, the bolt had to be opened and the manual safety device had to be pushed to the “on” position, in which position the red mark indicating that the rifle was ready to fire would not be visible. He also knew that the trigger would not fire the rifle when the bolt was open or when the safety was pushed to the “on” position. Robert Saenz admitted that, when he had directed the Power King at the decedent, he knew that the Power King had been pumped with air. He testified that he “just didn’t bother” to check the position of the safety device. Instead, he pushed the safety device and “just assumed that it went on safe.” In fact, he had pushed the safety from the “on” to the “off” position, thereby enabling the rifle to fire.</p>

He testified that he had “called Jimmy’s name,” intending that James Sherk would turn and look at him, and then “squeezed the trigger, thinking the safety was on.” Robert Saenz further testified, “I was just horsing around, <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>intended to scare him. I was just fooling around.” He said that, when he directed the rifle at James Sherk’s head, he knew that “this was something that [he] shouldn’t be doing” and “this was something that could injure [his] friend.”</p>

The Power King was purchased by Mrs. Saenz from a mail order catalogue at the request of Robert and his older brother Wayne. Mrs. Saenz testified that she had “no knowledge of guns,” and did not know “what BB guns look like.” She purchased the Power King air rifle without consulting or informing her husband, at a time when her son Wayne “just hit [her] at the right moment with the proper approach.” When the rifle arrived in the mail, Mrs. Saenz did not open the box or read the instructions. Instead, the box “was put away,” and Mrs. Saenz directed her sons that the gun was not to be used until their father had instructed them in its use. Later that week, Mr. Saenz looked at the gun but did not read the operation and instruction manuals accompanying the Power King. Mr. Saenz testified that he had told Robert not to point the gun at anyone and not to use the gun until he had been instructed by him in its use.

Specifically, plaintiff has failed to establish any causal connection between the asserted inadequacy of defendant’s warning and the tragic death of plaintiff’s decedent. However, I wish to make clear my view that the issue we are dealing with in <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>this case is causation in fact, not the legal concept of proximate cause. Taking the evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, it is clear the person firing the fatal shot was well aware of the substantial risk of death or serious injury involved in pointing this gun at decedent’s head and pulling the trigger. Whatever false expectations of safety the Daisy logo gave the community regarding this high powered air gun, the record shows the youth firing the shot knew the risks a warning would have alerted him to and acted without regard to them. The imposition of liability in any products case, including one based on Section 402A strict liability, requires a showing that the plaintiff’s injury was caused by some defect in the product. Thus, where a finding that the product is defective within the meaning of section 402A is predicated on the theory that the manufacturer failed to provide adequate warnings of the dangerous propensities of the product the plaintiff must prove the failure to warn caused plaintiff’s injury. <em>See </em>Annot., <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.L.R.%203d%201085" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="13 A.L.R. 3d 1085">13 A.L.R.3d 1085</a> (1967). Regardless of whether Daisy’s warnings were inadequate, rendering the product defective under section 402A, plaintiff failed to establish causation because Saenz and his parents knew the risks which an adequate warning would have described and acted without regard to them. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 402A comment n (1965), <em>See also Martinez </em>v. <em>Dixie Carriers, Inc., </em><a href="/f2d/529/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="529 F.2d 457" data-case-ids="10590615" data-case-paths="/f2d/529/0457-01">529 F.2d 457</a> (5th Cir. 1976). Given that circumstance, the trial court’s refusal to admit testimony of the Community’s perception of the non-deadly nature of Daisy-Heddon air rifles, as that perception related to the adequacy of the warnings, was correct.</p>

    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[183,888,1145,1260]]]'>The liability imposed on manufacturers of defective products is denominated strict, or without fault, because the usual requirement that plaintiff show a breach of duty has been eliminated, or attenuated to the point of elimination. In such cases, under the principles of section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, a plaintiff is not required to prove the defendant failed to discharge his duty of care. In addition it either is assumed his duty extends to all users of the product, or that harm from the defect is foreseeable to all users. 2 Dooley, Modern Tort Law § 32.55 (1977). Thus the manufacturer may be liable to any person suffering harm even if he exercised all due care. <em>See Berkebile v. Brantly Helicopter Corp., </em><a href="/pa/462/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="462 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="485148" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0083-01">462 Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="462 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="485148" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0083-01">337 A.2d 893</a> (1975) (plurality opinion). However, plaintiff must prove a defect existed in the product at the time of the accident and that this defect was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries. <em>See Kuisis v. Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., </em><a href="/citations/?q=451%20Pa.%20321" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="451 Pa. 321">451 Pa. 321</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="319 A.2d 914">319 A.2d 914</a> (1974). If the policy issues relevant to proximate cause are analyzed in terms of foreseeability, distinct notions relating to cause can be easily confused with those relating to duty in the sense of scope of the risk. Extension of the duty to manufacture a product free of defects to all users may then be incorrectly thought to eliminate the requirement of proximate cause.</p>

Accordingly, I do not share the dissent’s view that we have “overruled an entire body of Pennsylvania law concerning causation (substantial factor, proximate cause, intervening cause and superseding cause) ...” <em>See supra </em>at 637 (Larsen, J., dissenting).</p>
    <p id="b672-4" data-blocks='[["BL_672.4",672,[261,564,1147,1268]]]'>Strict liability for failure to warn is a means of protecting users of products from generally unrecognized risks in unavoidably dangerous useful products. By bringing the hidden risk home to the user it protects against a use in a manner likely to create that risk. Thus, the product is defective under the doctrine of strict liability if it is unreasonably dangerous without an adequate warning and no such warning is provided. Where the actor knows risk is present and still chooses to act without regard to it, the warning serves no purpose in preventing the particular harm. Imposing liability in such a case cannot be based on any connection between the failure to warn and the harm incurred. It can only follow from the assumption that a manufacturer is an insurer against all harm resulting from use of his product. Such an assumption must either be based on the inarticulated notion that no degree of social utility in a unavoidably dangerous but not defective product can prevent liability, even for fully recognized dangers; or that the degree of utility must be balanced against the nature of the risk by the fact finder. The former view makes all manufacturers insurers against all harm their products cause. The latter leaves to a jury the issue of whether the Daisy pump rifle’s deadly propensities outweighed its utility. Neither seems required by our case law.</p>

That argument, which is superficially appealing, assumes a lethal weapon cannot be marketed without liability for all harm it causes, including harm from an unreasonable use, regardless of the nature and quality of the warnings accompanying it. Accepting this argument would eliminate the requirement that the product be defective and impose liability for harm from unavoidably dangerous propensities regardless of <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>warning, or knowledge, of those dangers. On that theory, Daisy’s marketing of the rifle would constitute a substantial factor in causing the death of the Sherk child, when coupled with Saenz’ foreseeable negligence. Such a theory was not advanced at trial, is not supported by the cases and has no relevance to the issue of admissibility of evidence of the community’s perception of the deadly nature of Daisy’s pump rifle. The proffered testimony was offered on the issue of the adequacy or inadequacy of Daisy’s warnings. The arguable absence of adequate warnings plainly did not “cause” plaintiff’s injury within any meaning of the word.</p>

From these facts, a jury might well have found Daisy’s conduct to have been unreasonable and negligent in placing a product on a market under a logo conveying a certain image of safety without taking adequate precautions to disassociate the Power King from that image. <em>See Incollingo v. Ewing, supra </em><a href="/pa/444/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="444 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="1938647" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0263-01">444 Pa. at 292</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20206" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="282 A.2d 206">282 A.2d at 226</a>.

Yet such intent is irrelevant where it was mislabeled and marketed under the Daisy logo in a manner substantially similar to the marketing of other BB-guns which were, despite cautions and instructions accompanying those guns, occasionally fired at other children causing less severe injuries. (Daisy’s officers, in fact, were aware that their instructions were sometimes ignored. Testimony of Guy Braughler (N.T. at 285) and Henry Waring (N.T. at 391).) Despite the language of “intended use” in the <em>Azzarello </em>definition of “defect”, “intended use” cannot be construed to be a ceiling on the manufacturer’s liability since, as occurred here, the product might well invite other non-“intended” uses. The rationale of <em>Azzarello </em>was to <em>relieve </em>the plaintiff of added burdens of proving elements that ring of negligence, yet the elevation of “intended use” to a supplier’s defense, as the lower court rulings and the majority have done in effect, would impose the ultimate burden upon the consumer — the burden of proving the manufacturer/seller’s subjective intent. The negligence concepts of a supplier’s fault or lack of fault have been interjected into the dispute, contrary to the admonitions of <em>Azzarello </em>and of <em>Berkebile. Berkebile </em>stated “[bjecause the seller is liable in strict liability regardless of any negligence, whether he could have foreseen a particular injury is irrelevant in a strict liability case.” If a supplier’s foreseeability is irrelevant, it goes without saying that the supplier’s <em>intent </em>is irrelevant.

The “ordinary consumer expectations” certainly were relevant to the “invitational aspect” as they had a direct bearing on the degree of danger associated with the product, as did the promotional activities regarding traditional Daisy BB-guns. The same is true of the incidence of injury, and the extent and type of injuries, normally associated with BB-guns. The evidence of factors external to the Power King was relevant to the image of relative safety of similar guns, without which evidence the jury could not accurately assess “how much warning was adequate” to dispel that image and false sense of security. <em>See Maize v. Atlantic Refining Co., supra. </em>In a strict products liability action based upon failure to adequately warn, the trial court should admit all otherwise admissible evidence tending to demonstrate the product’s physical characteristics as well as evidence of factors extrinsic to the physical properties of the product which illustrate its “invitational aspect”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_9" id="ref_footnote_3_9">9</a>

Take the same situation presented herein, only substitute a 30/30 rifle for the Power King. Assuming the same marketing activities and use of Daisy logo, and assuming warnings which said only “this gun is much more powerful than the traditional Daisy BB-gun,” it would be virtually impossible for the jury to determine the adequacy of the warning without knowing of the sense of security that attaches to the BB-guns. In the absence of evidence showing that “sense”, the jury would have to decide the case in a vacuum, looking only at the physical characteristics of the rifle (including the warnings, instructions and advertisements specifically relating to it), and might decide, not being sufficiently aware of the danger fostered by that sense of security, that there was no defect because the warnings were adequate. The jury in the instant case, because of the evidentiary rulings, was operating under a similar handicap — the difference between this hypothetical and the situation actually presented is merely one of degree, and a slight one at that.</p>
