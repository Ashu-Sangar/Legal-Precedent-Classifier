The 1937 Act and the subsequent enabling acts provide that the Commission is to consist of five members: the Secretary of Transportation, serving ex officio, and four members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of two thirds of the Senate.

Of these issues, bonds in the principal amount of $95,936,000 are presently outstanding. The bonds are secured by a Trust Indenture, dated September 1,1952, under which the Fidelity Bank acts as trustee for the bondholders. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Commission is required to act from time to time with respect to such functions as the payment of invoices, maintenance of tolls, collection of revenues, award<a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>ing of construction contracts, obtaining and maintaining insurance policies, and the like.

At that time, the Commission consisted of three active members: Chairman Jack I. Greenblat, Secretary of Transportation Thomas D. Larson, and Commissioner Bollinger. A fourth member of the Commission, Peter J. Camiel, had been suspended from the Commission by the Governor on May 1, 1980, as a result of Camiel’s indictment on criminal charges brought by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Because it appeared that Commissioner Bollinger’s resignation would reduce the voting membership on the Commission to less than the statutory quorum of three members, Fidelity, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Indenture, filed an action for declaratory judgment in the Commonwealth Court on July 20, 1981, together with a motion for an expedited hearing. Named as defendants were the Turnpike Commission and all of its individual members, including Peter J. Camiel. Fidelity asked that the court declare the Commission to be capable of taking valid and legally binding action to operate and maintain the Turnpike upon the unanimous vote of the two remaining voting members.</p>

Commissioner Larson, believing that default was not imminent, opposed the granting of a declaratory judgment but requested the court to retain jurisdiction over the action “until such time as a default is clearly anticipated.” Mr. Camiel filed an answer alleging that his suspension from the Commission by the Governor was a nullity and asking, by way of new matter, that the court declare it as such. In addition to these answers, the Attorney General, acting as the representative of the Turnpike Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, Act of October 15, 1980, P.L. 950, 71 P.S. §§ 732-101 et seq., filed a motion to dismiss Fidelity’s action as moot, contending that the withdrawal of Commissioner Bollinger’s resignation extinguished the cause of action.</p>

Mr. Camiel filed an answer contending that, whatever the status of Commissioner Bollinger, the question of the validity of Camiel’s suspension should be decided. By way of new matter, Mr. Camiel stated that on August 4, 1981, a judgment of acquittal had been entered on the criminal charges that formed the basis of his suspension. Camiel asked that the Court declare his entitlement to reinstatement to the Commission “with retroactive pay and other emoluments of office from May 21, 1980,” the date of his suspension.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Judge Crumlish then went on to hold that the judgment of acquittal entered on the criminal charges against Mr. Camiel rendered his suspension a nullity and that Camiel was entitled to immediate reinstatement to the Commission with back pay from May 21, 1980. Judge Crumlish also addressed the dispute over who should represent the Commission, holding that representation by both the Attorney General and Commission counsel was proper and that the Commonwealth Attorneys Act was constitutional both on its face and in its application to the Commission.</p>

Fidelity took no position on the court’s decision as to Mr. Camiel but joined Chairman Greenblat and Commission counsel in requesting the court to grant the declaratory relief originally sought, reminding the court that a reversal of the decision to reinstate Mr. Camiel would leave the Commission with only two voting members.</p>

The court stated that, notwithstanding the government’s appeal, the judgment of acquittal served to extinguish the indictments upon which Mr. Camiel’s suspension had been based. Commissioner Larson and the Attorney General immediately filed notices of appeal to this Court. At a regular meeting of the Turnpike Commission on December 15, Deputy Secretary of Transportation David Sims, acting on behalf of Commissioner Larson, announced that because the Attorney General’s appeal from the order reinstating Camiel worked an automatic supersedeas of that order, Mr. Camiel was not a voting member of the Commission. Sims then stated that the absence of a quorum of three Commissioners rendered the Commission incapable of legally transacting business, whereupon he left the meeting. On the same day, President Judge Crumlish, sua sponte, issued an order that “no appeal filed pursuant to the Order of this Court dated December 14, 1981, shall act as an automatic supersedeas.”</p>

In July of 1981, the bondholders of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission faced <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>considerable uncertainty and insecurity because the impending resignation of Commissioner Bollinger would have left the Commission with only two voting members, one fewer than the quorum of three required by statute for the transaction of Commission business. Accordingly, Fidelity Bank, as trustee for the bondholders, availed itself of section 7533 of the Declaratory Judgments Act, which provides: “Any person . .. whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute .. . may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the . . . statute . . . . ” Quite simply, Fidelity wished to know, in the interest of the stability and marketability of Commission bonds, whether two members of the Commission could function as three. That question, which has yet to be answered, was ripe for consideration when Fidelity filed its suit in July. It was again ripe when Commissioner Bollinger resubmitted his resignation at the end of November, and would have been decided but for the Commonwealth Court’s replacement of that question with the question of Mr. Camiel’s right to reinstatement. Because it is manifestly apparent that the court’s consideration of Mr. Camiel’s new matter worked to increase rather than alleviate the uncertainty faced by Fidelity and its bondholders, we conclude that such consideration was improper and that the court’s order directing the reinstatement of Mr. Camiel must be vacated.</p>

See <em>In re Gross, </em><a href="/pa/476/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="476 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1736936" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0203-01">476 Pa. 203</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="476 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1736936" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0203-01">382 A.2d 116</a> (1978). If, as in fact happened, Commissioner Bollinger were then to resign before the necessary action was taken to fill the vacancies on the Commission, the court could have proceeded to decide on its merits the question presented by Fidelity. Instead, after dismissing Fidelity’s action as moot, <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>the court, in the interest of “judicial economy,” entertained Mr. Camiel’s new matter and decided his claim to reinstatement in his favor. As the foregoing procedural history illustrates, the court’s decision to address Mr. Camiel’s contentions has resulted not in judicial economy but in a myriad of motions and appeals, the perpetuation of uncertainty, and the relegation of Fidelity to the position of spectator in its own lawsuit.</p>
    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[259,732,1149,1031]]]'>The court's order of November 13 directing the reinstatement of Mr. Camiel and Commissioner Bollinger’s subsequent resignation on November 30 placed Fidelity in a virtually impossible position with respect to its action for declaratory judgment. As long as the Commonwealth Court’s order reinstating Mr. Camiel remained in effect, the declaratory judgment action would remain moot, despite Commissioner Bollinger’s resignation on November 30. Thus, a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the action as moot would fail unless the court were to reverse its reinstatement of Mr. Camiel, an issue upon whose merits Fidelity has consistently and understandably taken no position. If the court were to reaffirm its order reinstating Mr. Camiel, the uncertainty from which Fidelity sought relief would of course remain, for reversal or vacation of the order would leave, and indeed has left, only two members on the Commission, with the question of the ability of those two members to transact Commission business yet to be answered.</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[259,1806,1148,484]],["BL_157.1",157,[215,310,1143,534]]]'>The court’s decision on December 14 to reaffirm its order directing the reinstatement of Mr. Camiel instead of addressing the merits of Fidelity’s action also placed the court itself in an impossible position. There could be no question that the decision would be appealed. Indeed, the Attorney General had filed a notice of appeal to this Court even before the Commonwealth Court’s decision on whether to grant reconsideration. Pa.R.App.P. 1736(b) states that the taking of an appeal by an officer of the Commonwealth <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>acting in his official capacity “shall operate as a supersedeas in favor of such party.” Under this rule, the Attorney General’s appeal would have prevented the order directing the reinstatement of Mr. Camiel from taking effect, thus leaving a two-member Commission of uncertain status, the very situation that Fidelity’s action sought to avoid. Apparently to prevent this occurrence, the Commonwealth Court undertook to order, sua sponte, that no appeal should act as a supersedeas, despite the fact that such an order has no basis in our Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>
    <p id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[211,881,1144,1074]]]'>Moreover, the order cannot have been of much comfort to the Commission’s bondholders, because not only did the possibility remain that the reinstatement of Mr. Camiel could be reversed or vacated on appeal but also the federal government was in the process of appealing the judgment of acquittal entered on the criminal charges against Mr. Camiel. Indeed, even if this Court were to address the merits of Mr. Camiel’s claim to reinstatement and decide in his favor, the uncertainty from which Fidelity seeks relief on behalf of its bondholders would not be dispelled, for the appeal from the judgment of acquittal has yet to be decided. If that judgment should be reversed on appeal and the jury verdict of guilty reinstated, Mr. Camiel would be subject to automatic removal from the Commission pursuant to Article VI, section 4 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, see <em>McSorley v.

Thus it is apparent that section 403(b) does not compel the ouster of the Attorney General when agency counsel intervenes.

Although the Turnpike Act does indeed require that a quorum of three commissioners “for all purposes, must act unanimously,” 36 P.S. § 652d, nowhere does the act speak to the “purpose” of appointing counsel to represent the Commission in litigation. On the other hand, section 403(b) of the Commonwealth Attorneys Act specifically authorizes an agency chairman to direct agency counsel to petition to intervene in litigation involving the agency in which the Attorney General has refused to allow himself to be superseded.</p>

This argument cleverly equates a determination of the ripeness of the cause for a declaratory judgment with a proceeding in the nature of a request for reinstatement of Mr. Camiel. The issue is not whether the Commonwealth Court had the power in that action to reinstate Mr. Camiel, but rather a determination of his status for purposes of deciding whether in fact the controversy was ripe. The majority’s attempt to implicitly insist upon a formal reinstatement proceeding before the question of the status of Mr. Camiel could properly be considered is a thin facade to cover the absence of the critical fact required before a court should entertain an action for declaratory judgment.</p>
    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[189,1045,1143,634]]]'>I am totally at a loss to understand the majority’s statement that the consideration of Mr. Camiel’s status created uncertainty and, therefore, should not have been addressed. It is undeniable that if at the time the lawsuit was before the court there were three members of the Commission legally entitled to participate in the Commission’s business, then the question sought to be clarified had no existence in reality. Restated, there would have been no controversy or uncertainty to be resolved. To presume the uncertainty as the majority seeks to do on the pretext of avoiding uncertainty is not only absurd but it also nullifies the clear purpose of § 7537.</p>

If the majority is of the view that the issue was so clear that it does not require further study and consideration, then valuable judicial time is being squandered by allowing the Commonwealth Court to wrestle with an issue that the majority now sees so clearly. On the other hand, if there is a serious question as to the statutory authority for two members to bind the Commission, I am at <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>a lost to determine the source of this Court’s authority to grant that power even on an interim basis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

Nor can I comprehend the basis for this Court’s authorization of two members acting for the Commission pending the determination as to whether or not the legislature has provided such authority.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[282,649,1148,986]]]'>In summary, we should have first considered the merits of the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that Mr. Camiel was at this point and time entitled to serve as a member of the Commission. If after such consideration we concurred in that judgment, then we would have been required to accept the conclusion that the issue sought to be decided by way of declaratory judgment was not ripe for consideration. If we had reached the conclusion that Mr. Camiel was still in a suspended status, we would under the circumstances have had two alternatives. We could, as the majority does today, remand the question as to whether or not two members can bind the Commission where there are not three or more members capable of functioning. However, by deferring that decision, we would be precluded from authorizing the two members to act until the issue was ultimately resolved. The other alternative, which I believe would then have been more appropriate, would have been for us to reach the merits of that question and to have provided a definitive answer.</p>

It should breed no further anomalies. The <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>Turnpike Commission is without members sufficient to constitute a quorum. This deficiency is caused by the suspension of one member and the resignation of another. In this vacuum, the Fidelity Bank, as trustee of Turnpike bonds, seeks by Declaratory Judgment to know whether two members of the Commission may act in place of three. The matter came first before the Commonwealth Court. There, two things were determined: first, that the suspended member be reinstated and second, that the case was moot because the member who resigned withdrew his resignation and therefore, a quorum existed. That is, it existed for a few days until the member re-resigned and the status of the reinstated member was placed under attack by appeal of this Court.</p>
    <p id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[199,1021,1144,1054]]]'>If the suspended member was improperly reinstated, there is no quorum; if not, there is a quorum. The majority opinion finds, and I agree, that to determine that question, the Governor, whose action suspended the member, must be a party to these proceedings. He is not and that question cannot be answered now. The majority opinion then takes a step I do not believe we are entitled to take. They authorize two members to be a quorum when the statute mandates three. See 36 Pa.C.S.A. § 652d. While I have no doubt that extraordinary occasions invest this Court with extraordinary power, this case has a factitious ring of impending calamity. The Legislature, with swift powers of resolution at hand, seems unperturbed. It can fulfill the requirements of the statute it created. Whatever its reasons may be for not doing so, the responsibility is clearly that of other branches of government. For this Court to rewrite a statute and invest two Commission members with a power their creators did not give them, is to my mind an exercise in judicial statute writing that we ought not indulge, nor be required to do, while a viable Legislature exists.</p>
