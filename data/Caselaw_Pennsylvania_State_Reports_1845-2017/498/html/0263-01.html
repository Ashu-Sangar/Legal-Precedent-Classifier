He then, as part of the same order, determined the claimant was no longer entitled to compensation as of October 9,1978 based on the defense’s expert medical testimony that the employee was “normal” and symptom free on the termination date. However, this expert had also testified claimant should not return to the heavy work of his old job because of his age and massive disc injury, which had required surgical correction. The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board affirmed and its decision was in turn affirmed by the Commonwealth Court. We granted review.</p>

Therein, the fact finder should make specific findings on whether the employee was in fact unable to return to his old job following the operation; if so, whether his inability to resume those duties was related to his April 3, 1978 injury; and, if both those questions are answered yes, a determination of his earning power in the light of available work under the principles set out in our decision in <em>Barrett v.

    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[268,1199,1149,667]],["BL_333.1",333,[218,311,1140,793]]]'>Such an appreciation of <em>Barrett </em>has not been demonstrated here. The record contains relevant, competent evidence of the injured employee’s inability to return to his former employment through his own testimony on his duties and that of the defense’s expert witness that an attempt to perform them was medically contraindicated. The referee has not told us whether he was inclined to believe or disbelieve that evidence. Our law of Workers’ Compensation does not require an employee to bear the risk of probable severe and totally disabling reinjury by return to heavy work on pain of foregoing all compensation. <em>See e.g. Modern Cooling Company v. Driscoll, </em><a href="/pa-commw/18/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="18 Pa. Commw. 22" data-case-ids="1865578" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/18/0022-01">18 Pa.

In such instance the fact finder <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>is required to proceed to a consideration of those jobs the employer shows are available to claimant which do not pose that risk and, upon such consideration, award compensation for partial disability to the extent appropriate under the wages he can earn in those available jobs. If it appears the employee has not sought, or chosen not to take such available work, his compensation can be appropriately reduced or suspended. Such an analysis serves the interest of both the employer and employee. It reduces the employer’s risk of being burdened with a lifetime obligation for total disability if the employee reinjures himself by an effort to perform a job for which he is physically incapable. At the same time it requires the employee to seek other suitable employment shown by the employer to be available and thus mitigate the loss occasioned by his injury.</p>
