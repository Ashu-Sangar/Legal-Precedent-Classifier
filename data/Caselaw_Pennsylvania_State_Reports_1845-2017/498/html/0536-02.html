We have held that “our common law permits the admission of an unavailable witness’ prior recorded testimony from a preliminary hearing, provided the defendant had counsel and a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the earlier proceeding.” <em>Commonwealth v. Scarborough, </em><a href="/pa/491/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="491 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1765636" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0300-01">491 Pa. 300</a>, 317, <a href="/pa/491/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="491 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1765636" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0300-01">421 A.2d 147</a>, 155 (1980). “A witness who invokes the privilege against self-incrimination is ‘unavailable’ for purposes of the hearsay exception permitting the introduction of the notes of his testimony from a prior judicial proceeding.” <em>Commonwealth v. Rodgers, </em><a href="/pa/472/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="472 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="1727727" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0435-01">472 Pa. 435</a>, 452, <a href="/pa/472/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="472 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="1727727" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0435-01">372 A.2d 771</a>, 779 (1977) (plurality opinion). The tape of Mastrota’s preliminary hearing testimony was thus admissible against appellee precisely because appellee had counsel and an opportunity, which he in fact exercised, to cross-examine Mastrota at that hearing.</p>
    <p id="b606-6" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[261,1413,1148,568]]]'>If we were to permit appellee to impeach an unavailable coconspirator’s prior testimony through the admission of subsequently created tapes and • pretrial applications, we would open the door to every coconspirator to claim in a letter, tape or pretrial application that his prior testimony was false or coerced. This would deprive the opposing party of any opportunity to rehabilitate its witness and make a mockery of the truth-seeking purpose of trial. The trial would thus become a contest of hearsay tapes, memoranda and legal pleadings, none of which were ever subject to cross-examination. This we will not allow.</p>
