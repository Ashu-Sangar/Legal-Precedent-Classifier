He seeks a declaration and direction in mandamus to respondent Secretary of the Commonwealth that three seats on the Commonwealth Court, two of which are presently vacant and one of which will become vacant in June, 1983, are to be filled at the upcoming general election to be held on November 2, 1982. The petition was filed in the Commonwealth Court on July 12, 1982. Upon applica<a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>tion of petitioner and agreement of respondent, this Court assumed plenary jurisdiction on August 16, 1982.

Mencer, who resigned from office on April 15, 1982, to accept an appointment to the federal district court. The seat due to become vacant in June of 1983 is presently held by Judge Genevieve Blatt, who will reach the mandatory retirement age on June 13, 1983. See Pa. Const. art. V, § 16(b). Although nominations for appointment to the Commonwealth Court to fill the seats previously held by Judge Wilkinson and Judge Mencer have been submitted by the Governor to the Senate, confirmation has not yet occurred, and the seats remain unfilled.</p>

Rather, respondent argues that because this Court decided <em>Cavanaugh </em>before the deadline for the certification of offices for election, “ ‘circumstances’ clearly allowed for an orderly election process [and] a normal election in every respect. Here there is no opportunity for an orderly, let alone, a normal election process.” Brief of respondent at 13. In respondent’s view, petitioner’s failure to file the present petition until July 12,1982, after the May primary election and five months after the February 16, 1982, certification deadline, constitutes laches, which should bar consideration of petitioner’s claim for relief.</p>
