MePherran and wife conveyed to Porter W.

The deed was an absolute deed in fee simple containing the words “ grant, bargain, sell,” and also contained a receipt signed by the grantor for $7,500, the consideration mentioned. There was no reference in the deed to any incumbrance, but in point of fact the land was subject to a mortgage created by the grantor, upon which there was still due •when decedent died, the sum of $4,128.25. When the administrator sold the Eby lots, the sale was made subject to this mortgage and the administrator has accounted only for the purchase money in excess of the mortgage, which was $1,800. The appellant asked the auditor to surcharge him with, the amount of the mortgage on the grounds (1) that by the terms of the deed the decedent was entitled to receive an indefeasible estate in fee simple free'from incumbrances and therefore at the time of his death he had a right of action against the grantor for the amount due upon the mortgage; and (2) the grantor being administrator, and indebted to the estate as claimed, should have charged himself in his account with the amount of his indebtedness.</p>

The auditor held that this receipt was merely a formal matter and would not interfere with the assumption of the mortgage by the grantee as part of the $7,500, and the burden was upon the appellant to show payment of the full consideration. He found that appellant had failed to show that decedent had paid or obligated himself to pay the full sum of $7,500 and that the facts and circumstances of the case pointed the other way. He therefore declined to surcharge the accountant as requested.</p>

Two properties of the estate, known as the North Sixth street property and the Eby lots, were purchased by the administrator by leave of court at his own sale. It was alleged that he had actually paid for these properties with the funds of the estate and had subsequently sold them at a considerable profit, and the auditor was asked to surcharge him with the amount of this profit, and also with interest and the amount claimed by him for commissions on the sales. The auditor found that the testimony failed to establish these conclusions of fact, or that the administrator used the funds of the estate for his own purposes. He further found, as a conclusion of law, that when-an administrator purchases lands at his own sale, by permission of court, and the sale to him is confirmed by the court, he acquires a title in fee simple and is not responsible to the estate for any profits he may realize on the transaction. He also found as a fact, that the evidence did not show a profit at this stage to the administrator.</p>

By the efforts of counsel for appellant, the accountant was surcharged in certain amounts.. The counsel for the guardian of Frank P.

The appellant claimed (1) that he alone should be given the benefit of these surcharges; and (2) if the auditor should deny him such preference, then he is at least entitled to an allowance out of the fund realized by the efforts of his counsel for their compensation.

The note was objected to, on the ground that it had been overdue at date of decedent’s death and was presented by his administrator, without any proof that it had not been paid and surrendered to the maker, or that it was in the possession of the payee at the time of the maker’s death. It was claimed that under the circumstances a presumption arose that it had been in decedent’s possession and the claimant had found it among his papers after his death. The auditor allowed the claim for the reason that the note was included in the schedule of debts annexed to the petition to sell the real <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>estate of decedent, and its validity was attacked in an answer filed by tbe appellant to such petition, and the order of sale was made by the court notwithstanding.</p>
    <p id="b461-5" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[144,544,1177,344]]]'>As the auditor has found as a fact that nothing in the circumstances would indicate anything like fraud, it was not necessary for the administrator to prove negatively that he did not hold the note in his individual right. Mere possession by an executor of a note or bond payable by the decedent to the executor, will not prevent a recovery: Kuhlman’s Estate, <a href="/pa/178/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="178 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="885488" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0043-01">178 Pa. 43</a>.</p>
    <p id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[143,908,1176,200]]]'>The execution and delivery of the note by P. W. McPherran, the deceased, does not seem to have been questioned, before the auditor, and we see nothing in the evidence which would prevent this claim from participating in the distribution.</p>
    <p id="b461-7" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[141,1116,1179,510]]]'>5. Seventeenth assignment. This assignment relates to the finding of the auditor that 13,000 of the money of the minor, Frank P. Beam, was invested by his guardian, the decedent, in the Sixth street properties and in awarding that sum in full out of the proceeds of the sale of those properties. This appears to have been purely a question of fact for the auditor. Appellant contends that this finding depends upon the admissibility of the testimony of the accountant. But there is sufficient evidence to warrant such finding without considering the testimony of the accountant.</p>
    <p id="b461-8" data-blocks='[["BL_461.7",461,[141,1635,1179,299]]]'>We do not see that the testimony of John P. McPherran is in any way adverse to the estate of P. W. McPherran. It did not charge that estate with any more money than it was admittedly responsible for, by reason of P. W. McPherran having been the guardian of Frank P. Beam. The testimony only went to trace the fund, and show where it had been invested.</p>
    <p id="b461-9" data-blocks='[["BL_461.8",461,[141,1947,1178,304]]]'>6. Eighteenth assignment. The appellant offered to show that the date in decedent’s account book had been changed from January 20, 1890, to January 9, 1890, by the administrator, after decedent’s death. But the auditor held, "and we agree with him, that the alteration if made, was entirely immaterial, so that this assignment is without merit.</p>
    <p id="b461-10" data-blocks='[["BL_461.9",461,[141,2257,1177,98]]]'>All the assignments of error are dismissed, and the report of the auditor, as sustained by the court below, is approved.</p>
