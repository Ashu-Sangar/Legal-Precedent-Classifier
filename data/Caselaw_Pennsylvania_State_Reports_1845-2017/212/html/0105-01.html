It is clearly given by the statute of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1360. One of the grounds upon which the plaintiff’s counsel relies to sustain the plaintiff’s claim in the case is that the defendant company proposes to construct a street passenger railway, and that as such railway company, it cannot exercise the power of eminent domain, and by so doing, interfere with or injure the property belonging to the plaintiff. It must be conceded that if this position is a sound one, the plaintiff’s right to the injunction which is asked is established, for the reason that the act of 1868, under which the defendant company is incorporated, was in terms inapplicable to the incorporation of street passenger railway companies. We do not, <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>however, think that it can with' propriety be held that in any fair interpretation of language the defendant company can be said to be a street passenger railway company. The mere fact that its location embraces, for a short distance the line of a street of the city does not make it so. Such a state of affairs might exist, and does, in point of fact, exist in the case of a railroad designed and operated wholly for general purposes under the act of 1868. The consent of the municipal authorities to such an occupation of the street is, of course, a prerequisite to their lawful occupation, even in such a case. The question as to whether, in a particular instance, a railroad has the character of a street passenger railway depends not so much upon its location as upon its intended use. Street railways are artificial highways, designed to accommodate the inhabitants of municipalities, large or small, to enable them to pass from one portion of their territory to another, and to stop at convenient and frequent points, according to the regulations of the company. Ordinarily they are constructed upon the surface of the streets and in conformity with the grades thereof ; they have a local purpose to serve in transmitting passengers from one portion of a city or town to another and over its streets. The fact that tracks of a railroad or railway are laid in and wholly confined to the streets of a city does not, of itself, determine that they are the tracks of a street passenger railway company. In our own city there are corporations which occupy streets of the city, in whole or in part, and whose location does not extend beyond the limits of the city, which were incorporated under the act of 1868, and which it would be a wild stretch of imagination to describe as street passenger railways, as, for example, the River Front Railroad Company.</p>

There will be no access to or exit from the railroad within the limits of the city of Philadelphia, excepting at the point of terminus or beginning at Front and Market streets; no passenger can take a train there and be transported to any other point within the city limits. Besides, the road is intended <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>for the carriage of property as well as of persons. We fail to see any element in the case that would properly classify the proposed railroad under the head of a street passenger railway company, and no argument to sustain the contrary view can be drawn from the fact that the length of the road, if constructed there, will be only about a mile. It is not the extent of a railroad, but its character, which determines its proper classification.</p>

There the court had before it a corporation that was incorporated under the act of 1868, but which was attempting, in the exercise of its franchises, to construct an elevated street passenger railway in various streets of the city; and it was held that the city could not give its consent to such a company to build and operate such a railroad; and that that corporation had no right to elevate or depress its tracks, under the provisions of the Act of May 31, 1887, P. L, 275, inasmuch as it had no right of way on the surface.</p>

It is doubtless trae that, when the act of 1868 was enacted, such a thing as a <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>railroad wholly underneath the surface was not only unknown, but probably not contemplated as a possibility. At the same time, even then it was by no means beyond the knowledge of 'the legislature or outside of common experience that portions of railroads were, and, as a matter of necessity, must be constructed under the surface of the ground to a greater or less extent. Tunnels were a common device in railroad construction, as, indeed, were bridges across rivers and bodies of water, and neither one or the other of these devices needed specifically to be mentioned in a statute, in order to confer upon a corporation created under its terms the right to build tunnels or bridges. There is nothing prohibitive or affirmative in the expressed language of the statute which defines how a railroad must be built with reference to the surface of the ground on the line of which it is located. The statute seems to have been wisely framed in such a way as to allow for the development of invention and intelligence and of the use of methods and devices which greater experience and more expert knowledge should make expedient and convenient. To hold that nothing could be used by a railroad company incorporated under the act of 1868, or the general railroad law of 1849, in the wajr of plans or appliances, excepting such as were in vogue at the time when those statutes were enacted, would hardly be regarded as a reasonable or proper view to adopt. Such a construction would bring about a condition of things like a return to mediaeval life. The use of elevated and underground constructions has now become common. Without any special legislative authority, of which we have knowledge, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the Reading Railway Terminal Company have built elevated structures for a considerable distance within our city limits, and hardly anyone would dispute the statement that if all the railroads coming into our city were carried underneath the surface, even across the entire limits of the city, there would be great gain to the public, and no damage to private individuals which could not be amply compensated in damages. In other cities, as is a matter of common information, underground railroads have been and are being constructed of considerable extent and greatly to the convenience and advantage of the communities where they exist, and of the general traveling public. We are not disposed to 'limit the force of the act of <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>1868 in so far as to hold that a corporation created under it is necessarily obliged to construct its railroad upon the surface of the ground, and that it could not adopt that mode of construction which would do away largely, if not entirely, with the discomfort and inconvenience of having tracks laid upon the surface of the streets either longitudinally or crosswise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[290,704,1180,146]]]'>Upon this particular point we must therefore conclude that the plaintiff has failed to establish a ground for the interference of a court of equity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[289,858,1181,1284]]]'>One question remains, and that is whether or not the defendant company has a right to use electricity as the power for drawing or propelling cars along the tracks of its railroad. A good deal of what has been said under the previous head of this opinion, is applicable to the present question. There is nothing in the act of 1868 which expressly requires that steam power shall be used in the running of cars upon railroad tracks, and although, as in the case of Potts v. Quaker City Elevated It. R. Company, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20Pa.%20896" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="161 Pa. 896">161 Pa. 896</a>, it can be found in some cases that the courts have assumed and stated that the statute referred to related to steam railroads, we do not understand that it was intended to be decided that only steam could be used as a motive power. Undoubtedly in 1868 steam was the motive power exclusively used on railroads. Great progress, however, has since been made in scientific discovery and mechanical inventions, and other methods of propulsion are now and have been for a considerable period of time, in common use; they have proved to be of great practical service in mitigation of nuisances and in the effective operation of public conveyances. Of these, electricity may be regarded as a signal instance. This subtle agent is more and more, in point of fact, coming into use on the railroads of the country; and no doubt many practical mechanics and engineers look forward to a day when it will, to a large degree, supplant steam as the motive power upon the railroads of the world.</p>

The absence of such municipal' consent, however, is not averred in the bill and is not one of the grounds upon which the plaintiff asks relief, and although we regard it as we have just stated, as essential, before the defendant company can proceed with its work of construction, we do not think the absence of such consent can at the present time be invoked by the plaintiff as the ground for obtaining the injunction desired.
