A scire facias was issued thereon July 18, 1900, and was returned nihil habet the first Monday of August, 1900. An alias scire facias was sued out October 1, 1903, more than five years after the filing of the <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>claim. Frank Mauran, the present registered and real owner, became the purchaser of the property after the expiration of five years from the filing of the original claim, and was suggested of record as such on the first day of October, 1903. The contention of the appellant is that the return of nihil habet to the original scire facias did not comply with the express provisions of the statutes relating to the service of the writ, was therefore a nullity, the effect of which left the claim in the position as if no scire facias had been issued thereon, and as a result the lien expired in five years from the date of its entry. It is further contended that the alias scire facias having been sued out after tbe expiration of the lien, cannot revive and continue it. •</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[299,1067,1178,971]]]'>Municipal claims are creatures of our statutes. These acts being in derogation of the common law, as well as of private rights, must be strictly construed. The learned judge who delivered the opinion of the Superior Court correctly stated the rule as follows: “ The lien of the mechanic or municipal claim being by statute, its validity, duration and extent are wholly dependent upon compliance with the statutory provisions.” We entirely concur in this view of the law, but must insist that the application of the rule is fatal to the claim of the appellee. A scire facias must be issued on a municipal claim within five years of the filing of the same or the lien is lost: Act of May 4, 1889, P. L. 79. If there is personal service on the registered owner, it must be in the same manner as a summons, as provided in the Act of March 29,1867, P. L. 600. If personal service on the registered owner is not made, then an affidavit must be filed suggesting that the registered owner is a nonresident or cannot be found, to be followed by posting and publication, as provided by the Act of June 10, 1881, P. L. 91.</p>
    <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[299,2049,1176,407]],["BL_339.1",339,[146,357,1184,1854]]]'>In the present case the writ of scire facias was not personally served on the registered owner, and no affidavit was filed showing that he was a nonresident or could not be found, and service was not made by posting and publication as required by the act of 1881. The return of nihil habet is not in compliance with the acts of assembly regulating the service of the Avrit in this case. It is therefore fatally defective and must be treated as a nullity. The conclusion <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>reached by the Superior Court overlooks the act of 1881, and since these statutory provisions were not' complied with, under the rule announced the validity of the claim cannot be sustained. This court has held in .several cases that where the writ was defectively served, as in the case at bar, no valid judgment could be obtained thereon, and if in fact a judgment be entered it is not only voidable but void: Simons v. Kern, <a href="/pa/92/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="92 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="490979" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0455-01">92 Pa. 455</a>; Ferguson v. Quinn, <a href="/pa/123/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="123 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="967149" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0337-01">123 Pa. 337</a>; Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v.

If a writ fatally defective in its service is a nullity, and no valid judgment can be entered thereon, it is futile to argue that it has sufficient potentiality to continue the lien beyond the statutory period so as to support'an alias writ issued after its expiration, and thus give - vitality to a lost lien. This position is not sound, nor is it in harmony with our cases. If the service of the original scire facias was so fatally defective as not to support a judgment, and therefore a nullity for this purpose, it must be treated as a nullity for all purposes. The learned judge who delivered the opinion of the Superior Court holds that the provisions of the act relating’ to filing an affidavit and posting and publishing notice, are but a substitute for personal service. This may be true, but it is a substitute imperatively required by the act and not provided in this case. The case at bar is not different in principle from Philadelphia v. Merz, <a href="/pa-super/16/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="16 Pa. Super. 332" data-case-ids="832585" data-case-paths="/pa-super/16/0332-01">16 Pa.

L. 69, or other similar acts, cannot be sustained, for the reason that the provisions of these acts relating to the service of writs of scire facias generally on such claims cannot be held to apply to the present case, in which, personal service not having been made, under the express provisions of the act of 1881, service by posting and publication after affidavit filed is required.</p>
