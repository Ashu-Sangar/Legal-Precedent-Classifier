He then stood up in his wagon and saw a freight train about three-fourths of a mile away, coming in the same direction and on the same track as the one that had just passed. He also saw a work train of five or six flat cars standing on the second switch about thirty feet to the south side of the crossing. He looked up and down the track before starting his team, but his general view was obstructed by the freight train which had slowed down, and to some extent by the work train and the breaker.

The plaintiff, in order to show the company was neglectful in this particular, testified he listened, that neither a bell was rung nor a whistle blown. Two witnesses, docking bosses, I think, testified that they were at the top of the lookout breaker, saw most of the occurrence, that the whistle did not blow; the last witness said he did not remember that the bell rang, and if it had rung he would remember it, the other said he was not sure, would not say whether the bell rang or not; there may have been other witnesses but I call your attention to these because it appears to me, if you believe them, they were in a position to hear and see. Upon the side of the defendant, many witnesses have been called—persons who were upon the passenger train, workmen who were upon the passenger train, workmen upon other trains and some persons who stood by—-who testified just as positively the whistle was blown and the bell rung. The engineer testified he started the bell— an automatic bell—ringing, as I remember it, very near Kingston.</p>

If the jury believe that the plaintiff could have seen the train after he started and before he reached the east-bound track, it was his duty to have stopped before driving thereon and his failure to do so was negligence for which he cannot recover in this suit. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to affirm this point, for this reason: The point, in substance is, that after Mr. Pyne started, if he saw the approaching passenger train before he reached the track upon which it was running it was his duty to stop. I cannot say so, as a matter of law, because it would .mean it was his' duty to stop at any instant before his horses were actually upon the track, and with the second approaching freight train, and with the approaching passenger train, it is for you to say whether a man placed in such a predicament would have the presence of mind to know what to do. If he placed himself in an unfortunate position he would have to put up with it, but if the company, by its servants and trains, place him in an unfortunate and dangerous position, it could not require him to use good judgment instantly.

The accident occurred <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>at a grade crossing familiar to both parties. It was the duty of the appellant to use due care and caution in running its engine and hauling its train at this point, and to give suitable and timely warning of the approach thereof, by ringing a bell, blowing a whistle, or giving other danger signals. Did it meet this requirement of the law ? If so, there can be no recovery.</p>
    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[158,737,1180,1136]]]'>The appellee testified that no whistle was blown nor bell rung, and that no other danger signal was given. Two other witnesses corroborated his testimony in this respect in whole or in part. The appellant produced eight or nine witnesses who testified that the whistle was blown and bell rung at the proper places before approaching the crossing. Here, then, is a conflict of testimony which is generally for the jury. In such cases the court should call the attention of the jury to the kind and character of the testimony offered so that intelligent consideration may be given and correct conclusion may be reached. The appellant contends that the learned trial judge erred in not so doing. The court was not requested to call attention to the so-called positive and negative testimony of witnesses by a point submitted for the purpose, and we must therefore examine the general charge to see whether the cáse was properly presented to the jury. While the court did not specifically call the attention of the jury to the kind and quality of testimony submitted, yet the charge as a whole fully covered every point involved in the case, and under the circumstances we think the matter complained of is not reversible error. The learned court fairly left the entire question to the jury, where it properly belonged.</p>

If he failed to stop before going upon the track, he would have been guilty of negligence per se. It is conceded, however, that he stopped at the usual place and looked up and down the tracks while a freight train was passing. He waited until this train had passed the crossing upwards of 300 feet. He then stood up in his wagon and saw a freight train about three fourths of a mile away, coming in the same direction and on the <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>same track as the one that had just passed.

He could not then save himself and extricate his team from the impending danger. • What was his duty under the circumstances ? The answer is, ordinary and reasonable care..
