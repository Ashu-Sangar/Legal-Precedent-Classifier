    <p class="summary" id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[270,589,1195,458]]]'>Little may be said in addition to what was said when the case was here on the question of the sufficiency of the affidavit, of defense. It was then alleged: “ That the defendant knew that the bond was to be used in an application for the sale of real estate and that the guardian was the agent of the defendant in presenting the bond to the court,” which allegations were specifically denied in the affidavit of defense. These allegations and the denial thereof raised the question of fact necessary to be submitted to a jury.</p>

Angle, deceased.” The court was, therefore, justified in entering judgment for the defendant, non obstante veredicto. The re-examination of the authorities cited in our former opinion leaves no doubt in our minds as to the correctness of this conclusion.</p>
