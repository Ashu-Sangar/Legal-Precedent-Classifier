On the evening of the accident, one, of the defendant’s employees lowered the lamp to repair it, and left it in this position under the charge of a boy while he went to secure a file. In his absence a one-horse sleigh was driven at a x-apid pace around the comer. Plaintiff’s testimony tended to show that the horse struck the wires of the lamp, and that the wires in turn struck him and injured him. When the accident occurred plaintiff was attempting to cross the street at a point other than the regular crossing. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury, and that a judgment and verdict for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>

Miller was seriously injured by contact with electric light wires belonging to the defendant company. At a point in the borough of Lewistown where several streets intersected the defendant maintained an arc light which on the evening in question had been lowered for repairs. An employee of the company after lowering the light left it in charge of a boy while he went to secure a file. During his absence a one-horse sleigh dashed around a corner and struck the wires attached to the lamp. The testimony tended to show that Miller, while attempting to cross one of the streets at a point other than the regular crossing, was struck by the wires and <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>sustained injuries from which, he died after the present suit was instituted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[356,475,801,44]]]'>Defendant presented the following points :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.6",624,[310,526,1179,613]]]'>4. If the jury believe that it is the custom to lower arc lamps at night on public highways for the purpose of making them operate, and that in this case the lamp when lowered was left in charge of the boy to notify the public of possible danger in the short and necessary absence of defendant’s employee, then their verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>This point is denied. The -question as to whether leaving the light in charge of the boy was negligence or not is for you to determine and not for the court; and an electric light company could not have a custom, unless the custom had been established by many long years, so as to become universal and known by all persons, to negligently lower lights at night.
