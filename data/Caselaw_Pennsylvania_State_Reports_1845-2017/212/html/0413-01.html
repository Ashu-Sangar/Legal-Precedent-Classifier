Especially is it so in this case, because as soon, or a short time after the road was constructed and equipped, it was leased to Samuel P. Langdon, who almost immediately assigned the lease to the Pittsburg, Johns-town, Ebensburg &amp; Eastern Railroad Company. By the terms' of the lease the lessee was to apply the net income and revenues of the railroad to. the payment of the interest upon $325,000 of the bonds as provided for in the mortgage. The lessee therefore became a party to said mortgage, to the extent of the liability assumed.</p>

Yet, in paragraph seven of the answer, it avers that there was read at the sale of the thirty-four bonds by Levis &amp; Company a notice by the Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad Company, that said company was a creditor of the Altoona, Philipsburg Connecting Railroad Company, “and is in possession of the said railroad.”</p>

But it might be assumed that he did. In any event from the pleadings and evidence in the cause Samuel P. Langdon was the active manager and controller of the Altoona and Philipsburg Connecting Railroad Company from its inception to the present time, whether in his own name or that of the Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad Company, or the New York and Pittsburg Central Railroad Company. When he pledged the bonds and stock of the railroad company, to raise money for its construction, there is no allegation or scintilla of proof that the mortgage and bonds were issued in violation of law. The Union Trust Company, trustee, in the mortgage, had no such knowledge or intimation of it. It is not alleged that Mr. George Philler had any such knowledge, and there was nothing upon the mortgage or bonds, but what was apparently regular and legal.</p>

Mr. Philler testifies that he gave due notice to <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>Mr. Langdon that he would sell the bonds; that Mr. Langdon knew of the sale. That he had the right to sell them must be accepted as conclusively proven, because Mr. Langdon, the other party to the transaction, was not called to contradict Mr. Philler. And it was alleged that the collateral agreement was in writing, but it was not produced to show that its terms had been violated. Then we must conclude that when Mr. Philler sold the bonds under the collateral agreement he, as a bona fide holder, had the right to sell them and passed a good title thereto to the purchasers thereof. The same with the bonds held and sold by Levis &amp; Company.</p>

Can it be permitted to say that the securities it has pledged as collateral, and upon which it has realized the money for building its road are worthless and void so as to prevent the holder thereof from realizing a fair value therefor, and thus make use of its own turpitude to reform others ?

The trustee certified 330 of the bonds of which 299 were delivered to the president of the railroad company, Samuel P. Langdon. One of these bonds was sold to W. L. Shellenberger, four to W. S. Lee, two to S. J. Westley, one to W. J. Heinsling, five to John Loudon and two to William Loudon, in all fifteen. Two hundred and seven of the bonds were pledged as collateral for a loan to George Philler of Philadelphia and were sold by him, after due notice, to O. L. Schoonover, Charles S. Avery, John G. Platt, James A. Pass-more, and C. H. Rowland. Thirty-four bonds were pledged to Levis &amp; Company and sold by them at public sale, when they were purchased by the same parties, making their total bolding 241 bonds. The trustee held thirty-one bonds as security for certain advances and liability incurred on account of the railroad company, and the balance of the bonds apparently were not negotiated.</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[304,1257,1180,664]]]'>On August 20, 1903, the holders of the fifteen bonds filed a bill in equity against the railroad company, the Union Trust Company, the Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ebensbui'g and Eastern Railroad Company, the New York and Pittsburg Central Railroad, lessees of the Altoona, etc., Company, and Samuel P. Langdon, alleging default in the payment of interest on the bonds and the insolvency of the company, and praying for a decree of foreclosure and the appointment of a receiver for the railroad. On September 13, 1903, the court appointed a receiver, but this decree was appealed from and superseded. On December 17, 1903, upon its own petition, the Union Trust Company, trustee, was permitted to withdraw the answer it had filed and to intervene as a party plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[303,1929,1181,459]]]'>Defense to the bill was made in behalf of the railroad company upon three grounds : (1) that the bill was multifarious; (2) that under the Act of May 7, 1887, P. D- 94:, sec. 3, the issue of bonds was void and of no effect and therefore neither the bondholders nor the trustee had any standing to maintain this action; and (3) that the holders of these bonds had purchased them with full knowledge of the fact that they had been illegally issued and were only pledged as collateral and had paid for them a sum much less than the face value.</p>

    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[131,581,1180,303]]]'>Many of the assignments of error are not in accordance with our rules, and are open to the objection suggested by the appellees. But the appellants have met these objections in part at least by filing additional assignments, and among these are a sufficient number to properly raise the questions of importance in this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b453-6" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[131,892,1181,1290]]]'>Upon the second ground of defense it was contended that under sec. 3, of the act of 1887, the bonds were void because at the time of their issue the amount subscribed for capital stock had not been fully paid. The fact of the nonpayment of the stock was conceded, but the court held that the railroad company, having received the benefit of the sale of the bonds, could not defend against its contract on the ground of ultra vires. Citing Reed’s App., <a href="/pa/122/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="122 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1948411" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0565-01">122 Pa. 565</a>, and Fidelity Ins., etc., Co. v.

This was undoubtedly true to the extent to which the railroad company actually received the proceeds of the bonds. But it was shown that- 207 bonds held by O. L. Shoonover et al., were purchased from George Philler for $62,250, and the thirty-four from Levis &amp; Company for $10,300. Defendant offered to show that at the time of the purchase of these bonds, the purchasers were stockholders of the railroad company and had full knowledge of the fact that the bonds were illegally issued and also that the parties from whom they purchased were not absolute owners of the bonds, but that the company held an equity of redemption in them. The court excluded the testimony, which is the subject of a number of the assignments of error. In the final decree of the court below, the purchasers named above were adjudged to be bona fide holders of the bonds for their face value, $256,000, with accrued interest, $116,850, making a total of $372,850 due upon the mortgage.</p>

If the defendant could show that these bondholders were not bona fide holders for value, it was entitled to do so. “ The presumption is, that holders of negotiable railway bonds are bona fide holders for value, but if fraud in the <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>inception of the bonds is shown, the holder, to be entitled to protection as a bona fide holder, must show that he is such; his mere possession of the bonds is. insufficient: ” 23 Am. &amp; Eng.

    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[302,591,1176,552]]]'>“ The doctrine which validates securities within the apparent powers of the corporation, but improperly and therefore illegally issued, applies only in favor of bona fide holders for value. A person who takes such a security with knowledge that the conditions on which alone the security was authorized were not fulfilled, is not protected, and in his hands the security is invalid; though the imperfection is in some matter relating to the internal affairs of the corporation, which would be unavailable against a bona fide holder of the same security:” Hackensack Water Co. v. DeKay, <a href="/nj-eq/36/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="36 N.J. Eq. 548" data-case-ids="796289" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/36/0548-01">36 N. J.

The question of the validity of railroad bonds is to be determined by the well-established rule that “ if fraud or illegality in the inception of negotiable paper is shown, an indorsee, before he can recover, must prove that he is a holder for value. The mere possession of the paper under such circumstances is not enough:” Simmons v. Taylor, 38 Fed. Repr. 682.</p>

The equity of this course will be especially manifest, if the proof sustains the averments of the answer, that the holders of these bonds purchased them with knowledge of the irregularity of the issue, and that they <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>had only been pledged as collateral, and that the sum paid for them was substantially the amount required for their redemption.</p>
