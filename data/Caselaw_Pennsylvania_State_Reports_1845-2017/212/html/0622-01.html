Wheelock, A was the owner of a tract of land, part of which, on'which was erected the mansion house, was in a township and a small part of which was in a borough. On the part located in the borough was erected a liouse occupied by the owner’s mother and sister, rent free. It Avas decided that the house in the borough was taxable in the borough and not in the township where the mansion house was located, because it was not used as part of the farm. Judge Rice, in delivering the opinion of the court, says (page 287) : “ Possibly this house is subject to assessment in the borough, and upon reflection we are inclined to the opinion that this is the correct view. It appears to be in the exclusive occupancy of the owner’s mother and sister as a dwelling, and it does not appear it is used as part of, or in connection Avith, the farm. If the owner had demised it, reserving a rent, it would seem clear that this would be a severance of it from the rest of the farm, which would make it subject to taxation as a distinct tenement. The fact that the owner’s mother and sister pay no rent, if such be the fact, does not seem to us to affect the question. The controlling fact is that it is in their exclusive occupancy, and is not used in connection with, or as a part of, the farm.”</p>

It does not matter, therefore, where the mansion house is located, if it is in another county, for it would not, under the terms of the act of 1883, draw the portion of the tract on which the power plant is erected to it for the purpose of taxation.</p>

That is, the height of the water at ordinary stages of low water. In Stover v. Jack, <a href="/pa/60/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="60 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="1014530" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0339-01">60 Pa. 339</a>, Justice Agnew says: “ The defendant alleged it to be an island surrounded by water except at very low stages. The court held that low water, as contra^ distinguished from high water, does not mean the lowest water the stream may exhibit under special and extraordinary circumstances, and the locus in quo is an island if the water of the river flows around it, at its ordinary stage, unaffected by floods and drought. This is assigned for error, and it brings up for our decision what is meant by low-water mark as a terminus or boundary. . . .</p>

No one has ever thought that an island cut off from the mainland by the stream in ordinary stages of low water could be added to the land of an adjacent proprietor merely because in the very dry season of the year, the stream had almost disappeared and no water flowed over the intervening dry and sandy or pebbly bed.</p>

Ordinary high water and ordinary low water, each has its reasonably well-defined marks so nearly certain that there is not much difficulty in ascertaining it. The ordinary rise and fall of the stream usually finds nearly the same limits. But to bound title by a mark which is set by an extraordinary flood or an extreme drought would do injustice and contravene the common understanding of the people. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the plaintiff’s title was bounded by ordinary low-water mark.”</p>

They were all men who are, and have been familiar with the river for from thirty to fifty years, and have crossed it frequently at this point; two, in fact, have been ferrymen, and all know the location of Ring Rock, and of the power house in question.

These witnesses also testify that Ring Rock is from sixty-five to 100 feet west of the power house, and that there is wet and swampy ground to the Avest of the rock.

Three of these nine witnesses have lived in the vicinity for many years, namely, John Ohrendorf, Daniel Repinan and Sherman Walker. They-testify that at very low water, namely, in 1883 and in 1888, the water had receded to a point from twelve to fifteen feet east of the power plant, but they cannot say where low Avater mark was in ordinary low water. One other witness testifies that the paper mill company did fill up the creek Avhich flows into the river near this point, but did not fill up the river at the time the mill was erected. Another witness, William J. Childs, an hydraulic engineer, says, by his measurements at the time the power plant was built a year or two ago, low-water mark was east of the power plant. All the witnesses who testify on the subject admit that part of the poAver plant is east of low-water mark. Some of them testify that it was largely built on dry ground.

Any natural changes on the edge of a river may change the line of low water, but such is not the case if the changes are made by artificial causes.

    <p class="author" id="AsZx" data-blocks='[["BL_661.6",661,[439,374,378,38]]]'>Mr. Justice Fell,</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.7",661,[146,426,1180,813]]]'>The question raised by this appeal is whether the appellant’s power plant should be assessed for taxation in York county or in Lancaster county. The facts that give rise to it are these : The appellant purchased a tract of 400 acres of farm land in York county on which there were a farmhouse, barns and other farm buildings. The eastern boundary of the tract was the Susquehanna river, where it had a frontage of three-fourths of a mile. It constructed crib dams which extend into the liver and a race by which the water is conducted to a power house 278 feet long and forty-nine feet wide. It is agreed that the boundary line between York and Lancaster counties is low-water mark on the western bank of the Susquehanna river. The disputed question of fact is whether the power plant is east or west of this line. All of the witnesses agreed that a part of the plant is east of low-water mark. The court found that the whole of it is east.</p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.8",661,[146,1256,1180,873]]]'>The conflict in the testimony arose mainly from the different views of the witnesses as to what should be considered low-water mark, whether the lowest line the water has ever been known to reach or as expressed by some of them “the lowest kind of low-water mark,” or the line of ordinary low water, not the effect of an extreme drought. The learned judge, following the decision in Stover v. Jack, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20Pa.%20389" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="60 Pa. 389">60 Pa. 389</a>, held that the low-water mark was the line to which the water receded at ordinary states of low water, and ascertained the location of this from the testimony of witnesses who had observed the river for a long period of time and who fixed the line of low-water mark by monuments on the ground. The case was considered and decided on right principles both in determining what was low-water mark and the weight of the evidence. We should not set aside the finding of fact by the court unless convinced of clear error. From a careful review of the testimony we find nothing to lead us to doubt its correctness.</p>
    <p id="b661-6" data-blocks='[["BL_661.9",661,[149,2137,1177,300]],["BL_662.1",662,[276,363,1180,914]]]'>It is, however, contended that if the power plant is located east of the line of York county, it should be assessed in that county as a part of the tract on which the mansion house and other buildings are located. This contention is based on the Act of June 1,1883, P. L. 51, which provides that where county lines divide a tract of seated land, the assessment shall be <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>made in the. county in which the mansion house is situated. The act does not apply to this ease. The appellant was incorporated for the purpose of supplying water and power and of generating electricity by means of water power. By the purchase of the farm it secured valuable water rights and has utilized them by the construction of a dam in the river and a race and power house on its margin. The improvements are valued at 1500,000 and occupy only a few acres at one side of the tract. These acres are practically severed by their use from the rest of the tract and are applied to a new and entirely distinct use wholly unconnected with the use to which the remainder is put. They are not a part-of nor appurtenant to the farm. The 59th section of the Act of July 11, 1842, P. L. 321, which contains a similar provision as to lands divided by borough or township lines, was held not to apply to a house in a borough not used in connection with nor as a part of a farm : Commonwealth v.
