It is a fiction, therefore, invented to sustain and carry out the intention of the testator or settler, never to defeat it. Its application requires constant watchfulness to guard against the tendency to become a formal rule de jure without regard to its real purpose and necessity. It should never be overlooked that there is no real conversion ; the property remains all the time in fact, realty or personalty, as it was; but for the purpose of the will it may be necessary, and only so far it is treated in contemplation of law as if it had been converted. Few testators have any knowledge of the doctrine, or any actual intent to change the nature of their property, except when and to the extent that may be required to carry out the special purpose of the will. The presumption, therefore, no matter what the form of words used, is always against conversion, and even where it is <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>required, it must be kept witbin the limit of actual necessity.”</p>

If in addition to this clear intention of the testator, it plainly appears that effect cannot be given to material provisions of the will without the exercise of this power, the conclusion is irresistible that a conversion is as effectually accomplished by the will, and the duties of the executors under it are the same, as if it contained a positive direction to sell: ” Fahnestock v.

In brief he gives general pecuniary legacies upwards of $700,000; devises certain of his real estate to two of his sisters for life, and at their death directs a sale by the executors; and devises and bequeaths the residue of his estate to his two sisters and three brothers-in-law. Whenever it is necessary or expedient for any purpose of the estate, of administration, distribution or otherwise, the executors are given full power and discretion to sell any or all the real estate. The pecuniary legacies are to be paid before those to whom the residuary is given shall receive anything, because it is only what remains of the estate, after the specific legacies are paid, that passes as residue or remainder. These legacies pass to the legatees as money. The testator intended them to be paid in cash. There is nothing in the language of the will to show they are to be paid in any other way. Their character is personalty. He must have foreseen the necessity for a sale of his real estate to carry out his scheme of dividing his estate by first bestowing gifts upon the beneficiaries, in the form of pecuniary legacies, else how were they -to be paid ? <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>He, therefore, gives his executors full power to sell the real estate whenever a sale is necessary for any purpose of the estate, of administration, distribution or otherwise.

It will be observed he bequeaths $80,000 in pecuniary legacies to certain legatees who were included in the residuary clause of the will, thus giving them preference over the remaining residuary legatees. This amount, together with the legacies given in the will, made money gifts aggregating nearly $700,000, or several hundred thousand dollars more than his personal estate was then worth. The testator is presumed to have known the value of his personal estate at that time. He undoubtedly knew the extent of his gifts, and it would be passing strange if he intended their payment to be confined to the proceeds of the personal estate, resulting in each legatee receiving much less than the amount of the gift. The manifest intention of the testator is to first give legacies of different amounts, and what is left of the estate to five residuary legatees. The latter take what remains of the estate after the legacies have been first paid and satisfied thereout. “ A residuary clause in a will is a gift of all that is left after the gifts specified or designated have been paid and satisfied Per Penbose, J., in Wood’s Estate, 13 Pa. Dist. Rep. 195. It may be said the testator blended his real and personal estate, authorized a sale of the former by the executors, when in their discretion the purpose of distribution required it. But there can be no shadow of doubt that in order to execute the will, carry out the provisions, and pay the general pecuniary legacies, it is absolutely necessary to sell the real estate. Effect cannot be given to the will, without the exercise of the power of sale. For the purpose of administration and distribution, the proceeds of the lands must come into this court. It follows that an equitable conversion is as effectually accomplished by the will and the duties of the executors under it are the same as if it contained a positive direction to sell.

    <p id="b352-9" data-blocks='[["BL_352.12",352,[281,1304,1180,714]]]'>Louis C. Vanuxem, Esq., of Springfield township, Montgomery county, made his last will and testament dated October 16, 1903. By item seven of his will he gives his executors full power and discretion to sell any or all of his real estate, whenever any such sale be necessary or expedient for any purpose of his estate, of administration, distribution or otherwise. -He was seized of certain real estate in Tennessee and Illinois, and upon this property, the appraiser of collateral inheritance tax, assessed taxes. This was done upon the ground that the directions in the will worked an equitable conversion of the lands into personal property, by authorizing the executors in their discretion to sell for distribution, and the further fact that it became necessary to sell in order to pay the pecuniary legatees.</p>
    <p id="b352-10" data-blocks='[["BL_352.13",352,[272,2027,1186,402]]]'>The orphans’ court sustained the action of the appraiser. It was not pretended that the real estate in other states could be charged with collateral inheritance tax as real estate, but only by reason of the fact that it was necessary for the executors to sell it, in order to provide the money to pay the pecuniary legacies. And that being the case, the power to sell if 'necessary to make distribution, became -under the manifest intent of the testator, a direction to sell.</p>
    <p id="b353-4" data-blocks='[["BL_353.3",353,[111,380,1179,615]]]'>
      <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>The judge of the orphans’ court thus reasons it out in his opinion : “ The pecuniary legacies are to be paid before those to whom the residuary is given shall receive anything, because it is only what remains of the estate, after the specific legacies are paid, that passes as residue or remainder. These legacies pass to the legatees as money. The testator intended them to be paid in cash. There is nothing in the language of the will to show they are to be paid in any other way. Their character is personalty. He must have foreseen the necessity for the sale of his real estate to carry out his scheme of dividing his estate by first bestowing gifts upon the beneficiaries in the form of pecuniary legacies, else how were they to be paid ? ”</p>
    <p id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[108,1003,1180,658]]]'>The pecuniary legacies aggregated nearly $700,000, or very much more than the amount of the personal estate, so that we cannot see any way by which the executors can escape converting the land into money, in order to carry out the provisions of the will. We agree with the conclusion of the court below, that “ an equitable conversion is as effectually accomplished by the will, and the duties of the executors under it are the same as if it contained a positive direction to sell.” It follows as a matter of course that if sold, the proceeds of these lands must come' into the courts of Pennsylvania for distribution. The tax, therefore, falls upon the legacies themselves, rather than upon the lands which are now appraised in order to determine the amount of the tax.</p>
    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[107,1678,1179,201]]]'>The opinion of the court below has met so clearly the questions involved in this appeal and has disposed of them so fully, that further elaboration, upon our part, is both difficult and unnecessary.</p>

    <p id="b353-9" data-blocks='[["BL_353.9",353,[106,2099,1179,355]]]'>I would reverse this judgment. The taxation of land not within the territorial limits of the state is admittedly beyond the legislative power, and the taxation of the value or the proceeds of such land, under whatever form or disguise it is sought to be exercised, is upon the border line of questionable jurisdiction and should be scrutinized closely with every presumption against its validity.</p>
    <p id="b354-3" data-blocks='[["BL_354.3",354,[321,383,1180,872]]]'>
      <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>But even if the lands in this case were within Pennsjdvania there was no proper conversion. They were devised as land to devisees named, and there is in the will no direction to sell but only a power and discretion to do so when the executors should deem it expedient. The learned court below founded its judgment on the doctrine of necessity to carry out the will. But on this point the case falls clearly within the principle of Hunt’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="105 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="454272" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0128-01">105 Pa. 128</a> (141), where it was held, “the most that can be said is that the testator made a mistake as to the extent of his estate, and a sale of his real estate became necessary in order to pay his debts. But this is not to the purpose. The scheme oE his will did not contemplate this, and if by reason of the depreciation of his property, or for other causes a necessity to sell the real estate arose which was not foreseen by the testator, it will not work a conversion for the obvious reason that a conversion is always a question of intent.”</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[320,1264,1182,1121]]]'>The necessity to sell which effects a conversion is one which must have been contemplated by the testator in order to carry out the scheme of his will, not a necessity as a matter of fact arising out of the actual circumstances of the estate after his death. Suppose the personalty though insufficient to pay the pecuniary legacies at the time of testator’s death had so increased in value as to be sufficient before the time of payment, clearly there would have been no conversion which would require or justify an exertion of the executor’s discretion which would subject these devisees’ land to the payment of this <em>tax; </em>and equally so in the contrary case of a sufficiency of personalty at the death and a subsequent decline in value. Either case would come exactly within the quotation above made from Hunt’s Appeal. To attribute the necessity to sell as within the contemplation of the testator seems to me like attributing the gift of foresight to those who are wise after the event. The testator gave large pecuniary legacies, but he had personal estate of still larger nominal value, and .with this knowledge of his affairs he gave his executors not a direction but only a discretion to sell. Clearly he did not contemplate a sale as a necessity but only as a contingency to be dealt with in the discretion of his executors.</p>
