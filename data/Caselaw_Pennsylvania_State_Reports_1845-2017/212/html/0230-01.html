On September 8,1897, the grand jury inquiring for the county concurred in the report of the viewers. No further action was taken upon this report until March 13, 1901, three 'and one-half years after the action of the grand jury, at which time the court approved of the report of the grand jury and the viewers. On April 2, 1901, the county commissioners concurred in the action of the grand jury and the court, and the <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>bridge was entered on tbe records as a county bridge. The petition for the mandamus was filed July 26, 1904. The county commissioners made return to the alternative writ, which in substance averred that there was no necessity for the erection- of the bridge; that the proceedings by which it was entered of record as a comity bridge were irregular; that the report of the viewers with the concurrence of the grand jury had been presented to a former board of commissioners asking for concurrence;' that said board had refused to concur in the same; that by reason of these facts the proceedings to make it a county bridge either failed or were abandoned; and that under the provisions of the statute and rules of law applicable thereto, the attempt to compel the commissioners by mandamus to erect the bridge cannot prevail under the circumstances.</p>

We will briefly review the provisions of the act of assembly and the decisions of this court in reference to the law bearing on the question in order to determine the rights of the parties. The thirty-fifth section of the Act of June 13, 1886, P. L. 551, provides, inter alia, as follows: <em>“ </em>When a river, creek or rivulet over which it may be necessary to erect a bridge, crosses a public road or highway, and the erecting of such bridge requires more expense than it is reasonable that one or two adjoining townships should bear, the court having jurisdiction as aforesaid, shall, on the petition of any of the inhabitants of the respective townships, order a view, in the manner provided for in the case of roads, and if on the report of the viewers it shall appear to the court, grand jury, and commissioners of the county, that such bridge is necessary, and would be too expensive for such township or townships, it shall be entered on record as a county bridge.”</p>
    <p id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[272,2085,1178,356]]]'>The erection of county bridges is regulated by statute, and. all of the statutory provisions must be strictly complied with in order to make the proceeding effective and place the burden on the county. This is especially true when it is sought to compel the county commissioners by mandamus to construct the bridge at the expense of the taxpayers. This court has frequently laid down the rule relating to this class of cases.</p>

    <p id="b263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[134,629,1179,516]]]'>In re Pequea Creek Bridge, <a href="/pa/68/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="68 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="1024603" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0427-01">68 Pa. 427</a>, Mr. Justice SharsWOOD, in passing on this question, stated: “ It is evident that the legislature intended that these three bodies should act as checks upon each other in the unnecessary expenditure of public money in the erection of county bridges. When either of them therefore have put their disapprobation on record, the proceeding falls. If it were not so taxpayers and others interested in opposing a county bridge might be kept dancing attendance upon the courts from sessions to sessions until some one grand jury may be induced to approve it.”</p>

The statute contemplates a proceeding at least reasonably continuous. A break of seven years and a half and then precipitate action by new officers is Clearly unreasonable. All.parties interested might fairly have inferred that the enterprise had been abandoned.”</p>
    <p id="b263-7" data-blocks='[["BL_263.6",263,[135,1621,1178,822]],["BL_264.1",264,[297,388,1179,502]]]'>In these cases it was held that it is not only necessary to have the concurrence of the grand jury, the court and the county commissioners, but the concurrence of all three bodies must be reasonably .continuous. In the latter case a break of seven and one-half years in the concurrence of the different bodies was said not to be reasonably continuous, within the requirements of the statute. In the case at bar there is a break of from March 25, 1897, when the petition was filed, until April 2, 1901, when the concurrence of the county commissioners was secured. In other words, there was a break from the beginning to the end of the proceeding of more than four years. In view of these facts the .court below held that the concurrence of the different bodies had not been reasonably continuous and refused to award a peremptory writ of mandamus as prayed for. The ruling of the court was clearly right even on the record as it stands. The necessity which existed for <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>the building of the bridge as reported by the viewers in 1897, and approved by the grand jury a few months later may not have existed four years later when it was approved by the court and the county commissioners. The delay, and the fact that new county officials had been elected to and were in office at that time, notice not having been given to the taxpayers and other interested parties is not a reasonable compliance with the act of assembly. The proceedings were not reasonably continuous within the provision of the act and the rule of law announced in our cases.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[294,908,1180,603]]]'>In addition, however, the return sets out that the report of the viewers, with the <em>concurrence of </em>the grand jury indorsed thereon, had been presented to a former board of commissioners for concurrence, and that said board had refused to concur. If this refusal had been indorsed on the report or had been placed of record on the minutes of the board of commissioners, it would have been an end of the proceeding. Can the fact be established by parol testimony dehors the record ? We think it can. Inasmuch as the petitioners demurred to the return, this fact must be taken as admitted and therefore established for the purposes of this case. It is fatal to the proceedings and the mandamus cannot be maintained.</p>

It cannot be doubted that mandamus will lie to compel a board of county commissioners to perform their duty, and that if all the requirements of the act of assembly and rules of law applicable thereto have been met and the bridge properly entered as a county bridge, and the commissioners arbitrarily or unreasonably delay the construction of the same, mandamus will lie to compel them to perform their duty.

It is therefore not an authority under the facts of the present case. The irregularity of the proceedings by which it was attempted to make this a county bridge, and the fact that one body had refused to concur, is set up in the return and relied upon by the appellees to <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>defeat the application for a mandamus. If in this case the report of the viewers had been made, and the concurrence of the grand jury, the court and the county commissioners had been reasonably continuous, and if it did not appear as a fact that a former board of county commissioners had refused to concur in the report, mandamus would lie to compel the performance of the duty.
