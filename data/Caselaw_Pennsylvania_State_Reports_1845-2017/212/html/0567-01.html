From the place where he stopped he could see less than 200 feet in the direction of the train. This view was not materially enlarged as he approached the track because of a curve in the railroad and of a warehouse which stood nineteen feet from the rails and 174 from the crossing. The night was dark and rainy, the train was running rapidly, and no notice of its approach was given by bell or whistle. The warehouse not only obstructed the view but deadened the sound of the approaching train and the curve in the road caused the light of the engine to fall on the far side of the track until the engine was close to the crossing. <em>Reid,, </em>that the case was for the jury and that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>

There may be circumstances, to which these principles do not apply, and to say that it is a universal rule, even as to a traveler in a carriage, under all circumstances, has not, in my judgment, been decided by the courts.
