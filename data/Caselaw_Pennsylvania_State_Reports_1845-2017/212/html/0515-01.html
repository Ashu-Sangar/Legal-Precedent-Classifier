That between them the confidential relation of parent and child existed and the defendant sought to ingratiate himself- into his mother’s good will and confidence so that she would rely upon him and place her affairs in his hands. That in consequence of this relation the burden rests upon the defendant to prove to the satisfaction of a chancellor that the plaintiff acted voluntarily and deliberately and fully knew what she was doing; that she was competent to act, free from undue influence; had competent and independent advice and that the transaction was righteous.

This is not a gift or bequest to a stranger, nor a voluntary conveyance to one occupying a position of trust and confidence. It is a conveyance by a mother to her son of practically all her property it is true, but for a good and valuable consideration, viz.: her support and maintenance for life; and, in the absence of fraud or undue influence, such family arrangements have been upheld by our courts. They are of quite frequent occurrence—no less than three of them having-been before us for adjudication during the past year—and fraud, circumvention or unfair practice in their making is .not presumed.</p>

It appears to us that a misconception of the effect of the deed in question has occasioned much of the dissatisfaction in regard to it and the present hostile attitude of the parties. This is a conditional conveyance, the land stands as surety for the grantee and he is powerless to remove the charge thereby imposed upon it by sale or otherwise: Rohn v. Odenwelder, <a href="/pa/162/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="162 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="856766" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0346-01">162 Pa. 346</a>, and cases there reviewed. And, as this was not a mere voluntary conveyance, but one founded on a good and valuable consideration,-it would not have been proper to have inserted a power of revocation and the absence of such power is entirely immaterial: Doran v. McConlogue, <a href="/pa/150/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="150 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="834469" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0098-01">150 Pa. 98</a>. By accepting the grant the defendant assumed the obligation of providing for his mother “ in a complete and decent manner in accordance with her requirements as she has been heretofore maintained and provided for; ” and this he will be compelled to do whether the income and profits of the farm (some $200 to $300 per year) are sufficient for that purpose or not. She is relieved of the oversight of the farm which she felt unable to continue and was contemplating having assistance for that purpose. If the son fails to perform his duty to his mother and comply with the terms of the grant she has her remedy and the land will be restored to her. But we cannot avoid it in anticipation of his breach of his covenants. Thus far the son has not taken possession of the farm, no doubt owing to his mother’s attempted repudiation of her contract and the litigation which has grown out of it. She has received the proceeds, paid the taxes and refused reimbursement when tendered her. With the plaintiff hostile and rejecting his prof-erred services he could not comply with his agreement, but no inference that he will not in the future can be drawn therefrom.</p>
