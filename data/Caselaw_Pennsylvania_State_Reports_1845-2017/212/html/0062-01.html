Mitchell was indebted to his brother, Joseph Mitchell, in the sum of 1100. On September 26, 1900, while the debt was unpaid, Frederick E. Mitchell in consideration of $1.00 and of natural love and affection conveyed the land in dispute to his wife, Polly Mitchell. This conveyance was made with the knowledge and assent of Joseph Mitchell. Subsequently Joseph Mitchell recovered a judgment against Frederick E. Mitchell, and condemned and sold as the property of Frederick E. Mitchell, the land conveyed to the latter’s wife. The sheriff made a deed to Joseph Mitchell, who subsequently brought this suit. The court admitted under objection and exception the testimony of John Dando, an attorney at law, who represented Joseph Mitchell and Frederick E. Mitchell, in matters relating to the execution of the deed to Mrs. Mitchell.</p>
