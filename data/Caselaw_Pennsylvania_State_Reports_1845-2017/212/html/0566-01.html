    <p class="summary" id="b596-13" data-blocks='[["BL_596.18",596,[266,1575,1179,662]]]'>The first reason upon which the defendant bases its request for a new trial in this case is, that the court erred in refusing to affirm defendant’s first, second and third points. I have, consequently, carefully examined the charge of the jury and the answers to the points, to ascertain whether these objections are well founded, and I am satisfied that they are not. The points all close with the request for instructions that there could be no recovery in the case, and ignore the facts involved, which were clearly for the jury. To my mind the affirmance of any of them would have been manifest and reversible error: Whitmire v. Montgomery, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20Pa.%20258" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="165 Pa. 258">165 Pa. 258</a>. No serious harm can, however, come to the defendant thereby, for, if I am wrong, the record is in shape to be easily reviewed.</p>

Rule 17, page 34, directs that “ where the reasons for such motion or <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>application are not founded upon the evidence in the case, the facts must be verified by affidavit; ” but no affidavit was attached at the time the reasons were filed, nor when the court granted this rule. Only on March 14, 1904, was an affidavit appended thereto, and this was done without leave of court. This late action on the part of the defendant should not be considered as curing the original defect, and, because of it, we feel that the depositions taken in support of the application ought not to be considered.</p>
