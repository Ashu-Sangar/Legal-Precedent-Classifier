Appellants insist that there is a plain, full and adequate remedy at law, by suits against the several stockholders defendant, <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>where each can defend upon his own case nntrammeled by differences of fact in the others. That there is a remedy at law by separate actions against the respondents is undeniable, but is it a full and adequate remedy in the sense that it bars the jurisdiction of equity?</p>
    <p id="b197-3" data-blocks='[["BL_197.4",197,[138,638,1183,822]]]'>The subject of the controversy is the collection and administration of corporate assets as a trust fund for the benefit of corporate creditors. Both the control of corporate matters and trust funds, are in general the subject of equitable jurisdiction. As was said in Lane’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="105 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="454279" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0049-01">105 Pa. 49</a> (65) “ when insolvency and exhaustion of assets (of corporations) exist the unpaid capital is not available to any one creditor in satisfaction of his debt, because then the whole amount of the unpaid capital is a trust fund which does not belong to the corporation but to the whole body of its creditors. Hence whether the proceeding originates in the name of one or of several or of all the creditors the result is the same in each. The capital when recovered enures to the benefit of all, and must be distributed among all ratably.” This result, as to collection, and still more forcibly as to distribution, is not reasonably practicable except in equity.</p>
    <p id="b197-4" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[138,1470,1179,395]]]'>A bill may be filed as in this case by assignees representing the corporation for the benefit of creditors, or, as in Lane’s Appeal, supra, by creditors in their own names in behalf of themselves and others. In the latter case an action at law would present insuperable difficulties, and yet the substantial controversy is the same, and the mere difference in the nominal complainant should not oust in one case the jurisdiction that must be sustained in the other.</p>
    <p id="b197-5" data-blocks='[["BL_197.6",197,[137,1884,1179,563]],["BL_198.1",198,[292,366,1185,1334]]]'>It is earnestly argued by appellants that in all the cases where a bill has been sustained, an accounting was part of the relief sought, and that equitable jurisdiction attached on this ground alone, while in the present case no accounting is asked, as the bill avers that the whole unpaid subscription will be insufficient to pay the debts. It is true that the necessity for an account is a large and influential element in equitable relief, but we do not find it said in any of the cases, that its presence or absence is the conclusive jurisdictional fact. In the present case the bill sets up facts that avoid the necessity for an accounting and an assessment. But suppose the answer had denied the <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>averments and thus made the necessity of an accounting and assessment an issue. That would at once have made the case one cognizable in equity. Citizens’ Bank v. Gillespie, <a href="/pa/115/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="115 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="551677" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0564-01">115 Pa. 564</a>, was an action at law in which such necessity was part of the issue, and the ease had to be sent to a new trial for the' reception of incompetent evidence on that point. Whether all the unpaid capital is required for payment of debts, or only part, and if so how much, are matters of judgment on the evidence, and different juries are likely to differ in their conclusions. The result would be that in numerous suits by the assignees some stockholders defendant might have to pay their subscriptions in full while some paid only part and others perhaps nothing at all. This would be incurring certain inconvenience and quite probable injustice, where the relief should not only be certain but uniform. As was well said by the learned judge below “ there are more than forty defendants. Most of them live within the jurisdiction, some do not, and it is quite conceivable that there might be hundreds living without the jurisdiction not reachable by our process at law. The question involved in all the cases is substantially the same, namely, ought the corporation to collect in its unpaid capital ? It is a pure question of law, and may be decided once for all in one suit as well as in a thousand. If the balance should not be collected from all, then it ought not to be collected from any. If, on the other hand, it should be collected, then none should escape.”</p>

When later the legislature granted equitable powers it was held that if the subject of a bill was one within the proper and established jurisdiction of chancery the invention of a new remedy in common-law form, or the extension of an old one, would not necessarily oust the equitable jurisdiction: Wesley Church v.

In the last case it was said by our <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>Brother Dean, “ The question raised in this case is not alone whether plaintiff has a remedy at law, for that remedy it clearly has, but whether in view of the facts it is an adequate one. It may be conceded that the time is not very remote in our judicial history when a wronged party sought the intervention of equity and he could be truthfully met by the reply, you have a remedy at law in an action for damages, such reply would have been the end of his bill; he would have been turned out of court for want of jurisdiction. But this answer is no longer conclusive as to the jurisdiction; courts now go further and inquire whether under the facts the remedy at law is not vexatiously inconvenient, and whether it is so proximately certain as to be adequate to right the wrong complained of.”</p>

Stated generally it is whether, when demand is necessary to start the running of the statute, it must be made within six years of the contract. Stated in detail with reference to the particular facts of the case it is well expressed in the twelfth assignment of error, thus, “ the stock subscription having been made in 1888, and all the calls made in 1888 having been paid, and no further call for the unpaid portion of the stock having been made by the directors, and the insolvency of the company having occurred more than six years from the date of the last call and the payment thereof, this action for the unpaid portion of the stock subscription, begun more than ten years thereafter, is barred by the statute of limitations.”</p>

In the Byers case, WOODWAKD, J., says, the act “ contemplated an early commencement and completion of the road. ... It is not reasonable to suppose the legislature meant that subscribers to such a stock should be indefinitely bound. The road was to be promptly commenced and vigorously maintained.” And in the MeCully case the same judge still more explicitly said we have held in the case against Byers that “ the company were bound from analogy to the statute of limitations to call in payments on stock subscriptions within six years after their date; or if the delay was not satisfactorily accounted for subscribers would be at liberty after that lapse of time, to consider the enterprise abandoned and their subscriptions canceled. The presumptions of abandonment in such cases are very reasonable and necessary. . . . But this case is not left to stand on presumptions of abandonment. We have direct and conclusive evidence of it in the testimony of Addison, Kelly and Robinson.

That was an action by the holder of a certified check, against the certifying bank, more than six years after the date of the check, the date of the certification not appearing. The court held that the holder of such check stood upon the same footing as a depositor, and as the contract of the bank with its depositor was not to pay absolutely and immediately but when payment should be required, a demand was necessary and the statute did not begin to run until it was made. The Byers aud McCully cases were cited, but the court, per Strong, J., distinguished them on the ground of their special facts, saying “ the contract of subscription was a peculiar contract; the legislature had fixed five years as the limit within which the construction of the road should be commenced. It was the duty of the company to commence it and to prosecute it vigorously, and of course to make the calls without delay.” He then cited Morrison v. Mullin, <a href="/pa/34/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="34 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="418022" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0012-01">34 Pa. 12</a>, and after suggesting that in that case “ the twenty years presumption stood in the way of recovery ” said “ in delivering the opinion of the court Mr. Justice Thompson referred to the rulings in Codman v.

The obligation to pay in such case is absolute and present; the only element not fixed with certainty is the time of payment, and as that is at the option of the creditor, and the debtor must be prepared eo instanti, the time of payment, and with it the statute, begins to run at once.</p>
    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[272,909,1182,405]]]'>If, however, the debt is not absolutely or presently due, but either the obligation to pay or the time of payment is contingent on the performance of some act, the happening of some event or the lapse of a specified period of time, then the happening of the event is a condition precedent to the present obligation to pay and the debtor is not in default, nor the creditor entitled to call for performance until the condition is fulfilled and the statute cannot begin to run until that time.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[272,1323,1184,811]]]'>These principles are of uniform application and lie at the foundation of all our cases. Applying them to the present case |it is plain that where a subscription to stock is not presently payable in full, but by its terms is to be payable from time to time as called for by the company, there is no substantial basis for the existence of a third rule, as queried in Swearingen v. Dairy Co., <a href="/pa/198/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="198 Pa. 68" data-case-ids="920346" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0068-01">198 Pa. 68</a>. Until such call, there is no obligation on the stockholder to pay. It may never be made. If the enterprise is successful and profitable from the start, or the provision for capital has been larger than actual needs require, the duty of payment is only a reserve duty foj' possible contingencies, and until they happen, either by calls by the corporation on the subscriptions, or by the rights of creditors, there is no duty of the subscriber to pay, no right of action against him for nonpayment, and no starting point for the statute of limitations.</p>
    <p id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.6",206,[275,2151,1182,301]],["BL_207.1",207,[144,393,1178,254]]]'>As already said, the principles at the basis of the decisions are clear and undisputed, and the later and more authoritative cases have tended distinctly to rest upon them. We conclude, therefore, that R. R. Co. v. Byers, <a href="/pa/32/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="32 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="986769" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0022-01">32 Pa. 22</a>; McCully v. R. R.

Graham, <a href="/pa/36/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="36 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="992242" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0077-01">36 Pa. 77</a>, and the cases which have followed them, are not authorities for a gem <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>eral rule in cases of subscriptions to corporate stock, but must be sustained, if at all, as-exceptions resting on their own peculiar facts of abandonment of the corporate enterprise, which released the subscriber’s contract to pay further. The court below was right in applying the general rule to this case.</p>
