The change was unnecessary, because no court, in construing this section, would permit the error of using one word instead o£ the other to defeat the plain meaning of the legislative enactment, The fourth section of the schedule contained in the Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, specifically repeals the whole of the act of 1887, excepting sections 1 and 2, thus wiping out section 24 above quoted. Counsel for plaintiffs argues that the act of 1895 (section 1) is still in force, and that, therefore, no city of the second class can increase its bonded indebtedness in any amount without a vote of the people. We can hardly think that counsel is serious in maintaining this contention. It appears very clear that the only effect of the amendment in the act of 1895, section 1, was to read into the twenty-fourth section of the act of 1887 the word “thereon,” instead of “ thereat.” In this particular instance the latter section falls with the repeal of the former. We also call attention to jraragraph 5, section 3, article 19, of the act of 1901, relating to the corporate powers of cities of the second class. The paragraph reads thus:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[283,1487,1189,497]]]'>' .“To borrow money on the credit of the city, and to pledge the credit and revenues thereof for the payment of the same, to an amount not exceeding two per centum upon the assessed value of the taxable property in said city, and with the consent of the people of the said city, obtained at an election held under the provisions of the constitution and the general laws ■ of this commonwealth, to increase the indebtedness of such city to an amount not exceeding in the aggregate, seven per centum upon the assessed valuation of the taxable property therein.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.6",630,[281,2004,1177,405]]]'>In view of the power expressly given by this paragraph to cities of the second class to pledge the credit of the city up to two per cent of the assessed valuation without a vote of- the people, what becomes of section 1 of the act of 1895 ? Both provisions cannot stand. They are absolutely irreconcilable. One or the other must give way, and, according to a well understood rule of construction, the latter enactment must prevail. We need not enlarge on this point.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b631-3" data-blocks='[["BL_631.3",631,[153,416,1182,1346]]]'>It is claimed that there is no provision for the payment of the interest which falls due on January 1, 1905; sec. 8, of the ordinance, levies a tax for the year 1905 and every year thereafter to pay the bonds and interest. Counsel for plaintiffs says that the taxes, as a matter of fact, are not collected until late in the year, and that there will be no money in the treasury to pay the first semiannual installment of interest. This is undoubtedly true ; but it is equally true that the city has many lawful ways for providing money for temporary purposes. The main question is: Has the city done what the law requires it to do in making provisions for the payment of the bonds and interest ? Has it made a levy sufficient for the purpose ? The eighth section of the ordinance answers these questions affirmatively. The ordinance has been carefully drawn and meets the requirements of the law in such cases, but the city is not so helpless in this matter as counsel would have us believe. The interest even for the whole of the year 1905 may be paid out of the premium bid on the sale of the bonds. We know of no reason why this cannot be done. The amendment to the answer filed by agreement shows that the total premiums exceed one year’s interest. Regardless of the particular source from which the city may draw the money to pay the first semiannual interest, it is a sufficient answer to plaintiffs’ contention on this point that the city has made all the provisions demanded by law for the payment of all the bonds and interest. It could do no more. We consider this objection as highly technical.</p>

The constitution provides that all taxes shall be uniform on the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. Counsel for plaintiffs admits the right of the legislature to classify real estate for purposes of taxation, but denies the right of a municipality to levy a different rate on each class of property. In other words, he admits the principle, but denies the propriety of applying it so as to produce practical results. Unless there is a different rate of levy on the several classes of property, why should properties be classified at all ? The point of objection, as we understand it, is that one man pays more than <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>another on the same valuation. In the present case, for instance, the ordinance levies .142 on each dollar of valuation on first class property, .0946 on second-class property, and .071 on third-class property. All properties in cities of the second class being assessed at their actual value, the result is, that three men, each- owning property worth, say, $5,000, the properties being in each of the several classes, do not pay the same amount of tax on the same valuation. This is undoubtedly true, and such is the result of the practical operation of the rule ; but unless some such result is secured, it is apparent that the classification of real estate for purposes of taxation is useless. If all properties are assessed at their aetual value, and if the same rate should be levied on all properties, why not include all properties in the one class ? It is too late in the day in Pennsylvania to question the power of the legislature to classify subjects of taxation on broad lines and within certain limitations. The reasons for such classification, based upon imperious necessity, are so numerous, and have been so frequently discussed by the higher courts, that it is useless to refer to them now. We shall cite only one case to show that the question before us is definitely and authoritatively settled: Commonwealth v. Delaware Div. Canal Co., <a href="/pa/123/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="123 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="967114" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0594-01">123 Pa. 594</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.5",632,[285,1552,1174,508]]]'>It is decided- that the power to impose taxes for the support of the government, with the power of classification, still belonging to the legislature under the new constitution, the selection of the subjects thereof, their classification, and the methods of collection to be provided, are matters purely legislative. The power to classify being given all that is then required by the constitution is that taxes shall be uniform upon the members of a class, and it is the uniformity of taxation, according to the classification made, which is the matter to be determined by the court.</p>

L. 586, on page 594) has the following provision: “ To provide for the issuing of bonds ; for the application of bonds already issued, for the purpose of funding any and all indebtedness, now existing or hereafter created, of the city, now due or to become due : Provided that the said bonds shall be payable in not less than five years and not more than thirty years from <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>the date of their issue, and that the same shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding six per centum per annum, with interest coupons attached, payable annually or semiannually, and the said bonds shall not be sold or exchanged for less than their par value and accrued interest.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b633-3" data-blocks='[["BL_633.4",633,[117,620,1179,303]]]'>This provision, undoubtedly, refers to funding bonds or bonds issued to take up or pay an existing indebtedness.

They are issued for the purpose of providing money for improvements yet to be made. We hold, therefore, that the provision above quoted does not authorize the issuing of bonds payable annually. Where, then, do we find the authority for the issuing of bonds payable annually ? The only place it can be found is in article XI, act of 1901, on page Bl, relating to the “Sinking Fund Commission,” which states that whenever any new bonds shall be issued by any of said cities they shall be made payable in annual installments equal to the tax levied therefor, and shall be made payable annually from the funds so provided.- It is difficult to escape the effect of the comprehensive and general character of this provision relating to the issue of “ any new bonds.” Counsel for plaintiffs claims that the place of this provision in the article pertaining to the sinking fund commission means that the “ new bonds ” referred to are those bonds issued by the city to take up maturing bonds. We do not know what might have been in the mind of the person who drafted article XI, but we do know that we must give effect to the language used. The language is so plain and unambiguous that we cannot change it by any method of interpretation. We think the criticism is proper that the provision belongs logically to some other part of the act of 1901, but we must take this act of assembly as we find it, and give it such a construction that the whole may stand if possible. If it was the intention of the legislature to say that any new bonds issued by cities of the second class shall be payable annually when issued for the purpose of taking up or funding maturing bonds, <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>it should have said so. We have scanned every word and line of article XI, and can find no such intention expressed. Combining the two provisions in the act of 1901, in relation to the issue of bonds, we read them thus: “ Whenever any new bonds shall be issued by any of said cities they shall be made payable in annual installments,” but, “ bonds issued for the purpose of funding any and all indebtedness now existing or hereafter created .... shall be payable in not less than five years fior more than thirty years.” This, in our opinion, is the present state of legislation relating to the issue of bonds by cities of-the second class. Bonds to provide means for contemplated improvements or for the creation of a new indebtedness are payable annually ; funding bonds are payable in from five to thirty years.</p>
