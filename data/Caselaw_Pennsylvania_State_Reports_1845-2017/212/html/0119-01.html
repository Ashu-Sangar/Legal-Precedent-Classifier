    <p class="summary" id="b151-5" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[154,798,1175,91]]]'>Other facts appear by the opinion of the court by Ashman, J., which was as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[152,902,1179,1329]]]'>The testator bequeathed his residuary estate in trust, inter alia, to invest the sum of $10,000, and to pay the net income to his grandson “ until he shall attain the age of twenty-five years, at which time my said trustees are to pay to my said grandson the principal thereof.” The grandson died without having reached the prescribed age. We agree with the auditing judge that he took a vested interest. Time was not annexed to the substance of the gift, which was to the legatee at all events; but the date of payment, not the gift itself, was simply postponed. There was no limitation over. It is scarcely worth while even to glance at the cases which embody, some of them, refined distinctions as to what will constitute a contingent gift. A mere direction to executors to pay to a legatee “ as soon as he arrives to be twenty-one years of age,” there being no substantive gift, is contingent: Moore v. Smith, <a href="/watts/9/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts 403" data-case-ids="1849953" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0403-01">9 Watts, 403</a> ; or a gift in trust to pay to nephews “ when they shall respectively attain the age of nineteen years :” Engles’ Estate, <a href="/pa/167/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="167 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="866801" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0463-01">167 Pa. 463</a>. So a gift to a person at, or if, or as and when, he shall attain twenty-one: Hanson v. Graham, 6 Yes. 239, etc. But when the subject of the gift is separated from the rest of the estate and vested in trustees for the benefit of the legatee, the gift, although in form contingent, will be held vested: Branstrom v. Wilkinson, 7 Ves. 421; or where interest is given to the legatee till the time of payment arrives: Hanson v. Graham, 6 Yes. 239. See, also, Roberts’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/59/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="59 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="426927" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0070-01">59 Pa. 70</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b151-7" data-blocks='[["BL_151.6",151,[154,2251,1176,199]],["BL_152.1",152,[284,382,1174,202]]]'>The trust as to the balance of the residuary esta'te was to pay the income to testator’s wife until his said grandson should be twenty-five, and then or at his death, whichever event should first happen, to convey one-third to testator’s son, Ben<a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>jamin, and his wife in equal shares ; and if he should be then dead, to pay to his wife $5,000; one other third to testator’s son Lewis, and, if dead, to his wife $5,000, and the remainder, upon his attaining the said age, to his grandson absolutely.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[281,592,1186,1650]]]'>Benjamin, the son, died before the grandson, leaving his wife surviving. His interest was contingent upon his surviving the grandson in case the latter should attain the age of twenty-five years, or in case he should die before that period, and the grandson died in the interim, but having outlived Benjamin. The wife of Benjamin was thereupon entitled to receive $5,000, and the balance of the share lapsed. The auditing judge awarded it to the estate of the grandson. It will be observed that the testator, while he gave one-third of his residuary estate to his son Benjamin and one-third to his son Lewis, gave the remainder to his grandson. This difference in naming the quantum of the several gifts was adopted, we must assume, with deliberation and with a purpose. The remainder was not necessarily one-third of the estate ; it included all that was left after legacies which were well given had been paid and legacies which had lapsed had fallen back into the estate. This disposition of the residue is in harmony with the intent apparent throughout the will to favor the grandson. The objection that the grandson’s share of the residue was a contingent interest is futile. The residuary legacy did not rest in the direction to convey to him upon attaining a certain age. Of such a bequest Mr. Hawkins says-in his Treatise, at page 226 : “ A bequest to A. at twenty-one and a bequest to A. payable at twenty-one do not much differ in expression, yet one is a vested and the other is a contingent gift.” Under the present will the direction to pay was only the sequence of an antecedent gift. The testator instructed the trustees to hold the residue for the grandson and to convey the same to him absolutely at his age of twenty-five years. In no sense could this designation of time enter into the substance of the gift; its effect was merely to postpone the payment of a gift which vested at the death of the testator.</p>
