Loughlin, <a href="/pa/139/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="139 Pa. 612" data-case-ids="11252479" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0612-01">139 Pa. 612</a>, 617.)’ The principle of the act of June 8, 1891, is clear, to wit: that a corporation is to be taxed for purposes of revenue just as an individual or private citizen .is to be taxed, according to its assets; and so as to be in this respect on a footing of equalitj' with all corporations of the commonwealth, and also to be free from double taxation. That each citizen must contribute to the public revenue, and that a corporation doing business must contribute as a private citizen must, are made apparent by the statutes ; and the general doctrine is an enlightened one and, as we think, in this state practically exhibited in legislation which is just and at length equitably comprehensive. Criticisms by the Supreme Court, such as are found in Fox’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/112/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="112 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="546754" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0337-01">112 Pa. 337</a>, and Fidelity Ins., etc., Co. v. Loughlin, <a href="/pa/139/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="139 Pa. 612" data-case-ids="11252479" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0612-01">139 Pa. 612</a>, have doubtless assisted the legislature. A corporation is treated and taxed as an owner of property represented by its capital stock. If in the course of its business under its charter it has the legal title to propérty of others, that property is also taxed under certain circumstances, but the tax falls upon the parties having the title in equity. Hence when we enter upon an examination of the case at bar, we ask, what assets were contemplated in making up the value of the capital stock of the plaintiff, and what assets did it hold for people for whom it acted in a fiduciary capacity ? ■ A distinction at once suggests itself: the undisputed and unquestionable findings of fact show that the capital of this plaintiff is $1,000,000; that the market value of its capital stock is $5,100,000; that its assets free from the estimation of its capital stock, that jjs to say, practically set aside for its liabilities in the commercial appraisement of the capital stock, are $31,-646,779.17. There is thus a variance which we shall discuss. But with regard to property held in trust there cannot arise this variance. The appraisement of trust assets involves noth<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>ing more than the ascertainment of values, usually (for taxation in Pennsylvania) of par values, and if not this, then of values in the market.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b102-4" data-blocks='[["BL_102.4",102,[305,535,1184,1172]]]'>The distinction turns on the point of liabilities. In the assessment of stocks, bonds, other investments, real or personal, of a trust estate, the indebtedness of the trust estate owning them is not a consideration. They may be assets for the payment of debts, it is true, but no amount of indebtedness of the man who controls them can prejudice or increase their value. This is determined by standards having no relation whatever to- the solvency of him who may have the right to dispose of them. Thus far the situation of a trading corporation is similar. No amount of its indebtedness can prejudice or increase the value of the stocks, bonds, other investments, real or personal, which it controls and may dispose of. But the situation of a trading corporation involves a stage beyond this; assuming the assets described as of a given value, unaffected by the financial condition of their owner, what is their availability in trade as capital of the trading corporation ? The problem, then, is the assessment, not of the capital, but of these assets as the capital stock ; and this requires an ascertainment of the liabilities, to meet which assets must be set apart, and thus found unavailable pro tanto for other use. The value of a business capital is ascertained in the market upon allowance of many considerations, among which is the volume of debts of the business.</p>

Corporations and individuals must stand as citizens, equally liable to taxation, but they are not of the same class. It was said in Pullman Palace Car Co. v.

Rep. 318, Simonton, J., said, “ The property and capital stock are not identical, and it is the latter which is to be valued and taxed in this case.” The underlying principle of appraisement of stock according to market value in all these rulings, that the word assets means things of value to the corporation after an estimate of, or allowance for, its liabilities, is formulated by the same high authority in Commonwealth v. Lake Shore, etc., R. R. Co., 3 Dauphin County Reports^ 172. “ Under the act of June 8, 1891, the question of the actual value in cash of the capital stock of a corporation is a question of fact which must be determined by considering the value of defendant’s tangible property and assets of every kind, including its bonds, mortgages and moneys at interest, and its franchises and privileges ; and the amount of incumbrances on its property and franchises is also a relevant fact to be considered, but is not to be specifically deducted from the valuation so ascertained and determined.”</p>

L. 229. The original provisions subjected a corporation to the risk of double taxation, because of an apparent oversight of the fact that assets must be allowed for as specifically untaxable if necessary to meet liabilities. The fourth proviso of the act of June 1, 1889, saved property of corporations “ belonging to them and constituting any portion of their assets included within the appraised value of their capital stock.” The Supreme Court, by Mr. Justice Mitchell, said in the ease last cited : “ 'J'he proviso applies to all mortgages of corporations of either class, included in the valuation of stock prescribed by <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>either section 20 or section 21, and so read it carries out its plain intent of preventing double taxation. Under what circumstances there may be any mortgages not so included in the appraised value, we need not now inquire. If there should at any time be any such, they will be taxed under section 1.” That a corporation may own mortgages and other securities not affecting the market value of its capital stock, not necessarily taken into the calculation of that value, is difficult to understand, as this authority, we might say, this warning against double taxation, indicates. “ The capital stock is nothing,” said the Supreme Court in Fox’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/112/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="112 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="546754" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0337-01">112 Pa. 337</a>, “ a myth; a mere name excepting in so far as it is represented by investments made with the money paid into the treasury of the corporation on account of such capital stock.

It reported that as trustee, executor, administrator and guardian it held bonds, mortgages and other securities of the value of $6,455,282. On this it paid the state tax of four mills. It also paid a tax of eight mills on its gross premiums, and other taxes amounting in all to over $150,000. Upon notice from the board of revision of taxes of the city of Philadelphia, it made a return under protest of so-called insurance assets aggregating $31,646,779.17. The question raised <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>by this appeal is whether these assets are subject to a state tax of four mills.

L. 229, and the words of the proviso above quoted were omitted from the later act and the exemption was extended to mortgages, bonds and other securities held by corporations, “owned by them in their own right.” In construing the act of 1889, it was held that the intent of the proviso was to prevent double taxation and that the tax imposed by the twenty-first section was not cumulative but in substitution for that imposed by the first section: Fidelity Ins., etc., Co. v.

The facts to which it is applied are these : The Provident Life and Trust' Company is a corporation conducting the business of a life insurance and trust company. In the management of its business all receipts are mingled in a common fund. In order to keep track of its different branches, the receipts from insurance are credited to the insurance branch, and the expenses, death losses and payments on endowment policies are charged to this branch. The surplus with accumulations of interest is held as a reserve fund to meet the payment of policies as they mature and to make certain the fulfillment of the contracts of insurance.</p>

L. 194, amending the act under which the company was incorporated which provides ; “ That all the net profits to be derived <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>from the business of life insurance after deducting the expenses of the company, shall be divided pro rata among the holders of the policies of such life insurance, equitably and ratably, as the directors of said company shall and may, from time to time, ascertain, determine and report the same for division.” These assets do not represent the net profits of the insurance branch. They are a part of the gross assets of the company, subject to its insurance liabilities, which amount to over $43,000,000. The clear finding on this subject is: “ Thére is no provision of law that plaintiff’s assets or any part of them derived from its business of insurance shall be set apart for the benefit of policy holders, and they.are not so set apart, but, as matter of bookkeeping, plaintiff keeps a separate and distinct account of the assets pertaining to that side of its business. Its contract with its policy holders contains no provision giving them a claim upon any particular assets, but is the ordinary standard form of insurance policy. When insurance losses occur, they are paid out of the general fund of the company, and subsequently as a matter of bookkeeping charged to the insurance side of its business. The $31,646,779.17 of securities reported by plaintiff under protest was owned by it in its own right, and not as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian or any other fiduciary capacity.”</p>

No particular assets represent the net profits, which in 1900 amounted to $6,279,520, to which the policy holders will become entitled when the directors- of the company ascertain and report .them for division. Until they are reported for division, the policy holders are entitled to nothing, and then not to securities in kind but to money. This fund is under the absolute control of the trust company and was created to meet future indebtedness. The management of the company does not differ in this regard from the management of other financial institutions that create an adequate reserve against certain liabilities. It is only by regarding the company as a holding company and its branches as distinct entities for whose benefit investments are made and securities held that any conception of a distinct trust relation arises. If so regarded it is a trustee as well for its depositors of all securities purchased with funds received <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>by its banking department, and these are liable to taxation.

It can only fairly escape the same taxation as other moneys at interest pay, if it is owned by the trust company in its own right. It appears from the record that in 1898, when the commonwealth undertook to do the <em>very </em>thing which the trust company now says ought to be done, that is, tax the insurance assets as the property of the company held by it in its own right, the company strenuously resisted. It then set forth, referring to its charter, that it was “ authorized by said charter to conduct, and it does conduct, in pursuance of said charter authority, two separate and distinct branches of business, viz.: the business ordinarily incident to a trust company and the business of a life insurance company. . . .</p>

L. 194, supplementary to the original act incorporating the company, that £ the net profits to be derived from the business of life insurance, after deducting the expenses of the company, shall be divided pro rata among the holders of the policies of such life insurance, equitably and ratably, as the directors of said company shall and may, from time to time, ascertain, determine, and report the same for division.’ Such divisions are from time to time made <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>to the holders of policies, but no division of profits arising from the insurance business are, or ever have been divided among the stockholders as such. The assets of the insurance part of the company’s business are kept in an entirely separate and distinct fund, and are not covered by the capital stock of the company, and have no relation thereto, no more than if the insurance business were conducted by an entirely separate and distinct corporation.”</p>
    <p id="b112-4" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[289,820,1182,1180]]]'>The contention of the company in this respect was well founded and was sustained by the Dauphin county court. But the present attitude of the company is entirely inconsistent with the view for which it so stoutly and successfully contended at that time. The result is that under the conclusion reached by the trial judge in this case, and affirmed by the majority of this court, this very large invested fund, composed of the insurance assets of the company, escapes taxation altogether. Under any other circumstances than those in which it now seeks to avoid taxation, the company would no doubt reject with vigor, any suggestion that it did not hold <em>the </em>insurance assets in trust for the policy holders. It would be most insistent that in common with all other sound and reliable insurance companies, its attitude to its policy holders is that of a pure trusteeship. The policy holders contribute the capital, which is invested on their account to equalize the mortality <em>risks; </em>and after paying the cost of administration, the whole amount, surplus as well as legal reserve, is morally and equitably the property of the policjr holders. Not a dollar of it belongs to, or can in any way lawfully be distributed among the stockholders of the trust company. They have no more right to it than to any fund which the company may hold as guardian, administrator or receiver.</p>
    <p id="b112-5" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[290,2011,1186,355]]]'>There can be no question but that the fund now under consideration is made up of the proceeds of premiums paid by the policy holders to cover the mortality risks for the whole period' of their policies. It is the amount reserved to meet claims accruing from the insurance in force. It belongs to the holders of policies who are entitled at their maturity to the face value and in addition to a pro rata share in the accumulated profits.</p>
    <p id="b112-6" data-blocks='[["BL_112.6",112,[293,2373,1174,99]]]'>How then is it possible to hold that this is not a fund held by the company in trust for them ?</p>
    <p id="b113-3" data-blocks='[["BL_113.3",113,[124,408,1180,607]]]'>
      <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>The company holds the legal title to the fund, but to suggest that it holds the fund in its own right, for the benefit of its stockholders, is startling in the extreme. The only benefit which can accrue to the stockholders of the trust company, is in the handling of the fund as a deposit in course of investment, and from the incidental advantages which accrue from the control of large sums of money. In addition to this, under its charter privilege, all expenses of conducting the trust company are chargeable to the insurance department of the business. To my mind, it is perfectly clear that the fund in question is made up of trust assets, and as such, they are taxable as in the case of individuals.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[125,1033,1179,85]]]'>I would therefore reverse the decree of the court below, and dismiss the bill.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b113-5" data-blocks='[["BL_113.5",113,[167,1173,628,40]]]'>Dean, J., concurs in this dissent.</p>
