The notes were paid in part and, conceding some of these payments to have been made prior to the actual delivery of the mortgage, yet the notes were secured by the mortgage which bore the same date and hence part of the money secured by the mortgage was paid. The payment of some of the notes must be regarded, so far as it affects the delivery of the notes, as an acknowledgment of their actual delivery, or at least a waiver by the defendants of the right to insist upon the stipulation on the envelope containing the notes that the relation of the parties should remain unchanged until the agreement was fully complied with.

Prior to and at the time the agreement and mortgage were executed no prosecution had been brought against Dodson. While he testifies that the plaintiff and the latter’s counsel told him he would be prosecuted if he did not obtain the mortgage, it was not shown, nor is it even claimed, that the plaintiff or his counsel agreed not to prosecute if the mortgage was given. The contract would not be vitiated unless the plaintiff agreed to abandon or suppress the prosecution against Dodson : Johnston v.

There is therefore no substance in this suggestion as a defense to the scire facias on the mortgage.</p>
