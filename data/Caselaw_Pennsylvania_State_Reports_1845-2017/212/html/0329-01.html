A short distance from the end of the platform there was a switch and siding to enable the cars to pass at that point. As the inward bound car approached the switch, another car coming in the opposite direction from the city entered the switch and passed over the turnout towards the platform. Instead of stopping on the turnout the latter car ran on towards the second switch which it reached just as the inbound ear was crossing. The outbound ear struck the inbound one about the middle of the side. The deceased was caught between the cars and killed. There was testimony that the deceased was standing on the running board of the inbound car, but two witnesses testified that he was standing on the track next to the car. <em>Held, </em>that the court could not say as a matter of law that the deceased was guilty erf contributory negligence even if standing on the track, inasmuch as there was no reason why he should have apprehended that the outbound car would continue to run out from the siding and over the switch, and would strike with its front end the side of the inbound car.</p>

The present action has been brought to recover damages for the loss thus sustained on the theory that it was occasioned by the negligence of the defendant. [I do not think there is any evidence that would justify you in finding that <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>the injury complained of was the result of defendant’s negligence. But even if the fact were otherwise it is clear that the negligence of the deceased contributed to the injury.] [1] The only eyewitnesses of the accident were two women, friends of the deceased, who stood near him at the time, both of whom testify that when he was struck he was standing on the track over which the offending car was moving. There is no evidence that he was forced into this position or that it was not his own voluntary selection. True, these women were defendant’s witnesses. It is also true that one of the plaintiff’s witnesses testified that a very short time, if not immediately before the accident, the deceased was standing on the running board of a crowded car pointed in a different direction from the offending ear, but this witness did not see the accident, and frankly admitted that he did not know where the deceased was standing when it occurred. [This leaves wholly uncontradicted the testimony of the two women, which, if believed, and no reason has been assigned why it should not be-believed, clearly establishes contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.] [2]</p>

The accident happened at a station erected by the defendant company near a" pleasure resort known as Bushkill Park. On the opposite side of the park, and also near to it, the D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co. had a branch road leading, as did the defendant’s road, to Easton, the home of the deceased. The defendant, anticipating a great crowd beyond the capacity of its ears, hired a train of cars from the D., L. &amp; W. Co., to ply between the park and Easton on the day in question, and also constructed a well defined path, lighted at night by electricity,.leading through the park to the D., L. &amp; W. trains. The fare on both roads was the same. The defendant also employed L. P. Meyers, familiarly known for his stentorian voice, to announce,, from time to time the existence and movements of these trains, and this was done at the defendant’s station and in the park during the evening. Moreover, Mr. Hay, the president of the defendant company, met the deceased, whom he had known from childhood, a very short time before the accident, and advised him to take the train for safety, and walked with him’ a short distance in that <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>direction, the deceased being somewhat under the influence of liquor.

    <p id="b365-7" data-blocks='[["BL_365.11",365,[124,1304,1180,868]]]'>This action was brought to recover damages for the death of plaintiff’s husband, caused, as is alleged, by the negligence of the defendant company. After nine o’clock in the evening of September 1, 1902, a trolley car crowded with passengers started from the platform at Bushkill park on the return trip to Easton. A short distance from the end of the platform there was a switch and siding to enable the cars to pass at that point. As the inward bound car approached the switch, another car coming in the opposite direction from Easton entered the switch and passed over the turnout towards the platform. Instead of stopping on the turnout, the latter car ran on towards the second switch which it reached just as the inbound car was crossing it, and the result was a collision, by which several persons were injured. The outbound car struck the inbound one about the middle of the side, and the husband of tke plaintiff was caught between the two cars and crushed so badly that he died in a few hours.</p>
    <p id="b365-8" data-blocks='[["BL_365.12",365,[123,2190,1180,242]],["BL_366.1",366,[304,363,1176,88]]]'>The motorman of the colliding car testified that as he approached the switch so many persons jumped on the car and platform and crowded around him, that he could not move and could not control the car. If it had not been for the crowd he could have averted the accident. It was so dense that he could <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>not move his arms so as to put on the brake. This, he said, was the cause of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[302,466,1181,513]]]'>On behalf of the plaintiff, Harry Petty testified that at the time of the accident he was on the returning car, which was crowded, the seats being all filled and also the running boards at the sides. He says he “ saw the deceased who was standing on the running board just before he was hit.” That he “had bis arihs around the standard.” And that “ the blow kind of turned him around.” On cross-examination, the witness said that while he saw the deceased on the running board just before he was hit, he could not tell whether he was on the running board or on the ground when he was hit.</p>
    <p id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[301,985,1178,197]]]'>Floyd Stem testified that he saw the car hit a person who was standing on the running board, but it turned his face so that he could not recognize him, and he was unable to say whether he was plaintiff’s husband.</p>
    <p id="b366-7" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[301,1191,1179,561]]]'>This was all the evidence offered by the plaintiff to show where her husband was standing when struck and injured. But it was sufficient, we think, to justify its submission to the jury. If the decedent was unable to find room upon the car, elsewhere than upon the running board, and if the defendant company accepted him as a passenger in that position, and was undertaking to carry him, he was entitled to protection. If he was thus struck and injured by the other car, the burden of showing that the accident was not caused by the negligence of the motorman of the colliding car, was certainly upon the defendant company.</p>

Gibson, <a href="/pa/96/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="96 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="494584" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0083-01">96 Pa. 83</a> (a collision with a hay wagon), the burden would have been on her to show negligence on the part of the defendant. But when it arose from a collision between defendant’s cars, operated on its own rails, the presumption of negligence arises and the burden is on the defendant to rebut it.”</p>

There the traveler, if he is to get on at all, must stand on the platform, <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>with its rods, etc., to hold by, or inside with a strap -for that purpose.

In this statement we think there was error. Even if the decedent was standing upon the ground at the side of the car, this is not a place which the court could say as a matter of law was intrinsically dangerous. There was no reason as we see it, why the decedent should have apprehended that the outbound car would continue to run out from the siding and over the switch, and would strike with its front end, the side of the inbound ear. In any event it was not for the court to say as a matter of law that the decedent was guilty of contributory negligence in assuming the position in which he was when struck by the ear. Whether or not his conduct in this respect was negligent under the circumstances was for the jury-</p>

We sustain the first, second, third and fourth specifications. We consider the testimony irrelevant, which was admitted with reference to providing transportation on the steam railroad, and against the objection of plaintiff’s counsel, as set forth in the fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth and tenth specifications of error, and these assignments are therefore sustained.</p>

The eleventh assignment is sustained. We see no error in permitting defendant to show on cross-examination that the father of deceased contributed to the support of the plaintiff. The direct examination had 'shown' that the earning capacity of deceased was very small.
