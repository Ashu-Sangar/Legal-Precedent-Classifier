    <p class="summary" id="b96-10" data-blocks='[["BL_96.16",96,[293,1620,1179,458]]]'>■ From the record it appeared that the plaintiff was the lessee of coal under a lease in which one Sarah Horton had an interest. Charles D. Foster, one of the defendants, acquired a portion of the interest of Sarah Horton, and from June 13, 1894, to January 1,1903, received his proportionate share of the royalties. On March 23, 1903, Grizzie G. Norris made a demand on plaintiff claiming all of the royalties due on the share of Sarah Horton. The plaintiff then filed the present bill for an inter-pleader. Both defendants demurred to the bill.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b96-11" data-blocks='[["BL_96.17",96,[342,2147,1094,42]]]'>Ferris, J., filed an opinion which was in part as follows:</p>

That of Mrs. Norris was withdrawn pursuant to an agreement that her rights in the premises should be determined by an action of ejectment, and the prayer of the bill was modified accordingly. This would seem to eliminate from this pro<a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>ceeding the prayer for an interpleader, leaving the bill to stand, practically, as an application for equitable relief pending a determination of the rights of the parties by an action at law. This relief has been afforded by the special injunction already granted, which does not restrain Mr. Foster from bringing an action for royalties claimed by him if he so desires, but only from collecting and receiving them without first entering into a written agreement to refund them if it shall appear that he is not entitled to them. The plaintiff has been decreed to pay him, and all he need do to receive them pending the action by Mrs. Norris is to receipt for them, with an agreement to refund them in ease it shall turn out that he had no right to receive them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[137,1052,1180,250]]]'>The demurrer of Charles D. Foster is sustained so far as it relates to the bill as an application to the court for a decree that defendants interplead. The bill is allowed to stand, however, as an application for general relief, and the special injunction heretofore granted is continued until further order.</p>
