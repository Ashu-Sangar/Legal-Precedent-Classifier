It is true that she received receipts from the defendant for the stock, by which he agreed to return the stock on demand, and it is also true that she testified that the stock was to be temporary collateral, but she further testified as follows : “ I gave it to him with the understanding that he was going to give it to his broker.”</p>

And after this stock was assigned to defendant, the plaintiff got further profits.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b589-8" data-blocks='[["BL_589.8",589,[147,1422,1181,508]]]'>Undoubtedly, if the stock assigned by the plaintiff to the defendant had been hypothecated for the purpose of their joint speculations and swept away, she would have had no right to recover in this form of action ; and the fact that the defendant sold the stock for the purpose of raising money and applying it to their speculations does not vary the principle. The plaintiff authorized the defendant to use her stock for the purpose of speculation, and clothed him, through a power of attorney, with the rights of ownership. He used the stock, was unfortunate in his speculation, and the stock was lost.</p>

The stock was sold and the proceeds lost in speculations. We are of opinion that the plaintiff no longer had a property in the chattel, general or special, or the actual possession or the right to immediate possession, which are fundamental to a right to maintain an action of trover.</p>

As was said in Duffield v. Miller, <a href="/pa/92/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="92 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="491059" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0286-01">92 Pa. 286</a>, above cited: “ When the plaintiff authorized the managers of a failing bank to use his bonds to raise money, he must have known that it might not be in their power to return them. At any rate, there was a risk, and he assumed it. Having been pledged by his authority, the pledgee has a right to sell for nonpayment of the money borrowed, and such sale passed the title. At the time this suit was brought the bonds had been sold and the plaintiff’s rights divested. He owned nothing that could be the subject of an action of trover. All that was left him was a right of action upon his agreement. It is well settled that to maintain trover the plaintiff must have a property in the chattel, general or special, and the actual possession or the right to immediate possession: Mather v.
