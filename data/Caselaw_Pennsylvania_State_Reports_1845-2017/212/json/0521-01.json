Soisson and Rocks Coal & Coke Company.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEjectment for three acres of coal in Redstone township. Before Umbel, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the defendants claimed title through one James A. Lynn who died in 1883. Plaintiffs claimed title under the following agreement in writing:\n\u201cAn article of agreement made and entered into this the 15th day of August 1877 Between James M. Linn of Redstone township of the first part and Fletcher F. Chalfant of the second part of Jefferson township all of Fayette county and State of Pennsylvania\n\u201c Witnesseth That the aforesaid Jas. M. Linn doth bargain and sell unto the aforesaid Fletcher F. Chalfant all that certain tract or parcel of coal containing three acres for the sum of three hundred dollars situated south of the brick house where John Hartsock now lives Beginning at a Red oak tree at the mouth of the new entry Running thence to Baileys line on the top of the hill thence by Baileys line to a point south the old opening thence by old opening around the point to place of Beginning To make three acres of coal Excepting what has been taken out, the aforesaid, Jas. M. Linn Reserves the use of the new entry.\n\u201c The said F. F. Chalfant is to not sell anj^ coal only what he hauls himself or have hauled also cannot sell the said three acres of coal to any person or persons But Jas. M. Linn his heirs or assigns the said F. F. Chalfant has the privilege of erecting a coal scaffold Between the old Bank and the point opposite Brick house But has no other privilege of surface Said F. Chalfant has the privilege dumping the debris over the Road : In testimony whereof the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals.\u201d\nF. C. Clialfant died on April 21, 1902. At the trial there was a verdict for plaintiff subject to the question of law reserved, whether the article of agreement between Linn and Chalfant was executory or executed.\nThe court subsequently entered judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto.\nError assigned was in entering judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto.\nW. J. Sturgis, with him George D. Howell, for appellant.\u2014\nThe rule requiring the word \u201c heirs \u201d to convey land in fee, is purely technical, and the reasons which supported the rule no longer exist: Defraunce v. Brooks, 8 W. & S. 67.\nThe fact that the contract contemplated that Chalfant would mine out and totally destroy the corpus of the thing contracted about, is of itself a circumstance, sufficient to settle the construction to be given this informal instrument: Kenrick v. Smick, 7 W. & S. 41.\nThe parties intended their contract to be what they called it, an \u201carticle of agreement,\u201d and not an executed deed: Sheaffer v. Sheaffer, 37 Pa. 525; Stewart v.
