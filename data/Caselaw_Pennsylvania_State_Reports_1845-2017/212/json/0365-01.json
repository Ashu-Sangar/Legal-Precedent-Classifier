The American Bonding Company.\nGuardian and ward\u2014Principal and surety\u2014General guardianship bond\u2014 Sale of real estate.\nWhere a bond given by a guardian and his surety is on its face a general guardianship bond and it appears that the surety had no knowledge that the bond was intended for any other purpose than that which appeared upon its face, the surety cannot be held liable for the misappropriation by the guardian of the proceeds of the sale of real estate sold by the guardian under an order of court.\nArgued March 13, 1905.\nAppeal, No. 285, Jan. T., 1904, by plaintiffs, from judgment of Superior Court, Feb. T., 1904, No. 20, affirming judgment of C. P. Lycoming Co., March T., 1900, No. 489, on judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto in case of Commonwealth to use of Leila D. Cowles v. The American Bonding Company.\nBefore Dean, Fell, Mestrezat, Potter and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from Superior Court. See Commonwealth v. American Bonding Co., 25 Pa. Superior Ct, 145.\nBeaver, J., filed the following opinion:\nThe legal effect of the bond given by the defendant in this case and its liability thereunder for the misapplication of funds arising from the sale of the real estate of the use plaintiff were fully passed upon in Commonwealth v. American Bonding & Trust Co., 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 570.\nLittle may be said in addition to what was said when the case was here on the question of the sufficiency of the affidavit, of defense. It was then alleged: \u201c That the defendant knew that the bond was to be used in an application for the sale of real estate and that the guardian was the agent of the defendant in presenting the bond to the court,\u201d which allegations were specifically denied in the affidavit of defense. These allegations and the denial thereof raised the question of fact necessary to be submitted to a jury.\nOn the trial of the case there was no evidence whatever which tended, either directly or indirectly, to charge the defendant with a knowledge of the use of the bond for any purpose other than shown in the application, which was \u201c for the faithful performance of trust, as guardian of Dora Leila Angle, minor child of Lavina O. Angle, deceased.\u201d The court was, therefore, justified in entering judgment for the defendant, non obstante veredicto. The re-examination of the authorities cited in our former opinion leaves no doubt in our minds as to the correctness of this conclusion.\nJudgment affirmed.\njError assigned was the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThomas M. B. Hicks, for appellant.\nSeth T. McCormick, for appellee.\nJune 22, 1905 :"
