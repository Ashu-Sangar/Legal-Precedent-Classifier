The value of their testimony was for the jury.\nThe fact that the land had never been plotted or put in the market for building lote, though it should have made the jury shy of that element of the damages claimed, did not of itself make its availability for that purpose inadmissible. Any present or proximate use to which land is likely to be put, though not by itself a criterion of damages, is an element in its value and may be shown as such. We have examined the evidence in the present case with care to see if the jury were allowed to estimate the damages on a separate basis of the injury to plaintiff\u2019s land as building lots. But we do not find that they were permitted by the charge to go beyond the consideration of such use only as one of the elements of value. To that extent they were entitled to go : Reiber v. Butler, etc., R. R. Co., 201 Pa. 49; Gearhart v. Clear Spring Water Co., 202 Pa. 292. The verdict appears to us grossly excessive, but as that is a matter of which the court below was in better position to judge than we can be, we should not be justified in interfering with the judgment on this gz-ound.\nJudgment affirzned.",

Lehigh Valley Coal Company, Appellant.\nTrespass\u2014Damages to land\u2014Elements of damages\u2014Evidence.\nIn an action of trespass to recover damages for injuries to land caused by flooding, the'trial court commits no error in permitting witnesses for plaintiff to testify as to the value of the land, where it appears that such witnesses have knowledge of value of lands in the vicinity, and particular knowledge of the land in question, of the damage which it sustained, and of its availability for building purposes.\nThe fact that such land had never been plotted, or put in the market for building lots, although it should make the jury shy of that element of the damages claimed, does not of itself make its availability for that purpose inadmissible. Any present or proximate use to which land is likely to be put, though not by itself a criterion of damages, is an element of its value, and may be shown as such.\nArgued April 11, 1905.\nAppeal, No. 269, Jan.
