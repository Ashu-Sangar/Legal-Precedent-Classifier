Truby, 145 Pa. 540.\nBut even if that rule of construction should not be invoked and the plaintiff surviving her husband should die without having other children, so that the devise over should still be held effective, plaintiff under it, by the death of her grandmother, has now a vested remainder in fee. Her deed, therefore, will pass her present estate, whatever it be, and a remainder in fee, to the grantee.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Held, that she had an estate in fee simple and could make a good marketable title.\nArgued May 15, 1905.\nAppeal, No. 131, Jan. T., 1905, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Lancaster Co., April T., 1905, No. 11, on case stated to determine marketable title to real estate in case of Elizabeth B. Cooper v. Jere M. Leaman.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Potter and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to determine marketable title to real estate.\nBy the terms of the case stated it appeared that Harriet Brandt died on June 13,1904, leaving a last will and testament, dated January 9,1878, in which she provided, inter alia, as follows : \u201c I give, bequeath and devise all my estate, real and personal, which I may die seized and possessed of, to my only daughter, Lizzie Shearer, and to her heirs ; and, in the event of my daughter, Lizzie Shearer, should die single, unmarried and without issue, it is my will, and I do hereby give and bequeath and devise all my said estate, real and personal, as aforesaid, to my dear beloved mother, and to her heirs.\u201d Mary Brandt, who was the mother of Harriet Brandt, died before the daughter, leaving no other heir, and Lizzie Shearer, who is the plaintiff, was married November 26, 1895, to Amos Cooper, and she had two children, both of whom, however, died prior to the death of testatrix.\nThe plaintiff agreed, in consideration of the sum of $1,600, to convey to the defendant, in fee simple, a lot of ground, and tendered him a deed of conveyance and demanded the purchase money, but he refused to accept the said deed, alleging that the title was defective, in that the will of Harriet Brandt only vested in her a life estate.\nThe court in an opinion by Landis, P. J., entered judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in entering judgment for plaintiff.\nW. II. Hensel, for appellant.\nNo paper-book or appearance for appellee.\nJune 22, 1905 :"
