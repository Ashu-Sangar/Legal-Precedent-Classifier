      <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>Rather, two recent opinions of our court are compelling in establishing the close identity of Authority with the Commonwealth. In <em>Anderson Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/408/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="408 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="1308403" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0179-01">408 Pa. 179</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20514" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="182 A.2d 514">182 A. 2d 514</a> (1962), we determined that the Delaware River Port Authority bore such close identity to the Commonwealth that it was immune from liability for consequential damages resulting from the construction of a bridge facility. Earlier this year, in <em>Rader v. Pennsylvania Turnpike </em>Commission, <a href="/pa/407/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="407 Pa. 609" data-case-ids="1307366" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0609-01">407 Pa. 609</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20199" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="182 A.2d 199">182 A. 2d 199</a> (1962), we held that the Turnpike Commission was not subject to tort liability resulting from the negligence of its agents and employees. In both cases, the decisional point was relationship of these agencies to the Commonwealth. In each, we determined that in performing the functions at issue in the litigation, these agencies were in essence the “alter ego” of the Commonwealth. The same principle is equally applicable here.</p>
    <p id="b229-3" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[180,1339,1152,1025]],["BL_230.1",230,[240,356,1166,1403]]]'>As stated in appellee’s brief, “As a practical matter the Commonwealth and the Authority are one and the same insofar as highway construction work under joint contracts is involved. The Authority is nothing more than a vehicle to facilitate financing of State highway projects.” This is clearly borne out by an examination of the Act of 1949 which indicates, inter alia that: (1) The Secretary of Highways serves as a member of this “body corporate and politic constituting a public corporation and governmental instrumentality.” (36 PS §3603) ; (2) among the powers granted Authority are the ability to (a) lease property and projects to or from the Department of Highways and the Commonwealth, “at a nominal rental or at such annual rental as may be determined”; (b) “to sell, transfer or convey to the Commonwealth . . . any project.” (36 PS §3604); (3) Authority and Department of Highways are authorized to enter into agreements for mutual cooperation between them in use of employees, <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>equipment and services incidental to the construction, maintenance and operation of projects. (36 PS §3605); (4) the Department of Revenue is empowered to make periodic audits of the books of Authority; (36 PS §3609); (5) the Department of Highways can “grant, assign and convey to the Authority, with or without consideration” any lands or interests in lands, together with the improvements thereon, owned by the Commonwealth. (36 PS §3610); (6) the Department is empowered to utilize its powers of eminent domain to acquire lands for Authority (36 PS §3612) and lastly, the property of Authority and the bonds issued by it are tax exempt (36 PS §3617). The provision granting this exemption is revealing. In pertinent part, it reads: <em>"The effectuation of the authorized purposes of the Authority created under this act shall and will be in all respects for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth, </em>for the increase of their commerce and prosperity, and for the improvement of their health and living conditions, and since the <em>Authority will be performing essential governmental functions in effectuating such </em>purposes, the Authority shall not be required to pay any taxes upon any property acquired or used by it for such purposes, and the bonds issued by Authority . . . shall at all times be free from taxation. . . .” (Emphasis supplied) (36 PS §3617).</p>

It is not only a creature of the Commonwealth but acts as its arm and agent in carrying out its duties. Accordingly, it is entitled to avail itself of privileges granted the Commonwealth and is subject to the same responsibilities. In establishing Authority with its intimate interrelationship with Department, the legislature clearly intended that it was to come within the meaning of the <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>“Commonwealtli” as used in the Act of 1937 (72 PS §§4651-1, 4651-4) and to be subject to the jurisdiction of Board.</p>
    <p id="b231-3" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[163,515,1150,1131]]]'>Having so decided, it is unnecessary for us to discuss in detail appellee’s contention that even were Authority not subject to Board’s jurisdiction, it would be obligated under established principles of contract law and common law arbitration to honor the award made by Board. We feel constrained to note, however, that such a position is invalid. The jurisdiction of Board is clearly restricted to claims arising out of contracts involving the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities. Parties cannot by consent or by failure to object confer jurisdiction over the subject matter of a dispute to Board absent the necessary statutory authorization. As we stated in <em>Bluestone v. DeRoy, </em><a href="/pa/298/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="298 Pa. 267" data-case-ids="1120328" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0267-01">298 Pa. 267</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20A.%20110" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="148 A. 110">148 Atl. 110</a> (1929), “‘[i]t is not within the power of litigants to invest a court with any jurisdiction or power not conferred on if by law, and accordingly it is well established as a general rule that where the court has not jurisdiction of the cause of action or subject-matter involved in a particular case, such jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent, agreement or waiver.’ ” (<a href="/pa/298/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="298 Pa. 267" data-case-ids="1120328" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0267-01">298 Pa. at 271</a>).</p>
