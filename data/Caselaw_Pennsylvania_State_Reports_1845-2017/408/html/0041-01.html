In 1943 decedent, Eva Gold (an unmarried sister) and Walter Gold (an unmarried brother) lived together in Llanerch, Pa. Walter Gold had been engaged in business but, due to ill health, for a number of years he was unable to manage his business and the decedent, under a power of attorney, ran the business for him. Eva Gold kept house for Walter Gold and the decedent and Carrie Brown — one of the two residuary legatees— acted as a part-time domestic in the Gold household. Clifford Gold and Howard Gold, decedent’s other brothers, were employees in Walter Gold’s business. In August 1943 Attorney Harvey drew wills for Walter Gold, Eva Gold and decedent. When Eva Gold died she left her estate equally to Walter Gold and decedent. Thereafter, in June 1949, Walter Gold died leaving a gross estate of approximately $119,000, and, under his will, his estate was given to decedent as the sole surviving legatee, his will specifically excluding Clifford and Howard Gold from taking any portion of the estate. After confirmation of the account in that estate by the Orphans’ Court of Delaware County, Clifford Gold and Howard Gold threatened to contest the' will and that threatened contest was settled by the payment of $10,000 each to Clifford and Howard Gold by decedent. In letters enclosing these checks to the lawyers for Clifford and Howard Gold, Attorney Harvey <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>relayed decedent’s instructions: “she does not want them to make any attempt to get in touch with her in the future or to have anything to do with her in the future”. <em>On that same day </em>decedent executed a will which stated, inter alia: “I leave nothing to . . . Howard W. Gold and Clifford A. Gold for the reason they deserve nothing and have today extracted from me money to which they are not entitled in settlement of a contemplated contest of the will of my dear brother, Walter C. Gold”. Sometime thereafter Clifford Gold wrote several letters to the decedent which she returned unopened. It is clear beyond any question that decedent at the time of her death was not, and for many years had not been in good terms with either Howard or Clifford Gold and the hitters’ families were strangers to her.</p>

Hearings were held before the Register of Wills of Delaware County at which voluminous testimony was presented and on April 19, 1960 the Register admitted the will to probate. From the probate of the will an appeal was taken to the Orphans’ Court of Delaware County. Counsel then stipulated that the testimony and exhibits produced before the Register should constitute the record upon which the Orphans’ Court should decide whether to grant an issue d.v.n. on the question of testamentary capacity and undue influence. On July 13, 1961, the Orphans’ Court of Delaware County upheld the probate of the will and refused to grant an issue d.v.n. on testamentary capacity and undue influence.

On November 6, 1959 he saw decedent and, thereafter, he saw her every two or three days and, as she improved, every three or four days at the Bishop Home. Dr. Wentz stated that up until the latter part of December, 1959, decedent’s mental condition was “very clear”, that she knew him and was able to intelligently converse with him. Particularly significant is this portion of Dr. Wentz’s testimony: “Miss Gold’s mental condition was quite good, she spoke intelligently at all times; she was a woman of very, very strong opinions, and she expressed herself as to her likes and dislikes very frankly, and in my opinion she was entirely clear mentally, both shortly before and for sometime after November 4th, I would say right up until the final couple days of her life, she was very clear mentally.

Did this heart condition and this edema, in your opinion, in any way, affect the mental processes of Miss Gold during the time she was in the <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>.hospital and .up until late December of 1959?

Yes.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Under Dr. Wentz’s testimony it is clear that, even though he did not . see decedent on the date the will was executed, in his opinion, decedent on that date and until at least the latter part of December, 1959 possessed testamentary capacity and was neither mentally infirm nor weak.</p>

No, I don’t think I could say that; I think a person of this age, her physical condition was consistent with the 82 years of age. I think she was fairly well preserved for a person of that age”. Dr. Kavjian stated that in 1948 decedent had hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic cystitis and poor eyesight which necessitated that she wear very thick glasses. During 1959 he received an emergency cull to see decedent and she was then “suffering from shortness of breath, swelling of the ankles, she had vomited, her color was somewhat cyanotic, bluish, and felt at that time that she had a failing heart” but that during the summer of 1959 she “improved considerably”. He further stated that in 1959 she suffered from “advanced general arteriosclerosis”.

She acknowledged that the relationship between decedent and herself was broken off in October, 1955 by the latter who said “I just don’t want anything more to do with you”.

Contrasted to this evidence is the strong testimony of the subscribing witnesses, the attending physician, the supervisor at the Home and decedent’s fellow guest at the Brookwood Home, all of which testimony clearly and unequivocally indicates that at the time of execution of the will or within a period shortly before and after the time of execution of the will decedent possessed testamentary capacity and had no mental infirmities.

    <p id="b83-5" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[169,799,1150,859]]]'>Furthermore, the record indicates that, on the evening of November 4, 1959 at the Bishop Nursing Home, decedent indicated that she desired to change her will and gave Attorney Harvey certain instructions of which he made a memorandum; that Attorney Harvey then went to Attorney Bowden, acquainted him with decedent’s instructions and Attorney Bowden the next day prepared the will in accordance with the instructions given him by Attorney Harvey; that he turned the finished will over to Attorney Harvey who that evening took it to the Bishop Home for execution. For all practical purposes, Attorney Harvey, not Attorney Bowden, prepared this will. However, all these facts did not place upon Attorney Harvey the burden of proving a lack of undue influence, in the absence of proof of a weakened intellect on decedent’s part.</p>
    <p id="b83-6" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[167,1669,1150,536]]]'>Appellants urge that Carrie Brown, legatee of two-fifths of decedent’s estate, likewise had the same burden. With that we cannot agree. While Carrie Brown did occupy a confidential relationship to the decedent, there is no evidence of a weakened intellect on the part of the decedent nor is there any evidence whatsoever that Carrie Brown even knew of, let alone participated in, the making of the will. Under such circumstances, there was no burden upon Carrie Brown to prove a lack of undue influence.</p>

Suffice it to state that we have been unable to find any evidence whatsoever of any undue influence exerted by anyone, particularly Attorney Harvey and Carrie Brown, upon the decedent to make the will in the manner in which it was made. On the contrary, the record clearly indicates that this will was an expression of that which decedent of her own volition and free will sought to accomplish in the post mortem disposition of her estate.</p>

Decedent told Attorney Harvey that he was to receive 2/3’s and Carrie Brown 1/3 of the residuary estate. In relaying this instruction to Attorney Bowden, he told him “that Miss Gold means that my full share of the estate will amount to 2/3s of the estate, and she always included in what I should receive my commission as executor. Now I believe, that what she meant was that I would get about 3/5s and Carrie 2/5s and we better write it out that way because I want to make sure I do what Miss Gold wants.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Attorney Harvey testified that, when he returned to the Bishop Home on the evening of November 5, 1959 with the prepared will, he said to the decedent: “. . . Last night you told me that you wanted me to have two-thirds and Carrie one-third. I said when I first wrote your will after Walter died, you said you weren’t making a bequest to me because I should have my commissions. I figured it out that 3/5s plus my commissions would give me almost the equivalent of 2/3s of your estate, is that the <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>way you want it. . . . <em>She said something commendable and she said, that is just the way I want </em>it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Then I read about the executor and she just nodded her head.” Appellants argue that this is “a concrete, expressed, overt act of undue influence”, and “also a fraud” and an example “of a beneficiary soliciting a change of the mind of the decedent”. To that argument there is no merit. If the uncontradicted testimony is to be believed the instructions were changed and the will prepared to conform to the change, but the will was not executed until after the change had been fully explained and assented to by decedent. There is nothing to suggest any coercion or restraint by Attorney Harvey upon decedent in effecting this change.</p>

The decedent, as the result of the will contest threatened by her brothers, Howard and Clifford Gold, and finally settled, disassociated herself from and irrevocably cut off relations with not only her brothers but with members of her brothers’ families. Neither brother had seen decedent for almost ten years before her death and the nephew and the niece had never seen the decedent. On the other hand, the record is abundantly clear that for many years Attorney Harvey and Carrie Brown were the only persons genuinely interested in decedent’s welfare, such interest being evidenced by visits, ministrations and in various other ways. The logical persons to be the primary objects of decedent’s bounty under the circumstances were Attorney Harvey and Carrie Brown, the two residuary legatees.</p>
