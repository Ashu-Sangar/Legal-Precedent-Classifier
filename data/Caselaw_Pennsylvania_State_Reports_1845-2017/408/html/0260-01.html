      <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>Viewing the ordinance in this light, it is our conclusion that the use proposed of the land in question is proper and permitted under Section 501 (2) thereof. Clearly, the word “agriculture” therein does not mean only the tilling of the soil. The raising and housing of turkeys is well within the reasonable meaning of the term. It is significant that the term “agriculture” was used and not “farming,” which might well impose a far different connotation. This was, undoubtedly, done with deliberate purpose. Also, the words “business incidental to the processing and marketing of farm products” are influential. No restrictions were attached and the meaning intended, therefore, must be all inclusive and comprehensive.</p>
    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[255,1115,1159,797]]]'>Nor are we convinced that because this agricultural venture includes a large-scale commercial activity that it is precluded under Section 502(2). This section restricts itself to the conduct of certain specified commercial pursuits except under defined conditions. It was not intended to entail an agricultural business. Further, the number of turkeys to be raised and housed on the property is no more controlling than the number of cattle on a dairy farm would be if such an application were involved. Likewise, the fact that only a relatively small quantity of the necessary feed will be cultivated on the property is not conclusive. If this concept were correct, an ordinary dairy farm would be precluded if it purchased the necessary needs of the stock from outside sources.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[251,1932,1157,478]]]'>Finally, the argument asserted that the general provision of the ordinance as to “Prohibited Uses” (Section 806) forbids the agricultural enterprise involved is not persuasive. This provides: “No lot or parcel of land shall be used for the following purposes: . . . (d) Any trade, industry or business that is noxious or offensive by.reason of odor, dust, gas smoke, vibration, illumination, or noise, or that constitutes a public hazard whether by fire, explosion or otherwise.”</p>
