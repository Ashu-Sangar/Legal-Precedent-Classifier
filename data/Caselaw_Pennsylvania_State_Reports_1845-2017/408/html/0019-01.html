These survivors together with Harry J. Alker, Jr., Esq. were named as executors under the will and letters testamentary were issued to them on September 27, 1955. Some time later, the widow, A. Virginia Taulane, having become incompetent, the Liberty Real Estate Bank and Trust Company of Philadelphia was appointed as her guardian and she was removed as an executor of this estate.</p>

Alker then resigned as executor on February 17, 1959. On March 23, 1959 Alker represented by three counsel, filed an account as a co-execntor. This account provided for the payment of a $7500 counsel fee to Attorneys Frank Truscott, W. B. Allen and Leon H. Fox, counsel for Alker, for <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>services rendered in the preparation and filing of the account of Alker as executor. Helen T. Webster and Joseph H. Taulane filed objections to the payment of such counsel fee.

In my opinion they have succeeded ... in stating an account which as closely as possible approximates the actual administration of this estate. I think they are to be commended for their efforts in an estate which all parties agree Avas a ‘real hodge-podge — a real mess’.” The court below further found that these counsel “did render valuable and beneficial legal services for which they are entitled to reasonable compensation” and, in the exercise of its discretion, reduced the requested amount of counsel fee from $7500 to $4,000. Under the circumstances it cannot be found that the court below palpably erred. Our independent examination of this record indicates that the court below acted neither arbitrarily nor in a manner inconsistent with the eAddence before it. Absent any palpable error the discretion and judgment of the court below must stand.</p>
