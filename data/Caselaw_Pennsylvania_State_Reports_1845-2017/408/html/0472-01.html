    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[266,799,1156,587]]]'>The policy was originally issued on December 8, 1927, naming the plaintiff, the insured’s uncle, as beneficiary. It inadvertently stated that the insured’s date of birth was September 23, 1905, whereas in fact, it was September 23, 1903. In 1930, the insured married. On January 6, 1931, a change of beneficiary form was executed and filed with the company by the insured, naming his wife as beneficiary. The change of beneficiary was endorsed on page seven of the policy. The plaintiff’s name, as the beneficiary originally named, remained on page one thereof.</p>
    <p id="b506-6" data-blocks='[["BL_506.6",506,[262,1396,1157,693]]]'>In the year of 1959, an agent of the company discovered the existence of the date of birth discrepancy, not only in the policy involved, but also in six other insurance policies carried on the insured’s life. He pointed out to the insured the possible financial consequences and difficulties in connection with the collection of the proceeds of the policies. He advised that the policy involved, and the six others, be returned promptly to the company for correction and adjustment. The insured agreed and personally handed over all of the insurance policies to the company’s agent for this sole and limited purpose. No change in beneficiary was discussed or requested.</p>
    <p id="b506-7" data-blocks='[["BL_506.7",506,[260,2102,1154,259]],["BL_507.1",507,[183,353,1146,262]]]'>The local office of the insurance company contacted the home office as to the necessary procedure to effectuate the correction and adjustment. The home office prepared and forwarded forms for signature by the insured. After execution, they were returned to the home <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>office, together with the policies and a copy of the insured’s birth certificate. These written forms requested only that the policy be corrected as to the date of birth stated therein. Nothing was said as to a change of beneficiary.</p>
    <p id="b507-3" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[180,627,1149,533]]]'>As a result, the company’s records were corrected and the company instead of correcting the date of birth and adjusting the principal sum due thereunder on the original policy, issued a substitute or new policy which was delivered to the insured on, or about, June 3, 1959. This policy was identical with the original policy except the date of birth was changed to conform with the correct facts, the principal sum was adjusted and the endorsement noting the change of the original beneficiary was omitted.</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[177,1172,1151,586]]]'>In addition, the office records of the company manifested that the last and only change in beneficiary requested by the insured was that of January 6, 1931, wherein the insured’s wife was named beneficiary. No written request was ever filed to change the name of the beneficiary from that of the wife. The terms of the policy provided, inter alia, “Every change of beneficiary must be made by written notice to the Company at its Home Office accompanied by the Policy for Indorsement of the change thereon by the Company, and unless so indorsed the change shall not take effect.”</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.6",507,[178,1771,1149,206]]]'>This evidence was legally sufficient to warrant the submission of the question of mutual mistake to the jury. The motion for judgment n.o.v. was, therefore, correctly overruled.</p>

This is without merit. The question of the validity of <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>the contract was not involved. If all of the elements necessary for the reformation of a written contract are present, mere negligent conduct on the part of one of the parties thereto in failing to discover the mistake will not bar reformation in the absence of prejudice or a violation of a positive legal duty. See, 3 Pomeroy’s Equity Jur. (5th ed.) §856b; Goldin, The Law of Insurance in Pennsylvania, Yol. 1 (2d ed.), §268; <em>Broida v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra.</p>

In such an action the company would be required to assume the burden of going forward and the burden of proof, and it would <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>also be required to produce a higher quality of evidence than it is required to produce to defend an action of assumpsit.
