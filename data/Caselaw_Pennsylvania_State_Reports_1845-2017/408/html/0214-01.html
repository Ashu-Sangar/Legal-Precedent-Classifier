It is clear that these investments are in some respects similar and in some respects dissimilar to the investments enumerated by testator. First of all, “similar public divisions” means <em>public divisions </em>similar to the public divisions enumerated by testator, viz., bonds of “municipalities, townships and school districts”. We think it is clear that testator meant political subdivisions<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">*</a> such as those specifically enumerated by the testator.</p>

Moreover, Testator did not even give his trustee power to invest in what at the time of his will or at the time of his death were legal investments under the law of Pennsylvania; on the contrary he limited his trustee to eer<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>tain specifically enumerated investments. He did not even authorize his trustee to invest in ground rents in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which, at the time of his death, were an authorized legal investment; on the contrary he authorized it to invest only in ground rents in Philadelphia. Although specifically authorizing investments in loans of municipalities, townships and school districts, he did not specifically authorize investments in loans of cities, counties or boroughs which were legal investments for a trustee at the time testator made his will. However, it is reasonable to conclude that it was these political subdivisions with their tax-raising power which he had in mind and intended in and by the words “similar public divisions in the State of Pennsylvania.” It is clear that the investment powers given to the trustee by this testator, so far as bonds of municipalities, townships, school districts and similar public divisions in the State of Pennsylvania are concerned, were the bonds of political subdivisions of Pennsylvania, all of which possessed the power of taxation and hence provided the maximum safety in this investment field which the testator desired and intended.</p>

      <em>Catherwood Trust </em>was handed down and filed by this Court on July 26, 1961. The present account was called for audit by the Orphans’ Court on June 1, 1959. The account included apportionments which took weeks of investigation and mathematical calculations in order to comply with the rules which were at that time applicable. The adjudication in the <em>Brown Estate </em>was handed down by the Orphans’ Court on <em>the day after Catherwood </em>was handed down by this Court. It is clear from an examination of the record and the opinion of the lower Court that it must have taken the Court a very considerable time to prepare its adjudication. There has been in Pennsylvania no uniform or universal understanding and interpretation of the word “audit”, and the practice of auditing and/or confirming an account differs widely. In Philadelphia County, for example, where no questions of fact or law are raised, an audit or hearing by the Court is informal and very short. It consists of a “hand-up” of papers in open Court at the time the estate is called for audit, accompanied or followed by a statement of counsel for the accountant: “no questions.” It has generally been considered that this is an audit. It is then followed by an adjudication which is signed by the judge. If objections are made or exceptions filed when the estate is called for audit, a definite time is fixed for a hearing before the auditing judge, at which time testimony may be presented and questions of law may be argued. Thereafter a decision, usually in the form of an adjudication, is made by the <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>auditing judge. In these contested cases (as well as in the cases where exceptions were not filed at the time the estate was originally called for audit) exceptions can thereafter be filed, in which event the case is orally argued before the Orphans’ Court en banc.</p>
    <p id="b263-4" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[178,620,1155,1073]]]'>In some counties no hearing sur an account is initially held by the Court, while in other counties an audit includes more than merely handing up to the Court a petition for distribution and appearance slips. In such instances, the Court refers to an auditor or subsequently examines the account which has, of course, been previously filed and advertised, and until the auditor’s report is approved or an adjudication handed down by the auditing judge, the audit is not considered complete. In <em>Ray’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/345/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="345 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1213359" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0210-01">345 Pa. 210</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.2d%20803" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="25 A.2d 803">25 A. 2d 803</a>, the Court said (p. 213) : “Prior to, and since, the Act, it has been common for executors and administrators to collect claims, pay debts and make distribution without accounting or audit. In some counties accounts are confirmed as of course if no exceptions are filed within specified periods; in others, formal confirmation by the court is pronounced on presentation of accounts to which no exceptions have been filed. Automatic confirmation pursuant to a rule of court is not an audit.”</p>

In the instant case, an account having been filed and a hearing or audit held, the Pennsylvania Rule of Apportionment would govern the distribution, even though the Court’s adjudication or decision was filed <em>subsequent to Catherwood.</em>
