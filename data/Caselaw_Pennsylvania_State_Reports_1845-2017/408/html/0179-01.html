In the course of its opinion, the Georgia Supreme Court stated: “[T]he operation of the Georgia Ports Authority <em>is action by the State for a public benefit. </em>The Ports Authority is a <em>creature of the </em>State, and in the operation of the docks, wharves, etc., it does so as the <em>instrumentality of the State </em>for governmental purposes as authorized by the Constitution.” (Emphasis supplied). <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>(<a href="/citations/?q=124%20S.E.2d%20733" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="124 S.E.2d 733">124 S.E. 2d at 736</a>).

IX, §4 of the Constitution of 1874. It is reasonable to conclude that absent the constitutional restriction the functions of these authorities and commissions would be carried out by the executive branches of the government. In regard to the delegated functions involved in this litigation, Authority is to all intents and purposes synonymous with the Commonwealth. Its programs are those of the Commonwealth and its operations are subject to minute scrutiny by the proper Commonwealth officials. With the exception of its borrowing capacity, Authority simulates the Commonwealth.</p>
