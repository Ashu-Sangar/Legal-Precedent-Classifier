L. 1145, as amended, 53 P.S. §6851,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the Act of 1947, June 20, <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>P.

    <p id="b401-4" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[197,395,1151,698]]]'>Under the authority of the above acts, the City of Pittsburgh and the school district, appellees herein, imposed deficiency Mercantile Tax assessments for the years 1953-1956 against appellant, Pillsbury Mills, Inc., for sales of its various flour products. These assessments were levied by the proper taxing authorities. Appellant claimed exemption from the taxes on the basis that it is a vendor of products of its own manufacture within the purview of the exemption provisions of the respective tax enabling acts. The County Court of Allegheny County found in favor of appellee taxing authorities and entered judgments in their favor. The propriety of these adjudications is presently before us.</p>

      <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>According to the uncontroverted evidence of appellant, the milling operation involved in the present-day conversion of wheat germ to flour is an intricate technologically sophisticated process. It involves the transformation of literally hundreds of types of wheat into flours which are especially prepared for purchasers with greatly differing needs. The milling operation includes the grinding, blending and processing of the many types of wheat into flours of varying characteristics which will be used for countless purposes. Present day milling bears no relationship to the mortar and pestle operation of ancient times.</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[263,1012,1157,469]]]'>By the application of the principles enunciated in the <em>Atlantic Refining Company Case, </em><a href="/pa/398/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="398 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1289146" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0030-01">398 Pa. 30</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20855" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="156 A.2d 855">156 A. 2d 855</a> (1959), wherein we held that the refining of oil constituted manufacturing, we now determine that sales by appellant of its various flour products produced within its mills constitutes the vending of products of appellant’s own manufacture within the meaning and scope of the exemption provisions contained in the above two acts.</p>
    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[260,1501,1156,423]]]'>As we stated in the <em>Atlantic </em>case, “Our only concern here is whether or not the legislature intended to exclude [a particular activity] from these taxes. The purpose of the exclusion is an economic one in that it provides that Pennsylvania manufacturers should not be burdened with an additional tax on their products since such products have to compete with products of other states in an open market.”</p>

The reference to the “milling of grain” in the <em>Armour </em>case was pure dicta mentioned in a tangential manner and is in no way controlling upon us here. Once again, common <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>usage and custom plus tbe reason for tbe manufacturing exception leads us to the only logical conclusion that “manufacturing” includes the “milling of flour” as contemplated by the legislature in enacting the Acts of 1947.</p>
