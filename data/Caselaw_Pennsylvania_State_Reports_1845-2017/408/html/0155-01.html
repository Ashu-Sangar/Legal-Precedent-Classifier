She had been driven to the game from her home, located in a small community approximately one mile from Irwin, in an automobile by her sister and the latter’s boy friend. Following the game, about 9:30 p.m., she went to a close-by soda shop (Isalys), where the defendant was a frequent customer. She was looking for her sister in order to obtain a ride home; not finding her sister in the soda shop, she phoned to her home to ascertain if the sister had arrived there. She then left her school friends and started to walk towards Main Street in Irwin in the direction of her home. This was the last occasion anyone saw her alive.</p>

A rape, if not perpetrated, had at least been attempted, she was severely beaten and the injuries to her body indicated that she had fought fiercely to keep her virginity from being violated. Her skirt had been removed and was found wedged underneath her body; her sweater was pulled up and was bunched underneath her chin; her brassiere was torn and was pulled down exposing her breasts.</p>

The <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>cause of death was a large subdural hemorrhage.

At about 1:15 p.m., he was placed in a lineup and, in the course thereof, a woman employee of the state police pointed a finger in his direction and said, “That’s the man.” From about one-thirty until four o’clock p.m., he was again questioned by the police. Following this, he was taken to the Westmoreland County Jail for rest and confinement.</p>
    <p id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[261,741,1162,1189]]]'>On Friday morning, May 22, he was interrogated by the police officers again, at the county jail, for about an hour. Shortly after one o’clock p.m., he was returned to the state police headquarters. <em>There, at his request, he was visited by an ordained missionary minister, one Mrs. Jennie Frazee. </em>The latter had become acquainted with the defendant about thirteen months before and saw him frequently thereafter at church meetings. She spent about four hours with him alone. <em>While they were alone, </em>he told Mrs. Frazee that he had killed the Cordon girl. She asked him if he wanted to confess to the police. When he indicated he did, she asked one of the state policemen to enter the room. The defendant immediately told the officer that he had killed Marcia Gail Cordon and he was glad to get it off his chest. Subsequently, an oral statement was given, then a written statement in question and answer form, and finally another oral detailed statement which was tape recorded. Later on, he was taken to the scene where the body was found and there reenacted in detail what had occurred on the unfortunate night of January 27, 1959.</p>

He identified a tire iron found in his automobile as the lethal weapon. He also identified the pair of gloves found near the scene as his personal property.</p>
    <p id="b191-3" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[176,663,1148,590]]]'>The defendant did not take the stand in his own defense at trial. He, therefore, did not deny his guilt, nor did he deny the truthfulness of the statements given to the police. There was no evidence that he was mistreated or abused in any degree during his incarceration. <em>There were no long and protracted periods of constant and continuous questioning. </em>On the contrary, there were long and ample periods of rest. He was warned on more than one occasion of his constitutional rights. When he made the statements, he appeared cool, relaxed and relieved.</p>
    <p id="b191-4" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[177,1263,1149,802]]]'>The defense complains that he was not fed substantial food and not fed regularly. The evidence belies this. They also complain that he was not showered and given fresh clothing during the two and one-half days of interrogation. A wash bowl was readily accessible during most of his confinement. The fact that he was not given hotel accommodations is readily understandable. It is asserted that the minister acted as a tool of the police to help wring and trick a confession of guilt out of the defendant. The circumstances do not warrant this conclusion. This was his friend and her presence was dictated by his own request. While they were alone, in the absence of the police, he admitted his guilt to her. There is no evidence of trickery or threats.</p>

While there were some discrepancies in the various statements as to the details of the occurrence, these were for the jury to consider, with all of the other circumstances, in evaluating the validity of the statements. Also, the fact that the defendant did not admit and tell the police everything he did in connection with the attempt to ravish the victim does not affect the admissibility of the statements as given.</p>

A confession which is the result of coercion is in law and in truth no confession at all. However, for coercion to exist, there must be an impairing or overpowering of the will.
