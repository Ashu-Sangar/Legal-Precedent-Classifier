    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.7",158,[266,779,1155,208]]]'>Article IX, §8 of our Constitution requires that the debt of a municipality should not exceed a certain percentage of the assessed valuation of the municipality.</p>
    <p id="b158-7" data-blocks='[["BL_158.8",158,[261,997,1157,581]]]'>By the Act of 1961, the legislature sought to require that the assessed valuation be obtained in a certain manner and if not so obtained, then the market values established by the State Tax Equalization Board were to be used in determining the amount of debt which a municipality could incur. There is no constitutional grant that permits the market valuation as determined by the State Tax Equalization Board to be used; hence, an act utilizing such market valuation as the base in the creation of a municipal debt limit is unconstitutional.</p>
