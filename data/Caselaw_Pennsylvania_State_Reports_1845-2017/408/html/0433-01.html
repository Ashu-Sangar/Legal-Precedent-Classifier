Conversely, if the improvements were wisely made, it is possible that land having a fair market value of $1,000 to which $2,000 of improvements had been added, might have an enhanced fair market value of $3,500 or $4,000. Thus, it can readily be seen that an addition of the so-called fair market value of the component parts may not add up to the fair market value of the total property.</p>

    <p id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[248,1286,1163,1017]]]'>The unimproved land might have a fair market value of $1,000; the actual cost of the building might be $1,000; and the fair market value of the entire property might be $2500. If it were stipulated by the parties that the value of the building was $1,000, that amount would be subtracted from the fair market value of $2500, and the contest would concern only the $1500 assessment of the land. It might be clearly demonstrable by the party contesting the assessment that the fair market value of the land is only $1,000. The party would then contend, therefore, that the total assessment of the property for $2500 is excessive and does not represent the “true” fair market value of $2,000 which the contestant arrives at by adding $1,000 for the fair market value of the land, and $1,000 for the improvements. Thus, by a deceptively simple process, a taxpayer can distort in his favor the true fair market value of the property or the taxing authority might also do the same.</p>

This is not a novel proposition in the law of this Commonwealth. In the <em>Buhl </em>case, we held that the depreciated reproduction cost of the building had no probative value for any purpose in fixing the fair market value of improved real estate for tax purposes. The reason is clear. Reproduction cost new less depreciation has no relationship to the fair market value. Separated from the land, the building has no market value beyond salvage which in most cases does not compensate for the cost of removal.</p>
