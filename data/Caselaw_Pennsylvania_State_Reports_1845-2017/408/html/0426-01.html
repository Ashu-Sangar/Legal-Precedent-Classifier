The second floor of the building was occupied by a clothing merchant, Engel, Inc., which continued its operations during the remodeling.

Upon being sued by Engel, appellant forwarded the complaint to appellee, which denied coverage and refused to defend. Appellant engaged counsel and the matter came to trial, resulting, after 3% weeks of trial, in a jury disagreement. Subsequently, the parties compromised their differences and appellant paid to Engel, as his share of the settlement, $600. To recover this sum, as well as $7,500 in legal fees for defense of Engel’s action against <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>liim, appellant sued appellee in assumpsit, alleging a breach by appellee of its duty to defend the action brought by Engel against appellant.</p>

Appellant’s reply to new matter denied that the claim was beyond the purview of the policy and appellee moved for judgment on the pleadings.

Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, 178 U. 2d 750 (C.A. 2, 1949) an insured brought suit on a policy of liability insurance. The complaint was in two counts, the first seeking relief for a judgment which plaintiff was forced to pay to an injured party and the second seeking his costs in defending that suit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, speaking through Judge Learned Hand, held that the insurer was not obligated to pay the amount of the judgment recovered against the insured as the recovery was not one within the coverage of the policy. However, the Court went on to grant the insured his costs of defending that suit. The insurance policy in that case, as in this one, required the insurance company to defend only those claims covered by the policy. The court said, that so long as the complaint filed by the injured party covered an injury which ‘might or might not’ fall within the coverage of the policy the insurance company was obliged to defend. In the course of the opinion they said: *. . . the injured party might conceivably recover on a claim, which, as he had alleged it, was outside the policy; but which, as it turned out, the insurer was bound to pay. Such is the plasticity of modern pleading that no one can be positive that that could not happen. In such a case of course the insurer would not have to defend; yet, even then, as soon as, during the course of the trial, the changed character of the claim appeared, we need not say that the insured might not insist that the insurer take over the defence. When, however, as here, <em>the complaint comprehends an injury which may he within the policy, we hold that the promise to defend includes it”</em>

The ultimate question to be decided, therefore, is whether Engel, in its original suit against Casper, pleaded any facts alleging injury to itself, at the hands of Casper, caused by accident.</p>

In denying plaintiff recovery the Superior Court states, on page 362: ‘The word “accident” is not defined in the policy, and the term must therefore be interpreted in its usual, .ordinary and popular sense. “Webster has defined it as ‘an event that takes place without one’s foresight or expectation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event; chance; contingency’. Many courts.have quoted this-definition, and some have added to or embellished it, but in reality few have improved upon it:” Lacy v.

Ed. 60</a>, where it was said that an “accident” within the meaning of an insurance policy is an event “happening by chance unexpectedly taking place not according to the usual course of things or not as expected.” It seems clear that an accident is the antithesis of something likely to occur, foreseeable in due course. If an occurrence is the ordinary and expected result of the performance of an operation, then it cannot be termed an accident. To constitute an accident, the occurrence must be an “unusual or unexpected result attending the operation or performance of a usual or necessary act or event:” Hey v.

[page 364] While there are no Pennsylvania cases directly in point, our view is in accord with that in other jurisdictions. In Kuckenberg v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., <a href="/f2d/226/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="226 F.2d 225" data-case-ids="347976" data-case-paths="/f2d/226/0225-01">226 F. 2d 225</a>, plaintiff was required to do a large amount of blasting during the construction of a highway. The blasting operations caused debris to slide down upon the tracks of the Southern Pacific Railroad, causing considerable damage. Plaintiff anticipated that damage would occur and took steps to avoid the loss, including the covering of the tracks with thick layers of dirt. In denying recovery, it was held that the damage inflicted “was the reasonably anticipated, ordinary, and expected result,” and was not caused by accident. In reaching this conclusion the court said: “It is true that courts construing insurance contracts have differed in judgment whether the fact that the responsible cause is an intentional act sufficies in itself to preclude the resulting injury from being ‘accidental’ damage . . . But if, in addition to being intentional, the harmful conduct is reasonably calculated to cause substantial damage of the very sort that occurs, all courts seem to <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>recognize that the damage is outside of the insured risk.” See also Neale Construction Co. v.
