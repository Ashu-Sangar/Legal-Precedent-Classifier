Hence, he does not vacate either his office of president of council or as councilman. Indeed, should he cease to be a councilman, or president of Council, he would no longer be authorized to act as mayor. This conclusion is clearly required by the last part of Section 3-500 providing that “if the President of the Council should resign or be unable to act, then the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Council shall act as Mayor.”</p>

However, Tate’s status is not determined by any test other than that set out in the city charter which clearly defines his status to be that of acting mayor.

Respondent apparently further contends that because of the word “may”, the President of City Council may, we repeat, call a Special election three years later or at any time he desires. A reasonable construction of these words, especially when considered together with the entire Charter, would not give the President of City Council the discretion to postpone this special election for a period of two years, or at his discretion at any time in the third year he desires; a reasonable construction requires that the special election must be held this year. It follows that the President of City Council had the discretion to call an election to fill the vacancy in the May Primary of 1962 or in the November General Election of 1962. Irrespective of whether Tate is Mayor or acting Mayor, the President of City Council, having failed to call for an election to fill the vacancy in the next Primary, i.e., in May, no longer has any discretion but merely a ministerial duty of calling a special election at the <em>next </em>regular election, to wit, November 6, 1962; and his act, being merely ministerial, mandamus will lie.</p>
