This is not correct. First, the plaintiff mistakenly plead that the innuendo was necessary. Hoavever, this is a conclusion and may be disregarded as <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>surplusage, if the words are defamatory in themselves. See, 17 R.C.L. Libel and Slander §162, 53 C.J.S. Libel and Slander §164 et seq. Secondly, most important and crucial, the words are defamatory on their face. Clearly, the characteristics and dishonest conduct imputed in the advertisement need no extrinsic proof of explanation. In short, the words in themselves are defamatory and import the serious sense attributed to them. In such a case, general damages for loss of personal or business reputation are recoverable and no averments or proof of special damages are necessary. See, <em>McIntyre v. Weinert, </em><a href="/pa/195/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="195 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="914067" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0052-01">195 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20A.%20666" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="45 A. 666">45 A. 666</a> (1900); <em>Montgomery v.

    <p id="b349-4" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[237,1182,1150,424]]]'>The fact that the plaintiff is not specifically named in the advertisement is not controlling.
