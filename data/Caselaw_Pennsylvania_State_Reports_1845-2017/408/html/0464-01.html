Upon its petition to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, a board of viewers was appointed to ascertain the costs, damages, and expenses and to assess the benefits of the sanitary sewer system against the properties benefited, improved or accommodated by it. The board, in due course, filed its report assessing 93 properties, identified as V-l, to V-93, for the cost of the improvement.</p>
    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[258,842,1157,533]]]'>Seven of the assessed property owners appealed the report of the viewers to the court of common pleas, on the theory that three parcels of land served by the improvement had not been assessed and that their, the appellants’, proportionate shares of the cost had thereby been increased. The court of common pleas affirmed the action of the board of viewers and one of the property owners appeals to this Court the order of the court below which confirmed the viewers’ report.</p>

There is ample evidence to support the conclusion that the three properties are beyond the boundaries of the sewer district and that they were not intended to, nor did they actually benefit from the improvement. That conclusion was reached by the viewers and by the court below; we cannot and will not disturb it on appeal. This then should conclude our opinion, for if the three properties are not within the sewer district, they could not have been assessed and the <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>court below was correct in so holding.

Section 2 of the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945 (53 P.S. §302(a)), defines the term “Authority” as meaning “a body politic and corporate, created pursuant to this act or pursuant to the ‘Municipality Authorities Act of 1935’ repealed hereby.” It has been consistently held in cases in point, both under the Municipality Authorities Act of 1935 and 1945 and under other legislation involving authorities that an authority is not the creature, agent or representative of the municipality organizing it. In <em>Tranter v. Allegheny County Authority, </em><a href="/pa/316/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="316 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1158989" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0065-01">316 Pa. 65</a>, 79, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20289" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="173 A. 289">173 A. 289</a> (1934), this Court refers to the Authority “as the agent created for the purpose <em>by the State” </em>(emphasis supplied), notwithstanding the fact that under the Second Class County Authority Act the Authority therein provided for would not come into being until the county commissioners so declared. <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>In <em>Williams v. Samuel, </em><a href="/pa/332/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="332 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="1186619" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0265-01">332 Pa. 265</a>, 277, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20834" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 A.2d 834">2 A. 2d 834</a> (1938), this Court commented that as to an Authority “the state can authorize its creature, the City, to transfer its sewer system to the Authority <em>created by the State.” </em>(Emphasis supplied). In <em>Lighton v. Abington Township, </em><a href="/pa/336/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="336 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1195576" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0345-01">336 Pa. 345</a>, 353, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20609" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 A.2d 609">9 A. 2d 609</a> (1939), this Court stated that: “In the Tranter case, . . . the State authorized the creation of a public corporation, the Allegheny County Authority, and required its agent, the county, upon the creation of the Authority, to transfer to the Authority certain property for purposes which were within the jurisdiction of the State. On the same theory the incorporation of Municipal Authorities has been supported. They are public corporations, being corporate agencies engaged in the administration of civil government. The <em>state </em>may modify the part performed by <em>its </em>agencies in government <em>by creating other agencies, </em>subject always to constitutional limitations. If there is any resemblance between (1) the exercise of the power of the state to modify township government by taking part of it from the township and <em>vesting </em>it in a <em>public corporation </em>and (2) by statute, authorizing the municipality to make a contract with a private corporation to take over and operate public property, the fact remains that the state may do the first but is expressly prohibited from doing the second.” (Emphasis supplied). In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. McCreary v. Major, </em><a href="/pa/343/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="343 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1208313" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0355-01">343 Pa. 355</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.2d%20686" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="22 A.2d 686">22 A. 2d 686</a> (1941), it was held that a member of a board of a Municipal Authority created under the Act of 1935 was a public official by reason of the fact that such entity is an independent agency of the Commonwealth and part of the sovereignty of the State. Similarly, in <em>Evans v. West Norriton Township Municipal Authority, </em><a href="/pa/370/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="370 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1234553" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0150-01">370 Pa. 150</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20474" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="87 A.2d 474">87 A. 2d 474</a> (1952), Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Bell of this Court stated at page 154 that: “A Municipal Authority is defined by the Act as <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>‘a body politic and corporate’. Its members are appointed by elected public officials. It receives a charter from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania <em>which grants it certain characteristic attributes </em>of a corporation. It is authorized by law and by its charter to perform vast private as well as certain limited public functions.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

This should be apparent to all having familiarity with Municipality Authorities established in this State, since many exercise certain powers and perform certain functions both within and without the municipal limits of the incorporating municipality, within certain constitutional and statutory limitations, and rightly so. It is the very nature of many of the various purposes set forth in the Municipality Authorities Act that dictate such a course if Authorities are to accomplish the purposes intended under the Act in an efficient and economical manner and for the benefit and health of all the people of this Commonwealth.</p>

This Court held that the Act, more particularly subsection (s) aforementioned, was not a violation of the constitutional provision since it did not delegate the unlimited power to levy taxes to an Authority inasmuch as the basis for the assessments (the plan of construction and the estimated costs thereof) to be valid, must have been approved by the elected municipal officials.
