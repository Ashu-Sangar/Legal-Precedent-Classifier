Such adherence to the conduct fully expected of every counsel for an estate justifies commendation but it does not justify an unfair or unjust fee. That the original fee claimed by Mr. Rubin in the amount of $28,200 was exorbitant is <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>clear beyond any question and the court bel ow very properly rejected the amount of the fee claimed.

On this memorandum were noted letters written, conferences, phone calls, etc., all purporting to show that Mr. Rubin spent between 1500 and 2000 hours in the settlement of this estate. In respect to this we are in full agreement with the statement of the court below: “. . . this court gave much consideration to the inexperience of counsel in setting the fee. The following language is used . . . [in the] adjudication. <em>‘A </em>more experienced attorney could have accomplished a similar result in much less time. The hours spent by Mr. Rubin therefore have not overimpressed the court on setting the fee but the court commends Mr. Rubin for his diligence and industry! ' The evidence indicates that Mr. Rubin spent much time conferring with other attorneys seeking' advice which would have been unnecessary to a more. experienced attorney. For this reason, this court refused to place very much weight on the testimony of Mr. Rubin to the effect that he spent between 1500 and 2000 hours in administering the estate.

So far as decedent’s realty was concerned it appears that Mr. Rubin performed duties which would ordinarily be performed by the personal representative, rather than the counsel* of an estate and that he collected the. <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>rents, arranged for maintenance and repair and generally managed the realty. While he did make some efforts to sell the realty, such efforts, as reflected by the record, were not as effective as they might have been. At the time of decedent’s death he had employed Joseph K. Fornance, Esq. to handle a claim against the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and in that proceeding a board of view made an award to decedent of $40,800 which had been reduced on appeal by the Commission to $35,000. This matter was being handled by competent counsel, chosen by the decedent, and it is very difficult to understand the necessity for Mr. Rubin to consult with “specialists in the condemnation field to determine the best course of action in regard to this matter” as he claims to have done. The closing of the bank accounts and the sale of the U. S. savings bonds presented no unusual or extraordinary problem and are matters common in the settlement of most estates. As to the scrap business it appears that, largely through Mr. Rubin’s efforts, a sale was effected for $25,090, “a highly beneficial result” as the court below termed it. Outside of the scrap business sale and perhaps the preparation of an opinion in construction of the will, <em>our </em>scrutiny of this record reveals nothing in the services rendered or the problems involved of such unusual nature as to justify an unusually high fee.</p>

However, in the case at bar, insofar as the services rendered and other factors in fixing compensation are concerned, no question of credibility arises; assuming that Mr. Rubin did all that he stated he did and that the settlement of the estate involved all the problems outlined by him, what is the fair amount of the fee to which he is entitled? In fixing a fee for counsel for an estate certain factors must be considered: the services rendered, including consideration of the nature and difficulty of any problems involved, the responsibility incurred, the time expended, the size of the estate, the general experience of counsel, etc. Of: <em>Williamson </em>Estate, supra, p. 357.

At that time, Mr. Rubin asked Yeshiva’s counsel what price Yeshiva would consider acceptable for the Praiman property on Old York Road, Montgomery County and Yeshiva’s counsel, by letter, advised Mr. Rubin that $100,000 would be acceptable. In response to this letter Mr. Rubin wrote a letter to Yeshiva’s counsel in which he, <em>somewhat peremptorily, </em>advised that, while he appreciated Yeshiva giving its views, after all it was up to him, not Yeshiva, to set the price. The tone of this letter and the attitude exhibited therein by Mr. Rubin seem to have injured the prior good relationship between the parties. A short time later, Yeshiva’s counsel requested the right to examine (a) books and records kept by decedent prior to his death and (b) books and records of the estate. Mr. Rubin replied that the former were being audited by the Internal Revenue agents and the latter were being used to prepare the final account, hence all were presently unavailable. <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>After Yeshiva’s counsel had written Mr. Rubin, terming the reasons assigned for not opening the books and records for examination “poor excuses”, a meeting was finally arranged at which such books and records were examined. This incident served to widen the breach between the parties. Furthermore, after the executor secured other counsel and decedent’s real estate had been sold, Mr. Rubin, as trustee, sought to surcharge the executor for having sold the realty for approximately $20,000 less than the inventory value. These are the incidents, together with the size of the counsel fee claimed by Mr. Rubin, which furnish the background for the present unhappy relationship between the parties. While these incidents could well have been avoided had Mr. Rubin exhibited more tact and diplomacy in his dealings with Yeshiva, we agree with the court below that the relationship as it now exists between the parties is not such as to justify the removal of Mr. Rubin as trustee.</p>
