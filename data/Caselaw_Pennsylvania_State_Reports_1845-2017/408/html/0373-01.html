The Municipality Authorities Act, supra, in this connection states only that contracts such as the one involved shall be let upon “competitive bidding.” Assuming arguendo, that we cannot read into this requirement that competitive bids for such contracts must necessarily be in writing and properly executed by those to be bound thereby, the instrue<a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>tions, promulgated by the Authority itself made this requirement mandatory. Section 10 emphatically provides, as pointed out supra: “No proposal will be considered which is submitted otherwise than on the prepared form of proposal and in the designated manner. . . . The bidder shall sign his proposal correctly ... if made by a corporation, the person signing the proposal must be the President or Vice President of the Corporation. No proposal will be considered . . . which is not properly made out and signed in writing by the bidder. . . .” No words could be more clear and explicit.

The requirement that the bid be signed by the bidder was not only for the purpose of facilitating the process and the identification of the bidder, as appellant argues, more importantly, it was for the purpose of legally binding <em>the </em>bidder. For in the case of a corporation, it is only such an officer or officers as stipulated, or others so authorized that could clearly bind the corporation. See, Business Corporation Law, Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, §305, 15 P.S. §2852-305; and, <em>Lebowitz v. Keystone Insurance Agency, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/198/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="198 Pa.

Philadelphia, </em>supra, factually and fundamentally involved the failure to fulfill a requirement spelled out in the pertinent ordinance, the Court considered it significant that the unfulfilled requirement was also stipulated in the instructions to the bidders. The opinion pointedly distinguished between irregularities for which a bid <em>may </em>be rejected and defects for which a bid <em>will </em>be rejected at pages 506-507, wherein it said: “In the present case, the exercise of discretionary power is contemplated in the ‘information for bidders’ by providing that ‘a proposal which is incomplete, obscure, conditional or unbalanced, or which contains alterations, erasures, additions not called for or irregularities of any kind, or in which the proposed surety is not named, <em>may </em>be rejected as informal.’ Had the Cranford bid contained a defect of the character so described, no objection could have been made if the director had, in the exercise of his discretion, permitted the bid to be corrected. But with respect to the deposit, we find the provision that ‘a proposal which is not accompanied by the required certified check <em>will </em>be rejected,’ this clause being included pursuant to the mandatory provision of the ordinance that all bids ‘must be accompanied’ by a certified check for the agreed amount. We thus have explicit notice brought home to all bidders that their bid would be rejected unless this particular feature of the ordinance were fully complied with. All persons knew it was an essential requirement and one which must be strictly performed and that the city official was without discretion in the matter. He could correct or disregard technical irregularities but this requirement he was bound to enforce. . .</p>
