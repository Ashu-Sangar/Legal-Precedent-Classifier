That ordinance, in pertinent part, provides: “Section 2. No person, persons, firm or corporation shall play, use, operate, or knowingly permit to be played, used or operated any radio receiving set, musical instrument, phonograph, sound amplifier, loud speaker, or other machine or device for the reproduction of sound, upon property (real or personal) or premises owned, occupied or used by him, them, or it, which is not measured and regulated by decibels so that the sound coming from such, machine cannot be audibly heard at a <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>distance greater than one (100) hundred feet from the property or premises wherein such machine or device is located. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit the playing of a band or orchestra in any concert hall, auditorium, club room or public park. Section 3. No person shall operate a sound truck or loud speaker on the streets or public places of the City of Chester without first obtaining a permit therefor from the Council of the City of Chester. Such permit shall be for a period of one day only. Such permit shall not be transferable from person to person or from sound truck to sound truck and may not be extended as to the date it shall be used, nor shall any permit for the operation of such sound truck be issued for use earlier than 8 o’clock A.M. or later than 9 o’clock P.M. of the prevailing local time. Every application for a permit shall be accompanied by a permit fee of One ($1.00) Dollar.” That ordinance further provides the manner of applying for a permit for the use of a sound truck or loud-speaker, prescribing, inter alia, that a permit application must be accompanied by a “certificate from an engineer that such amplifying machine is so equipped and regulated by decibels, that the sound coming from such machine cannot be audibly heard at a distance greater than one (100) hundred feet from the sound truck or amplifying machine.” For a violation of this ordinance a minimum fine of $50 and a maximum fine of $200 is prescribed; in default in payment of the fine and costs, imprisonment for a minimum period of 30 days and a maximum period of 90 days in the county jail is prescribed.</p>

There can be no doubt that, if a statute or an ordinance is so “vague, indefinite or uncertain” that the courts are unable to determine, with any reasonable degree of certainty, the intent of the legislative body, such statute or ordinance is invalid: <em>Murray v.

The test is whether the language of the legislation clearly reveals the intent of the legislative body and the. instant ordinance certainly meets that test. This ordinance clearly shows that it was the intent of the councilmanic body to protect the citizens of Chester from such “unnecessary noises and sounds” as would occasion them discomfort and annoyance and to regulate the use of sound trucks and sound amplifying equipment in and about the public highways so as to decrease accident hazards, insure the orderly movement of traffic and avoid traffic congestion on such highways. This ordinance does not <em>prohibit </em>sound trucks and sound amplifying equipment in and about the highways; on the contrary, this ordinance <em>permits </em>the use <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>ol! such trucks and equipment under certain conditions which are clearly set forth and with which compliance is neither onerous nor difficult.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a> This contention of Hines is without merit.</p>

Ordinances which are regulatory in nature must be reasonable: <em>Lutz v. Armour, </em><a href="/pa/395/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="395 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1282792" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0576-01">395 Pa. 576</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.2d%20108" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="151 A.2d 108">151 A. 2d 108</a>; <em>Warren v.

The instant ordinance does not limit or restrict a permit to only one day of the week, the month or the year; it simply provides that each permit will be issued on a <em>per diem </em>basis and, if additional permits are required, such permits will be issued on a <em>per diem </em>basis. The proper enforcement of this ordinance requires that the police be alerted to the exact date or dates and the hours on each date when the sound trucks and sound amplifying equipment will be used in or about the public highways so that additional police can be directed to the area where the sound trucks and sound amplifying equipment will be used. For instance, the use of such sound trucks and sound amplifying equipment on days or at hours when the traffic is normally heavier than on other days or hours will <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>require greater police activity to see that traffic moves in an orderly manner and without congestion. We cannot see any element of unreasonableness in this requirement of the ordinance and, on the contrary, believe. that it properly serves the over-all purpose of the ordinance. The mere fact that one who seeks to use trucks and equipment over a number of days must fill out a separate application for each permit for each day does not vitiate this ordinance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a>

In <em>American Baseball Club v. </em>Philadelphia, supra (p. 316), we stated: “A license fee is valid if the amount thereof is reasonably commensurate with the actual cost to the municipality for special services rendered: [citing cases]”. Judge (later Chief Justice) Horace Stern, speaking of a license fee in <em>Arronson v. Phila., </em><a href="/pa-d-c/16/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="16 Pa.

D. &amp; C. 427</a>, aptly said: “Such a charge is not regarded as in any sense a revenue-producing measure or as the imposition of a tax. It is merely making the person who causes the expense pay for it.” In determining the reasonableness of the amount of a license fee two principles must be borne in mind: (a) the party who claims that the amount of a license fee is unreasonable has the burden of so proving<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5</a> and (b) in matters of this, character municipalities must be given reasonable latitude in fixing charges to cover anticipated expenses to be incurred in the enforcement of the <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>ordinance and all doubt should be resolved in favor of the reasonableness of the fee: <em>Wm.

After hearing, the court below, in this respect, made the following findings of fact: “11. When permits are issued, notice of issuance is forwarded to the police department to alert police cars in all districts to supervise and check the operations of the sound truck and to answer complaints of annoyance from the public. 12. All policemen supervising sound truck operations must leave their regular duties for this purpose; and a patrol car of two men must remain with the truck the entire permit time of 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. requiring constant policing. 13. Policing sound trucks has required not only the services of patrolmen, but sergeants, captains, the chief of police, desk sergeants and radio operators. 14. Each patrolman earns $2 per hour salary, and at 13 hours for two patrolmen, the expense to the City is Fifty-two ($52) Dollars per permit day not considering the cost of gasoline, oil, the use of the patrol car, services of the City Clerk in issuing the permit, the radio operator alerting the patrolmen, and any superior officers who are involved in enforcing the Ordinance. 15. The enforcement of the Sound Truck Ordinance requires more time and effort by the police than any other City Ordinance. 16. Four regular police and additional auxiliary police were required to be present when [Hines] used sound truck equipment without a permit on the occasion when he was found guilty.”</p>
