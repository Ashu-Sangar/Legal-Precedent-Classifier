Brodstein had filed three income tax returns which the lower Court found to be fraudulent. In one of these returns he had omitted to report approximately $22,000 income which he received in 1956. In imposing sentence the Court took into consideration not only the aforesaid fraudulent income tax returns but also (a) the fact that in 1930, Brodstein had been suspended for three years for unprofessional conduct, and (b) the fact that Brodstein’s conduct for nearly 25 years had been so exemplary that he had been elected in 1951 President of the Berks County Bar Association, and (c) that he was highly respected by judges and lawyers alike, and (d) that he is now 66 years of age and ill, and (e) that he had paid his deficiency (income) taxes in full.</p>

It was through the lawyer and his intimate relationship with government that our country developed the unique institutions that now characterize our American society.

Edward Hoffman who was sued by a woman named Anna Baumwald for $12,000, being commissions allegedly due her for the sale of trucks manufactured by Hoffman. In this litigation, Brodstein allowed zeal to becloud judgment and championing of his client’s interests to overcome integrity, and in doing so transgressed the code of the profession. He quickly realized <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>his error and himself paid $12,000 to Miss Baumwald, the amount she had been claiming from his client.

He labored long and arduously, he put his heart into his work, he plunged into religious, civic and charitable activities, he treated his brothers at the bar and his fellow-men with respect, kindliness and amiability. His friends became legion. He so earned the good will and the esteem of the bar that in 1951 he was elected President of the Berks County Bar Association.</p>

There is formidable authority for this position. In <em>Com. v. Ferguson, </em><a href="/pa-super/44/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="44 Pa.

Accordingly, he could plead nolo contendere which means “I will not contest it.” In <em>Teslovich v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance </em>Co., <a href="/pa-super/110/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="110 Pa.

Medford, supra, cited to us by the present defendant) treat the plea of nolo contendere as being an implied admission made solely and exclusively for the purposes of the indictment, and as having no further operation or effect . . . And it has been specifically laid down that it cannot be used as evidence against the defendant in a civil suit to show that he did the act charged against him in the criminal case ... in Guild v. Lee, 3 Bost. Law R. 433, which was an action for an assault and battery, it was held by Shaw, C.

The plea was nolo contendere, and the proceedings are not competent evidence in a civil suit for the same assault. One object of this plea is to <em>prevent the proceedings being used in any other place.”’” </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>

    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[175,1020,1154,533]]]'>Black’s Law Dictionary states that although a plea of nolo contendere admits, “for the purposes of the case, all the facts which are well pleaded, but [it] is <em>not to be used as an admission elsewhere.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.)

The Supreme Court of Louisiana dismissed the petition, stating: “A plea of nolo contendere is not technically a plea of guilty, but it is one in substance if accepted by the court; for when so accepted, it becomes an implied confession of guilt. However, it has no effect beyond the particular case, and <em>it cannot be employed, against the. defendant as an admission in any civil suit for the same act.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>

Even if the court believed that the plea of nolo contendere was equivalent to a plea of guilty, the circumstances did not justify total and permanent disbarment which, of course, to a lawyer, so far as a career is concerned, amounts to capital punishment. To permanently disbar a lawyer means to humiliate and degrade him for life and to bring shame and discredit on himself and family. While, of course, there are many situations which not only justify but demand this ultimately drastic punishment, the record does not reveal such a situation to be present here.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[258,968,1157,588]]]'>In the case of <em>Alker Disbarment, </em><a href="/pa/398/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="398 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1289085" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0188-01">398 Pa. 188</a>, where disbarment was affirmed, we approved of what President Judge Klein of the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County said, namely: “No strict technical rule has ever been adopted in this State. <em>Our rule is one of common sense </em>and each case is judged on its own circumstances. The true test in a disbarment proceeding is whether the attorney’s character, as shown by his conduct, makes him unfit to practice law from the standpoint of protecting the public and the courts.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

Nor does it appear that the tribunal was lit up by the golden sunlight of charity when consideration was being given to the case of a lawyer 66 years of age who, aside from the offenses here indicated, has led a blameless life. In addition the Court ignored the plaintiff’s physical condition. While, of course, bodily disablement is no defense to misconduct, there is scarcely a tribunal which, deliberating on a choice of punishment, does not take into consideration the state of health and the capacity to absorb punishment on the part of the person who is to receive the lash of penalization. The medical evidence presented in this case shows that Brodstein is <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>presently suffering from a coronary arteriosclerosis with angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus, hyper-cholesteremia, arteriosclerosis obliterans with intermittent claudication and degenerative arthritis of severe nature of the cervical spine.</p>
    <p id="b121-4" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[169,635,1149,306]]]'>There is one passage in the opinion of the court below which cannot possibly merit laudation.

    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[170,962,1149,587]]]'>If Brodstein had elected to stand trial and had been found “Not Guilty,” it would have been a travesty on the law and justice for the court below to disbar him on the charge of which the jury had found him innocent. The statement of the court below that it would not be guided by a verdict of not guilty is an attack on our judicial system, it is a denial of due process, it is an assault on the principles of fairness which control all our democratic institutions. It has happened more than once that innocent persons have been indicted and have been properly acquitted.</p>

Respondent’s counsel in his brief points out: “neither the 1880 case, nor the instant case, involved any betrayal of clients’ trust or confidence, or any misuse of funds of others; they were acts purely personal to the appellant, and although he acted in an improper manner as a young and zealous lawyer in 1930, it is urged upon your Honorable Court that the Ellis Brod<a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>stein of 1954-1955-1956, the years in which the tax evasion allegedly occurred, was a different person than the Ellis Brodstein of 1930.”</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[269,520,1160,479]]]'>But the court below says: “Respondent contends that in the event that disciplinary action is in order, the Court should act to suspend his right to practice and not disbar him. We would agree with such contention and impose suspension except for the fact that in 1930 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania suspended respondent’s right to practice for a period of three years. This is the second time that disciplinary action has been required.”</p>
    <p id="b122-5" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[253,1008,1168,1081]]]'>The respondent’s first dereliction occurred in 1930. Thirty-one years have passed since then. Respondent’s counsel well says that the Brodstein of today is not the Brodstein of 1930. If the constantly recurring breakers of time and the ever-surging cleansing tides of the passing seasons do not wipe out what was written in the sands of thirty-one years ago, then character once injured can never be healed, a good name once blemished can never be regained, a horizon once clouded can never be blue again. According to the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, the lawyer who stumbles once may as well continue to trip until he topples over the precipice of complete and irrevocable ruin, because no matter how much he makes amends, no matter how repentant he may be, no matter how exemplary his mode of life, he will never be treated equally with the other members of the bar. I believe that such a doctrine, such a policy is not only contrary to the law but is opposed to the teachings of every religion in the world.</p>

Brodstein paid his debt to the opposing litigant involved, he discharged his indebtedness <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>to society, he met his responsibility to the law, he satisfied the mortgage on his career held by the Berks County Bar Association for three years. What more does the Berks County Bar Association want? To brandish the sin of thirty years ago, like a spiked club, over the head of the ill and aging Ellis Brodstein is, in my estimation, suggestive of cruel and unusual punishment. It is like rereading pages of the misfortunes of Jean Val jean.</p>

It involved rather an appraisal of the proper relationship between the collective bar and a lawyer; it involved, more so, the relationship between man and man. I do not see in the record that the court gave any moral evaluation to the truly vital factors involved. It would appear that the court was determined to degrade the respondent at all costs. After the Berks County Bar Association had prepared its report on Attorney Brodstein but before it had filed it in Court, Brodstein on June 20,1961, submitted a letter resigning “from the Bar of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, effective immediately.” The court refused to allow the resignation to take effect. It ordered that the bar association proceed. If the objective of the proceedings was to have Brodstein severed from the Bar, this objective was attained when Brodstein voluntarily resigned. But the court would not permit this humane ending to the career of a lawyer who at one time had so enjoyed the respect of the Bench and Bar that he was elected president of the bar association. It insisted on accomplishing the disaster of the bar association ex-president in the most painful way possible.</p>

The appropriate precedent which the Court has not been able to find through “research” shines forth in Matthew, chapter 18, where Peter asked Jesus: “Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?” And in verse 22, we read the reply: “Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: bub, Until seventy times seven.”</p>

I would say in reply to that proposition that the court below cannot find a case which says that a court is compelled to inflict the ultimate penalty of total disbarment where an attorney has twice erred. On the contrary, there are many cases where even conviction under income tax laws following trial has not dictated disbarment. We have actually had a rather large number of cases in Pennsylvania where attorneys guilty of violating the income tax laws have not been disbarred because the crime, while obviously reprehensible, is regarded malum prohibitum.

Attorney Hallinan represented the notorious Communist abettor on the Pacific Coast, Harry Bridges. He was found guilty, after a jury trial, of violating the Internal Revenue Code, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7145" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="26 U.S.C. §145">26 U.S.C. §145</a>(b) by “ ‘willfully and knowingly filing false and fraudulent income tax returns.’ ” The State Bar of California filed a certified copy of the conviction with the Supreme Court of California, and asked for Hallinan’s disbarment on the basis that the conviction, ipso facto, dictated disbarment under the Business and Professions Code which provided for the summary disbarment of attorneys convicted of “ <em>‘a </em>felony or misdemeanor, involving moral turpitude.’ ” The Supreme Court of California rejected the representation and held that conviction under federal statute for failure to collect and pay over tax or attempting to collect or evade tax does not necessarily involve <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>moral turpitude and does not justify summary disbarment. In support of its decision it said: “The crucial question in the present proceeding, therefore, is whether or not an intent to defraud the United States is an essential element of the crime proscribed by section 145 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If an intent to defraud is not an essential element and a person may be convicted thereunder without proof of that intent or other conduct evidencing moral turpitude, an attorney convicted of that crime cannot be summarily disbarred. Since section 145(b) is a United States statute, we must accept the interpretation given it by the United States courts, [citing cases] These courts have uniformly held that an intent to defraud is not an essential element of section 145(b) and that a conviction under that section does not necessarily involve moral turpitude.” The California Supreme Court cited a case of the United States Supreme Court <em>(United States v.

The court could have accomplished equally salutary results, without permanently disabling the respondent, by suspending him from the practice of the law for a period of years or even indefinitely; but to place his head on the block because of the offenses discussed is not in keeping with the traditions of the bench and bar where mercy is not unknown and where help to a fallen brother is not to be regarded as weakness.</p>
