The application was denied, however, because the side yard requirements of the borough zoning ordinance would not be met by the proposed structure.

This does not contemplate a rigid “master-plan” which attempts to answer in minute detail every last question regarding land utilization ; whether that plan be formulated by a planning commission or by the zoning ordinance itself.

We cannot.say that the zoning legislation in question violated the legislative re'qhlfement that it be “in accordance with a comprehensive plan” merely because it was an appendage to the general zoning ordinance and has the purpose and effect of güaranteeing that the area in question will, continúe predominately as a neighborhood of single and twin houses. ■</p>

These are some of the perplexing <em>general </em>questions which have been unanswered by any decision of an appellate Court in this Commonwealth. They do not include the more particular questions which are frequently raised, such as whether the act or ordinance is valid and constitutional, and/or whether it is valid and/or constitutional as applied to the appellant’s particular property, and/or whether in each individual case the property owner has complied with the provisions of a valid zoning ordinance, or is entitled to an exception or a variance.</p>

The main reason for this, I believe, is because too many Courts and too many legislative bodies and zoning commissions and boards have ignored or forgotten the Constitution, which, in spite of many present-day critics, has often been proclaimed by great world leaders as the most wonderful document ever written by mankind in the last 1900 years. The Federal Constitution in the 5th (and similarly in the 14th) Amendment provides: “No person shall... be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” The Constitution of Pennsylvania provides in Article I, §1 — “All men . . . have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property . . . .” Article I, §10 provides: “. . . nor shall private property be taken or applied to public use, without authority of law and without just compensation being first made or secured.” The ownership and possession of private property is of little value unless the owner can use it, hence the acquiring, possession and protection of private property necessarily includes its lawful use and if a public authority wishes to deprive an owner of his lawful use it must pay just compensation therefor. See in addition to the Constitutional provisions supra, the cases cited herein.</p>

The right of private property, together with the right of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press are the hallmarks of western civilization.

The historical origin and development of our Country, our Birthright and Heritage of Freedom and the (so-called) inalienable fundamental rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed by our Constitution are too often forgotten today. The natural or zealous desire of many planners, zoning commissioners, zoning boards and legislative bodies to protect or improve or develop their community so as to make it peaceful and prosperous, beautiful and economically utilitarian, and to conserve the property values as well as the “tone” of that community is — when reasonably applied — highly commendable.

These cases and the standards laid down and thus interpreted were never expressly overruled, but they were effectually changed by a new concept of zoning, and realistically a new standard for zoning in <em>Bilbar Construction Co. v.

The change can be thus expressed: Although some decisions made no reference to general welfare, almost all the decisions expressed the required standard that the statute or ordinance must be clearly or reasonably necessary for public safety, health, morals, <em>or </em>general welfare. Notwithstanding the word “or”, the Court in all of the cases <em>until Bilbar and Best </em>(1958) devoted nearly their entire opinion to discussing and determining <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>whether the Act or ordinance in question was necessary for. the health and/or safety of the particular community, (township, borough or city, as the case might be), with only a sentence or two dealing with the secondary and connected question of general welfare. Moreover, even in <em>Bilbar </em>the Court said (page 72) : “Although some of our recent cases appear to have ignored ‘general welfare’ as a consideration in adjudging whether the police power has been constitutionally exercised in a given instance, it is not open to serious question that it is one of the important elements to be reckoned with in any such inquiry.” The emphasis in all of these cases was, I repeat, on the question of health and/or safety, with only slight consideration or weight given to the secondary but connected “general welfare”. The basic reasons for this were two-fold: (1) the words “general welfare” were ejusdem generis with health and safety and morals, and (2) the Court’s conviction that the constitutionally ordained and guaranteed rights of private property could be restricted or curtailed by government<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">*</a> in pursuance and application of the police power which government impliedly but necessarily possessed, but only to the extent of Acts and measures reasonably necessary for health and/or safety and/or morals, and even then only if also reasonably necessary for general welfare.</p>

A comprehensive plan is ordinarily separate and distinct from an ordinance but it is possible for an ordinance in and of itself to be a comprehensive plan, unless the Legislature or the legislative body clearly otherwise provides. 6. A zoning ordinance may be amended, supplemented, changed, modified or repealed — in the sound discretion of the legislative body and in accordance with statutory and other pertinent legal and Constitutional requirements — as conditions or changing circumstances may require. 7.
