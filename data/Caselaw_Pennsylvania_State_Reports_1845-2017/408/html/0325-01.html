This relationship is not analogous to that of an industrial worker with his company. The latter, through his bargaining agent, enters into contractual negotiations with the employer at periodic intervals — usually, immediately prior to the expiration of the existing contract. At such time, the union representatives and the company officials sit down and review the existing collective bargaining agreement, provision by provision. Through this process, they arrive at mutually agreeable provisions relative to wages, working conditions, vacation benefits, unemployment security and the host of other details relevant to modern day employment.</p>

While governmental units recognize unions, such as Fire Fighters, as the bargaining agents of the municipal workers, they do not sit down and enter into collective bargaining agreements containing provisions governing employment.

Rather, wages, hours, retirement benefits and many other conditions of employment are established by ordinance or directive of the duly authorized municipal authority — in the instant case, the Pittsburgh City Council. Similarly, many of the details concerning the day-to-day working conditions of municipal employees (e.g. type of shifts, clothing requirements, etc.) are regulated by order of the proper administrative department — here the fire bureau. Provisions contained in ordinances relative to wages and other matters can be changed only by getting the city council to amend or rewrite the ordinance. Revision of such provisions does not come about from a periodic review of a labor contract as in the industrial context, but results solely and exclusively from the decision of the city authorities to change the existing terms by the enactment of new or amended legislation.</p>

It is long settled that mandamus will lie to compel a public officer to perform a mandatory or ministerial act which he is legally obliged to perform and which the complainant is legally entitled to receive.

It is, therefore, exceedingly regrettable that he should become involved in a legal controversy concerning the very least to which he is entitled, a proper wage. However, what is proper and what is not, is a matter to be decided in accordance with certain established legal procedures. This is necessary if the public well-being, which the fireman protects from the ravages of flame and flood, is not to be seriously damaged through the breakdown of governmental order.</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.7",365,[208,1270,1150,534]]]'>The record in this case shows that the plaintiffs presented their proposition for a certain wage formula before the city council, the only body that has the authority to grant the plaintiffs that “wage formula.” It is the city council which must determine the whole wage structure of city employees because it is the council which is charged with raising the money to pay the wages. The council granted the plaintiffs a wage increase but declined to give, with the wage increase, the “wage formula” requested.</p>

L. 1183 (sometimes known as the Public Employees Anti-Strike Act). On February 16, 1961, they went into the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the City to “comply with the terms of the Act of June 30, 1947, P. L. 1183, as amended, for the establishment of an <em>arbitration </em>panel for the adjustment of the wage rate controversy and grievance <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>involving the fire fighters employed in the Burean of Fire of the City of Pittsburgh and to select its member for the <em>arbitration </em>panel.” (Emphasis supplied)</p>

    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[242,667,1159,749]]]'>I respectfully submit that the suit in this case was ill-advised because it disregarded the very Act (that of 1947) on which the suit was based. The plaintiffs’ complaint makes frequent reference to “arbitration,” but it is a matter of simply reading the Act of 1947 to note that in the whole statute the word “arbitration,” or any derivative thereof, is <em>not mentioned once. </em>I state, again with respect, that the plaintiffs, in pursuing their action under this Act of 1947, have been apparently misled as to the substance, the letter, the spirit and the whole objective of that law. Ever since January, 1961, the plaintiffs have been calling for arbitration under the Act of 1947, when, I repeat, that Act contains not the slightest reference to arbitration.</p>
    <p id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[241,1428,1156,260]]]'>In the plaintiffs’ letter of January 27, 1961, to the mayor of Pittsburgh they ask for the appointment of a “three man arbitration panel.” But there is no provision in the Act of 1947 for any such “arbitration panel.”</p>
    <p id="b366-7" data-blocks='[["BL_366.7",366,[238,1701,1158,694]]]'>For many months now the plaintiffs have been picketing the City-County Building, which houses the offices of the mayor of Pittsburgh, carrying large signs reading: “Barr bars arbitration.” This assertion does not accord with the facts because, I repeat and emphasize, the Act of 1947 does not authorize, permit or even suggest arbitration. Mayor Barr cannot be charged with barring something he cannot legally do. No one could say that Mayor Barr bars the calling of a session of the Legislature since he has no authority to call a session of the Legislature. Equally, he has no authority, under the Act of .1947, to arbitrate the matter which is the subject of the plaintiffs’ request.</p>

      <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>This whole case is built on a complete misconception of the law. I repeat, deferentially, that the firemen (for whom I have great respect because of the hazards they constantly confront in behalf of public safety) have been misadvised, miscounselled, and misdirected. Even a hasty glance at the Act of 1947 will show that its motif is “grievance procedure.” What is a grievvance? It refers to something which has already happened. A person is hurt- — physically, morally, legally —and he has a grievance. The Act of 1947 provides for an airing of grievances. Under the Act of 1947, the plaintiffs would have the right to complain, for instance, on such matters as hours of employment, working conditions, assignments, — matters which had already found expression on the tablet of time through experience and chronicle. Such hypothetical complaints would be subjects for consideration under the Act of 1947 since they would be based on events which were fait accompli. But the plaintiffs would not have the right, under the Act of 1947, to demand certain terms of employment and wages <em>in the </em>future„</p>
    <p id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[225,1501,1149,206]]]'>The plaintiffs are not asking for a decision on a grievance as specified in the Act of 1947, they are asking for a “wage formula.” A wage formula applies to the future, but a grievance looks to the past.</p>
    <p id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[225,1718,1150,368]]]'>The plaintiffs’ complaint cannot even be designated a demand for wage increase because a wage increase was accorded to them by city council before this proceeding in mandamus was initiated. What the plaintiffs are demanding is a “formula”, a formula involving collective bargaining. But collective bargaining in this case cannot be denominated a grievance.</p>

It will be noted from the decision of this illustrious court that “grievances” refers to rights “under the collective bargain.” But there has been no governing collective bargain in this ease in which the city agreed to give what the plaintiffs ask. Hence, there can be no grievance in its legal sense. You cannot legally complain over what you have no legal right to demand.</p>

L. 1161, 43 P.S. 213.1.

The plaintiffs here have not proved that they have a right acknowledged by law to the formula they request. They have not proved any promise that they would get such a formula. Where, then, is the grievance in the legal sense, a grievance which the courts can adjudicate? The plaintiffs have expressed a desire and a hope, but this cannot warrant <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>and justify a court in issuing a writ of mandamus, one of the most powerful writs known to law.</p>

The panel which the Majority decision has ordered formulated cannot do anything more than has already been done, namely, listen to what the plaintiffs and the city have already presented before the city council which, as I have stated, is the only authoritative tribunal which can give a decision on the “wage formula” in question. The panel, it is true, may make recommendations, but the recommendations will have no binding effect whatsoever. It should be obvious that no panel may fix salaries of Pittsburgh’s municipal employees. To permit such a procedure would be an unlawful and unconstitutional delegation of power.
