Those actions lack legality and cannot be allowed to stand. An asserted “Special Grand Jury” was ordered, for which there is no warrant in law; an attorney was appointed as “Special Prosecutor,” an office which does not exist; an investigation was directed without limitation as to subject matter or time, contrary to the most fundamental precepts of precision in the administration of the law; a constitutional officer, duly elected by the people of Philadelphia County, was displaced from office, with<a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>out due process; additional personnel was employed, supplemental quarters were rented, new facilities were obtained, all at the expense of the taxpayers when personnel, quarters and facilities for the contemplated action were already in existence.</p>

On March 22, 1962, a petition addressed to the judges of the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of the City and County of Philadelphia, signed by Robert L. Leonard and other “citizens, taxpayers and residents” of Philadelphia, was filed with the clerk of quarter sessions, averring widespread violations of law in the government of the City of Philadelphia and that the district attorney, James C. Crumlish, Jr., was unable or unwilling to cope with the situation. The petition prayed that the grand jury be instructed to investigate into the matters therein described.</p>
    <p id="b587-5" data-blocks='[["BL_587.5",587,[197,1278,1148,317]]]'>The petition came into the hands of Judge Guerin, assigned to Quarter Sessions Court No. 4 (Bail Arraignment Court), which court was charged with conducting all miscellaneous business coming before the Criminal Courts<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> of Philadelphia County for the month of March, 1962.</p>

Court of Common Pleas No. 7 was designated to that duty for the month of March. Within No. 7 itself, it was decided that President Judge <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>Sloane would preside in Room 653 for the weeks beginning March 5th and March 12th and that Judge Gleeson would preside for the weeks beginning March ■19th and March 26th.

(hereinafter to be referred to as the Leonard petition), was not presented to Judge Gleeson but went to Judge Guerin in Quarter Sessions Court No. 4, that division of the court, as above stated, which administers all miscellaneous business of the court. It is obvious that by no liberal construction of language can the summoning of a grand jury be regarded as a miscellaneous item. “Miscellaneous” connotes odds and ends of affairs: remnants and scraps, heterogeneous and promiscuous. In the classification of what is important, a grand jury investigation is not to be found in the heterogeneous and promiscuous scraps of a court’s activities.</p>

Among the incongruities in the history of this case, no light is shed on the inevitable query as to why Judge Alessandroni, once he perused the Leonard petition, and, being thoroughly conversant with the division of duties and responsibilities in the criminal court, did <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>not himself immediately refer the petition to Judge Griffiths, who was ready to instruct the grand jury in Court No. 1 during the entire month of April.</p>

Judge Alessandroni stated that that could not be done. The colloquy was as follows: “Mr. Fogel: The point, sir, is that Your Honor may come to a determination in the matter when Your Honor might not then be sitting in the Court of Quarter Sessions, and not being in the Court that has jurisdiction over the Grand Jury, I would like to make sure that there would be no objections interposed if Your Honor should determine that special instructions should be given and that Your Honor have jurisdiction and the power to convene a special Grand Jury so instructed.

Before quitting the criminal court he had made no definitive decision on the Leonard petition and he did not pass it on to his successor in the miscellaneous branch of the court, as Judge Guerin had bequeathed it to him. Nor did he make any effort to call it to the attention of Judge Doty who was now presiding in Criminal Court No. 1 and who stood ready to charge the grand jury on all matters which required action. The month of May wended its accustomed way through the calendar and then came June which in due time melted into July, but during all this time the Leonard petition was ignored, neglected and unmentioned.</p>

Judge Doty, in turn, was succeeded by Judge L'llman for the month of June and when Judge Ullman had completed his assignment Judge Sporkin assumed command of the grand jury for July. It would have been a simple matter to refer the Leonard petition to any of these judges to determine the question of a grand jury investigation.</p>

Undue passage of time nearly always works adversely in the ascertainment of truth. Where there is any controversy, truth is a ripe fruit which must be timely picked. After maturity passes, disintegration sets in. Memory fades, and what is worse, it often enters into the shadowland of guesswork, loss of focus and even unconscious distortion. In addition, deaths, translocations and other mutations also make holes in the fabric intended to reproduce in testimony what has occurred in fact.</p>
    <p id="b591-4" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[177,898,1153,1291]]]'>Of course, some delays in law are inevitable but this was not the case here. The record does not offer the slightest explanation as to the reason for the inert lodgment of the Leonard petition from March until July 11, 1962. The only possible explanation for this inertness, consistent with adherence to judicial responsibility, is that the judge was in grave doubt as to whether there should be a grand jury investigation. Finally, on July 11th, under the heading of Quarter Sessions Court, March Session, 1962, Miscellaneous Docket No. 279, Judge Alessandroni ordered what he called a “Special Grand Jury.” But even then, another protracted procrastination intervened. The July grand jury, under the presidency of Judge Sporkin, was in session, ready and prepared to take action, but the learned judge of Court of Common Pleas No. 5 ignored the established machinery of the court. He passed over Judge Sporkin. Judge Sporkin, in the grand jury courtroom, was followed by Judge Hagan who was to conduct all grand jury business for the month of August. Judge Alessandroni was indifferent to Judge Hagan and the grand jury over which he presided and which, equally, was standing by for any special instructions throughout that month.</p>

Why the Board of Judges of Philadelphia County allowed the inordinate delays recounted, the entangling and thwarting of the schedules they themselves had set up in the criminal courts, we are not informed. But that the inertia, lack of coordination and absence of frank disclosure among judges which have been manifested in this entire proceeding bestows no <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>credit on the whole administration of the criminal courts in Philadelphia is written too plainly on the gray and ancient walls of City Hall.</p>

Judge Alessandroni was not sitting in that court in July. His term there having expired the first Monday of May, he had returned to his regular post as President Judge of Court of Common Pleas No. 5. In fact, the reverse side of the backing sheet of the order in which he called for a grand jury investigation bears the printed designation: “Court op Common Pleas No. 5 in and por the County op Philadelphia.”</p>
    <p id="b593-5" data-blocks='[["BL_593.5",593,[170,1124,1150,914]]]'>The fact that he had shed his robe in criminal court would not of itself disqualify him from acting on criminal subjects.

We have seen that the Leonard petition was not presented to Judge Alessandroni in the first instance, we have observed how on April 27th he stated that he could not summon a grand jury unless he was actually in criminal court, and we have noted that he could have passed the petition on to the judge who succeeded him in criminal court as he had inherited it from his predecessor.</p>

    <p id="b594-4" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[261,634,1161,1129]]]'>A judge must be assigned to the court over which he purports to preside. Judge Alessandroni in effect commandeered the grand jury courtroom when he took possession of the Leonard petition, but he was not assigned to the grand jury room. If he could assume jurisdiction, when not assigned thereto, over grand jury matters, then any judge in the criminal court could take similar jurisdiction. If petitions or other applications for judicial action do not go to the judge designated to handle the subject matter of the petition but may, in billiard-ball fashion, make the rounds of the courts, haphazardly striking and missing jurisdiction until the final destination and disposition becomes a matter of chance, then the mists of potential chaos will hover constantly over the courthouse. The Pennsylvania Constitution specifically aimed at dissipating such mists in the workshop of justice through the operation of Article V, §8, which says that judges shall be detailed “to hold the courts of oyer and terminer and the courts of quarter sessions” <em>“in such manner as may be directed by laxo.”</em>

Instead of one integrated court with a president judge over all, the court is made up of seven separate courts, each comprising three judges with a president judge of its own. Each of these seven courts exercises a certain amount of autonomy which separates it from the other six, as much as if it were in another county. Judges who are not president judges feel a certain inferiority toward all the seven president judges so that the president judges may be led astray simply because of the lack of free and candid discussion which should characterize the entire bench of the county. This is not the place to discuss reorganization of the courts of Philadelphia County, but it is to be hoped that proper constitutional action will be taken to dissolve the seven individual courts of Philadelphia and amalgamate them into one court of common pleas, with one president judge, who will have authority to assign the judges to the various departments of work and to schedule the court’s business so as to remove all overlapping or collision of effort and endeavor, creating in the end a homogeneous, close-knit, harmonious-working court.</p>

Instead of considering this definitive procedure, Judge Alessandroni acted on his own volition and displaced the district attorney. A displacement of this character, even if only partial and temporary, is a serious and solemn matter. The learned judge treated it with a casualness which amounted almost to unconcern. The petitioners had charged the district attorney Avith misconduct and the district attorney had denied such misconduct, declaring under oath that he had “taken legal steps necessary to vigorously investigate the matter and prosecute any proven Avrongdoers.” He asserted “that the usual machinery for investigation and prosecution of crimes is operating efficiently and vigorously.” If these assertions actually represented fact, there could not be any need for the action ordered by Judge Alessandroni.</p>

That he was chosen by Judge Alessandroni an assistant to the purported Special Prosecutor, was, insofar as this litigation is concerned, a coincidence; and that he was eventually to inquire into the affairs of City Council was a fortuitous sequel to that coincidence. The essential ingredient in this procedural potpourri is that Mr. Griffin was being paid by City Council to do a job. Was he qualified to do that job? Whether his job was that of investigator, lawyer, architect or carpenter was immaterial, the City Council owed it to the citizenry of Philadelphia to ascertain whether it was properly withdrawing funds from the public purse. Certainly, to use an extreme illustration, if the person who was the subject of investigation, could not speak English, <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>no one could question the right of Council to inquire as to whether $17,500 of the taxpayers’ funds should be turned over to one so obviously disqualified for the job in question. Deficiency in language is no more an impediment in conducting an impartial and proper investigation than deficiency in a respect for impartiality.</p>
    <p id="b625-4" data-blocks='[["BL_625.4",625,[167,740,1150,1135]]]'>It was charged that Mr. Griffin had represented certain clients whose interests could be affected by the investigation and that he was a member of a law firm in such a manner as to present a conflict of interests. Under these circumstances Council would have been remiss in not making appropriate inquiry regarding Mr. Griffin’s qualifications for the serious employment he was to undertake. The $112,000 appropriated by Council for the grand jury investigation was admitted by all to be only the first installment in what was to become a very expensive undertaking. Assuming arguendo that Council had lost its chance to inquire into Griffin’s qualifications so far as the first $112,000 was concerned since the appropriation was now a fait accompli, it cannot possibly be questioned that it would have the right to determine if Griffin should receive any part of the additional stream of money which was to pour from the City treasury.

Not one of the three enumerated judges was on assignment in criminal court.

Judge Gold said, ‘I am going to invite Mr. White, the Crime Commission, the Committee of Seventy, the Republican Alliance which filed the original petition which was heard by Judge AlesSANdkoni, the Attorney General.’ And he said, ‘I will invite all these people in; do you, Mr. Berger, and do you, Mr. Lipschitz object?’ And Mr. Lipschitz said ‘No.’ ‘And do you, Mr. Berger, object?’ I said, ‘No. I welcome all these people in.’ And Mr. White summarily rejected the invitation. <em>He said he is not and will not become a party to this proceeding</em>

After Mr. Berger completed his argument before Justice Jones of this Court in the night session referred to, Mr. White replied. He said: “My standing is this: I have been directed by the order appointing me to carry forward this investigation, to get ready as soon as we possibly can for the grand jury investigation proceedings, which in the order appointing the grand jury the court found so urgently required. Should this taxpayers’ suit be successful I would be wholly unable to perform my duties.”</p>

Russell, Esq., for the “Committee of Seventy”; Herbert A. Fogel, Esq., for the Republican Alliance; Daniel B. Michie, Jr., for the Crime Commission.

They resulted from a barrage of petitions, counter-petitions, charges and counter-charges, as well as delaying and diversionary tactical procedures, many of which were so highly technical, or so obviously political and irrelevant, that they reflected no credit on the bar. Moreover, they undoubtedly, although unintentionally, caused confidence in the Courts as well as in the bar to be <em>temporarily </em>diminished, a result which everyone agrees was deplorable. Furthermore, the welter of legal suits, petitions, charges, counter-charges and the conflicting decisions by the Courts of Philadelphia County, produced tremendous confusion and near chaos in the Orderly Administration of Law and Justice. An aura of politics was generated which enveloped all the <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>cases and successfully hid from public and sometimes from legal view the very important legal questions which were raised in and by the various petitions and suits.

This was known as the “Frankford El” or Elevated railway scandal. The Philadelphia newspapers thereafter commenced or (continued and) <em>intensified </em>their investigations to attempt to discover whether there was widespread graft, corruption and crime in Philadelphia, and if so, to expose the corruption and those involved therein. As a result of their investigations, the newspapers of Philadelphia — all of which were independent, although supporters of the so-called Dilworth City Administration — proclaimed that there was widespread graft, payola, corruption and crime in the City Administration, especially among the higher echelon, and for many months constantly demanded a grand jury investigation. Finally, prominent residents, citizens, electors and taxpayers of Philadelphia, early in June, 1961, filed separate petitions or memorials<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_26" id="ref_footnote_2_26">*</a> alleging <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>widespread graft, corruption and crime in tlie City government and requesting that a special grand jury be convened to make a full and complete investigation of the aforesaid matters.

One Judge supervises the regular monthly grand jury and likewise hears criminal cases in the Quarter Sessions Court in a Court or courtroom known as “Quarter Sessions No. 1.” Another Judge presides over the (so-called) “Miscellaneous Division” of the Quarter Sessions Court and hears miscellaneous petitions and matters, and also hears criminal cases (mostly bail cases). This Court is known as “Quarter Sessions No. 4.” Criminal trials are also <em>simultaneously conducted </em>in other courtrooms in Philadelphia by other Quarter Session Judges.

Philadelphia County, unlike any other County in the State, convenes a (so-called regular) Grand Jury <em>every month. </em>Other Counties have a regular Grand Jury convene three or four times a year, and the term of service of these jurors usually extends for a period of three or four months. Those who are unfamiliar with the practices and procedures in Philadelphia County which are necessitated by the tremendous number of crimes which occur monthly, fail to realize (a) the functions and the enormous amount of work performed by a regular <em>monthly </em>grand jury in Philadelphia County; and (b) the necessary assignment of several Judges to dispose of this enormous volume of criminal cases and miscellaneous criminal matters which must, whenever reasonably possible, be tried or heard each month.

This was, we repeat, a matter of internal management of the Quarter Sessions Court by the 21 Quarter Sessions Judges of Philadelphia County. As Judge Gold, speaking for the Court of Common Pleas No. 6, so aptly said “After careful consideration [of the fact that Judge Alessandroni did not preside by “designation” in the Court of Quarter Sessions during the months of May, June, July or August and had not been “designated” to preside as a Judge in said Court during the month of September] we conclude that he had such right [to consider and determine the petition of the memorialists], although . . . for the reasons stated in this opinion, that there is no authority in law which supports the orders [for a <em>special </em>grand jury investigation or for the appointment of special prosecutors] which the Court made.</p>

A regular Grand Jury likewise investigates any matter which the presiding Quarter Sessions Judge directs it to investigate.

Of these 1828 monthly bills, the grand jury finds on the average 1668 true bills every month, and ignores approximately 160 bills. Furthermore, the regular monthly grand jury is, we repeat, under a duty to investigate whatever matters the presiding Judge of the Quarter Sessions Court directs. If, in addition to all of this — hearing witnesses, indicting persons accused of crime, and investigation of whatever matters the Judge <em>directs </em>— a <em>regular monthly grand jury </em>would have to investigate in Philadelphia the charges of widespread corruption and crime throughout the City, indictments and trials of criminals will be grievously retarded, witnesses will become lost or move, their recol<a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>lection may become hazy or obscured, <em>statutes of limitation may run, </em>and criminals will have further opportunity to “cover their tracks”. <em>The net result would be that protection of law abiding citizens would be further weakened and Justice not only delayed but jeopardized. </em>A law abiding community can be protected from criminals only by an adequate police force and the speedy arrest, indictment, trial and conviction of criminals, and the prompt and adequate sentencing of them by the Courts. The crime wave in Philadelphia and the backlog of untried criminal cases is alarming; moreover, crimes and backlog are constantly increasing. On September 1, 1961, there was a backlog of untried criminal indictments in Philadelphia County of approximately 12,700. On September 1, 1962, the backlog of untried criminal indictments was nearly 17,-000. To require a regular <em>monthly </em>grand jury to hear witnesses and dispose of approximately 1800 or more bills of indictment each month, and at the same time to specially investigate whatever the presiding Quarter Sessions Judge may direct, and <em>also </em>to investigate for a four to six months period charges of widespread graft, corruption and crime in the higher echelons of Philadelphia’s government, <em>is so impractical and unrealistic as to be fantastic.</em>

It would therefore have been a breach of professional and official propriety for him to have acted as district attorney in these cases. But it is said the appointment was illegal because the Constitution adopted since the act of 1866 was passed, makes the district attorney a constitutional officer, and as such he cannot be stripped of his powers by the legislature. There is little force in ibis suggestion. While the legislature may not abolish the office, it can control the officer. They can regulate the performance of his duties, and punish him for misconduct, as in the case of other officers. And where he neglects or refuses to act, or where, from the circumstances of a given case, it is improper and indelicate for him to act, it is competent for the legislature to afford a remedy.
