The problem most often presented in contempt cases is whether it is criminal or civil, and perhaps it is more difficult to distinguish between civil and indirect criminal contempt. It is therefore necessary to refer to the essential purpose of the proceeding. In <em>Knaus v. Knaus, </em><a href="/pa/387/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="387 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1271028" data-case-paths="/pa/387/0370-01">387 Pa. 370</a>, 376, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.2d%20669" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="127 A.2d 669">127 A. 2d 669</a>, 672 (1956), it was said: “The dominant purpose of a contempt proceeding determines whether it is civil or criminal. If the dominant purpose is to vindicate the dignity and authority of the court and to protect the interest of the general public, it is a proceeding for criminal contempt. But where the act of contempt complained of is the refusal to do or refrain from doing some act ordered or prohibited primarily for the bene<a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>fit of a private party, proceedings to enforce compliance with the decree of the court are civil in nature. The purpose of a civil contempt proceeding is remedial, and judicial sanctions are employed (1) to coerce the defendant into compliance with the court’s order, and (2) in some instances to compensate the complainant for losses sustained: United States v. United Mine Workers of America, <a href="/us/330/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="330 U.S. 258" data-case-ids="353858" data-case-paths="/us/330/0258-01">330 U. S. 258</a>, 303. A judgment in a civil contempt proceeding for the benefit of a private plaintiff will, of course, incidentally vindicate the authority of the court just as on the other hand a criminal contempt judgment, which is punitive, may often advance private interests. But the test is the dominant purpose, not the incidental result: Gompers v. Bucks Stove <em>&amp; </em>Range Company, <a href="/us/221/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="221 U.S. 418" data-case-ids="3658940" data-case-paths="/us/221/0418-01">221 U.

Wyoming Valley District Council, <a href="/pa-super/31/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="31 Pa. Super. 112" data-case-ids="864417" data-case-paths="/pa-super/31/0112-01">31 Pa.

Eq. 105" data-case-ids="95480" data-case-paths="/nj-eq/48/0105-01">48 N. J. Eq. 105</a>: ‘Proceedings in contempt are of two classes namely, first, those instituted solely for the purpose of vindicating the dignity and preserving the power of the court. These are criminal and punitive in their nature and are usually instituted by the court in the interest of the general public and not of any particular individual or suitor. Second, those instituted by private individuals for the purpose mainly, if not wholly, of protecting or enforcing private rights and in which the public have no special interest. These are remedial or civil in their nature rather than criminal or punitive’.</p>

These are the considerations which play a part, either expressly or impliedly, in the determination of the question by a majority of the courts. Most of these criterions are listed in a Avellconsidered opinion by the court in Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. Whary et al., 52 D. &amp; C. 83, and are discussed in Beale, Contempt of Court, Criminal and Civil, 21 Harvard Law Review 161. See also to the same effect Gompers v.
