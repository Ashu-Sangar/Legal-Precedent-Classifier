Such evidence was most relevant and material and the trial judge recognized such relevancy or materiality otherwise he would not have admitted it. The probability or improbability of such evidence and the credibility thereof were questions within the province of the jury and the court in its charge recognized that it was for the jury to determine the credibility of this testimony. Moreover, it was for the jury, as the court charged it, to determine whether plaintiffs did in fact rely upon the implied warranty that the raw pork sausage was fit for human consumption and whether the sausage was in fact unwholesome and unfit for human consumption. If, as the majority in the court below now opines, the only relevant and material issues before the jury were whether the sale of the sausage had taken place, whether the sausage was infected with trichinae and whether, from eating the sausage, plaintiffs became ill, why did the trial court admit into the record the testimony as to the other issues?

Scheib requested the court to charge that Scheib “warranted only that the pork sausage was wholesome and fit if properly cooked” and the court refused to do so. Again, Scheib’s counsel called the trial judge’s attention to the fact that his charge had not covered the fact that the warranty was conditioned on a proper cooking of the sausage and the trial judge replied: “We say we didn’t discuss it because it wasn’t proper”.

      <p id="b484-7" data-blocks='[["BL_484.6",484,[227,1544,1155,822]]]'> Trichinosis is “a parasitic disease of mammals primarily” which is carried “to a large extent by hogs as the main reservoir of infection.” Hogs normally become infected “by eating uncooked or raw garbage, or scraps, that is, garbage containing scraps of infected pork, infected with trichinae” which cause the hog “to develop ultimately trichinae cysts in the muscle tissue” and makes the hog capable of transmitting the disease to any animal, including man, which eats the flesh of the hog. Trichinae can infest only a live hog. If infected pork is eaten by man, the tiny larvae imbedded in the hog’s muscle tissue are released into the stomach and intestines of the man; within a short time the larvae copulates, the male eventually disintegrating with the intestinal contents and the female imbedding herself in the inner intestine. Within a short time the female liberates in large numbers small larvae which eventually get into the arterial system from which they are distributed throughout the entire system of the man. The result is trichinosis, an illness most serious and in some instances fatal. Summary of testimony of Dr. E. J'. Witte.</p>
