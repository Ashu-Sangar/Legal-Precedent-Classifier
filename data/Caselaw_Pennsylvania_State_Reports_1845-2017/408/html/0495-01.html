Under the terms of his will his residuary estate was divided into three parts: one part was given outright to his 39 year old son, W. J. Healey, one part was given outright to his 24 year old daughter, Grace Healey Greenan, and one part was set up in trust for his 32 year old son, Norman Healey,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> for life and, upon his death, to W.

Healey’s residuary estate were a fee-owned 20 acre tract of land and an oil lease of an 80 acre tract of land, both oil producing tracts being located near Bradford, Pa., the 80 acre tract being known as “Shepard Run”. In his will, J. H. Healey requested his wife, children and trustees to continue the operation of his oil and gas business for a period of at least five or ten years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Pursuant to that request, W.

The partnership agreement, in pertinent part, provided: (a) W. J. Healey, Mrs. Greenan and the Norman Healey trust each would have a third interest in the partnership; (b) W. J. Healey was to manage the business “in a good and skillful manner” and for the first six months was to, receive a salary of $60 per month at the end of which time the salary was to be readjusted by agreement of <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>the parties;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (c) the partnership was to drill new wells on property it presently owned as well as on after-acquired properties as the majority of the partners would agree; (d) W.

Pursuant to this offer and acceptance, W. J. Healey transferred his ownership of the Hunt, Yan Scoy, Buchanan and Forty-four properties to Healey Petroleum. At W. J. Healey’s solicitation, Mrs. Greenan transferred to him her interest in the Shepard Bun property and W. J.

W. J. Healey committed himself to give % share of common stock to each preferred stockholder who would surrender, for exchange under the plan, one share of the outstanding preferred stock.

At the time of the sale by W. J. Healey to Healey Petroleum of the five properties — in which the court below found Healey Oil had an interest — part of the consideration was 10,-000 shares of the Healey Petroleum common stock. The estate <em>now </em>raises no question as to its duty to account for these 10,000 shares and the profits which arose therefrom. As to all the other shares of Healey Pe<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>troleum common stock which W. J. Healey <em>subsequently </em>acquired, the estate takes the position that it is under no duty to account for such shares since such shares were acquired either by purchase or as compensation for services rendered by Healey. Even though it may be repetitious, it is most important to understand the <em>amount </em>and <em>the manner of acquisition </em>by W. J. Healey of this Healey Petroleum common stock. Healey acquired a total of 51,655 shares of the common stock the acquisition of which arose in the following manner: 10,000 shares were <em>paid </em>him as part consideration for the sale of the five properties, 38,155 shares were <em>given </em>him by reason of the provisions of the Hochstetter-Healey contract of November 19, 1928 which provided that W. J. Healey would receive 1 share of common stock for each unit (i.e., 1 share of preferred stock and 1 share of common stock) subscribed and 3500 shares were <em>purchased </em>by him between 1929 and 1942. When the recapitalization of Healey Petroleum took place in 1936, W. J. Healey, as an inducement to the preferred stockholders to exchange their stock for the debenture bonds, contributed back to the preferred stockholders 18,156 shares from his holdings; it is conceded that such shares were not subject to an accounting by the estate. Mrs. Greenan claims, and the court below held, that the estate must account for one-half of the balance of 33,139 shares (i.e., 51,655 shares less the 18,516 shares) or 16,569% shares, valued at $62.50 per share<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> or $1,035,593.75. The thrust of the estate’s argument is that, <em>to the extent that the court below considered in this balance of 33,139 shares any part of the 38,155 shares received under the November 19, 1928 contract, </em>the court erred.</p>

In disposing of tMs contention adversely to the estate, the court below did so on three grounds: (a) Finding of Fact No. 32, made at the time the court originally determined that a general accounting should be made, precludes this question now being raised; (b) W. J. Healey’s sMll and experience in the oil and gas business was an asset of Healey Oil and, since that partnership never terminated, W. J. Healey continued under an obligation to devote his sldll and experience to that partnership; (c) the 38,155 shares of stock did not represent compensation for W. J.

Finding of Fact 32 stated: “In January and February of 1929 [Healey] received from [Healey Petroleum] for his own account for these properties $966,200 in cash, $500,000 face value of preferred stock of the corporation, and <em>J¡!1}91¡.0 </em>shares of common stock of the corporation.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> (emphasis supplied). Finding of Fact 24 stated: “[Healey Petroleum] was formed on November 30, 1928 and on December 3,1928 [Healey] offered all his oil and gas producing properties in McKean County, Pennsylvania, to this new entity, which offer was accepted on that date to the end that a deed dated December 3, 1928, was prepared conveying all these properties including Shepard Bun to [Healey Petroleum] in return for which [Healey] received 5,000 shares of $100 par value <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>preferred stock of [Healey Petroleum], <em>10,000 </em>shares of no par common stock of [Healey Petroleum] and $965,000 in cash.” (Emphasis supplied). Obviously, in regard to the number of shares of common stock transferred as <em>partial </em>consideration for the sale of the five properties, these two findings of facts are contradictory and incompatible and, furthermore, <em>only </em>Finding of Fact 24 is correct under the instant record as to the number of such shares. The court below believed that it was bound in <em>this </em>proceeding by Finding of Fact No. 32 in the <em>prior </em>proceeding. The <em>prior </em>proceeding was to determine whether <em>any </em>accounting had to be made by the estate whereas the present proceeding is to determine <em>the manner </em>in which such acounting should be made. The prior decree of the court below and our affirmation of that decree did not fix the precise or exact liability of the estate: <em>such is the purpose of the present proceeding. </em>In <em>Provident Trust Co. v.

It is only after an account has been stated and adjudicated that the respective liabilities of the parties and their estates can be determined. All that we now decide is that, under the agreement, appellant is required to account. The extent of the accounting, and the respective rights of the parties, must await determination until the account has been filed and adjudicated: [citing eases]”. To the same effect: <em>Ringer v.

In our view, Finding of Fact No. 32 in the prior proceeding does not preclude the estate from raising this question, particularly when it is so obvious that Findings of Fact 32 and 24 are at odds with each other and where the <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>record before the court in this accounting proceeding so clearly shows that Finding of Fact 24 reveals “the truth of the matter”.</p>

Healey should be paid a $60 monthly salary for his services and at the end of six months this salary would be subject to readjustment, a readjustment which never took place. It is Mrs. Greenan’s position that W. J. Healey’s services constituted an asset of Healey Oil to which she, a partner, was entitled not only through 1928 but until the sale in 1948 of Healey Petroleum. So far as compensation is concerned, she appears to contend that, after the lapse of the six months period without readjustment of salary, Healey was entitled either to no compensation or compensation at $60 per month.</p>

J. Healey was entitled to <em>some </em>remuneration over and above his share of profits and, as even the most cursory examination of W. J. Healey’s services would reveal, his services extended far “beyond normal partnership functions”. The entire management, direction and supervision of this partnership rested on W. J.

Mrs. Greenan’s theory, upon which she seeks restitution from W. J. Healey’s estate, is that W. J. Healey committed a fraud upon her and the Healey Trust in concealing the ultimate disposition of Healey Oil assets and thus depriving her and the trust of their fair share of profits arising from a successful employment of such assets. Mrs. Greenan does not — in fact, under this record, could not — contend that W. J. Healey did not devote his skill and efforts to the successful employment of the partnership assets, whether such employment took place under the aegis of Healey Oil or Healey Petroleum. In effect, what Mrs. Greenan is now urging is that, despite the skill and efforts of W. J. Healey which produced such very large profits from the partnership assets, W. J. Healey or his estate is not entitled to any compensation for such skill and effort because he had fraudulently concealed from her how successful were his efforts and that she was entitled to share in the fruits of such success. <em>Restitution, not punishment, is the goal of this proceeding. </em>To direct the restitution to Mrs. Greenan of the profits arising, in large part, from the employment of W.

Healey to his family comes, in part, out of Mrs. Greenan’s half of the common stock and that it is accountable only for the selling prices of such stock. The court below, in effect, held that the Healey estate must be deemed to have kept intact Mrs. Greenan’s half of the common stock and that the shares sold by W. J.

Healey’s services to Healey Petroleum and, <em>to the extent that the 38,155 shares given to Healey represent compensation, </em>the estate should he given credit and the decree of the court below which failed to allow <em>any </em>credit for such compensation is erroneous; (2) that sales of the common stock made to W. J. Healey’s children by Healey must be considered as consisting of W. J. Healey’s own, rather than Mrs. Greenan’s share, of the stock and the decree charging the estate with the entire capital gain realized from this stock was proper; (3) that the allowance of interest from 1913 to August 31, 1960 was erroneous and interest should have been allowed only from February 16, 1959, and, therefore, the decree must be modified in that respect; (4) the allowance of compensation for W. J. Healey’s services to Healey Oil as a credit to the estate was proper; (5) the disallowance of Mrs. Greenan’s claim to share in salaries paid to W. J. Healey by W. J. Healey &amp; Co., Atlas Oil and Healey Petroleum was proper; (6) that the court properly refused to require the estate to account for a share in profits realized by Healey and his family from the drilling partnerships.</p>
