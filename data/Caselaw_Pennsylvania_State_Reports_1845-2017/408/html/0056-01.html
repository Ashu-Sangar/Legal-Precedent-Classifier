At this stage the Borough and School District of Taylor intervened and filed petitions challenging the jurisdiction of the court to entertain these appeals. After hearing, the court below held that the taxpayers should not be prejudiced by the informality of the procedure before the Board nor by irregularities in the Board’s records, stating “the taxpayer entered an appeal from the definitive assessment as soon as it had notice thereof, and made timely appeal . . . from the final decision of the Board . . . .” From the dismissal of the petition attacking jurisdiction these appeals were taken.</p>

Appellants argue that, under the statute, the appeals should have been filed on or before November 1, 1960 or that, under the notice by publication given by the <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>Board of the completion of the rolls and the date of appeals, the appeals should have been filed on or before December 31, 1960; under either theory, the appeals filed in March, 1961 were not timely. Appellants further argue that, since the appeals as filed in March requested an <em>abatement, </em>rather than a reduction in assessment, the appeals were not in writing as required by the statute. The statute requires that the appeals must be in writing, must set forth the assessment complained of and give the aggrieved person’s address for the purpose of giving notice. An examination of the appeals filed indicates that they gave a description of the property, the present assessed valuation, the requested valuation for 1961 and the names of taxpayers’ counsel. In our view, this constituted a substantial compliance with the statute and the appeals as filed were <em>written </em>appeals in every sense of the term. We shall examine, therefore, only the validity of appellants’ position as to the timeliness of the filing of the appeals.</p>

      <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>The statute requires that a person aggrieved by an assessment must take an appeal to the Board on or before November 1st and the Board in the case at bar, despite this provision of the statute, notified all persons aggrieved by an assessment that they must take an appeal on or before December 31, 1960. Both the statutory requirement and the Board’s appeal deadline, however, presuppose the existence of an assessment. In the case at bar, <em>there toas no assessment until on or about February 2J¡, 1961 of which the taxpayers had any notice. </em>In fact, the subject of assessment for 1961 was still a subject for discussion by the Board as late as January 17, 1961. Under the circumstances there was nothing from which the taxpayers could appeal and neither the statutory nor the Board requirement as to the appeal deadline could possibly be satisfied. The failure to have the assessment roll completed on or before October 1, 1960 was that of the Board and the failure to have an assessment of taxpayers’ properties made so that taxpayers could file an appeal on or before December 31, 1960 was likewise that of the Board. If the argument of appellants be accepted what was the assessment from which taxpayers could have appealed within the statutory or the Board’s deadline for appeals? The Board’s failure to comply with the mandated duties under the statute or to make an assessment of taxpayers’ properties on or before the December 31st deadline should not be visited upon the taxpayer. To hold otherwise would constitute a denial of due process and fair procedure, both of which must be accorded by quasi-judicial tribunals as well as the courts: <em>Bily v. Allegheny County Board of Assessment, </em><a href="/pa/353/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="353 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="465970" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0049-01">353 Pa. 49</a>, 52, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%20250" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="44 A.2d 250">44 A. 2d 250</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> As Mr. Justice Clark stated in <em>Breithaupt v.

    <p id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[264,749,1157,1134]]]'>Prom October 21, 1960 until January 27, 1961, the Board and the taxpayers were engaged in discussions of assessments of the coal properties for 1961. The assessment and valuation of coal properties is highly complicated and involved and presents many and varied problems of engineering and a proper assessment and valuation can only be arrived at after a long and extensive investigation by the assessing authorities. Furthermore, rightly or wrongly, the Board, as a practical matter, in the fixing of an assessment of coal properties balances two interests: the interests of the municipalities which in the anthracite coal field look primarily to the coal companies for the tax monies to run their government and the interests of the taxpayers who are engaged in a “sick” industry and who own some coal properties which have been so affected by water as to render difficult, if not impossible, the removal of the coal. Such does not excuse but it may well explain the Board’s delay in fixing the initial assessment of the taxpayers’ coal properties. Such delay, however, should not penalize the taxpayers.</p>
    <p id="b94-6" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[261,1893,1155,479]],["BL_95.1",95,[184,337,1149,807]]]'>Furthermore, we fully agree with the court below that the informality of the Board’s proceedings should not prejudice taxpayers. In <em>Susquehanna Collieries Company’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/335/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="335 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1193047" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0337-01">335 Pa. 337</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20831" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 A.2d 831">6 A. 2d 831</a>, at page 344, we stated: “The failure of the county Boards of Revision to make proper records of their proceedings has resulted in confusion in many cases and has been commented on by the appellate courts, [citing cases] It is true that the statutes prescribe no form of pro<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>cedure, and it is common knowledge that the hearings before these Boards are conducted with extreme informality. . . . Since a Board of Revision in acting upon appeals functions as a quasi-judicial tribunal, there is no reason why it could not employ the services of a stenographer to prepare such minutes as would disclose the substance of the appeal. These minutes would eliminate guesswork in subsequent stages of litigation, and would preserve the rights of the taxpayer and the county.” Had the proceedings before the Board in the case at bar been conducted in the manner prescribed by the statute the taxpayers would have known exactly when an assessment was made and they could have appealed on or before the statutorily prescribed deadline.</p>

However, the fact that the provisions of the 1931 Act are mandatory does not aid appellants in the instant factual situation. Noncompliance by the Board with the provisions of the Act rendered <em>impossible </em>a compliance by the taxpayers with the “time of appeal” provisions of the Act. It was certainly not the legislative intent to deprive a taxpayer of Ms rights because the assessing authority failed to perform its duties within the mandated time. To hold otherwise would completely nullify the rights of the taxpayers to due process.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Furthermore, in our view, the taxpayers did exhaust their statutory remedy before they appealed to the Court of Common Pleas.
