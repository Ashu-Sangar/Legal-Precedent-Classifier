A party to a fair trade contract does not, therefore, enforce mere contractual obligations when he brings an action under the Act of 1935 against a non-signatory. Rather, he is implementing a set of statutory rights which entitle him to designate the resale price of retail items. <em>Sunbeam Corp. v.

The lower court was correct when it observed that section 1014 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law in no way restricts the maintenance of such an action in tort by an unregistered foreign corporation.</p>

Parties cannot by agreement eliminate this requirement and confer power upon the court to enter an injunction despite lack of compliance with the statutory provision. It is fundamental that parties to a divorce action cannot waive the requirement that the <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>libellant prove tlie residence necessary to establish the court’s jurisdiction; nor can they by stipulation agree that the residence necessary to establish jurisdiction is complied with. Indeed, it is never within the power of litigants to invest a court with any power not conferred upon it by law. See <em>Bluestone v.

Here, as in the requirement of residence in divorce actions, because of the overriding public interest in price fixing litigation, the courts will not enforce fair trade provisions against non-signers unless all the statutory requirements are satisfied. <em>Gulf Oil Corporation v.

None of these conditions are here present. Absent the necessary proof of compliance with the statutory prerequisites of the Fair Trade Act, appellant has not demonstrated that it is entitled to relief by the courts. A preliminary injunction would, therefore, be improper at this time.</p>
