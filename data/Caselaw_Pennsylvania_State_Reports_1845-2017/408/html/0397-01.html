    <p id="b428-8" data-blocks='[["BL_428.11",428,[236,1113,1157,1072]]]'>In this equity action, Abraham White (White), an individual, and four Philadelphia Bealty Boards (Boards) sought to enjoin the City of Philadelphia (City), the Philadelphia Housing Authority (Authority), and the School District of Philadelphia (School District) from the enforcement of an ordinance of the Council of the City of Philadelphia (Council), known as Ordinance No. 2530, and to have said ordinance declared invalid and' unconstitutional.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After the dismissal of preliminary objections to the complaint and the filing of identical answers by the City, Authority and School District, the matter was heard before Judge Leo Weinrott and argued before the court en banc of Court of. Common Pleas No. 5 of Philadelphia County. That court unanimously enjoined the City, the Authority and. the School District from proceeding under the ordinance holding that the ordinance whs invalid and that the City had exceeded its powers under the enabling statute, the Housing Authorities Law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The validity of that ruling is attacked on these three appeals.</p>

      <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>Over eleven years ago, the Authority received from the Public Housing Administration (PHA), a federal agency which administers the program of federal housing,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> a program reservation for 10,000 units of low rent housing to be developed in the City. On June 19, 1950, the Authority entered into a so-called Cooperation Agreement with the City and School District to assist in providing low rent housing units. By January 14, 1958, the Authority had developed projects containing 10,000 units and the Cooperation Agreement was amended to provide an additional 10,000 units.</p>
    <p id="b429-3" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[198,949,1153,856]]]'>The Authority then decided to embark upon an <em>entirely new concept </em>of low rent housing, i.e., the acquisition of existing structures and buildings, not necessarily contiguous, for the purpose of rehabilitation of such structures and buildings and the conversion of such structures and buildings into low rent housing units. For that purpose, the Authority determined to utilize the so-called Haddington area which is comprised of 60 blocks, bounded on the east by 52nd Street, on the west by 63rd Street, on the south by Market Street and on the north by Girard Avenue, all in Philadelphia. To that end, the Authority on July 31, 1958 entered into a so-called Annual Contributions Contract with the PHA under which PHA was to contribute the necessary funds for the acquisition of 200 existing dwelling units in the Haddington area.</p>

The important fea<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>tures of Ordinance No. 2106A are: (a) its enlargement of the definition of “project” to include “The acquisition of existing structures and tracts of land, <em>not necessarily contiguous, </em>located in a general area, for re-use and development by the Authority” (emphasis supplied) and (b) its requirement that such acquisition should not be made until City Council had first approved the site and the maximum number of acquisitions to be made therein for re-use and development and until the Authority secured an appraisal of the property to be acquired and the approval of PHA of the purchase price.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[239,997,1155,476]]]'>On December 11, 1958, the Authority conducted a public hearing with respect to the selection of the Haddington area as the site and, after such public hearing, the Authority, by resolution, approved this area as the site for the project. On January 27, 1959, City Council passed Ordinance No. 2530 which approved the acquisition by the Authority of not more than 200 structures and tracts of land for re-use and development in the Haddington area.</p>
    <p id="b430-6" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[237,1484,1153,739]]]'>In accordance with this approval, the Authority, <em>although possessed of the power of eminent domain, </em>decided only to <em>purchase </em>homes, offered voluntarily for sale, which needed rehabilitation and which were located in a block which would benefit by the rehabilitation. The record indicates that, under federal regulations, the Authority was required to purchase homes only in wholly residential districts and was not permitted to acquire any building or structure contiguous to a nonconforming use. Upon acquisition by the Authority, the structure would be rehabilitated and utilized as a low rent housing unit. The Authority had purchased and acquired forty homes in the area at the time this action was instituted.</p>

Appellees contend that: (1) the councilmanic action is outside the scope of the Housing Authorities Law of 1937, supra; (2) that, if it is within the scope of such act, the act is unconstitutional as constituting (a) an improper delegation of legislative power and (b) a violation of due process of law; (3) that they do have a standing to challenge the councilmanic action.</p>
