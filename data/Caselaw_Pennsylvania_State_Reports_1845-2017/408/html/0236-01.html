    <p id="b268-10" data-blocks='[["BL_268.12",268,[255,1338,1153,197]]]'>(1) On February 7,-1950, Sydney Klein and others conveyed a fee simple title in the real estate involved to Amos Porter and Essleen Porter, who were described in the deed as man and wife.</p>

At the same time, they ¿xécuted and delivered a bond and warrant to confess judgment in double the amount of the principal sum due under the mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b268-12" data-blocks='[["BL_268.14",268,[252,1989,1154,263]]]'>(8) Sydney Klein subsequently assigned his complete interest in the bond and mortgage to the Mortgage Service Corporation of Pittsburgh, which later reassigned the bond and mortgage to the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Greene County.</p>

Judgment pro <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>confesso was entered therein on November 27, 1951, in favor of the plaintiff. The court decreed that Essleen Davenport was not the wife of Amos Porter and that title to the mortgaged property was held as tenants in common.</p>
    <p id="b269-3" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[195,626,1148,208]]]'>(5) Later, on December 14, 1951, Amos Porter and Essleen Porter by deed conveyed their interest in the property to Essleen Davenport. This deed was not recorded until September 10, 1958.</p>
    <p id="b269-4" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[204,853,1140,97]]]'>(6) On August 15, 1958, Essleen Davenport (Porter) was killed in an automobile accident.</p>
    <p id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.6",269,[194,970,1148,152]]]'>(7) On September 25, 1959, letters of administration in Essleen Davenport’s Estate were granted to her daughter, Yesslen Harrell.</p>
    <p id="b269-6" data-blocks='[["BL_269.7",269,[194,1141,1147,205]]]'>(8) The administratrix of the estate instituted an action in ejectment wherein Amos Porter was the named defendant. A final judgment was entered for the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b269-7" data-blocks='[["BL_269.8",269,[191,1366,1149,262]]]'>(9) On June 10, 1959, the mortgage being in default, the mortgagee, First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Greene County, entered judgment on the bond and warrant accompanying the mortgage against Amos Porter only.</p>
    <p id="b269-8" data-blocks='[["BL_269.9",269,[191,1647,1147,155]]]'>(10) On the same day, a writ of fieri facias issued on the judgment, the sheriff levied upon the mortgaged property and advertised it for sale.</p>
    <p id="b269-9" data-blocks='[["BL_269.10",269,[189,1818,1148,259]]]'>(11) Yesslen Harrell, the administratrix of Essleen Davenport’s Estate, visited the offices of the mortgage loan association, paid $500 on the mortgage, requested and secured a postponement of the sale. The writ of execution was stayed.</p>
    <p id="b269-10" data-blocks='[["BL_269.11",269,[187,2097,1147,267]]]'>(12) On October 7, 1959, an alias writ of fieri facias issued. The sheriff again levied upon the mortgaged property and readvertised it for sale on November 2, 1959. The defendant in the writ was Amos Porter, the judgment debtor.</p>
    <p id="b270-3" data-blocks='[["BL_270.3",270,[255,358,1157,426]]]'>
      <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>(13) No notice of the issuance of this alias writ, or the intended sale, was personally served on Vesslen Harrell, the administratrix. However, personal service was given to Amos Porter and, in addition, the sale was advertised in the newspapers and notices of the sale were posted on the property. In these notices, Amos Porter was listed as the sole owner, or reputed owner, of the property.</p>
    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[250,796,1156,259]]]'>(14) The property was sold by the sheriff on November 2, 1959. An innocent third party, one Joseph Pierce, was the successful bidder for the sum of $2000. He instructed the sheriff to name Samuel Gladstone as grantee in the sheriff’s deed.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[246,1068,1156,478]]]'>(15) On November 6, 1959, the sheriff and the loan association were served with a copy of a petition to open the judgment and to set aside the sheriff’s sale, signed by Vesslen Harrell, as administratrix of the Estate of Essleen Davenport. Therein, it was stated, inter alia, that Amos Porter and Essleen Porter or Davenport were never married and hence not man and wife. The petition was presented to the court on November 9, 1959.</p>
    <p id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.6",270,[240,1555,1158,371]]]'>(16) On November 16, 1959, no exceptions having-been filed, the sheriff’s sale was confirmed absolutely. On November 24, 1959, the sheriff’s deed was filed of record. On March 19, 1960, the sheriff’s return on the sale was confirmed nisi. On March 30, 1960, no exceptions having been filed, the sheriff’s return was confirmed absolutely.</p>
    <p id="b270-7" data-blocks='[["BL_270.7",270,[239,1937,1153,148]]]'>(17) On December 2, 1959, the court entered an order, dismissing the petition to open judgment and set aside the sale.</p>
    <p id="b270-8" data-blocks='[["BL_270.8",270,[235,2099,1156,266]],["BL_271.1",271,[180,355,1147,151]]]'>(18) Reargument was subsequently granted. Joseph Pierce and Samuel Gladstone were permitted to intervene. Depositions were taken, wherein Vesslen Harrell testified that her mother was married to her father, Jack Davenport, who was still living; that they <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>were never divorced; and, that her mother never married Amos Porter. On January 18, 1962, the court again dismissed the petition. This appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b271-4" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[175,662,1149,316]]]'>This request was correctly denied. Aside from the rather dubious legal right of a stranger to the judgment involved to attack its validity, no meritorious defense was pleaded, which is vital in such a proceeding. In fact, there is no contention that the mortgage is not in default; nor denial that the debt is due and owing.</p>
    <p id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.6",271,[170,989,1150,753]]]'>If we consider it as a motion to strike, it still lacks legal foundation. The judgment, as entered, is valid.

The appellees, on the other hand, contend: (1) that Amos and Essleen owned the property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship as of the date of the mortgage; (2) that any subsequent deeds of conveyance or court actions, <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>regarding the marital relationship of the mortgagors, could not affect the rights of the mortgagee, who was not a party thereto; (3) that upon the death of Essleen, complete title vested in the surviving Amos; (4) that, therefore, when the writ of execution issued Amos was the only party in interest and notice to others was not required; (5) that, in any event, the estate whose rights rise no higher than the original mortgagor is now estopped from asserting that Amos and Essleen were not in fact man and wife since they falsely represented themselves so to be and upon this representation the credit was extended.</p>
    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[253,1007,1159,1131]]]'>The deed of February 7, 1950, did not operate to convey an estate by the entireties.

Nor did it create a joint tenancy or dual ownership with the right of survivorship. Such an intention must be clearly expressed in the deed to be legally effective, where the grantees are not, in fact, man and wife. A deed which merely describes the grantees as man and wife, when in fact they are not, is not sufficient: <em>Teacher v.

Then, as a result of the deed of conveyance of December 14, 1951, Essleen Davenport became the sole owner of the title to the property, and her estate was such upon the date the writ of execution issued: See, <em>Benedict v.

L. 755, §62, 12 PS §2443, which was then extant, and required (1) the posting of a handbill on the property at least ten days before the sale giving notice of the hour, day and date of sale, and a description of the property; and, (2) notice to the defendant. However, the Act of «July 22, 1919, P. L. 1089, §1, 45 PS §81, which supplemented the Act of 1836, was also operative and controlling.

Superior Ct. 29</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.2d%20789" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="151 A.2d 789">151 A. 2d 789</a> <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>(1959). Neither is the date the lien affixed. The mortgage and warrant are valid and an alias writ of execution with proper notice may still be pursued. We further consider it significant that the mortgagee accepted a payment on the indebtedness from the estate a few months before the alias writ issued and was thus given notice of the fact that the estate enjoyed some interest in the property and assumed payment of the debt.</p>
    <p id="b275-4" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[169,777,1148,642]]]'>The fact that the property was purchased at the sale by an innocent third party is not controlling in the absence of proper notice. The sale was a nullity and, in such an event, it operates only as an equitable assignment of the mortgage to the third party purchaser. See, Wiltsie Mortgage Foreclosure, §348 (4th ed. 1927). A search of the public records would have disclosed to the intending purchaser the then real owner of the property and lack of proper notice. The rule in sheriff’s sale of mortgage foreclosed properties is caveat emptor. See, <em>Vandyke v. Wells, </em><a href="/pa/103/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="103 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="449184" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0049-01">103 Pa. 49</a> (1883).</p>
