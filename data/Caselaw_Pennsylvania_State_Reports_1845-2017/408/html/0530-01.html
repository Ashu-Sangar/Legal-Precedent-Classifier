Testatrix, a spinster, left three wills in <em>physical </em>existence: (1) a lawyer-prepared will dated January 29, 1958 (herein called first will) to which there was a codicil dated August 20, 1958; (2) a will drawn by testatrix dated June 25, 1959 (herein called second will); (3) a holographic will dated June 26, 1959 (herein called third will). The third will was probated by the Register of Wills of Blair County on July 1, 1959. Three and one-half months later Mary P. Turner (appellee)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> appealed from the probate of the will on the ground that the second will should be probated with the third will.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> After hearing, the Orphans’ Court of Blair County sus<a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>tained the appeal and opened the decree of probate to enable the Register to act upon a petition for the probate of the second with the third will. From that decree this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b563-4" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[173,572,1149,522]]]'>At the outset the respective contentions of the parties should be clarified. Testatrix’ estate, valued at approximately $69,000, was composed of household and personal effects inventoried at approximately $500, cash (or its equivalent) approximating $14,500 and securities inventoried at approximately $54,000. <em>Concededla, </em>the third will effected a testamentary disposition of the household and personal effects and cash. The instant controversy involves only the disposition of testatrix’ securities.</p>

Appellee contends that no revocation by implication of the second will has taken place and, in particular, there exists no inconsistency in the disposition of testatrix’ “stocks and other investments” in the second will and the gift to appellant of the “balance” of her “money”, the latter being construed in its narrow sense of “cash”.</p>

Turner, James W. Turner and their wives; (e) the first will, changing the provisions of previous wills, was occasioned by reason of the death of James L. Turner in 1957; (f) testatrix’ very close friend and legatee in previous wills, a Miss E. K.

Kurtz, testatrix’ lawyer for approximately twenty years, drew the first will for testatrix on January 29, 1958. James L. Turner having recently died, testatrix explained to Attorney Kurtz that she wanted his “share” of the estate to be given to Mary Turner, his widow. This first will, containing an ex<a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>press revocation clause, provided for testatrix’ burial and bronze or marble plates for the graves of herself and brother, the care of her parents’ burial plot, bequests of $1,000 to each of her two nephews’ children, gave “the remaining <em>cash” </em>in equal shares to appellant, appellee and Miss Eyre and then gave testatrix’ “stocks and other investments” in equal shares to the same three persons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The first will further directed that for three months after her death the expenses of her apartment be borne by the estate, that household effects and personal belongings be given to Miss Eyre and Attorney Kurtz and Miss Eyre act as the personal representatives. In the codicil to that will — prepared by Attorney Kurtz — testatrix directed that the trust provisions for Miss Eyre include her share of the “cash” and that “the inheritance tax on all my bequests be paid by my said estate.”</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[162,1283,1152,751]]]'>Miss Eyre died on May 29, 1959 and on June 8, 1959, at testatrix’ request, Attorney Kurtz visited testatrix. Testatrix indicated that, due to Miss Eyre’s death, she Avanted to change her will but she was too weak at the time to discuss the contemplated changes and she gave the original of the first will and codicil thereto to Attorney Kurtz requesting that he keep them until she was able to make the contemplated changes. On June 23 and June 24 Attorney Kurtz visited testatrix but again she was too weak to discuss the contemplated changes and, on the latter occasion, testatrix was informed by Attorney Kurtz that he would be out of town for several days but would see her again on June 30.</p>

For that purpose she utilized an <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>unsigned <em>copy of the first will </em>upon which she made various alterations, additions and interlineations in her own handwriting. Testatrix struck out the provision concerning plates for the graves of her brother and herself and increased the amount of the gift for the care of her parents’ burial plot by crossing out the word “two” and writing above it the word “three”. By striking out the figure “$1000” and inserting “(2) Two”, “2 Thousand” or “2,000” she sought to increase the bequests to her nephews’ children from $1000 to $2000. The provision in the first will providing for a division of testatrix’ “stocks and other investments” into “three equal parts” (one each for appellant, appellee and Miss Eyre) was altered by the insertion of the word “two” instead of “three” and by striking out the provisions for distribution of one of the parts to Miss Eyre. The provisions for the trust for Miss Eyre, for the maintenance of the apartment for three months after her death, for the gift to Miss Eyre of the household effects and personal belongings were stricken and Miss Eyre was eliminated as a personal representative. Initially, the First National Bank of Altoona and, later, the appellant was substituted in Miss Eyre’s place as a personal representative. Testatrix struck out the date in the testimonium clause “29th day of January A. D. 1958” and inserted in place thereof “25th day of June'1959”. On the signature line testatrix affixed her signature, an unwitnessed signature the genuineness of which is not questioned.</p>

On this instrument the date “June 26,-59” appears on the upper right-hand corner of the first page and below, in the top middle of the page, “My last will and testament”. This will provides the place of testatrix’ burial, that her debts be paid, that the expenses of maintaining her apartment for three months be paid to appellant and that <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>“all <em>money </em>derived from sale” of the household furnishings be given to appellant and that her jewelry and china be sent to appellee for division “among her children”. Testatrix inserted the provisions found in the second will for the care of her parents’ burial plot and the provision found in the codicil “I direct that the inheritance tax on all . . . my bequests be paid by my said estate.” After appointing the First National Bank of Altoona and Attorney Kurtz as her executors, testatrix inserted a testimonium clause and signed her name. Thereafter in the will testatrix gave her “hand-painted chocolate set to Mrs. H. W. Turner” adding that the rest of her handpainted china “. . . go to . . . [appellee] ... to be divided among her children.” Testatrix then stated “I give to each person named below, two thousand dollars” and set forth the names and addresses of four legatees,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> adding that a Mrs. Lucy Turner be given $100. Testatrix then provided <em>“The balance of my money to be given to Mr. James W. Turner </em>[appellant] . . ., now living with me,” (emphasis supplied) and added a testimonium clause in which she used June 26, 1959 as the new date. Testatrix then drew a signature line upon which she signed her name and two neighbors were called in to sign as subscribing witnesses. On June 27 testatrix sent for the same witnesses, told them she had accidentally destroyed the last page of her will and asked them to witness a new page. The witnesses signed the new page and, at testatrix’ request, the date of June 26, 1959 was repeated. Testatrix died in her sleep some time on June 28.</p>

Of course, that is not and never has been the law. ... It is not what a Judge, if he had been sitting in [testatrix’s] armchair, and moralizing, thinks that the testatrix should in equity and in good conscience have done . . . .” The language of this will and the circumstances surrounding its preparation command the result we have reached.

Were there, no <em>other </em>guideposts in this will as to testatrix’ intent we would be inclined to agree with the court in the significance to be attached to the double use of the word “money”, but such other guideposts weakened considerably any such significance. The interpretation in a broad sense of the provision providing for a gift of the balance of the “money” does render superfluous the earlier provision employing the term “money” but that is neither unusual nor uncommon in home drawn or “do-it-yourself” wills; under the factual situation in the case at bar any significance to be attached is very slight.

Therefore, the court concluded that testatrix’ “plain direction [“The balance of my money to be given to James W. Turner”] is that James W. Turner is to have the excess of the bank funds over <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>and above the sums specifically bequeathed”. The fallacy of this conclusion is evident; the court completely overlooked that which the testatrix did not overlook. From reading the third will it is clear beyond question that the testatrix realized that, in addition to the payment of the pecuniary legacies, payment would have to be made of her debts, her funeral expenses, for perpetual care of her parents’ burial plot and death taxes; in fact, testatrix in her will not only directed such payments but, in the case of the taxes, directed how they were to be paid. While there is no direct proof of knowledge on the part of testatrix, it is only logical to assume that testatrix, portrayed upon this record as a highly intelligent woman, knew that her executors and attorney would have to be paid as well as other expenses incurred in the settlement of her estate.

In our view, the absence of such an express clause of revocation is of little significance when one considers the third will in its entirety. The court also pointed out that in the sealed envelope which was marked “My will 1959” were included not only the third will but also the altered copy of the first will and concluded that “the inclusion of both documents therein was solely the act of the testatrix and that her purpose in so doing was that the rest of her property— namely her stocks and investments — undisposed of by the holographic instrument should pass in accordance with the provisions of the altered carbon copy.” In appellant’s brief this conclusion of the court is com<a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>plétely answered: “The court in effect read the inscription as saying ‘everything inside is my will’. The inscription does not say that; its message is simply, ‘my will is inside’. We do not gainsay that message by treating the third will as the only effective one: it was in fact inside. Here the unsigned copy of the first will’s codicil becomes important: it was inside the envelope and yet it was admittedly inoperative. This disproves the notion that everything inside was part of the will. If despite the inscription that envelope could contain one inoperative paper, why not two? They were the work sheets for the will, and it was quite natural for Miss Turner to keep them with it.”</p>

Turner, the widow of James Lisle Turner, it is urged that testatrix could not have intended to prefer the former to the latter. We cannot <em>know </em>with any certainty why testatrix made such preference although it is evident she did. The record indicates that, when the third will was executed, both James W. Turner and his wife, living with the testatrix, were in such a state of health as to be termed “invalids” by testatrix.

    <p class="author" id="Amc" data-blocks='[["BL_579.6",579,[760,856,531,33]]]'>Mr. Chief Justice Bell:</p>
    <p id="b579-6" data-blocks='[["BL_579.7",579,[190,909,1148,197]]]'>Mr. Justice Jones has ably stated the law and clearly set forth the facts, as well as the narrow question involved. I regret I must differ with him in the inferences and conclusions which he has drawn therefrom.</p>
    <p id="b579-7" data-blocks='[["BL_579.8",579,[186,1133,1151,581]]]'>Justice Jones holds that the word “money” in the residuary bequest in Miss Turner’s third will meant and included not only “money”, but also “stocks and other investments”. Testatrix drew and signed her second will and the next day drew and signed her third will, and two days later died. Although testatrix was an invalid, it was agreed, (a) that she had testamentary capacity, and (b) that she was fond of all the legatees, and (c) that at all times testatrix was a very intelligent woman who knew the difference between cash and stocks and other investments.</p>
    <p id="b579-8" data-blocks='[["BL_579.9",579,[183,1740,1150,643]],["BL_580.1",580,[237,369,1161,1567]]]'>The most difficult problem in connection with wills is the interpretation of a holographic will, and this will is no exception. My reasons for believing that the third will repealed, by implication, only those parts of the second will which are inconsistent with the second, are as follows: Testatrix demonstrated that she knew the difference between cash or money, on the one hand, and stocks or investments, on the other hand, in her first and second wills, and this knowledge is admitted by the parties. In her second will she changed the equal division of her stocks and other investments from three persons to two persons, because of the recent <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>death of one of the three original legatees. In the third, as well as in the second will she gave cash to four named nephews and nieces — $8,000 in the second will, $8,100 in the third will. In the second will she provided: “All the stocks and other investments of which I die possessed or entitled to Mary P. Turner and James W. Turner”. In her third will she gave “all money derived from sale of home furnishings to James W. Turner”. She then gave “the balance of my money to be.given to' James W. Turner”, thereby (according to the majority) giving James W. Turner all her stocks and other investments and completely eliminating Mary P. Turner (of. whom it is admitted she was very fond), from any share in these investments. The majority assert that in this third will testatrix (a) clearly showed that she used the word “money” in its usual narrow sense, i.e., “cash” when she gave to James W. Turner “all money derived from sale of home furnishings”, but (b) used “money” in its broad sense, i.e., property, stocks and other investments, when she gave James W. Turner “the balance of my money”. Considering the fact that this testatrix knew the difference between money and stocks and other investments, and that she clearly used the word “money” as meaning cash in the gift to James W. Turner of “all money derived from sale of home furnishings”, I can find no justification for holding that she used “money” <em>in an entirely different sense </em>when she gave “the balance of money to be given to James W. Turner”.</p>

    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[194,575,1147,143]]]'>I would therefore hold that both the second will and the third will should be admitted to probate and construed as above set forth.</p>
