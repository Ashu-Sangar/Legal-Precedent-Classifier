        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno:\nThis Court has affirmed the conviction in this case on the Opinion of the Superior Court, and thus accepts it as its ovm. There are some statements in that Opinion with which I cannot agree. For instance, the Majority says: \u201cThe evidence established that Ornato was operating a lottery\u201d.\nHow can the Majority make such a statement when the jury specifically acquitted Ornato on the charge of operating a lottery? Is the Majority changing the meaning of the Word \u201cestablished\u201d? Does it intend to say that the verdict of a jury has no validity? Are we now minimizing the sanctity of a jury\u2019s verdict? Are we now juridically to say that the verdict of a jury has no weight in so far as facts are concerned? And if it does not decide the facts, what does it decide?\nThe Majority seeks to give one erroneous statement authority by quoting another erroneous statement. It quotes from the Superior Court in the case of Com. v. Parrotto, 189 Pa. Superior Ct. 415, where it said: \u201cAn acquittal cannot be interpreted as a specific finding in relation to some of the evidence.\u201d\nIn that case it also said that \u201cconsistency in a verdict in a criminal case is not necessary.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t there be consistency in a verdict which may involve the life or liberty of the accused?\nThe epigrammatic terseness and the show of authority with which an illogical statement is made does not supply the missing logic. In the Temple of Reason, an unreasonable statement gains no authority because of the elevation of the pulpit from which it is proclaimed.\nIn point of convincingness, how does the statement: \u201cConsistency in a verdict in a criminal case is not necessary\u201d differ from the statement that: \u201cReliability in a verdict in a criminal case is not necessary\u201d or \u201cJustice in a verdict in a criminal case is not necessary\u201d? There is no limit to the absurd declarations which can be announced if one is disposed to ignore logic, reason, rationalization and the constitutional guarantees which go with trial by jury.\nTo say that \u201cconsistency in a verdict in a criminal case is not necessary\u201d is to ntter tlie ultimate in inconsistency because the word \u201cverdict\u201d itself means consistency, it means agreement; it means a meeting of the minds without contradiction; it means a unanimous concord in thinking and conclusion.\nAnd then, why does the Court say that consistency is not necessary in \u00e1 verdict in a criminal case? Does this mean that it is necessary in a civil case? And if so, does this further mean that a person\u2019s good name, his liberty and even his very life, when placed in jeopardy in a trial, are of less consequence than his property?\nI believe that the defendant is entitled to a new trial because of inconsistency in the verdict. I believe also that his exercise of the right of cross-examination was unnecessarily curtailed and that, for that reason alone, he is entitled to a new trial.
