        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nJohn T. Mikaloff died.testate on September 1, 1928, survived by his widow, Emma, and by his five children of a previous marriage. In his will, after bequeathing to his widow an annuity, the testator directed that \u201cthe residue of my estate be invested for the period of thirty years, and the income therefrom paid quarterly and the principal at the end of thirty years, as follows: One-fifth thereof to my daughter, Mary Alice Gordon, and then to her two children, Clifford and Gladys; one-fifth thereof to my son, George F. Mikaloff; one-fifth thereof to my son, William Oscar Mikaloff; one-fifth thereof to my daughter, Grace Elizabeth Jones; one-fifth thereof to my son, John P.' Mikaloff, Jr.; and in the event of the death of any of my said children, then to their children respectively; if they leave no children surviving them, respectively, then to the other residuaries.\u201d\nThe thirty year period designated in the residuary clause has expired, and we are called upon to determine what is the proper distribution of the principal of the estate. The two appellants here, one the heir-at-law and executrix of the estate of widow Emma, the other,- the sole beneficiary and executrix of the estate of testator\u2019s son, William Oscar Mikaloff, who died within the thirty year term without leaving children, stand to gain only \u25a0 if the principal of the testator\u2019s estate should pass under the intestate laws. Their objection to a distribution under the will to Grace Elizabeth Mikaloff, the sole child of the testator to survive the thirty year term, and to the children of Mary, George and John,, is- on the ground that testator\u2019s attempted gift of the' principal violates the rule against perpetuities.\nThe court below did not pass upon appellants\u2019 remoteness objection. The learned court found that a family agreement executed subsequent to the testator\u2019s death, in which the widow Emma and son William joined, estopped appellants in their representative capacities from contesting the validity of the will. Since we think it clear that no violation of the rule against perpetuities has occurred, it is unnecessary for us to pass upon the appellants\u2019 contention that they have the right to contest the validity of the residuary provision. For the purpose of these appeals, we assume appellants\u2019 present standing to object.\nThe rule against perpetuities is concerned with the vesting of estates. In its simplest expression, the rule commands that a future interest, to be valid, must vest with absolute certainty within a life or lives-in-being at the creation of the interest- and twenty-one years, Leach, Perpetuities in a Nutshell, 51 Harv. L. R. 638, 639 (1938) ; the rule is long-established that the court should construe an interest as vested whenever possible. Bald Estate, 385 Pa. 176, 122 A. 2d 294 (1956).\nAmple authority exists for the proposition that where a testator gives a present gift of income from specific property with the principal thereof to be given over at a future time to the same taker, even where there is the possibility of divestment of either the income or principal prior to the time the principal is to be turned over, the taker takes an immediate vested interest in the principal. See Reed\u2019s Appeal, 118 Pa. 215, 11 Atl. 787 (1888) ; Long\u2019s Estate, 228 Pa. 594, 77 Atl. 924 (1910) ; Harrar\u2019s Estate, 244 Pa. 542, 91 Atl. 503 (1914). Indeed, the gift in the Long case is so similar in all particulars to the will before us that we need do nothing more than cite that decision in order to hold vested the gifts to the named children here. In Long, the testator ordered that the residue of his estate be held in trust for twenty years, during which time any surplus accumulations were to be divided into six equal shares and distributed to five named children and the children of a deceased .child, \u201cand if any of my children should die without leaving any descendants, before the expiration of twenty years after my decease, then such shares shall go to the other legatees share and share alike. . . . At the termination of twenty years the [trustee] shall sell said real and personal property and divide the same in six shares to be distributed as is provided with reference to income of same.\u201d The Court, after an exhaustive review of the relevant Pennsylvania authorities, and notwithstanding the possibility of divestment within the twenty year period, held that the interest to the children was clearly vested. It adopt\u00e9d the rationale of \u25a0 the decisions. reviewed therein that the testator, by giving the immediate enjoyment of the principal by virtue of the present gift of the income, intended a present vested gift in the principal, with only payment postponed. On the basis of the general proposition recited above, the Long decision and its rationale, we hold the gift here to the named children of the testator of the income from the residue of the estate \u201cand the principal at the end of thirty years\u201d was an immediate vested gift of the principal. As such, it is not subject to the rule against perpetuities.\nMoreover, the contention that the divesting interest held by the grandchildren or other residuaries violates the rule cannot be sustained. As each named child owned a one-fifth interest absolutely from the time of testator\u2019s death, it is the absolute interest which is divested. By necessity, each possible divestment in the thirty year period could only occur upon the death of a named child who qualifies as a life-in-being.\nAppellants argue that the divesting interest taken by the grandchildren or other residuaries upon the death of a named child during the thirty year period is of the income only, while the gift of the principal is a separate interest, contingent upon the grandchildren or other residuaries surviving the thirty year term. Under their view, the divesting interest in the principal would be invalid since it would have been possible for all the named children to have died immediately after testator, leaving more than a twenty-one year period remaining before it could be determined which grandchildren would take. As support for their contention, appellants direct us to our decision in the case of Linck v. Plankenhorn, 286 Pa. 319, 133 Atl. 510 (1926). The clause in the Linck case, held violative of the rule against perpetuities, provided that the \u201crents, issues and profits\u201d from certain properties should be given to four named children for a period of thirty-five years. \u201cAt the determination of the said period of thirty-five years,\u201d if there were no living issue of the named children, then the four named children would take the properties, but if there were any living issue of any of the four named children, then the issue would take. It is sufficient for our purposes to point out the significant distinction between the will in the Linde case and the one before us now. In Linde, the gift of principal was necessarily a contingent future interest because the testator expressly required that the determination of who would be the taker of the principal could not be made until the expiration of thirty-five years. Here, however, no such contingency was spelled out. The children of John T. Mikaloff took an immediate vested interest in the principal subject only to the contingency of divestment. The operation of the divesting interest was in no way made dependent upon the expiration of the thirty year term \u2014 it was expressly to operate \u201cin the event of the death\u201d of the testator\u2019s children. And since the determination of who would take the named children\u2019s absolute interest by divestment is made at the death of a life-in-being, as mentioned above, the divesting interest satisfies the rule against perpetuities.\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 costs.\nMr. Justice Bell dissents on the ground that the disposition violates the rule against perpetuities.",
