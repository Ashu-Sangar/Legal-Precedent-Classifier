        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Bok,\nThis is a suit by husband and wife arising out of an accident to the wife, who was struck by defendant\u2019s ear while she was afoot and crossing Main Street in Spring City, Chester County. A jury awarded her $8000 and her husband $3236.50, and they filed separate appeals when the court below granted judgment for defendant n.o.v. Both appeals were quashed for some reason not now of concern, and later the wife\u2019s appeal alone was reinstated. This is what we will now consider. Defendant also filed a motion for a new trial based on the conventional reasons, but it has not been pressed or argued.\nJudgment Avas given because the court below considered the Avife guilty of contributory negligence.\nThe evidence discloses that she was going to work at seven o\u2019clock in the morning of June 29, 1955. It was light, clear, and dry. Her husband, driving their car, let her off at the curb opposite the entrance to the plant where she worked. To get there she had to cross Main Street, which ran north and south and Avas about thirty-three feet wide. Her point of crossing was midAvay in a block some 1200 feet long, and cars were parked solidly along the' east and west sides of the street. Mr. Gordon got his car in to the curb by stopping beside a fire plug.\nPlaintiff got out, walked to the rear of the car, which then drove off, and walked forward into the street about seven feet to a place where she could see, and looked both Avays. She saw nothing except a double-parked car to her right that was stopped to unload a passenger. She then hurried forward and when she was at some point at or near the center of the street she was hit and at the same moment saw a flash of green. As she stopped rolling she heard the screech of brakes. She never saw the car that hit her and it is conceded that she did not look after she left the point a car\u2019s width from the west curb where she looked both ways.\nThere were skid marks thirty-eight feet,- eight inches long, and the police chief Avho measured them testified that they led to defendant\u2019s front and rear wheels. There was no painted white line to mark the center of Main Street, and the police chief said that the skids were in the easterly half of the street \u201cAvith the exception of the ending of them\u201d: it looked to him as if the car had swerved to the left, but he still put the marks \u201ca little off\u201d, that is to the east of the approximated center. He said that the clear space between the two lanes of parked cars was such that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t get the ambulance through, hardly.\u201d And plaintiff described it as \u201cpretty tight, but there was room\u201d for two-way traffic.\nDefendant\u2019s negligence is conceded. He saw plaintiff and hit her at the same instant, and at one point he was asked whether he was entirely on his right side of the street: his answer Avas, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nUnder the conditions outlined, and with all inferences favoring the verdict winner, we cannot say that reasonable minds could not differ on the central question of contributory negligence: Nugent v. Joerger, 387 Pa. 330 (1956), 127 A. 2d 697.\nIt is obviously not clear how close to the unmarked center of the street the defendant Avas driving; whether, if it was very close, the car overhung the center; how close to the center Mrs. Gordon was; whether, in view of her hurry and the brief time it must have taken her to go from the point where she looked to the point where she was hit, the look she made was the equivalent of a look upon entering the northbound lane, es-specially when she saw nothing in motion; where defendant\u2019s car was, in relation to the plaintiff, when it began its skid; and what the police chief meant when he said, in possible self-contradiction, that the skids were all to the east of the center of the street, or \u201ca little off\u201d the center, or all to the east \u201cwith the excep-' tion of the ending of them.\u201d\nWe do not think that these matters emerge with the pitiless clarity necessary to take away the plaintiff\u2019s verdict. It is the law that a crossing pedestrian must look before committing himself to the street and must continue to look: Gatens v. Vrabel, 393 Pa. 155 (1958), 142 A. 2d 287. But we are mindful that plaintiff looked at a safe point \u2014 safe because she was shielded by the parked cars \u2014 seven feet into the street, with only 9% feet to go to the center. It would have taken her only a second and a half to go that distance at the normal gait of four miles per hour: Miller v. Gault, 345 Pa. 474 (1942), 29 A. 2d 71. Since she was hurrying, it may well have taken her less time: Martino v. Adourian, 380 Pa. 580 (1949), 63 A. 2d 12. With such a microscopic interval of time, the jury may have felt that her look and her self-care were sufficient.\nWe consider applicable our outlook expressed as follows in Mackin v. Patterson, 270 Pa. 107 (1921), 112 A. 738: \u201cHow far the accident happened from the east curb is not definitely shown, but approximately twenty feet; whether plaintiff should have looked again to the south, while walking that distance, .depended upon the surroundings, and was for the jury: Anderson v. Wood, supra [264 Pa. 98];. . . Healy v. Shedaker, 264 Pa. 512. A pedestrian must exercise continued vigilance while crossing a street (Lorah v. Rinehart, 243 Pa. 231) ; but just where he should look depends upon shifting conditions and is a question of fact rather than of law.\u201d\nIt is necessary to distinguish our recent decision in Shuman v. Nolfi, 399 Pa. 211 (1960), 159 A. 2d 716. In that case a street thirty feet wide was divided in three lanes of ten feet each. The street ran north and south and the westerly lane was used for parked cars. Plaintiff, walking south on the west sidewalk, saw a friend driving north in the easterly lane wave to him to pick him up. To get there he had to cross the lane of parked cars and then the southbound lane. As he left the curb he looked left and saw a truck coming south. He walked out into the street between two of the parked cars and at their edge saw the defendant 175 feet away. He went on four or five steps and when he looked again the defendant\u2019s car was on top of him. He was hit at once. There were 24-foot skid marks twelve feet east of the west curb and 2.5 feet from the line dividing the two traffic lanes, respectively, and two blood marks in front of the western skid mark, also twelve feet from the west curb and 4.5 feet east of the parked cars. On defendant\u2019s truck there was a dent on the right front between the right headlight and the center of the grille.\nIt was clear that plaintiff had entered the near lane of the street and had been hit almost at once, admittedly without continuing to look after having once seen the oncoming truck. He must have been moving slowly. We affirmed the grant of a compulsory nonsuit.\nIn the instant case the wife plaintiff looked but saw nothing and moved quickly towards the center. She was struck by a car moving not in the near lane but in the far lane, and the evidence is not clear where she was or just where the defendant\u2019s car was, and hence a jury was needed to establish the conflicting and uncertain mise-en-scene.\nThe two situations are obviously different.\nThe judgment is reversed and the record is remanded for disposition of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.\nMr. Justice Bell dissents.",
