        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bok,\n' By its Act of May 22,- 1933, P. L. 912; 43 PS \u00a7403 et seq.', known as the Bakery Act, the Legislature conferred on the State Department of Agriculture\" the .power to regulate.and control bakeries.\nBy its Act of August 24, 1951, P. L. 1304, 16 PS \u00a712001 et seq., known as the Local Health Administration Law, the Legislature gave to the counties of the State the power to regulate public health within their boundaries.\nThe Allegheny County Health Department was created in 1957 under the Act of 1951 and adopted rules and regulations controlling bakeries in that county.\nVarious bakers and Bakers\u2019 Associations, plaintiffs here, filed a complaint in equity to restrain the County and its appropriate officials, defendants, from enforcing the local rules and regulations, to declare them void, and the Allegheny County Health Department to be without authority or jurisdiction to act. Defendants filed preliminary objections to the complaint and these were sustained by the court below. Plaintiffs appealed.\nThey contend that the Act of 1933, which they admit is silent on the subject of local regulation, preempted the field and make the argument, which they undoubtedly made and lost in the Legislature, that crippling duplication and inconvenience would ensue from having regulation on both State and County levels.\nThis is n\u00f3t' a case of a municipal ordinance impinging upon the province of a State system of control. Even when it does; the ordinance will not be stricken down unless it be clearly shown that the Legislature intended to pre-\u00e9mpt the field -or unless the ordinance conflicts -with the statute: Kelly v. Philadelphia, 382 Pa. 459 (1955), 115 A. 2d 238. Nor is it the ease of the State entering a field already covered by Federal legislation. Here again the State Act may co-exist with the Act of Congress if the latter does not show an intent to pre-empt and if the State Act does not produce a result inconsistent with the Federal legislation: Whitehall Laboratories v. Wilbar, 397 Pa. 223 (1959), 154 A. 2d 596; Commonwealth v. Nelson, 377 Pa. 58 (1954), 104 A. 2d 133, affirmed 350 U. S. 497, 76 S. Ct. 477; Hill v. Florida, 325 U. S. 538 (1945), 65 S. Ct. 1373.\nWe have upheld the co-existence of municipal and State legislation in Western Pennsylvania Restaurant Assn. v. Pittsburgh, 366 Pa. 374 (1951), 77 A. 2d 616, and Philadelphia v. Weber, 394 Pa. 466 (1959), 147 A. 2d 326. In the Pittsburgh case we said that it was obvious \u201c. . . even in the absence of express testimony to that effect, that the sanitary standards and appropriate regulations in the case of restaurants in a large city such as Pittsburgh might well be, and no doubt are, quite different from those applicable to rural communities, in view, among other conditions, of the usually larger number of patrons and the congestion o\u00ed buildings with consequent special problems of their construction and ventilation.\u201d\nIn the Philadelphia case we held that local regulation of beauty shops did not conflict with the State Beauty Culture Act, and said: \u201c. . . where the Act is silent as to monopolistic domination and a municipal ordinance provides for a localized procedure which furthers the salutary scope of the Act, the ordinance is welcomed as an ally, bringing reinforcements into the field of attainment of the statute\u2019s objectives.\u201d\nIn Brazier v. Philadelphia, 215 Pa. 297 (1906), 64 A. 508, we spoke of \u201cnecessary incompatibility\u201d between statute and ordinance, where both required the licensing of automobiles.\nThe case is stronger where, as here, we deal with two statutes. We then have the rules concerning actual repeal or repeal by necessary implication, and, with special reference to the instant case, the applicable provisions of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, \u00a763, 46 PS \u00a7563, such as: \u201cWhenever a general provision in a law shall he in conflict with a special provision in the same or another law, the two shall be construed, if possible, so that effect may be given to both. If the conflict between the two provisions be irreconcilable, the special provisions shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision shall be enacted later and it shall be the manifest intention of the Legislature that such general provision shall prevail.\u201d See also Walker\u2019s Appeal, 332 Pa. 488 (1938), 2 A. 2d 770, and Nyce v. Board of Commissioners, 319 Pa. 353 (1935), 179 A. 584, for our decisional rule that statutes in pari materia should be considered concurrently and effect given to both whenever possible.\nWe see no such irreconcilability or manifest intention in the two Acts now before us. The Act of 1951 appears to be a comprehensive plan of health control, and if the people, through the Legislature, wish to guard the State\u2019s health on two levels together, we see no reason why it should not be so. Nihil obstat. We can think of many rather obvious affirmative reasons for such an exercise of the police power: difference in population density, in climate, and in economic pressure, for example. The situation is unlike that in Girard Trust Co. v. Philadelphia, 336 Pa. 433 (1939), 9 A. 2d 883, which involved a system for inspecting and regulating elevators and where we approved the idea that the functioning of elevators was the same in a large city as in a rural district. We think that the problems surrounding the consumption of food can vary markedly between a large city and a rural district.\nThe instant case is rather like Kelly v. Philadelphia, supra (382 Pa. 459), where in the field of zoning the State Act of 1925 and the First Class City Home Rule Act were accorded co-existence.\n\u25a0 As for the possibility that Allegheny and Pike Counties may require a different wrapper- on a loaf of bread, we regard such latent troubles as chimerical, but to the extent that they become real, they are of a kind peculiarly suited to redress by the Courts or the Legislature. \u2022\nWe see no reason to question or hamper the Legislature\u2019s finding and statement of purpose, expressed in Section 2 of-the Act of 1951, that the State\u2019s duty to protect the health of its people can be met only when health services \u201care administered according to units of population sufficiently large to enable full time modern health services to be provided on the most economical basis by local communities working in partnership with the Commonwealth.\u201d\nAppellants argue that the Act of 1938 provided full and complete coverage of bakery regulation and that it is therefore improper to add another coverage that will duplicate fees and inspections. This is a non sequitur. The Legislature has every right to call upon residents of the Counties to enforce regulations, whether State or local, instead of billeting State inspectors in the three principal cities, as at present. The two conceptions are distinct.\nThe order is affirmed at appellants\u2019 costs.",
