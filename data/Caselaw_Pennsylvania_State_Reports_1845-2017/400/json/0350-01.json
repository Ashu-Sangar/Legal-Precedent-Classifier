The court shall have exclusive power to remove a guardian when ... (6) the incompetent of whose estate he is guardian is adjudged competent.\u201d \u201cSection 323. Adjudication of competency. The court, upon petition and after such notice as it shall direct, may find, after a hearing at which good cause is shown, that a person previously adjudged incompetent has become competent.\u201d\nThe Incompetents\u2019 Estates Act of 1955 has recently been ably analyzed by Mr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones in Myers Estate, 395 Pa. 459, 150 A. 2d 525, and further analysis is unnecessary.\nWe find no clear abuse of discretion nor error of law in the order, which is affirmed on the opinion of Judge Sporkin.\nP. L. 794, 50 PS \u00a7\u00a73101-3801 (Supp. 1958). The short title of this Act is The Incompetents\u2019 Estates Act of 1955. Even stranger', The Incompetents\u2019 Estates Act of 1955 was enacted February 28, 1956, P, L. 1154. The 1957 Act re-enacted the so-called Act of 19.55 and amended it.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno\nfiled June 30, 1960:\nOne sure way not to make a mistake is not to do anything. Thus, the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County handling the present case can remain safely within its ivory tower of non-criticism by refusing to touch the status quo.\nJustin Pearlman was declared incompetent on September 19, 1945, and the Tradesmens Bank and Trust Company was appointed 'guardian of his estate. In June, 1959, a petition was filed asking for removal of the guardian on the basis that Pearlman had recovered from his mental illness. Hearings were held on the petition, and the court refused to discharge the guardian principally because on a previous occasion Pearlman had been declared recovered and then suffered a relapse. But there is no reason why he should be shackled to a guardian during the time that he is entirely competent to handle his affairs, only because of the remote possibility of a relapse. Joshua Logan, one of the geniuses of the Broadway stage and of Hollywood in dramatic production has had relapses of a mental condition but upon recovery he goes back to his work and his art.\nTwo physicians, Dr. Herbert Freed and Dr. William R. O\u2019Brien, both eminently qualified in their fields of psychiatry and neurology, testified at the hearings and they both declared that in their opinion Pearlman would not become the victim of designing persons. The petitioner himself took the witness stand and accredited himself excellently, testifying with considerable minuteness on financial affairs. He summed up his situation in the following manner: \u201cI feel that I am able to handle my own funds, and it is also a considerable expense to have a guardian needlessly manage the funds I have. They get a percentage of the principal and a percentage of the income and it is not necessary any longer, and I don\u2019t feel that I would become the victim of designing persons.\u201d\nThe testimony of the petitioner and of the two physicians was uncontradicted. The court below may have felt that if it was erring, it was doing so on the safe side, but a court must have the formidableness to meet an issue and decide it according to the evidence. It Avould appear that the court was not being guided by the evidence but by fear of a possibility which was not justified by what was said in court. The Incompetents\u2019 Estates Act of June 28, 1951, P. L. 612, \u00a7\u00a7321 and 323, provides the machinery for the removal of a guardian when the \u201cincompetent of whose estate he is guardian has become competent.\u201d\nThis machinery turned in vain in the court beloAV. I am in accord with what Chief Justice Maxby said in Denner v. Beyer, 352 Pa. 386, 397: \u201cIt is a serious thing to deprive any person of the control of their own property or of their right to dispose of it by will. This right Avill be judicially taken away from a person only after preponderating proof of his lack of mental capacity to manage his own business affairs. There is no such proof in this record.\u201d\nThere was no such proof in the record of this case either.\nMr. Justice Cohen joins in this dissent.",
