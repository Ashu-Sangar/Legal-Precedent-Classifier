      <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>A reading of the Majority Opinion is its own best answer. It begins by citing <em>Boorse v.

A valuable race horse by the name of AlPs Over had, while enjoying some unexpected but refreshing liberty, run into a culvert from which it could not extricate itself. Although imprisoned, the horse was not injured in any way. Two police officers came upon the unfortunate animal and, instead of trying to liberate it or even to notify its owner of what happened, they whipped out their revolvers and fired ten shots into the horse’s head. For <em>All’s Over </em>it was now indeed all over. His owner sued the two municipalities which had hired the police officers but this Court refused recovery, not because the policemen’s actions could be justified but because, as it took pains to point out, more than a century <em>ago </em>“it was held in Fox v. The Northern Liberties, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 103" data-case-ids="1854612" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0103-01">3 W. &amp; S. 103</a>, that the defendant in that case, an unincorporated distinct, was not liable for a trespass committed by its Superintendent of Police, who was alleged to have illegally seized a horse under a false pretense that its owner was violating the ordinance of the district.”</p>
    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[237,1759,1152,538]]]'>Thus, on the basis of a previous act of injustice by the government, this Court affirmed the injustice done the owner of AlPs Over. If an American visiting in Russia had seen two Communist policemen draw guns and needlessly slay a healthy horse, and then learned that the Russian government had refused compensation to the owner of the horse, the American would voice indignant astonishment over the manifestation of such unbridled tyranny. Why should a similar act in America be enveloped in impeccable legality?</p>

It tells us how in 1874 a policeman illegally seized a horse and so negligently handled it that it ran away and was killed. The owner sued for the value of the horse but the Court held that the municipality would not be liable for the negligence of its police officer. It based its decision on the precedent of what had been done in the <em>Fox </em>case where the superintendent had illegally seized the horse in that case under false pretense. If it was all right to commit a flagrant act of governmental abuse with the horse in the <em>Fox </em>case, it was equally all right to repeat the illegal performance in the <em>Elliott </em>case.</p>

Does the difference in liability therefore depend on whether the policeman is on foot or ahorse? Is an automobile-riding policeman a lesser governmental agent than one on foot? We, of course, know that The Vehicle Code provides for municipal responsibility in automobile cases, but the principle involved is still the same.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">*</a>

I will forego launching into that extended treatment, but I wish to record that it is my belief, founded on appreciation of law, that the government, which should be the first to acknowledge error and make restitution for harm done its citizens, should not be exempt from rules which apply to everybody else, only because of fine-spun theorizing, academic argumentation and sophistic dialectics which have no place in the determination of what is fundamentally right and what is flagrantly wrong.</p>
