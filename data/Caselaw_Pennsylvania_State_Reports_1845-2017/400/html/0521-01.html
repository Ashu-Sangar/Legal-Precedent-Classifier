To prove such a gift inter vivos it must be shown that there was an intent to make a gift and a delivery, actual or constructive, <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>of the subject matter of the gift so as to divest the donor of dominion and control over it. Appellant correctly urges that a requisite delivery may be made to a third person for ultimate delivery to the person sought to be benefited. In <em>Chambley et al. v. Rumbaugh et al </em><a href="/pa/333/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="333 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="1187917" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0319-01">333 Pa. 319</a>, 322, 323, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20171" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 A.2d 171">5 A. 2d 171</a>, this Court stated: “It is not necessary that delivery of a deed should be to the grantee himself, but it is sufficient if it be delivered to a third person to be given by him in turn to the grantee at some specified time, as, for example, upon the death of the grantor. ... Nor is delivery accomplished by the mere handing of a deed to a stranger without instructions to deliver it to the grantee: [citing cases]. If, however, it appears that such instructions were given, or, if the attendant facts and circumstances indicate that the intent of the grantor was that delivery should be made by the third person to the grantee, and if the grantor parted with control, such delivery is in all respects valid, and, while the actual enjoyment of the property may be postponed, the deed, when subsequently turned over to the grantee, takes effect as of the time of the first delivery: [citing cases].” In <em>Rynier Estate, </em><a href="/pa/347/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="347 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="1217394" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0471-01">347 Pa. 471</a>, 474, 475, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20736" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="32 A.2d 736">32 A. 2d 736</a>, Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Stern stated: “Of course, delivery need not be made directly to the beneficiary. The instrument may be placed in the possession of a third person for delivery upon the happening of a specified contingency or event, as, for example, the death of the donor; in such cases not only is the delivery valid, but it will be held to relate back to the time of the initial delivery if that be necessary to effectuate the donor’s intention: [citing cases]. Nor is it essential that the donee have knowledge of the transaction before the death of the donor, since there is a presumption that a person will accept what is for his benefit . . . and by his subsequent actual acceptance tlie <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>donee ratifies the original delivery by which the gift was made. As the chief factor in the determination of the question whether a legal delivery has been effected is the intention of the donor to transfer title to the donee, as manifested by his words and actions and- by the circumstances surrounding the transaction, it is evident that each case must depend largely upon its own facts. The delivery to an agent or custodian is ineffective as a gift inter vivos if it is not accompanied with definite instructions to make delivery in turn to the donee: [citing cases]. It is likewise ineffective if the donor indicates an intention to retain title notwithstanding his parting with possession: [citing a case]. But where the purpose of the donor to make a present gift clearly appears, and explicit directions are given as to the person to whom final delivery is to be made, as well as the time when and the event or contingency upon which it is to be made, the transaction is upheld as vesting a valid title in the donee to the deed, bond, note or other instrument which is the subject of the gift”.</p>

The chancellor found that when Attorney Christy prepared and received the assignment from the decedent he was then acting as her counsel. The instructions given to him by decedent were that he should, upon her death, deliver the assignment of the ground rent to appellant. Normally such a delivery, though conditional, would constitute a valid delivery and the circumstances surrounding the making of such delivery would show an intent to make a gift inter vivos to appellant. The only fact which might cast some doubt on the validity of this gift is that the decedent reserved the right to withdraw for her personal needs, if they should arise, payments under the ground rent. The fact is that the <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>decedent never exercised this right nor did her needs require that she exercise this right. In <em>Hartman’s Estate (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa/320/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="320 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="1163623" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0331-01">320 Pa. 331</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20232" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="182 A. 232">182 A. 232</a>, a deed was delivered by a woman to a third person with instructions to give it upon her death to a certain named grantee if she, the grantor, did not call for it in the meantime. The grantor never recalled the deed and, after her death, it was delivered by the third person to the grantee. This Court held that delivery was valid and that the title vested as of the time of the original delivery of the deed to the third person. The fact that such a right is reserved is “important as evidence of an intention on the part of the grantor not to effect an immediate transfer of title”: footnote p. 476, <em>Rynier Estate, </em>supra. An examination of the instant factual situation indicates that decedent did reserve a right which she in fact never exercised. At the same time it is most evident under the testimony that, in the absence of the exercise of any such right on her part, she did intend that, upon her death, Attorney Christy should deliver the assignment to appellant. Under such circumstances it is clear that there was a valid gift inter vivos of this instrument of assignment to appellant. The fact that the custodian of the instrument was not the appellant’s agent — as the court below found — is without legal significance:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Two daughters, offered as witnesses to matters which occurred during Lemmer’s lifetime, were held by the court below incompetent to testify. In sustaining this ruling, we stated (p. 256) : “The transfer by decedent was, prima facie, a valid gift to his wife. To avoid it, the burden was on the party contesting to show, by positive proof, fraud or coercion. . . . By decedent’s own act the property passed to his wife, a party on the record. The daughters, in opposing this transfer, are opposite parties on the record. . . . The transfer being prima facie valid, both right and capacity are presumed to exist.

S. savings bonds from his own name to that of himself and son with right of survivorship. After the father’s death, his personal representative sought to set aside the transfer on the ground that the transfer had been brought about by the son’s fraud and coercion. The chancellor permitted the decedent’s children to testify as to conversations which took place prior to their father’s death, It was argued that their testimony was admissible because it disclosed admissions on the part of defendant which struck down the prima facie character of the gift and, therefore, the relative positions of the personal representative and defendant with regard to the father’s interest were reversed. Defendant contended that prima facie the bonds had been transferred to him by the father and, therefore, he represented of record his father’s interest.
