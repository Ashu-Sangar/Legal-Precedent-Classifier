The original right-of-way was forty feet, part of which had been constructed of macadam. The plans for reconstruction of said highway as approved ... by the Governor of Pennsylvania on March 19th, 1924, prints of which were introduced in evidence, were filed in the office of the Department of Highways in Harrisburg. According to these plans, the highway was reconstructed of concrete for a distance of 7,302.6 feet, on part of which the properties of petitioners abutted. The paved portion of the road was not widened over its original width and was completely within the original right-of-way, referred to on the plans as ‘Legal Width of Right of Way,’ except at the ‘William Schrader’ property where <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>a curve was eliminated. The Schrader property is sixteen hundred feet from the property line of any petitioner. The plans also show a line, ten feet on each side of the original right-of-way and parallel thereto, referred to as ‘Required Width of Right of Way’. Thus the total ‘Required Width of Right of Way’ is sixty feet. While there was a marked deviation of the reconstructed highway from the original road bed at the Schrader property, the deviation from the original center line of the turnpike abutting the properties of petitioners varied from three feet to one-half foot and at times the new and old center line coincided. Since the highway was reconstructed in the original road bed and at no point (except the Schrader property), considering the combined width of pavement and shoulders, exceeded the original right-of-way width, we may assume this minimal deviation from the original center line would have been difficult to detect other than by survey or expert examination of the plans. No physical entry was made on the additional ten feet width above referred to as within the line of the ‘Required Width of Right of Way’.</p>
