There are some statements in that Opinion with which I cannot agree. For instance, the Ma<a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>jority says: “The evidence established that Ornato was operating a lottery”.</p>
    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[231,476,1149,485]]]'>How can the Majority make such a statement when the jury specifically acquitted Ornato on the charge of operating a lottery? Is the Majority changing the meaning of the Word “established”? Does it intend to say that the verdict of a jury has no validity? Are we now minimizing the sanctity of a jury’s verdict? Are we now juridically to say that the verdict of a jury has no weight in so far as facts are concerned? And if it does not decide the facts, what does it decide?</p>

    <p id="b656-8" data-blocks='[["BL_656.9",656,[225,1864,1149,485]]]'>In point of convincingness, how does the statement: “Consistency in a verdict in a criminal case is not necessary” differ from the statement that: “Reliability in a verdict in a criminal case is not necessary” or “Justice in a verdict in a criminal case is not necessary”? There is no limit to the absurd declarations which can be announced if one is disposed to ignore logic, reason, rationalization and the constitutional guarantees which go with trial by jury.</p>

    <p id="b657-3" data-blocks='[["BL_657.4",657,[173,699,1151,375]]]'>And then, why does the Court say that consistency is not necessary in á verdict in a <em>criminal </em>case? Does this mean that it <em>is </em>necessary in a civil case?
