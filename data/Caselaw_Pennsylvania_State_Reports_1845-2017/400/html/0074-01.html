This Court directed that judgment be entered for the plaintiffs “for such sum as to right and justice may belong, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown to the court below why such judgment should not be so entered.” <em>Syme v. Bankers National Life Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/393/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="393 Pa. 600" data-case-ids="1279630" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0600-01">393 Pa. 600</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.2d%20845" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="144 A.2d 845">144 A. 2d 845</a>. The Court below thus states the facts:</p>
    <blockquote id="b103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.9",103,[158,1123,1150,433]]]'>“Pursuant to this decision, no legal or equitable cause being shown why judgment should not be entered, this Court ordered judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against defendant in the sum of $13,250 as the amount presently due upon the contract of insurance, and adjudged that the contract of insurance remain a binding and valid contract unchanged by either the judgment or satisfaction thereof.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b103-7" data-blocks='[["BL_103.10",103,[162,1578,1155,765]]]'>Appellants are attorneys for plaintiffs. They filed a petition to establish an attorney’s <em>charging lien </em>upon the proceeds of the life insurance policy which, was payable to plaintiffs, as above set forth. Appellants recited in their petition that as a result of their efforts plaintiffs will receive the sum of $76,750 from defendant. Plaintiffs orally agreed to pay appellants a contingent fee of 25% “payable out of the insurance policy proceeds,” together with the sum of $450 advanced.by appellants for costs and expenses. Each plaintiff receives $125 per month under the policy and pays 25% thereof, or $31.25, to appellants. The final payment of appellants’ fee is payable from the lump sum payment of $25,000 due to plaintiffs under the policy in 1965.</p>

      <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>Defendant filed an answer to tlie petition. Plaintiffs filed a consent to appellants’ petition, agreeing therein that the defendant insurance company pay to appellants out of the sums due to plaintiffs certain specified amounts from time to time and agreed further to execute assignments to appellants of these aforesaid amounts as they became due and payable. The appellants did not make any claim under the proposed or actual assignment for the obvious reason, as we shall see, that an assignment could not be sustained either under the insurance contract or under the law. The appellants have been paid by their client the agreed upon contingent fee as and whenever payments were received from the defendant by the plaintiffs. There is no fund in existence, or payable at the present time by defendants to plaintiffs, in which the appellants have any interest.. The lower Court dismissed the petition.</p>

In <em>Ruzyc v. Brown, </em>the Court said: “The argument that plaintiffs’ attorneys have an interest in the judgment to the extent of their fee is without merit.

The rule that an attorney may claim his fees as a preference out of money raised by his services when it has come within the grasp of the court [citing cases], (on the principle that he is the equitable owner thereof to the extent of the value of his services . . .), applies only to a court of equity, or to a proceeding in the orphans’ court [citing cases]; it does not apply to a common law action [citing cases] . . .

The defendant insurance company, of course, has not benefited from the petitioners’ services in this action, and the insurance company does not seek to appropriate or claim the proceeds of the insurance policy, or any portion thereof, for its own use. Conversely, were this Court to order a charging lien on the proceeds of the subject insurance policy, injustice would be imposed upon the defendant who made a contract prohibiting such a lien. The terms of the contract were known to petitioners prior to the time they rendered their services to the plaintiffs in this action. In addition, it is averred by petitioners that plaintiffs have agreed to pay their attorneys’ fee, and that plaintiffs continue to so agree; there is no averment that plaintiffs are insolvent or that petitioners’ fee is in jeopardy for any other reason.</p>
