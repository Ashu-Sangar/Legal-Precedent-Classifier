On September 10, 1952 executors’ counsel was again notified not only of the filing but also of the finality of this appraisement. Despite such notice, the executors of the estate took no appeal. On April 5, 1956 the Commonwealth presented a petition in the Orphans’ Court of Mercer County to enforce payment of the unpaid inheritance tax. After answer filed on behalf of the estate and hearing, the court granted the Commonwealth’s petition and directed payment of the inheritance tax calculated on the basis of the final appraisement of July 26, 1952.

The executors did not file an inventory and appraisement until <em>fourteen </em>months after their appointment and no justification for such delay appears of record. The Act of June 20, 1919, P.

Failure to pay this tax on time is indefensible. The last installment on the tax was not paid until January 8, <em>1958 </em>— nearly <em>eight years after decedent’s death and nearly seven years after the time the tax was due. </em>The penalty from March 4, 1951 — when the tax should have been paid- — ■ until January 8, 1958 — when the last installment of the tax was finally paid — was $758.76, an amount which the executors paid out of the estate funds.

The claim was finally settled in September, 1951, for $3,013.50. Even though the tax had not then been settled and determined, the executors made no effort whatsoever to claim as an allowable deduction $3,013.50, instead of $2200. As a result the estate lost a credit by way of deduction of $813.50 — the difference between $3,013.50 and $2200 — and sustained a tax loss of $48.81 through the executors’ negligence.

To her he gave the “income” from his estate to the extent that such “income” might be necessary for her “maintenance”; at the same time he envisaged that such “income” might be more than sufficient for her “maintenance”, in which event any balance of “income” was to liquidate any indebtedness owed at the time of his death. So long as Ella Jones <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>lived testator contemplated that the Bank and Lartz would act in dual capacities, as executors <em>and </em>as trustees; the testamentary phrases “during the lifetime of my wife” and “while said estate is held in trust” were used synonymously and, during this period, certain authority was expressly granted the Bank and Lartz as executors and trustees. Even the most cursory reading of the third paragraph of the will which empowered the Bank and Lartz, in their dual capacities, to “sell any of [his estate]” indicates that the testator intended, at least during Ella Jones’ lifetime, that the proceeds of any such sale or sales should be invested and the funds not permitted to remain idle. Whether the word “empower” be construed as a “direction” or simply as an “authorization”, it is clear that testator intended that any funds realized from a conversion of his assets, at least during this period of time, be invested for the purpose of insuring the necessary income to his widow and of liquidating any indebtedness owed at the time of his death.</p>

The executors’ powers were plenary; to them — not to any auditor or any court — testator entrusted the selection of the assets which were to constitute the one-half of the estate to belong to his widow’s appointees.

In the first place, the executors contend that, because of the provisions of the second paragraph of testator’s will and the codicil to the will, they were uncertain whether testator had died testate or intestate as to the balance of his estate; until that question was determined, the executors argue, they were unable to carry out the provisions of the will as to the widow’s appointees. Such a position is untenable. Assuming, arguendo, the existence of such question, the pendency thereof should not have prevented the executors from performing their duties. Had the executors filed even a partial account within a reasonable time after Ella Jones’ death the court could have determined whether testator died testate or intestate. Moreover, by resort to a declaratory judgment proceeding, the executors could have secured a court construction of the terms of both the will and the codicil.

Technically, therefore, the corporate executor was within its statutory right in using the estate funds in its commercial department. However, such statutory provisions cannot act as a cloak of immunity for the executors under the instant factual situation. When the legislature contemplated the employment of estate funds by a bank and trust company in its commercial department, such employment was clearly to be temporary in nature; the statutory description of the funds which may be so utilized are funds awaiting “investment or distribution”. We find no legislative intent expressed in the Banking Code authorizing the use of such funds on a long term basis; such a construction would be both absurd and unreasonable. Cf: Statutory Construction Act of 1937, Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1019, art. IV, Sec. 52(1), 46 PS §552. In the instant situation, the corporate executor by the use of the estate funds realized an average yield for its own purposes of 4.6%-5.2% <em>over a period of almost five years. </em>The Banking Code was never intended to sanction this type of corporate banking conduct.</p>

The executors interpret this statute to mean that under no circumstances is there a duty on a personal representative to employ estate funds so as to secure profit for the estate and they find therein a legislative sanction for allowing estate funds to remain unproductive no matter how long eventual settlement of the estate be delayed. Such a view is certainly at variance with common sense and with the case law prior to the enactment of the 1949 Act: <em>Landis v.

The executors deprived the beneficiaries of estate assets which were productive and at the same time withheld distribution of the cash assets of the estate which the beneficiaries might have made productive. Regardless of a duty or lack of duty to invest estate funds on the part of these executors after the death of the life tenant, even when they had testamentary authority to invest, during the lifetime of the life tenant, they chose not to do so. The executors were gravely at fault and oblivious of the responsibility of their stewardship in the manner in which they administered this estate; through their action and inaction they permitted a status to continue where moneys rightfully due for distribution to the beneficiaries were allowed to remain in an unproductive state, while the corporate executor was permitted to employ such moneys for its own profits.
