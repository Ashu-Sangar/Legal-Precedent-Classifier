Appellant’s amended complaint alleged that he was a dues-paying member in good standing in appellee Local No. 2026, United Mine Workers of America (Union) ; that he was employed by appellee Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Company (Company), with seniority from 1939; that on January 8, 1954, in violation of appellant’s seniority rights under the collective bargaining agreement between Union and Company, he was laid off by the Company while at least one, and possibly more, employees with less seniority than he were retained; that appellee Company continues to employ such employee or employees and has rehired others with less seniority than appellant; that appellant’s loss of seniority rights came about as a result of an unlawful conspiracy between appellee Company and the named individual appellees (Union officials) under the pretext that appellant was no longer able to fulfill his job obligations; that after appellant filed the original complaint in this action he was expelled from the Union; that he has demanded to be restored to Union membership, but appellee Union has refused, and that all remedies under the Union constitution and collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Company have been exhausted and further resort thereto would be futile. In his prayer for relief, appellant asks that the Union be compelled to restore appellant’s membership; that the appellee Company be compelled to reinstate appellant in his employment with the same job classification he had before the alleged discharge; that damages be awarded appellant for loss of wages; <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>and that such other and further relief that may be just and equitable be allowed.</p>

By their preliminary objections, appellees contended in substance (1) that the lower court had no subject-matter jurisdiction - because (a) the .appellee Company, being engaged in interstate commerce, is subject to the provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7141" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §141">29 U.S.C. §141</a> et seq., and that under the doctrine of federal pre-emption, exclusive jurisdiction in this case is in the National Labor Relations Board or in the Federal courts, and (b) that the contract with the Union and the Union constitution provide adequate grievance procedures which were properly followed and concluded unfavorably to- plaintiff, (2) that plaintiff’s claim is barred by. laches; (3) that necessary and indispensable parties were not joined; (4) that there was a misjoinder of causes of action and that the amended complaint is multifarious.</p>

Rules 1508, 2229(a), (b), Pa. R. C. P. See also Goodrich-Amram §1508-2; 10 Anderson Pa. Civ. Pract. 180-181. The bill now before us does not meet these requirements. In his complaint appellant made no allegation that would connect appellee Union with the alleged discharge in disregard of appellant’s seniority rights. Nor was there any allegation in the complaint that appellee Company was in any way responsible for appellant’s alleged wrongful expulsion from the Union. Appellant’s theory in his amended complaint against the Union is obviously that the reason he was wrongfully expelled was because he had filed the original complaint in this action. This indirect connection with appellant’s discharge from employment does not constitute the “same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences” to which the Rules refer. Nor is there a common question of law or fact involved in the two causes of action which would affect <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>the rights or liabilities of all the parties. A judicial resolution of the issue concerning appellant’s discharge and' loss of seniority rights would have no bearing whatever on whether the Union had a right to discipline appellant simply for filing suit. The amended complaint thus joins matters entirely distinct, for which appellant claims different rights and in which different parties are concerned. It is therefore objectionable as a misjoinder of causes of action and is properly subject to appellees’ preliminary objections. <em>Hornsby v.

As the late Professor Chafee stated, “the closest analogy to the position of the member of an association is to be found in the relation between a stockholder and a corporation, or between a partner and the partnership. Such relations are much more than contracts. The law of associations not for profit thus takes its natural place beside the law of business corporations and partnerships. A violation of the relation does not automatically give rise to judicial relief. Judicial consideration must be given to the seriousness of the injury, on the one hand, and, on the other, to the policies which make interference with the particular association undesirable. Sometimes the relation, unlike membership in business corporations and partnerships, may involve only interests of personality, but the courts should still consider whether justice and policy require them to protect it.” Chafee, The Internal Affairs of Associations Not For Profit, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20993" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="43 Harv. L. Rev. 993">43 Harv. L. Rev. 993</a>, 1008 (1930).

There is as well an over-riding <em>public </em>interest in promoting well-managed autonomous associations which are able <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>to perform their functions effectively and still provide internally for the fair treatment of individual members who must be disciplined. See Chafee, op. cit. supra. The exhaustion rule is beneficial to the association in that by- encouraging intra-association resolution of internal disputes, it permits officials in positions of higher authority within the association to carry out a uniform application of the association’s policies. The association, in this manner, is able to prevent its “dirty linen” from being washed in public. Moreover, such a rule often saves the association the unnecessary burden and expense of litigation.</p>

The exhaustion rule reduces litigation by forcing disputes through a private system where they may be settled before reaching the courts.

The aggrieved member will quite often obtain satisfaction within the association’s hierarchy, thereby terminating the dispute before it ripens into a full-blown legal contest. The <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>rule, in summary, is extremely valuable in encouraging private adjustment, self-correction, and fair internal procedures.</p>

It is with a view toward the recent important steps taken legislatively to safeguard in the federal courts the rights of individual members against organizational excesses that we today elevate the rule of exhaustion to such a prominent position in our jurisdictional scheme. The Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, Title I — Bill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations, is not an attempt by the Congress of the United States to control the internal affairs of labor organizations. Rather, it represents the establishment of certain channels within which union activities which <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>affect membership rights may proceed. The provisions are designed to fill the gaps found to exist in union constitutions and bylaws in regard to the procedural and substantive due process accorded members. Rights and remedies which members have long claimed and which courts have long struggled to provide are now made articulate by specific provisions dealing with (1) the right of a member to fully participate in the internal politics of the organization, (2) the member’s freedom of speech, assembly and association, (3) the member’s rights in regard to dues, initiation fees and assessments, (4) protection of the member’s right to institute legal action and (5) safeguards against improper disciplinary action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> We are hopefully entering a new era in union self-discipline and responsibility. Rather than adopt judicial rules that would discourage resort to union processes which now must meet detailed elementary standards of fairness, we will attempt in every way to encourage the steady evolution of internal democracy. A strict adherence to the rule of exhaustion will go far toward placing the initial responsibility where it rightfully belongs — on the association itself. It is only when an issue has become fully “ripe” for adjudication that our courts will enter the picture.</p>

The ultimate responsibility in discharge cases is thereby left not to individual members, but rather to their trustee in these matters. The result we reach thus flows as a matter of course from the face of the Agreement. In effect, the appellant is a beneficiary of the appellee Company’s promises, as to seniority rights, but the Company has limited those promises by refusing to entertain claims based on such rights (beyond the initial complaint stage) unless brought by the other party to the Agreement, the trustee Union. The limited character of the Company’s promises serves to defeat any attempt to get redress individually.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_20" id="ref_footnote_1_20">20</a>

It is an interest in a ‘specific .orderly arrangement.’ As such, each of the rights is tied to all of the rest.
