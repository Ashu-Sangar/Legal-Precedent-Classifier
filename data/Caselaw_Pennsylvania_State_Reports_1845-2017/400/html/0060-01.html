In June, 1958, tMs fraternity agreed to buy a new and more commodious house at 203 South <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>Third Street, also in the borough. This agreement was later consummated. The fraternity then applied for a certificate of occupancy, which was refused by the administrative officer of the zoning ordinance. On appeal, the board of adjustment, by a divided vote, reversed the officer and granted the certificate. The protesting neighbors appealed to the court of common pleas, which reversed the board and revoked the certificate. By stipulation, a tape recording of the testimony taken before the board constitutes the record of evidence, with no further testimony taken by the court below. The fraternity now appeals to us.</p>

It is also admitted that no signs, guideposts, or standards are given in the ordinance by which to judge the conditions under which a “special exception” might be granted or withheld. This lack prevents an exception from being validly made: <em>Devereux </em>Foundation, <em>Inc., Zoning Case, </em><a href="/pa/351/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="351 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="462762" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0478-01">351 Pa. 478</a> (1945), <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20744" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="41 A.2d 744">41 A. 2d 744</a>; <em>Dooling’s Windy Hill v.

This fraternity house, where twenty-four boys sleep in bedrooms and eat in a common dining-room, resembles a multiple dwelling more than any of the other types mentioned. <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>And in <em>Jennings’ Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/330/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="330 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1182961" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0154-01">330 Pa. 154</a> (1938), <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20621" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="198 A. 621">198 A. 621</a>, a Pittsburgh ordinance included fraternity houses within the class of multiple dwelling: the idea, therefore, is not impossible or preposterous. Since a fraternity house must be something, we are satisfied that it be considered a multiple dwelling within the scope of the ordinance before us. This is borne out by the definitions in the ordinance. These were omitted from the record but appear in the briefs of both parties. Thus: “Dwelling — Any building which is designed for or occupied in whole or in part as the home, residence, or sleeping place of one or more persons either permanently or transiently. . . . Dwelling — Multiple—A dwelling designed for or occupied otherwise than a single family dwelling, two family dwelling or double house.”</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[230,1270,1150,589]]]'>At the same time “fraternity house” is expressly listed in sub-section H. Appellees contend that all three classes there mentioned — clubs, fraternity houses, and lodges — are subject to the requirement of a special exception. We do not read the language so. Zoning ordinances are presumably valid and constitutional: <em>Whitpain Township v. Bodine, </em><a href="/pa/372/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="372 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1238057" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0509-01">372 Pa. 509</a> (1953), <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="94 A.2d 737">94 A. 2d 737</a>. But they also impose restrictions on the free use of property and are in derogation of the common law. Hence they must be construed strictly: <em>Lord Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/368/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="368 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1230348" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0121-01">368 Pa. 121</a> (1951), <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.2d%20533" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="81 A.2d 533">81 A. 2d 533</a>.</p>

We have no- guide to their intent save in the language they used, subject to the rule of strict construction. It becomes apparent, thus construed, that H requires a special exception for lodges only and not for clubs or fraternity houses. Had there been a comma after “lodge”, the argument that all <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>three should be bound by the need for a special exception would have weight, but as written H means: “Club.

    <p id="b93-4" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[128,594,1150,429]]]'>That a fraternity house may therefore qualify under A or H or both is of no concern to us save as an exercise in the construction of language. The authorities must have known their town and the problems attendant on college life, and it is not our province to supply their intent. Nor may we say that they may not have seen a reason to distinguish between lodges, on the one hand, and clubs and fraternity houses, on the other.</p>
