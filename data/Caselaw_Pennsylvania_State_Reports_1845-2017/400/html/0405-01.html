Throughout <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>this period, appellants Scheckter and Fish held majority control of both Weatherly Steel Casting Company and Dutron Plastics. They did not reveal their interest in these companies to the appellee, however, even though they were requested to supply this information on at least one occasion by the appellee’s New York counsel and earlier, by one of appellee’s officers and directors. Until December, 1958, the appellee corporation had no conclusive knowledge that the appellants Scheckter and Fish were connected with either company, nor did appellee learn that these appellants owned the controlling interest in the companies until the time of the hearing in this matter.</p>

The “Vulcanized Stock Syndicate” was an organization composed of directors, officers, and employees of the- appellee corporation. Created in July, 1949, by a written agreement signed by the members, the syndicate’s avowed purpose was to purchase stock of the appellee when it appeared on the market at favorable terms. Complete control and management of the syndicate was vested in the “syndicate managers”, Stanley H. Renton, a director and chairman of the finance committee of the appellee, Prescott Beach, then an officer of the appellee, and appellant Redland, a director and treasurer of the appellee for twenty years until June, 1959, when he also was discharged. Appellant Scheckter, although not an officer, director or employee of the corporation, was allowed to be a member of the syndicate because apparently the plan was primarily his idea and suggestion. While the finding is vigorously disputed, the chancellor found that the syndicate agreement was <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>drafted by Scheckter himself in July, 1949.

This latter purchase was apparently financed by appellants Scheckter and Fish and is substantially the basis of appellee’s charge against appellant Redland of allying himself with the other appellants and conspiring with them in breach of his fiduciary position with appellee in order to overthrow appellee’s management and control.</p>

The legal error of the finding is in equating the individual intentions of Mr. Werner and Mr. Renton, but two of the nine directors of the corporation, with the intention of the corporate appellee. The separate expressions or opinions of members of the board of directors do not in law amount to an “existing interest” by the corporate entity itself.

Certainly the potential harm of demoralization of these key employees is too tenuous to give rise to a claim for equitable relief enjoining voting rights of <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>appellants and charging them with a constructive trust. Moreover, it would seem that if the wrongful action of the appellants was in purchasing in competition with the syndicate, the right to charge the appellants as trustees ex malificio and claim the shares under a constructive trust would lie with the syndicate members themselves. <em>Shannon v.

Then, on June 8, 1959, they informed appellee that they controlled 50% of its outstanding common stock and demanded that three members of the board of directors resign and the vacancies be filled by their nominees, to give them control of six members of the nine member board. Again refused, the appellants, on June 30, 1959, purportedly pursuant to a Maine Statute, held a meeting of certain of appellees’ stockholders; voted to increase the number of directors to 18 and elected 9 new ones consisting of themselves and their nominees; caused the new directors to oust the appellees’ president and general manager, as well as the chairman of its finance committee, and appointed their own nominees, making appellant Redland president. By order of .the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, a preliminary injunction was entered on July 30, 1959, declaring that the stockholders’ meeting of June 30 was invalid, and that all proceedings taken at the meeting were void. Appellants then brought a mandamus action in Maine seeking to compel appellee to call a stockholders’ meeting for the purpose of increasing the board of directors. A written stipulation was then entered into .between the parties on July 30, 1959, whereby a consent decree invalidating the stockholders’ meeting of June 30 was issued and the mandamus action withdrawn, and both sides agreed to hold a special stockholders’ meeting in Portland, Maine, on August 24, 1959, for the purpose of voting on a motion to amend the by-laws of appellee to increase the size of the board of directors. On August 20, the appellee moved for the temporary restraining order in this suit, which deprived appellants of their voting rights until-at least the hearing which was set for August 25, 1959', the day after the agreed upon date for the special shareholders’ meeting. Despite the temporary order appellants voted their shares at the meeting on August 24, but upon threat of contempt proceedings revoked their action at the meeting. In the meantime, the management group on August 21, at a board of directors meeting, by a divided vote, agreed to issue 3,000 shares of common stock to Plastic Company, a corporation formed the day before, in exchange for a piece of real estate in Trenton, New Jersey. The management group, before this date, had' given options for all of their and their family shares in the appellee to the man who controlled Plastic Company. Apparently, if-the <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>transaction is consummated, the ownership of a majority of shares will again shift. Its accomplishment, however, has been stayed temporarily by the appellants by legal proceedings in Maine.</p>

Where the complainant is the foreign corporation suing for relief from alleged wrongs against the corporate entity itself, such a plea is without merit. Cf. <em>Plum v. Tampax, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/399/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="399 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1290537" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0553-01">399 Pa. 553</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.2d%20549" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="160 A.2d 549">160 A. 2d 549</a> (1960). A more difficult problem which confronted the court, though not raised nor briefed by the parties, was whether because the appellee is a Maine corporation with its business office in New York a question of the proper choice of law exists. After an examination of the record we remained unsure of whether the allegedly wrongful conduct of the defendants all occurred in Pennsylvania. Since, however, the parties did not see fit to question the application of Pennsylvania law, we infer that this state was in fact the situs of most of the allegedly wrongful conduct and accordingly decide the issues of fiduciary responsibility on the basis of our own law.</p>

Similarly, while there could be situations in which the existence of the corporation might be threatened by the purchase of control, as where the group seeking control intends to use the power of control to “loot” the corporation, compare <em>Perlman v.
