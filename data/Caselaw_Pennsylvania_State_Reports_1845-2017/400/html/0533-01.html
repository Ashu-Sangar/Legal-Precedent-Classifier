The policy was issued on May 22, 1957, the application containing the declaration having been signed the day before.

(2) Where the statements are made representations, the insurer, to avoid the policy, must show they were false and insured knew they were false or otherwise acted in bad faith in making them. (3) If such falsity and the requisite bad faith affirmatively appear (a) from competent and uncontradicted documentary evidence, such as hospital records, proofs of death, or admissions in the pleadings, or (b) from the uncontradicted testimony of plaintiff’s own witnesses, a verdict may be directed for the insurer. (4) But whenever disputed questions of fact are presented by conflicting evidence, whether documentary or oral, or whenever the insurer’s defense depends upon the testimony of its witnesses, even though such testimony is uncontradicted, the case must be submitted to the jury, subject to the trial court’s power to award a new trial as often as in its sound discretion it may think the in<a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>terests of justice require.

    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[263,885,1153,911]]]'>It may be conceded that mental illness would be material to the risk, but however material it cannot avoid the policy unless it was also concealed or otherwise misrepresented in bad faith. The court concluded this question by making the following finding of fact in its first opinion: “There is no evidence that defendant acted in bad faith in answering the question pertaining to his license revocation, and there is a dispute in the evidence as to how the question was presented.” The dispute was that the insurance agent who took the application testified that he read the declaration to Stinger precisely as written and received a flat negative answer: whereas Stinger testified that the agent paraphrased it and related it to being in an accident. He therefore thought that the question had to do with driving his car and not with his being a hospital patient for other causes.</p>

The court said in its second opinion : “At the first hearing plaintiff proved that the defendant’s answer to the foregoing question was false, and that he knew it was false (although defendant placed a different interpretation on the meaning of the question.)” But the court did not ascribe bad faith to defendant’s knowledge of the falsity of his answer, and hence the finding of its lack remains. In <em>Evans </em>we said, at page 563: “Mere mistakes, inadvertently made, <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>even though of material matters, or the failure to furnish all details asked for, where it appears there is no intention of concealing the truth, does not work a forfeiture, and a forfeiture does not follow where there has been no deliberate intent to deceive, and the known falsity of the answer is not affirmatively shown.”</p>
    <p id="b567-3" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[139,713,1150,363]]]'>Hence Stinger’s false answer is in the category mentioned in Evans: “Nothing in this documentary evidence shows that Evans thought or had any reason to think the dislocation he suffered before his application for insurance were more than slight and temporary indispositions, too trivial to be reported in the application.”</p>

All we have is the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the insurer that anyone who is a mental patient in an institution, regardless of his diagnosis, is incompetent and that the fact is material to the risk. The plaintiff’s underwriting manager said that “if a man has received treatment of that sort, was hospitalized or treated for something of that sort” (without saying what the something or the treatment or the sort was), his company would not issue him insurance for from five to twenty years after his release.
