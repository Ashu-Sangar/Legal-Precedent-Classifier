A number of eases are cited by appellant in which it has been decided that petroleum and natural gas are minerals. Of the fact that under the broad division of all matter into the three classes of animal, vegetable and mineral, petroleum and gas are minerals, there has never been any room for question, and even under some more restricted classifications the same result may be reached. But, on the other hand, it has also been held that in other connections they are not included under that term. There is no discrepancy in the cases. The variations in the scope of the word arise from the connection and application in which it is used. The crucial question ... is what was the sense in which the parties used the word. Mineral is not per se a term of art or of trade, but of general language, and presumably is intended in the ordinary popular sense which it bears among English speaking people. It may in any particular case have a different meaning, more extensive or more restricted, but such different meaning should clearly appear as intended by the parties. ... In the present case the question arises in respect to natural gas, the plaintiff claiming that it was included in the reservation of the <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>“minerals underlying” the land conveyed. Certainly such gas is a mineral in the broadest sense of the term, but no evidence was given or offered to show that the parties so understood or intended the word mineral, or even that it had acquired a usage in conveyancing which would include gas”.</p>

The mining of coal, not the recovery of natural gas, was the principal objective of the <em>Byrne </em>and <em>Hall-Kaul </em>conveyances; in fact, John Byrne’s principal duties as trustee were in connection with the recovery of coal. Even in 1926 — over a quarter of a century subsequent to these two deeds — this property had never been tested for natural gas or oil.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a> The <em>Richey </em>

It is inconceivable that, if Arnold has intended to convey the title to the natural gas to Byrne and Hall-Kaul which he had received in the <em>Richey </em>deed, he would not have described the <em>Byrne </em>and <em>Hall-Kaul </em>conveyances in language similar to or identical with the language in the <em>Richey </em>deed. Of great significance in the interpretation of the parties’ intent is the fact that the <em>Richey </em>deed expressly conveys natural gas rights yet the <em>Byrne </em>and <em>Hall-Kaul </em>deeds make no reference to such rights. For minerals — coal, fire clay, limestone and iron ore — are specifically mentioned in the <em>Byrne </em>deed; two minerals — coal and coal oil — are specifically mentioned in the <em>Hall-Kaul </em>deed; a study of the language in both deeds indicates a high degree of selectivity and precision of language and description to have been employed by Arnold, especially bearing in mind that he had but recently been <em>expressly </em>given the rights to the natural gas. Arnold’s omission of natural gas, coupled with the variation in the delineation of the minerals expressly conveyed to Byrne and Hall-Kaul, indicates that Arnold did <em>not </em>intend to convey <em>all </em>the mineral rights he had received from Richey et al. Furthermore, application of the rule of <em>ejusdem- generis </em>clearly indicates that the words “other minerals” was intended to include only minerals of the character or the type enumerated with particularity and natural gas is certainly not of such character or type.</p>

Penfield, in grave financial difficulties and unable to be operated successfully, was forced to liquidate its assets to meet, if possible, <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>its obligations. The purpose of the receivership proceedings was to make available for the payment and satisfaction of Penfield’s creditors not <em>some </em>but <em>all </em>of Penfield’s assets. The only reservation in the <em>Commonwealth </em>deed was of “the coal, fire clay, limestone, iron ore and other minerals that had been heretofore sold and conveyed to third parties”, [i.e. <em>Byrne </em>and <em>Hall-Kaul]. </em>The <em>Commonwealth </em>deed further recited: “It is the intention of [L. W. Smith, receiver] to convey by this indenture <em>all </em>his rights, title, and interest and <em>all </em>the right, title and interest of [Penfield] in, to and upon the above mentioned warrants”. (Emphasis supplied). The amount of money which the receiver finally realized from the sale of Arnold’s Elk County and Clearfield County realty was consumed in the payment of taxes, expenses, costs and fees. No money remained available to liquidate the large mortgage against Penfield and its properties and to pay other creditors. Under these circumstances it is absurd to construe this judicial proceeding as resulting in a sale only of the surface of the land and not of any rights thereunder, including natural gas. Had Penfield’s receiver and the U. S. Court contemplated or intended that the sale was to effect a severance of the natural gas rights from the surface of the land, why then was the receiver discharged by the court while the value of such natural gas rights remained undisposed of and creditors remained unpaid even in part? Neither Pen-field nor any representative on its behalf at any time during a quarter of a century ever claimed title to these natural gas rights. It is clear beyond any question that the purpose of the receiver’s petition to sell was to divest <em>all </em>Penfield’s interest in the premises, gas rights as well as surface, and the court so decreed; the <em>Commonwealth </em>deed vested in the Commonwealth title to <em>all </em>the rights which Arnold had acquired under the <em>Richey </em>deed, save those which Arnold had conveyed <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>to <em>Byrne </em>and <em>Hall-Kaul. </em>Nothing in the present record indicates that either the receiver or the court ever contemplated that the Commonwealth deed effected a severance of the surface from the natural gas rights. <em>Yuscavage v. Hamlin, </em><a href="/pa/391/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="391 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="1276842" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0013-01">391 Pa. 13</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20242" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="137 A.2d 242">137 A. 2d 242</a>, is apposite. In <em>Yuscavage, </em>supra, where the owners of two tracts of land, with the exception of the coal thereunder, conveyed “All the surface and right of soil” of the two tracts and the habendum clause, very similar to ihe recitation in the <em>Commonwealth </em>deed, recited “And also, all the estate, right, title, interest ... of the grantors”, we held that such language conveyed title to the oil and gas under these tracts of land. Like the deed in <em>Yuscavage, </em>supra, the <em>Commonwealth </em>deed conveyed all the interest of the grantor [Penfield’s receiver] in the premises, including the natural gas rights, excepting only that which had been conveyed previously by Penfield’s predecessors in title. An examination of the <em>Commonwealth </em>deed, read in conjunction with the judicial proceedings which authorized and approved the conveyance, clearly shows that Pen-field intended to convey <em>each and every </em>interest which it had, save such as had been previously conveyed; no severance of the natural gas rights was ever contemplated by the parties.</p>

The Majority Opinion finds a way to say that when the grantor said “all other minerals of every kind and character,” he did not intend to include natural gas. Is gas not a mineral? From time immemorial the substantive world has been divided into three kingdoms; the animal, vegetable and mineral. If gas is excluded from the mineral kingdom, where does it go?

On June 25, 1900, N. T. Arnold of Clearfield County obtained title in fee simple from I. F. Richey et al. to four tracts of land comprising 3781.35 acres. On the same day he obtained title from the same Richey et al. to mineral rights in fifteen other tracts of land. The mineral rights in these other fifteen tracts were conveyed in the following language: “All the coal, coal oil, fire clay and other minerals of every kind and character.” The deed also contained this illuminating provision: “It is the intention of the grantors herein to convey to the said N. T. Arnold all the land, coal, coal oil, fire clay, <em>natural gas </em>and other minerals and all rights vested in said grantors.”</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[167,1406,1147,371]]]'>Thus, this provision quite clearly established that Arnold obtained title to the natural gas in the fifteen tracts (which are not here at issue). Nor is it questioned that he acquired the gas rights in the four tracts here involved since his title to these tracts was a fee simple one. The question is who <em>now </em>owns the gas rights in those four tracts.</p>

We have seen that he made the first conveyance of mineral rights in two of the four parcels of land on June 25, 1900, the same day that he had received the mineral rights in the fifteen tracts. In this conveyance he had accepted the word “gas” as a mineral and had contracted with respect thereto on that basis. Why would not the term “mineral” in the deed <em>from </em>him to Byrne not be given the same meaning it was given in the deed <em>to </em>him? Especially when the latter deed shows that the Byrne deed was already in contemplation of the parties, since it makes specific reference to it as follows: “. . . excepting such interest as was heretofore <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>conveyed ... to John Byrne, Trustee as of this date.” In fact, the deed to John Byrne was recorded before the deed to Arnold.</p>
    <p id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[161,528,1146,1030]]]'>Since these two deeds (the one to Arnold and the one from Arnold) were warp and woof of the same transaction, can the word <em>mineral </em>be given one interpretation in one conveyance and another meaning in its twin conveyance? In <em>Silver v. Bush, </em>supra, cited by the Majority Opinion with enthusiastic approval, this Court said: “The crucial question ... is what was the sense in which the parties used the word.” In what sense could Arnold, Byrne and Hall-Kaul use the word mineral except to include natural gas, in view of the specific language to that effect in the Richey deed conveying the mineral rights to Arnold? Let us see further how Arnold regarded the deeds in which he conveyed mineral rights to Byrne and Hall-Kaul in June and July, 1900. He lived six years after these conveyances. During those years he did not attempt to sell the natural gas rights to anyone nor did he indicate in any manner that he had withheld the rights to natural gas from the grant of “all other minerals.”</p>

His personal representatives petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Clearfield County to sell all his property for payment of debts. A Schedule “C”, listing all Arnold’s properties, was attached to the petition. This schedule described Arnold’s rights in the four tracts as <em>“surface only.” </em>One of Arnold’s personal representatives incidentally was his widow, who had been a co-grantor in the deeds to Byrne and Hall-Kaul. If anyone would know the intention of Arnold when the mineral rights were conveyed to Byrne and Hall-Kaul, it would be she. She recognized that <em>all </em>mineral rights had been conveyed to Byrne and Hall-Kaul, thus leaving to Arnold and herself only the surface rights in the four tracts, Accordingly, the formal document describing <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>Arnold’s rights in the four tracts specified “Surface Only.”</p>

F. Thompson, the gas rights were nevertheless included in the petition and authorized for sale by order of court and conveyed to B. F. Thompson!

It will mean that no one, looking over the record of court authenticated sales, can now be certain of what was actually sold because, although a schedule specifically enumerates what has been sold, there is always the possibility that a later court in an entirely different and independent proceeding may declare the schedule added to, subtracted from, or completely nullified.</p>

Of course, this reasoning on the part of the Majority is all ex post facto, because no one, while the property rights were being transferred, could have foreseen or imagined what this Court is now deciding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a>

Obviously, Penfield could not receive more than Thompson had to sell, and Thompson could not have had more than he obtained from Arnold’s representatives, and the representatives could only have inherited what Arnold had left to them, namely, surface rights only.</p>

Although the Majority regards this quitclaim deed as assuring to Penfield the gas rights underlying the four tracts, Penfield itself acted all the time on the assumption and belief that it had only surface rights to the land. On March 1, 1910, in a mortgage to the Guarantee Title and Trust Company, by which it expressly undertook to place in trust <em>all </em>of its property, real, personal and mixed and <em>all </em>rights, privileges and franchises of the Company, in order to secure $700,000, Penfield described its rights in the four tracts only as <em>“surface.” </em>Nor did it make any changes in this mortgage after the correcting deed had been executed. Even Penfield’s own map of its holdings, introduced in evidence in this litigation, and dated 1920, showing the acreage here involved, marked its rights in the acreage as “surface” alone.</p>

And thus the fateful four tracts of land without mineral rights became the property of the Commonwealth. And upon this showing, the Majority comes to the conclusion that the Commonwealth received the rights to the natural gas in the land! In arriving at this astonishing conclusion, the Majority makes no effort to explain Iioav it is that in all of the 57 years Avhich elapsed between the granting of the mineral rights to Byrne and Hall-Haul (which rights now belong to the New ShaAVmut Mining Company) and the initiation of this laAVsuit, the only ones who paid taxes on the minerals were Byrne and Hall-Haul and the NeAV Shawmut Mining Company.</p>

It says that: “The mining of coal, not the recovery of natural gas, was the principal objective of the Byrne and Hall-Kaul conveyances; in fact, John Byrne’s principal duties as trustee were in connection with the recovery of coal.” But I respectfully suggest that the test of principal objective is no test at all in arriving at the proper decision in this case. If we would apply this principal objective test to the other conveyances we have encountered in the chronology of title we would have to ask: Was it the principal objective of N. T. Arnold to recover gas, yet no one questions that he received the gas rights in the original conveyances. Was it the principal objective of Penfield Coal and Coke Company, which was in the coal and coke business, to recover gas, yet the Majority held that Penfield obtained title to the gas in the property. Was it the principal objective of the Commonwealth’s Department of Forests and Waters to gather up gas? What does the Department of Forests and Waters have to do with the recovery of natural gas?

Thus, if the Majority conclusion is to be accepted as law, we must find that when Arnold said “minerals of <em>every hind </em>and <em>description,” </em>he did not mean every kind and description. We must find that when Arnold’s personal representatives said “surface rights alone” they really meant surface and sub-surface rights. We must find that when the orphans’ court used the words “surface rights,” they did not mean only the surface, on which there is no gas but the inner strata as well where there is gas. We must find that when Thompson conveyed “all of the surface” to Penfield, he really meant all of surface and all of the subterranean terrain as well. We must find that when Penfield described its rights in the tracts as “wild surface lands,” it meant not only the wild land above the surface, but the wild natural gas beneath. We must find that when the receiver of Penfield petitioned the United States District Court to sell the “wild surface lands but <em>without </em>mineral rights,” he really meant wild surface lands but <em>with </em>mineral rights. We must find that the United States District Court in granting the petition in the words of the receiver intended to go beyond what was requested, what was intended, and what was legal. We must find that when the receiver sold the land to the Commonwealth, Department of Forests and Waters, and reported to the court that he had sold only the wild surface land that he really did not mean what he said, that he was misrepresenting matters to the court, and that he really sold the wild surface land and the wild, uncontrolled natural gas beneath. And we must find that although the Commonwealth’s Department of Forests and Waters was only interested in buying the <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>wild surface land it was forced to accept the natural gas for winch it has no use and with which as a Department of the Commonwealth’s government it is not required to cope.</p>
