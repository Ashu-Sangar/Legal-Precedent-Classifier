There Avas no residuary estate; on the contrary the assets left by the testator were insufficient to pay the legacies and devises in full. The loAver court decided that there must be an abatement and the amount of the abatement for each legacy and devise, as Avell as the order of abatement between various legacies and devises. In <em>Dunion’s Estate </em>the lower court stated that <em>in computing the abatement </em>among the legatees and devisees the direction to pay inheritance tax out of a residuary estate “is <em>in substance </em>an additional legacy in favor of the legatees.” In <em>Greaves’s Estate </em>the lower court stated that a devise of real estate free of collateral inheritance tax should “be considered <em>as equivalent </em>to a legacy to [the devisee] of the amount of the tax and as a general legacy must abate with the others.” However, these cases, instead of supporting, completely refute the Commonwealth’s present position because after the lower court had decided the questions of abatement, both the Commonwealth and the appellee agree that the court imposed the inheritance tax, <em>not on the■ additional legacy theory </em>but, on the <em>actual amount </em>of the pecuniary tax-free legacies and the appraised value of the real estate de\dsed.</p>

Moreover, the Income Tax Law is generally considered a law unto itself. For example, it treats as income what is not income, namely, capital gains; and it holds that capital gains are taxable income, but capital losses are not deductible as income except to a very limited extent. We repeat, we do not consider the provisions of the law with respect to Federal income taxes analogous or controlling. However, if an analogy to Federal taxes is sought, we note parenthetically that Social Security taxes which are paid by an employer for the benefit of an employee are not considered additional income to the employee, and that the gift tax which is payable by a donor on his gift to a donee is not considered an “additional gift” or “additional income” to the donee, nor taxable to the donee as such.</p>

He says, “There can be no argument about this fact — obviously it is better to be left a tax free legacy. But the Act does not say that this economic difference is something which is to be taxed.” This is my point of departure. I think the only construction that can consistently be placed on the forty-five or more amendments to the Transfer Inheritance Tax Act is that “the clear value of the property . . . passing to or <em>for the use of” </em>the legatee can be measured only by the economic value. The legislature undoubtedly used clear value synonymously with economic value.
