    <p id="b94-12" data-blocks='[["BL_94.20",94,[247,1819,1147,370]]]'>The Township of Whitehall, in Lehigh County, a township of the first class, enacted an ordinance, known as “The Trailer and Trailer Park Ordinance”, which provides, inter alia, that “No person shall occupy any trailer coach for sleeping or living quarters outside a duly permitted trailer park” and further prescribes penal sanctions for violations.</p>
    <p id="b94-13" data-blocks='[["BL_94.21",94,[249,2200,1145,152]],["BL_95.1",95,[161,377,1149,1028]]]'>Following enactment of the ordinance, Gerald Oswald and John Reiss, the appellants herein, purchased and occupied house trailers, as homes, upon <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>land situate in the township outside “a duly permitted trailer park.” The chief of police of the township, at the direction of the board of commissioners, gave notice to Oswald and Reiss that they were in violation of the ordinance and subject to the fines and penalties provided therein. Without any effort to enforce the ordinance against Oswald and Reiss, the township filed a petition in the court of common pleas of the county praying a declaratory judgment affirming the constitutionality of the ordinance in its application to Oswald and Reiss. The basis for invoking the court’s jurisdiction of the township’s declaratory judgment petition was, as averred therein, that. “there is a conflict of judicial opinion as to the constitutionality of ordinances of the nature and type” of the Whitehall Township Ordinance in question. The court took jurisdiction of the petition and adjudged and decreed that the ordinance is constitutional. From that judgment Oswald and Reiss have appealed.</p>

The plaintiff township, a political subdivision, seeks, by means of a declaratory judgment petition, a judicial pronouncement upon the constitutionality of its own voluntary enactment. It is as unorthodox as it is extraordinary for a municipality to., enact an ordinance and ■then forthwith supplicate a court’s determination of its constitutionality. To construe the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act as granting such a right to a governmental body would be to encourage legislative irresponsibility and to constitute the courts the legal advisers of municipalities with respect to their legislative enactments. If a question concerning the constitutionality of an ordinance is to be passed upon by a court, it can be done properly only as the sequence of an actual controversy based upon a sufficient allega<a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>tion by a complainant that he is being harmed or threatened with imminent harm in violation of his constitutionally protected rights.</p>
    <p id="b96-4" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[240,538,1149,1074]]]'>The draftsman of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act labored under no misapprehension as to the impossible situation that would result if a municipality were permitted to test by a declaratory judgment proceeding the constitutionality of one of its own enactments. Such a right, the statute does not extend to a municipality or other political subdivision clothed with legislative power. The right to question the construction or validity of a municipal ordinance by a declaratory judgment proceeding, in appropriate circumstances, and obtain a declaration of the petitioner’s rights, status, or legal obligations under the ordinance, is restricted by Section 2 of the Act of June 18, 1923, P.L. 840 (12 PS §832) to “Any person . . . whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract or franchise. . . .” Certainly, it can not reasonably be said that the plaintiff township’s “rights, status, or other legal relations” have been adversarily affected by its own deliberately intended enactment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

For what purpose would an ordaining public body subject to judicial scrutiny its <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>own legislative enactments which are presumptively constitutional as a matter of law? And, it has been expressly recognized that “The same presumption of constitutional validity that attends an act of the legislature is equally applicable to municipal ordinances whether they be enacted by the council of a city, town or borough or by the supervisors of a township”: <em>Bilbar Construction Company v. Easttown Township Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/393/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="393 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1279711" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0062-01">393 Pa. 62</a>, 71, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20851" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="141 A.2d 851">141 A. 2d 851</a>. So long as an ordinance is unquestioned, its constitutional validity remains established. The plaintiff township was, therefore, without standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the court below for the purpose of having the constitutionality of its trailer ordinance adjudicated in a declaratory judgment proceeding.</p>

    <p id="b98-4" data-blocks='[["BL_98.5",98,[271,655,1151,966]]]'>I agree with the majority opinion that we certainly should not ordinarily entertain a declaratory judgment proceeding sur a petition by a Township to interpret the meaning or to adjudicate the constitutionality of a Township Ordinance. The Courts of Pennsylvania, for practical reasons and as a result of practical experience, have found it wise and necessary to restrict declaratory judgment proceedings; otherwise the Courts would be swamped with such proceedings, many of which would not or could not or do not include a statement of material facts which were then in existence or subsequently arise. However, this is one of those cases where (§5 of) the Ordinance creates such unusual and inevitable problems and hardships, and the threatened injury to landowners and to present and prospective trailer coach owners is so immediate and so great that this declaratory judgment proceeding is, in my opinion, both appropriate and justifiable.</p>

What is the likely or inevitable result? A person may wish to buy land and also to purchase a trailer and to use it for sleeping or living quarters on his own land. The record does not disclose the market value of land in this Township but land, depending on its location and the times, may cost $1,000 to $20,000 an acre; a trailer coach costs many thousands of dollars. Under the majority opinion it is clear that such a prospective purchaser would be without status, legal or equitable, and would have no equitable or legal remedy to test the constitutionality of this Ordinance until (1) he had spent a small fortune to buy land and/or a trailer coach, and (2) he was thereafter arrested and convicted of violating this Ordinance-even though, as in the present case, the Board of Commissioners or other proper official gave him advance notice that the use of such a trailer coach would be in violation of the Ordinance and would subject the violator to the fines and penalties provided therein.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">*</a> This is so obviously inequitable and unjust as to make it clear that the present action is the only action which is available (a) to protect trailer coach owners and purchasers, and (b) to render equity and justice.</p>
