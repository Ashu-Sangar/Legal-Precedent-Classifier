The appellants filed amended preliminary objections, which in part challenge the lower court’s jurisdiction to entertain the cause of action.

In his amended complaint, appellee makes the following cryptic allegation: “11. That the plaintiff has exhausted the remedies available within the international mailers union and the PHILADELPHIA MAILERS UNION NUMBER 14, and that he has no adequate remedy at law.” Attached to appellee’s amended complaint is Exhibit “A” which is a copy of Article XXI of the International’s by-laws, in effect in August, 1956, and from which the president of the International and its Annual Convention purported to derive their authority for appellee’s alleged expulsion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Section 2(e) of Article XXI specifically <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>provides an aggrieved member with the right to appeal to named bodies within the International for redress against action taken against him which, he deems un-. just. Later sections of the Article- spell out procedural requirements which must be complied with in taking an appeal, i.e., giving notice in writing of intention to appeal,, filing six copies of the grievant’s appeal brief, etc. Further, there are provisions in the Article which provide for appeal from an adverse decision of the Executive Council, after ‘ notice find filing briefs and documents with the Secretary-Treasurer of the International, to the next succeeding Convention. And finally, there is a provision making the determination of the Convention final. It is thus patently clear from the face of appellee’s- amended complaint and supporting data that internal union remedies are provided by the International for the resolution of member-association disputes. . ;</p>

A mere conclusion of the pleader that he has exhausted his internal remedies, without specific averment of the procedure available, the steps taken, or the specific reasons why certain steps were not taken, will be insufficient to support jurisdiction.

In that case the Supreme Court sustained the jurisdiction of a state court which had ordered reinstatement of a plaintiff who had alleged a wrongful expulsion from his union. We think that the <em>Gonzales </em>situation is clearly distinguishable from the instant case. Moreover, the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in the second <em>Garmon </em>case has either effectively undercut or severely limited to its facts the <em>Gonzales </em>case.</p>
    <p id="b209-3" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[172,1084,1193,1308]],["BL_210.1",210,[226,372,1150,208]]]'>In the matter now before us, the appellee seeks reinstatement only because, as he alleges, the direct result of the expulsion has been to prevent him from continuing work as a mailer. He makes no claim' for damages based on injury to his <em>rights as a, member </em>of the appellant unions, which in a proper case, as we stated in Falsetti, our courts will protect. Therefore,'^ the crux of the appellee’s case is not injury to the <em>union-member </em>relationship, as it was in Gonzales, but rather injury to appellee’s <em>employment </em>relationship by reason of the appellant’s arbitrary and unreason-^ able action in expelling him. Since appellee has not* provided any explanation of how or why the expulsion from appellant finions has prevented him from obtaining work as a mailer, we can only infer that in pursuance of agreements or arrangements between employers and the appellants, only members of the appellant unions could obtain work from the employers, and further, that as a consequence thereof, that appellants from August, 1956, on, caused the employers to refuse employment to the appellee because he had lost his membership in appellant unions. The theory of appellee’s cause of action, therefore, if substantiated by the evidence, makes it at least arguable <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>if not more, that the type of union activity involved was in violation of Section 8(b)(2) of the.

As Justice Frankfurter stated at the outset of his opinion, “the crux of the claim sustained by the California court was that under California law membership in a labor union constitutes a contract between the member and the union, the terms of which are governed by the constitution and by-laws of the union, and that state law provides, through mandatory reinstatement and damages, a remedy for breach of such contract through wrongful 'expulsion.” <a href="/us/356/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="356 U.S. 617" data-case-ids="6165713" data-case-paths="/us/356/0617-01">356 U. S. at 618</a>. The court ordered the plaintiff reinstated to membership and awarded damages both for the physical and mental suffering which the breach of contract had brought about, and for lost wages similarly caused. On plaintiff’s own theory of the case, the fact that he was unable to obtain employment was only an incidental effect of the breach of contract, developed as an item of damage through evidence adduced at the trial. It is belaboring the obvious to point out that the theories behind the two suits are entirely distinct. In sustaining the state court’s jurisdiction, the court emphatically pointed out that “the protection of union members <em>in their rights as members </em>from arbitrary conduct by unions and union officers has not been undertaken by federal law, and indeed the assertion of any such power has been expressly denied.” <a href="/us/356/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="356 U.S. 617" data-case-ids="6165713" data-case-paths="/us/356/0617-01">Id. at 620</a>. (Emphasis supplied). And again at pp. 621-622, the Court reiterated “that the subject matter of the litigation in the present Case, as the parties and the court conceived it, was the breach of a <em>contract governing </em>

      <em> </em>(Emphasis supplied). We conclude, therefore, that even if <em>Gonzales </em>remains unimpaired by the Supreme Court’s later holding in the second <em>Garmon </em>case, our jurisdiction can only be sustained where the complaint is grounded solely on injury to the plaintiff’s member-union relationship, and which complaint does not seek damages for “back pay” as a result of interference by the union with employment rights, which remedy the N.L.R.B. is specifically empowered by Section 10(c) to grant in unfair labor practices cases.</p>

In a pre-emption case decided upon what now seem to be discarded principles, the author of today’s majority opinion declared: ‘Controlling and therefore superseding federal power cannot be curtailed by the State even though the ground of intervention be different than that on which federal supremacy has been exercised.’ Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., supra (<a href="/us/348/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="348 U.S. 468" data-case-ids="6931860" data-case-paths="/us/348/0468-01">348 U. S. at 480</a>).

Justice Frankfurter, the author of Weber, <em>Gonzales </em>and now the second <em>Garmon </em>case, makes it abundantly clear in the latter decision that the “discarded principles” embodied in <em>Garner </em>and <em>Weber </em>have been completely restored as guiding lights in the Court’s continuing attempts to fill in the “Delphic” interstices of the Taft-Hartley Act. In the <em>Garmon </em>decision, Justice Frankfurter dismisses the <em>Gonzales </em>decision as one involving a situation “where the activity regulated was a merely peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act” (<a href="/us/359/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="359 U.S. 236" data-case-ids="6164086" data-case-paths="/us/359/0236-01">359 U.

Nor is there any doubt that the prophetic remark of Justice Harlan, who concurred in the result, that the <em>Garmon </em>case “will stand as a landmark in future ‘pre-emption’ cases in the labor field” (<a href="/us/359/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="359 U.S. 236" data-case-ids="6164086" data-case-paths="/us/359/0236-01">359 U.

See the <em>Yellow Cab </em>Service, <em>Inc. </em>decision, supra, wherein the Court, <em>without opinion </em>and citing only the <em>Garmon </em>case, summarily reversed a pre-emption case wherein the only issue argued was whether <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>there had been enough of an effect on interstate commerce as to oust state court jurisdiction.</p>

Out of the intricate maze of prior opinions, their distinguishing characteristics and their attending confusion both to the bench and bar, the Supreme Court in one landmark case has created order. We can add nothing to the language used by Justice Frankfurter in so doing. He has directed attention to the significant criteria by which both the state and federal judiciary must determine whether jurisdiction exists in these labor situations. We are to be concerned solely with delimiting the areas of potential conflict between the two law-enforcing authorities, and in so doing, we should focus on the nature of the activities rather than on the method of regulation. The unifying consideration should always be that Congress has entrusted responsibility in this area to an administrative agency, „ the N.L.R.B., equipped with specialized procedures and peculiar expertise, to which body primary determinations of jurisdiction should be referred in order to effectuate the intent of Congress, in the Taft-Hartley Act, to fashion a national labor policy. The test given us by the Supreme Court to apply is not at all complex. Is the activity <em>arguably </em>within §7 or §8? If it is, then the jurisdiction of state and federal courts is ousted. Only a subsequent determination by the , N.L.R.B. that the activity is neither protected nor prohibited can vest jurisdiction once again in our courts.</p>

The alleged <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>union activity would, if proved, be arguably subject to a §8 proceeding. The appellee’s complaint in effect charges that without the necessary union clearance, employers could not accept the appellee as an employee. The result was to encourage membership in the union on the union’s own terms. As the Supreme Court has stated, “§§8(a)(3) and 8(b)(2) were designed to allow employees to freely exercise their right to join unions, be good, bad, or indifferent members, or abstain from joining any union without imperiling their livelihood.” <em>Radio Officers’ Union v.

And even the proviso to §8(a) (3), which authorizes certain union security contracts, prohibits discharge under such contracts if union membership was terminated for reasons other than the failure to pay dues.
