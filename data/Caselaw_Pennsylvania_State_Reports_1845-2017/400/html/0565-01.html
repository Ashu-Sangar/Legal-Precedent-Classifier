    <p id="b594-5" data-blocks='[["BL_594.6",594,[231,924,1152,1082]]]'>This confession of judgment resulted from a dispute between the parties concerning a proper interpretation of a lease. The judgment is for the sum of $91,279.34 including a <em>5% </em>attorney’s commission. The lease itself contains a provision that “All disagreement or disputes under this contract shall be settled by arbitration . . .”, and sets forth means to select a panel of three arbitrators. The appellee’s defense- to the payment of monies allegedly due is predicated upon an interpretation of a paragraph in the lease relating to the inclusion of amortization costs in rental returns. This interpretation is dependent upon the further interpretation and admissibility under the parol evidence rule of certain unexecuted leases negotiated by the parties just prior to the existing lease. While problems of the proper interpretation of written instruments and the admissibility of evidence are predominantly questions of law, they may be ruled upon by arbitrators. <em>Shannon v.
