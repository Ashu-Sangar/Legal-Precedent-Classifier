The Commonwealth and the City of Philadelphia had, a year before, put in contract form their respective responsibilities vis-a-vis each other arising out of the construction of the bridge and its approaches.

    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.6",617,[150,917,1148,1078]]]'>The applicable rule is that the parties may stipulate, and be bound by their act as the law of the case, in all matters affecting them without affecting the jurisdiction and prerogatives of the court.

But it is not necessary to subject parties or the court inexorably to such applications, and in all nonessentials it is safe to let parties or counsel fix their own conditions. It may, therefore, be stated as the settled laAV and practice in Pennsylvania, that whatever does not affect the jurisdiction, or the due order of business and convenience of the court is capable of arrangement between the parties or their counsel, and an agreement by them Avill become the law of the case.”</p>

Hence the Board of Arbitration of Claims had the right to reject the stipulation.</p>
    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.6",618,[246,982,1145,592]]]'>This leaves us with only the Act of 1937 and its provision that a legal quorum should be two members.

    <p id="b618-6" data-blocks='[["BL_618.7",618,[242,1594,1147,591]]]'>The answer is clear. The Act of 1927 relates to private arbitration, while the Act of 1937 is a self-contained Act created expressly for the disposition of claims against the Commonwealth, which can be sued only when and how it permits. Private arbitrators are chosen <em>ad hoc </em>by the parties, whereas the Board arbitrators are Governor-appointed for set terms and are paid. The Act of 1927 has nothing whatever to do with the situation before us, the more so since the contract between the parties expressly adopted the arbitrational process of the Act of 1937.</p>

It is obviously advisable, when the legislative command is to hear and determine, that those who decide should hear substantially all of the testimony, except where the delegation of the hearing power to a master or auditor is proper. But the important thing is that they who decide must consider all of the evidence, and in the event of a member of the hearing body dying, it should suffice that his successor consider, by reading from the record what he has not heard, in order to avoid the practical and expensive difficulty of requiring a full rehearing. Of equal import is the right of the parties to make argument before the determining body on the issues involved. In <em>Morgan v. U.
