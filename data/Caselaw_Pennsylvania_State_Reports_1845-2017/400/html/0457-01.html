    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[255,710,1152,1364]]]'>We do not see how the presumption of due care could arise from this record. It exists only to bridge the gap of silence caused by death, but it may be overcome when there is evidence of how the occurrence happened: <em>Bernstein v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em><a href="/pa/252/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="252 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="1021671" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0581-01">252 Pa. 581</a> (1916), <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.%20933" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="97 A. 933">97 A. 933</a>; <em>Basel v.

There was considerable evidence here; the defendant was examined as under cross-examination and without substantial contradiction later; there were pictures introduced; there was evidence of drinking by the three persons in ■the car and of defendant’s condition when they left. Hence the presumption was inoperative. It would also have been illogical, for as the court below said: “It impresses us that the present situation falls within the class of cases that are strictly 'assumption of risk’ and not contributory negligence. The decedent is charged with assuming the risk of riding with defendant knowing him to be so intoxicated or fatigued to be incapable of driving. This was the issue submitted to the jury. Therefore, decedent’s actions after entering the car were immaterial, since his prior actions in getting into the car governed the results; and these actions were all demonstrated by the plaintiff’s witness.”</p>

      <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>Plaintiff points to no Pennsylvania or Ohio case holding that the gnest who assumes the risk of driving with an obviously drunken driver is still entitled- to the presumption of due care, but he offers a case from Illinois where there is a Guest Act: <em>Anderson v. Launer, </em><a href="/ill-app-2d/13/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="13 Ill. App. 2d 530" data-case-ids="5170335" data-case-paths="/ill-app-2d/13/0530-01">13 Ill.

In that case the court said: “This presumption, standing alone, prohibits this court from holding that there is <em>no </em>evidence showing plaintiff’s intestate to be free from wilful and wanton misconduct.” The real thrust of the case appears in the defense that the decedent was equally guilty of wilful and wanton misconduct by participating in defendant’s drinking and then entering the car. This was held to be a question for the jury. In the instant case the defense is different. Appellant’s brief states that “if the plaintiff is barred, he is barred because his disregard for his own safety [i.e., assumption of risk] is equal to the defendant’s misconduct”, and in addition states that there is no showing that the decedent was aware of the defendant’s condition. If this is his acceptance of the defense and the theory of his case, he cannot take advantage of the “equal wanton misconduct” theory, since it isn’t charged against him, in order to reach the very limited benefit of the presumption of due care in the <em>Anderson </em>case. We regard the reasoning of the court below as more robust and to the point, that there is no place at which the presumption can attach and operate. The charge of ■the trial judge was therefore correct.</p>
    <p id="b489-3" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[178,1976,1151,377]],["BL_490.1",490,[237,361,1150,1077]]]'>. Plaintiff’s second complaint is that the trial judge erred in excluding evidence that plaintiff’s witness, Mrs. McCue, had spoken with the defendant’s representative before trial. Appellant tries to build up a recondite farrago of insinuations, suggestions, and inferences, but the incident is very simple. In a deposition not read to the jury Mrs. McCue referred to the <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>man who talked to her before trial as being from the insurance company and resembling defendant’s trial counsel. During the trial defense counsel cross-examined her about her talk with one of plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff now says in its brief: “The plaintiff offered to show that the witness spoke to the defendant’s representative before speaking to the plaintiff’s attorney, either with the mention of insurance or without mentioning it.” The trial judge obviously thought that the danger of Mrs. MeCue’s blurting out that the defendant’s representative was from the insurance company was too great to risk allowing it and to have to declare a mistrial if it happened. This seems to us clearly more weighty than counsel’s delicate balancing of subjective assumptions. Far from there being an inference that the witness had been coached by her attorney, she testified directly that he did not tell her what to say and that she told him “exactly what I am telling here.” This was a matter for the court’s discretion and we see no abuse of it.</p>
