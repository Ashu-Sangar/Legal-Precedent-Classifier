In 1930 Frank Securities Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was formed and all the trust assets were transferred to that corporation with the trusts receiving, proportionately to each trust interest, stock in that corporation. On October 4, 1935 a Delaware partnership known as Frandel Partnership was created and all the stock in the corporation was turned over by the trusts to that partnership, each trust receiving, in return, its fractional interest in the partnership. At that time all the corporation, partnership and trust assets were transferred from Pittsburgh to Wilmington, Delaware, the trust assets being placed in the Wilmington Trust Company which held them in nominee registration. Both the corporation and partnership were later dissolved and their assets transferred to the three trusts. In January, 1957 all the trust assets were transferred to the Fiduciary Trust Company of New York (herein termed Fiduciary) which placed them in its vault in nominee registration. Pursuant to an order of the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County, all the trust assets have been returned to a Pittsburgh fiduciary which now holds them in a custodial capacity. The assets of all three trusts, originally valued at approximately one and one-half million dollars, now have an estimated value in excess of fourteen million dollars.</p>

In connection with these accounts, the court appointed one Abraham Pervin as trustee ad litem to represent various minor and unborn interests in the trusts. In Pervin’s report to the court he stated, inter alia: “I do not think it is incumbent upon the individual Trustees to appoint a successor to the dissolved Corporate Trustee. I also feel that it is for the best interests of the minors and all other parties whom I represent that no corporate trustee be appointed to act with the present individual Trustees . . . that the addition of a corporate trustee in this estate would be a useless extravagance and would involve the interests which I represent in unnecessary expenditures”.</p>

In our view, such a construction is not a strict, but a super technical interpretation of the language of these trust deeds required neither by <em>Boning </em>nor <em>Trimble. </em>Our examination of the trust language indicates that it was the manifest intent on the part of the settlors that the <em>event </em>which would give rise to the individual trustees’ power to appoint was the corporate trustee’s <em>resignation. </em>The corporate trustee did resign. True, that resignation took place by operation of law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> rather than by submission to a demand on the part of the trustees; nevertheless, that constituted the event upon the happening of which settlors intended the individual trustees to have the right to select the successor to the corporate trustee. Appellants well state in their brief: “To require the individual trustees to demand the resignation of [Pittsburgh Bank] when it was insolvent and in receivership [a legal status which made it impossible for the Bank to continue to act] would mean that they were obligated to perform that kind of vain and useless act that, traditionally, courts have not required parties to perform.

The mere failure on the part of the trustee to exercise the power of appointment for a long period of time did not act as a forfeiture, especially when no one has been shown to have been prejudiced thereby, when the former trustee ad litem opposed the appointment of any corporate trustee and when the Orphans’ Court in 1949 by its award of the balances for distribution to the individual trustees had, by implication, countenanced the failure to appoint.

The power of the orphans’ court to appoint any successor trustee is “subject to the provisions, if any, of the trust instrument”; until it was determined that the trustees had no power of appointment under the provisions of the 1930 trust deeds, the orphans’ court lacked the power of appointment.

A foreign fiduciary cannot act as a trustee in Pennsylvania unless it is appointed within the terms of that statute. The court en banc in its opinion said: “It is obvious from the 1930 deeds of trust that the Fiduciary Trust Company of New York is not appointed by the terms of either of them as successor corporate trustee and it is equally obvious that the individual trustees are not granted by the trust instruments the express or implied power to appoint a foreign corporate fiduciary as successor to the Bank of Pittsburgh.”</p>

The argument that, even though Fiduciary was not expressly named in the deeds of trust themselves yet if the trustees have the power to appoint under the instruments impliedly Fiduciary’s appointment arises by virtue of the trust deeds, overlooks the basic legislative intent which is that the maker of the instrument assume responsibility for the foreign fiduciary by expressly naming him — an express, rather than an implied, appointment.

Our review of the record, including the opinions of President Judge Boyle and the court en banc, indicates that full and complete consideration was given to all the factors which indicated or contraindicated the suitability of Fiduciary for appointment. The court concluded that, under the circumstances, the appointment of <em>any </em>foreign fiduciary as successor corporate trustee would not be for the best interests of this estate. Within the scope of our permissible review we find no abusé of discretion on the part of the court below and must affirm its refusal to appoint Fiduciary under the 1927 trust.</p>

Our scrutiny of this record indicates that for the best interests of all three trusts a corporate trustee in succession should be appointed and that the <em>same trustee should he appointed for all trusts. </em>These three trusts have been administered over the years as one unit; that type of administration should continue. The individual trustees, the trustee ad litem and the . court should agree on a corporate fiduciary located in Pittsburgh and appoint that fiduciary as the successor trustee in all three trusts.</p>

In these days of reciprocal banking laws, when America is “flying”, when residents of every state often have multiple dwellings and businessmen multiple plants, and when people are frequently moving their homes and their businesses, when New York is “just around the corner,” when banks are doing an interstate business and are thoroughly examined and strictly supervised, the Bank<a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>ing Code should receive a liberal rather than a narrow restrictive construction.
