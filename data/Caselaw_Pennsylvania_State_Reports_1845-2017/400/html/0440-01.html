The Superior Court determined that the claimants were unemployed because the work stoppage was the result of a strike and not a lockout. Administratively, the Bureau first denied the claimants compensation but the referee and the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review determined that the work stoppage was a lockout and allowed compensation to the claimants and their fellow employees.</p>

The Union asked for a five cent per hour increase and certain fringe benefits pertaining to insurance and pensions which would have totaled approximately nine cents an hour. The Company made no offer on wages <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>and fringe benefits until August 26 when it offered six cents an hour increase to be divided between wages and fringe benefits in whatever way the Union desired. The increase was, however, contingent upon the fact that the premiums and tonnage systems would be abolished. Although all the employees were offered the hourly increase, the evidence shows that some, although not all of those on incentive pay, would be subject to a loss of take home pay.</p>

The employer refused to agree to such extension and informed the Union that work would be available only on the basis of its original offer. The employees refused to accept the Company’s proposal. The employees continued to work their regular shifts until midnight, August 31. Those on the 11:00 shift reported at 11:00 and worked until midnight. Operations at the plant did not cease until midnight. The employer continued to hold its plant open and there was work available for the claimants and their fellow . employees, but only under the new conditions of employment laid doAvn by the employer.</p>

The law contemplates that collective bargaining will be conducted in good faith, with a sincere purpose to find a basis for agreement. Neither an adamant attitude of “no contract, no work” on the part of the employees, nor an ultimatum laid down by the employer that work will be available only on his (employer’s) terms, are serious manifestations of a desire to continue the operation of the enterprise. While either or both of these positions may legitimately be taken by the parties during the bargaining negotiations prior to the expiration of the existing contract, when the contract has in fact expired and a new agreement has not yet been negotiated, the sole test under §402(d) of the Unemployment Compensation Law, Act of December 5, 1936, P.

If the employer refuses to so extend the expiring contract and maintain the status quo, then the resulting work stoppage constitutes a “lockout” and the disqualification for unemployment compensation benefits in the case of a “stoppage of work because of a labor dispute” does not apply.</p>

The referee below found as a fact that when the existing contract expired, the employer rejected a good faith union offer to maintain the status quo for a reasonable time pending further negotiation, and hence held that the claimants are not barred by the terms of §402(d) from receiving unemployment compensation benefits. The Board affirmed the referee’s findings of fact and also allowed the claims, holding expressly that the labor dispute must be classified as a “lockout” since the employer was, in the end, responsible for the work stoppage. We agree with the appellants that the findings of fact by the Board and the referee are supported by the evidence. Such findings are conclusive on appeal. Act of December 5, 1936, P. L.
