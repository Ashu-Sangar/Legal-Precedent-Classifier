Moffat, appellant in No. 84, under the State Mining Commission Act (Act of July 3, 1941, P.L. 259, amending Act of June 1, 1933, P.L. 1409, 52 PS §1501 et seq.) to determine the amount of coal owned by Moffat necessary to be left in place in order to give lateral and vertical support to certain portions of the Northeastern extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and to award damages for the taking thereof. Diamond Colliery Company, appellant in No. 128, was granted permission to intervene in the proceedings before the State Mining Commission as the owner of a smaller portion of land condemned by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. The Commission awarded to Moffat $1,064,614.60, and to the Diamond Colliery Company $3500 as damages for the coal and silt required to be left in place, including detention damages. By their appeals the appellants (1) contend that the damages awarded were inadequate and unsupported by any substantial evidence, and (2) ascribe error to the failure of the Commission to award detention damages for the full period between the date of condemnation and the date of final judgment on the award.</p>

That court dismissed the appeal and quashed the proceedings on the grounds that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission was not a municipal or other corporation within the meaning of Section 8, Art. 16 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and consequently the appellants were not entitled to a jury trial under the proviso of the State Mining Commission Act allowing an appeal to the courts of common pleas where a party is constitutionally guaranteed a jury trial. The present appeals, however, are solely from the award of the State Mining Commission. There is no separate appeal from the order of the court below dismissing the appeal for a jury trial which was entered subsequent to the taking of the instant appeals.

When coal is taken for the vertical and lateral support of lands, easements or rights-of-way' of the Commonwealth, however, the legislature has chosen to set up a separate body to assess the resulting damages. This body, the State Mining Commission,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> is empowered under the Act to determine, <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>

The determination of the value of <em>surface </em>lands is something within the intellectual ken of .ordinary citizens, but the question of the extent' and value of the Third estate’ is a subject requiring a comprehension of scientific principles and their application, and this fact justifies the-creation of a different tribunal to deal with that problem. There is no reason why the legislature may not make such a tribunal a permanent body and confine its personnel to specialists and experts.”</p>

In the Moffat case, six experts, three for each party, gave their opinions as to the value of the coal taken and explained the basis thereof. The Turnpike Commission’s witnesses gave estimates of value ranging roughly between $630,000 and $742,000, while the expert witnesses for Moffat ranged from $1,300,000 to $1,600,000. On the basis of the testimony of these witnesses, the State Mining Commission determined the damages to Moffat for the coal and silt taken to be $875,183. Moffat contends that the estimates of the expert witnesses for the Turnpike Commission were arrived at by legally erroneous methods and therefore should have been stricken from the record in their entirety. This being so, Moffat <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>argues, the sole evidence of value for the Commission to consider was that of Moffat’s experts, and since the award by the Commission was some $500,000 lower than the lowest value given by any of Moffat’s experts, the award could not have been founded on the only competent evidence in the record. With regard to the Diamond Colliery award, three experts testified, one for the Turnpike Commission and two for Diamond Colliery. Their opinions ranged from $3500 to $5100, the lowest opinion being that of the expert witness for the Turnpike Commission. Since the award granted Diamond, including detention damages, was $3500, Diamond argues that the Commission necessarily valued the coal at a figure below the lowest estimate given by any of the witnesses and therefore its award must have been founded on evidence outside the record and hence invalid.</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[168,1297,1151,1078]]]'>The argument of both appellants completely ignores the function of a State Mining Commission as a specialist tribunal in the determination of the monetary damages suffered upon a taking. A Commission is not bound to accept any of the valuations given by the expert witnesses, including those of the condemning authority. So long as it acts upon competent evidence in the record, a Commission may arrive at its own independent determination of damages. Aside from an estimate of damages, the use of expert testimony is a means of presenting pertinent data to the Commission and of allowing the experts to advocate a method of valuation. The testimony of the expert witnesses as to their findings about the quality of coal condemned, recent sales, appropriate engineering tables, mining conditions, condition of tracks and seams, and similar data, is equally, if not more important than their final valuation of damages, for as a body of experts, a Commission may use this information to arrive at a value themselves.</p>

Approximately five and one-half years elapsed between these two dates, but detention damages were awarded for only slightly more than three of those years. This lengthy lapse of time can be attributed in the main to the inherent technical difficulties involved in determining the extent as well as the value of the coal taken for support purposes. The resolution passed by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission on January 18, 1954, condemned approximately 160 acres of surface of Moffat’s land along 4.3 miles of the Turnpike. It was not until September 29,1955, some 20 months later, that the Turnpike Commission filed its bond and accompanying map specifying the exact lands required for construction purposes, thus allowing the appellants to resume mining of their unaffected coal. The next 27 months, until the petition for the convening of a State Mining Commission was filed by Moffat on January 9, 1958, can be best described as a period marked by delay and excuse by the parties in not reaching agreement as to the extent and value of the coal taken, and marked also by numerous differences between the parties with regard to the furnishing of mine maps and other pertinent information. Once the Commission was convened on January 9, 1958, however, the parties got together, and although technical difficulties caused extension of the hearings to July 30,1959, (the date of the award and <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>order of the State Mining Commission) the- negotiations and hearings were apparently conducted amicably and in good faith.</p>
    <p id="b159-4" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[160,537,1148,1522]]]'>The Commission awarded detention damages, for the period from January 18,1954, the date of condemnation, to September 29, 1955, the date of the filing of the bond, and accompanying map, because the,Commission found that “the petitioner could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained the areas within which coal might be required to be reserved for support of the Turnpike, and consequently was not in a position to apply for the services of the State Mining Commission.” It also awarded damages for the period between January. 9, 1958, when Moffat filed his petition to convene a Commission, and July 30, 1959, the. date of the award, because the Commission found that the appellants, “considering the substantial technical problems, involved, proceeded with due diligence to investigate and determine the issues involved.” No detention damages were awarded, however, for the time between the filing of the bond and map by the Turnpike Commission on September 29, 1955, and the time Moffat, filed his petition, to convene the Commission, because the Commission found that during that time appellants were in a position to apply to the Commission for a determination of their rights and damages, and that under the principles expressed in <em>Payne Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/350/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="350 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="461207" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0022-01">350 Pa. 22</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20A.2d%2026" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="38 A.2d 26">38 A. 2d 26</a> (1944), the appellants were not entitled to detention damages for that period.

A careful read<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>ing of the decision in <em>Payne Appeal, </em>however, reveals that the Court was not concerned with the problem of whether or not detention damages should have been awarded. Instead, we had for review a determination by a State Mining Commission that none of the coal of the petitioner over which the state highway had been constructed was necessary for the support of the right-of-way. There the condemnation for the right-of-way had taken place in 1938 and the highway construction ended sometime in 1939. The petitioner had not convened the Commission until 1942. Since the Commission found that none of the coal was necessary for support, the petitioner suffered no damages since he could now mine his own coal. There being no money damages owing to petitioner, the question of detention damages never arose. Petitioner argued, however, that he was entitled to some damages because, inter alia, by virtue of the condemnation he was legally unable to mine any coal in the condemned area until the Commission allowed him to do so. It was this loss we held to be self-inflicted on the ground that the petitioner could have convened the Commission at any time subsequent to the condemnation to determine his rights in this respect.</p>

There is little sense to a rule which penalizes a property owner for not having convened a Commission at the earliest possible moment so far as detention damages are concerned. To apply such a rule would only result in the filing of a petition therefor as a matter of course immediately after the bond and map are entered, so as to insure and protect the owner of his award. This would eliminate the possibility of any stipulation or settlement by amicable negotiations without the necessity of convening a Commission, and would in no way help to speed up the process of making a <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>final determination of either the amount of coal to remain in place or the damages suffered thereby.</p>

There is, however, no absolute right to such damages, and when the circumstances of . the case disclose that the cause of the delay is the fault of the property owner, the claim therefor may be lost in whole or in part. <em>Waugh v.
