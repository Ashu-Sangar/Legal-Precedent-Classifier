They unwisely destroyed the original 1951 wills, but an exact copy of each will was identified and proved by counsel who drew the wills. Thereafter Liggins made a new will in which he bequeathed and devised everything he possessed to his daughter, Constance Liggins. This Court sustained the original oral agreement and awarded Liggins’ interest in 1346 Solomon Street to Mr. Old-ham. The Court said: “ ‘ “Mutual wills, that is, where two persons execute wills reciprocal in their provisions, but separate instruments, may or may not be revocable at the pleasure of either party, according to the circumstances and understanding upon which they were executed. To deprive either party of the right to revoke such mutual wills, it is necessary to prove such wills were executed in pursuance of a contract or a compact between the parties and that each is the consideration for the other.” When such contract has been proved, the will becomes a writing containing the terms of the agreement, and satisfies the statute of frauds: Shroyer v.

But, there is no rule of law or logic which requires that the contractual element exist <em>aliunde </em>the wills, or that it be not contained in the same instrument or instruments as the wills.
