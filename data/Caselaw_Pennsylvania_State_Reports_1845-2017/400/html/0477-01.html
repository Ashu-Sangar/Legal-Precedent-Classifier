This <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>entity was expelled by the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, which we will refer to hereafter as the AFL-CIO. The reason for its expulsion was the proved existence of corruption within the BCW.</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[141,656,1149,372]]]'>As soon as the BCW was expelled, the two locals seceded and disaffiliated from it and retained their property and assets. Almost at once the AFL-CIO chartered a new International, the American Bakery and Confectionery Workers’ International Union, which we will refer to hereafter as the ABC, and the two locals joined it.</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.6",507,[142,1050,1148,525]]]'>The BOW remains outside of the AFL-CIO. Its position is that the locals had no right to secede and have none to retain their assets. The court below at first issued a preliminary injunction in order to keep the assets intact, but after final hearing dissolved it and dismissed the complaints. The plaintiffs have appealed. Only the appeal taken by Olson in each case is being pressed, and they present the same questions: appellants do not press the contention that the dis-affiliations were ineffectual.</p>
    <p id="b507-6" data-blocks='[["BL_507.7",507,[143,1603,1150,373]]]'>The long record and briefs give the case a complexity it inherently lacks. The picture is one of an International Union dominated by one man whose corruption was proved after full hearing by the Ethical Practices Committee of the AFL-CIO, following exposures in the labor-management field by an investigating (McClellan) committee of the United States Senate.</p>

Stuart shortly thereafter resigned and he disappeared from the case. On March 7 and 8 the General Executive Board of BCW met and cleared Cross and Stuart of <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>all guilt but filed charges against Sims, found him guilty,, and suspended him. On March 12 the locals called for the resignation of Cross and the reinstatement of Sims. On March 15 President Meany, of the APL-CIO, ordered an investigation of BCW. Late in March the locals managed to set up an Integrity Committee within BCW to preserve its honor, so far as it could. Between May 7 and August 1 the Ethical Practices Committee of the APL-CIO held hearings and on . September 16 reported its findings of corruption. On September 25, the Executive Council of AFL-CIO approved the report and directed BCW to correct the abuses by electing new officers and barring from reelection those whose corruption had been proved. BCW then expelled Sims finally and declared its intention to remain in the APL-CIO. On October 25 the Executive Council of AFL-CIO directed BCW to reinstate Sims, to bar corrupt officers from re-election, and called a special convention to hear BCW’s appeal. Upon its refusal to comply with these directions, it was suspended by President Meany. On November 19 the locals called on BCW to comply with the directives and to stay in AFL-CIO. On December 9 the Appeals Committee of the Convention approved the action of the Executive Council and recommended to the Convention that the Executive Council be given power to expel BCW on or before March 15, 1958. On the same day the Convention adopted the report of the Appeals Committee by more than a two-thirds vote. On December 10 and 11 the locals took action to disaffiliate from BCW and to continue affiliation with APL-CIO. On December 12 APL-CIO formally expelled BCW and chartered ABC, the new International Union. On December 17 plaintiffs were appointed special trustees of the locals by BCW. On December 26 ABC granted charters to the locals: 125 put of 290 locals, with 75,000 out of 136,000 members, also disaffiliated from BCW and joined ABC. <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>In January, 1958, these suits were begun, and in March a special convention of BCW ratified all that Cross and its General Executive Board had done.</p>

    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.6",509,[174,1101,1151,428]]]'>To complete the factual picture, BOW was organized in 1886 and affiliated with the AFL in 1887; Local 6 was chartered by BCW in 1896 and Local 492 in 1939; and the AFL and CIO merged in 1955 and BCW affiliated with the new entity. It is not denied by anyone that such affiliation carries real benefits to the component unions. Locals 6 and 492 now have 4,000 and 2,600 members, respectively.</p>

The principle of the case is sound but it has no application. There the locals refused to turn over to the International a certain <em>per capita </em>tax included in the dues, as required by the constitution, and we held that they must do so. There was no basic corruption, as in the case before us.</p>
    <p id="b511-5" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[128,1017,1152,1079]]]'>Plaintiff’s argument is that when the AFL-CIO ordered BCW to make Cross ineligible to run for reelection it was demanding the impossible, since Cross met the qualifications for office contained in the constitution and these couldn’t be changed without amending the constitution, which couldn’t be done in time. They are that he must be a citizen, must be a dues paying member of the International for two years, and must have worked for two years as a wage-earner. Obviously no set of minimum qualifications can lock a man into an office against his own misbehavior. No one argues that BCW was not bound by the constitution of the AFL-CIO, and certainly BCW acknowledged it when it appealed the action of the Executive Council to the Convention. Article II, Sec. 10, of the Constitution-reads: “To protect the labor movement from any and all corrupt influences and from the undermining efforts of communist agencies and all others who are opposed to the basic principles of our democracy and free and democratic unionism.”</p>

The Executive Council, when requested to do so by the President or by any other member of the Executive Council, shall have the power to conduct an investigation, directly or through an appropriate standing or special committee appointed by the President, of any situation in which there is reason to believe that any affiliate is dominated, controlled or substantially influenced in the conduct of its affairs by any corrupt influence, . . .”</p>

Even without the specifically enabling provisions above quoted, such an organization would have the inherent power to clean house. It is a mere quibble to argue that only Cross and not BCW was found guilty of corruption, nor is it the fact. The report of the Appeals Committee said: “The Ethical Practices Committee concluded that the Bakery and Confectionery Workers’ Union does not meet the ethical standards required by the AFL-CIO Constitution because”, and there followed the four specific acts of corruption listed earlier in this opinion.</p>
