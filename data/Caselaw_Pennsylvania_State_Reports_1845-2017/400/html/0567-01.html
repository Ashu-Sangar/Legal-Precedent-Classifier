During the term of the trust a son died leaving no natural born children but a daughter who had been adopted in 1897. Ruling that this adopted daughter of the deceased son was not entitled to take as “issue”, this Court stated (p. 297) : “ ‘Issue’ is not synonymous with ‘children’. ‘Issue’ means issue of the body, offspring, progeny, natural children, physically born or begotten by the person named as parent: [citing cases].

By the Act of 1957, supra, the legislature has declared that this type of unfunded life insurance trust must he construed as non-testamentary and to that mandate our judicial construction must yield. By Section 1(2) of the Estates Act of 1947, supra, a conveyance has been defined as “. . . an act by which it is intended to create an interest in real or personal property whether the act is intended to have inter vivos or testamentary operation”. The 1936 agreement did create certain legal interests — even though contingent — in the subject matter of the agreement and did contemplate that a conveyance would take place. This trust agreement gave rise to the creation of two separate interests: an interest in the Bank to receive from the insurance companies the proceeds of the policies as such matured upon the death of Cilley and an interest in the persons named in the trust agreement to receive from the Bank such proceeds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

More important, however, than the reservation of these important rights was Cilley’s self directed construction of the language of the agreement <em>“that no interest of any hind shall </em>vest<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>
      <em>in any party . . . until the date of [his] death. . . </em>More emphatic and absolute language could not have been employed to express Cilley’s intent that the conveyance of any legal interest should not take place until his death — a post mortem conveyance.

    <p id="b603-4" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[133,499,1154,1416]]]'>In actuality, the 1936 agreement contemplated two conveyances: a conveyance of the life insurance policies to the Bank whereby the Bank became the beneficiary under the policies subject to change, in whole or in part, by Cilley, and a conveyance of the proceeds of the policies by the Bank to the beneficiaries named in the trust agreement, a conveyance which was to take place upon the occurrence of two events, i.e., Cilley’s death and the receipt by the Bank of the insurance proceeds, and then only if Cilley had not revoked, in whole or in part, the trust agreement. The argument that such a construction renders this agreement testamentary is without merit. The legislature has seen fit to place life insurance trusts in a separate category and has declared that such trusts shall be construed only as non-testamentary. A construction that such legislation is applicable only if the conveyance takes place during the settlor’s lifetime amounts to judicial legislation and a reconstruction of the legislative language. In view of the fact that Cilley’s death occurred subsequent to January 1, 1948, the conveyance to the beneficiaries named in the trust agreement could not become effective until subsequent to that date. It was not until his death that the beneficiaries named in the trust agreement secured any vested interest in the proceeds of the policies.</p>

When and only when these events occurred was a conveyance to take place, a conveyance by the Bank to the persons and in the shares designated in the 1936 agreement of the proceeds of the insurance.

Moreover the word “vest” has always had a number of meanings, depending upon its context. Cf. <em>Phillips’s Estate (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/205/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="205 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="929987" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0504-01">205 Pa. 504</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.%20210" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="55 A. 210">55 A. 210</a>. We believe it was not used in this context in its technical sense of vesting in interest (as the majority interpret it) especially since, we repeat, Blanche’s interest, while contingent, was irrevocable. However, it is immaterial whether the word “vest” was or was not herein used in its technical sense of vesting in interest, because the gifts to “lawful issue” were technically not vested interests but “mere <em>expectancies,” </em>— Henderson <em>Estate, </em>supra — and therefore as the settlor correctly said did not vest until his death. We believe that <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>in this context the settlor used the words “no interests of any kind shall vest in any parties under this Indenture,” to mean that “no absolute indefeasible right shall be acquired by his children or lawful issue” until his death, and thus make certain beyond any legal doubt that he had a right to change or revoke the gifts to his children or lawful issue at any time he desired.</p>
