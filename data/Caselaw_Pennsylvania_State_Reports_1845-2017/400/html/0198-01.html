He was alive at 12:15 p.m. on July 4th when he telephoned a friend about swimming, and at lunchtime when defendant brought him a chicken sandwich. At approximately 2:45 p.m. on July 4th, Mr. and Mrs. Paul MacMurray were on their lawn approximately 305 feet away from the Kravitz residence. Three times they heard the noise of breaking and falling glass in the Kravitz residence. Believing a burglary was being committed, MacMurray ran to the Kravitz home and noticed a tear in a window screen and a broken windowpane behind.the screen; these were later described as being in the marital bedroom. MacMurry saw no one about the premises or entering or leaving it. Hearing a man’s loud voice, he ran back to his home and called the Lower Merion Township police, who arrived in police cars at approximately 3 o’clock at the Kravitz home. They surrounded the house and saw no one enter or leave.</p>

He rang the front doorbell and Mrs. Kravitz appeared within a minute. He asked her if everything was all right and she said it was. She was then asked about the broken glass and she replied “We know about it”. Defendant was calm, cool and collected. She was wearing a multi-colored dress which she changed before other witnesses saw her at 4 p.m.</p>
    <p id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[190,809,1148,754]]]'>Defendant came to the residence of her in-laws, Mr. and Mrs. Morris Passon, without telephoning and without being expected. This was the first time she had ever come to the Passon home alone, without her husband. She was wearing a different colored dress than when she was seen by the police officers. She told them that she had been gardening; that she was putting Bovung on the rosebed in their garden; that she had to carry buckets of water to the rosebed because there was no outside water faucet close by. After gardening she took a shower and changed her dress. Contrary to her statements, Bovung was not placed in the rose-bed; there was an outside water faucet close by, and the rosebed was absolutely dry.</p>

She then invited Passon to come up and see her husband. As they came up the cellar stairs the defendant screamed and said “He is in there”, meaning their bedroom. When Passon saw deeedent lying on the floor he immediately called the police.</p>

He was lying on the floor on his right side, clad in underwear and shorts. There were deep lacerations around his head. He had been shot in the back, in the left shoulder, and in the left wrist. The testimony dis<a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>closed that the bullets must have been fired by a person other than the deceased and that the 16 lacerations about the head were caused by a blunt instrument. The defendant’s bent and twisted hand mirror was under the victim’s body and small pieces of glass were found in the immediate vicinity which had come from the broken hand mirror. The rug was splattered with blood; blood was on the bed sheet; broken glass was around the window; three panes were broken from the inside; a broken bloody statuette was by the window. A chair which was in front of the window contained defendant’s multi-colored blouse which was later found to have three drops of blood on it. An intact statuette with blood on it and two red shoes belonging to defendant were found near the chair; the left shoe had blood on the toe and soles. Defendant’s plum-colored pedal pushers with blood on the left leg, were lying on the floor in front of the chair. There was a bed sheet and blanket on the floor with blood on them. There were <em>fragments of gun grips </em>found on the floor, one of which was under defendant’s pedal pushers. No gun was found in the room, but the next day, by brilliant police work, a gun was found in a culvert along the route which defendant told the police she had taken on her way to the Passon home. <em>The fragments of gun grips found in the Kravitz bedroom fitted this gun from which the gun grips were missing. </em>There was a wallet on the bureau containing $43 and neither it nor anything valuable was stolen, thus indicating that robbery was not the cause or motive of the murder.

To nearly every <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>question asked, the defendant replied that she did not know what happened.</p>

Shoemaker examined the deceased at 5:20 p.m. and testified that his death occurred approximately two hours prior to his arrival. He testified with respect to the bullet wounds and to the multiple lacerations of the scalp, some of which were very deep. He and Dr. Simpson testified that a man could have lived 30 minutes after being shot as Kravitz was shot, and during that time could have shouted or cried out and could have moved around the room. Dr. Simpson, the coroner, examined the body at 8 p.m. and was of the opinion that death took place about 3 o’clock p.m.</p>

At 12:20 p.m., July 5th, detective Loughran discovered a gun in a storm sewer opening on Morris Road, which is about 12 to 15 feet below the surface of the road. It was a 32 TJ.S. nickel-plated revolver which was subsequently identified by an agent of the P.B.I. as the gun from which the fragments of the gun grips had been found in Kravitz’s bedroom. Even more important, the revolver was triple wrapped, with the outer covering being <em>a woman’s </em>blouse, <em>which was later identified as belonging to the defendant', </em>the second cover being' a blood-stained dish towel; and the innermost covering a man’s handkerchief. Harry Kravitz testified that his <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>father owned a gun similar to the one found in the culvert on July 5th.</p>

The sweater also had a strand of dog hair on it which was similar to the hair of the Kravitz’s dog. The dish towel which formed the middle wrapping on the gun found in the culvert was similar to the dish towels found in the Kravitz’s residence. The lead bullet found in the Kravitz bedroom contained cotton yarn of similar texture and composition as the yarn which formed the undershirt of the decedent. The man’s handkerchief was similar in composition to handkerchiefs found in the decedent’s bedroom.

The Commonwealth’s evidence was amply sufficient from which the jury could properly find that Mrs. Kravitz was guilty of this murder. As the District Attorney states, the use of a hand mirror which inflicted 16 lacerations in the head, but were not strong .enough to cause a fracture of the skull, and the lack of ability to fire two bullets in the gun, indicated that this was a <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>feminine crime. The jury could properly have found that the blood which was found on defendant’s pedal pushers was the blood of her husband, that the blood which was found on defendant’s red left shoe in the marital bedroom was the decedent’s; that the blood which was found on defendant’s shoes in the kitchen was decedent’s blood; that defendant at the time she answered the policeman’s door-ring was wearing a multi-colored dress which contained blood of the same grouping as that of her husband; that it was the defendant’s hand mirror (which was found under his back) which was used to bludgeon him about the head; that defendant in going to the Passon home after the killing, passed the culvert on Morris Road in which the gun with missing gun grips was found, and that the gun grips which were found on the floor in the Kravitz bedroom fitted this gun; that it was the defendant’s blouse which was wrapped around this gun; that the strand of Caucasian hair found on the blouse matched the hair found in her hair brush and comb in her bedroom; that the dark hairs found on the blouse were the same as the hair of her dog, Pedro; that the dish towel which was covered with blood and which was wrapped around the gun was covered with blood of the same group as her husband’s; that she lied when she said she did not hear the breaking glass which was heard by neighbors 305 feet distant; that she lied when she pretended she was gardening and covering the rosebed with Bovung and with water; that her husband could have broken the bedroom window with a statuette in an attempt to summon help; that defendant’s calmness and her wailing without tears were indicative of guilt; and finally, that she made a number of contradictory, conflicting statements which indicated an attempt to deceive the police and conceal her guilt.</p>

He testified that he found arsenic in various organs of Danz’s body in weighable quantities.

The Commonwealth also proved that defendant and her husband Danz quarreled frequently; that she stated to some of the witnesses that she would be happier if he were dead; to one she repeatedly said that she would like to get rid of him; that he accused her of trying to poison him; and that she had stated “To Mrs. Heinel . . . that she had put the powders Hossey had given her into her husband’s coffee, and that the son-of-a-bitcli had discovered it and thrown it out, but she would catch him yet.” Defendant denied that she had ever given her husband any arsenic; she proved that the embalmer inserted arsenic in the body of the deceased; and she likewise proved by distinguished experts that her husband had not died from arsenic poison.

One could not say on this basis that <em>25% </em>of the spouses (one or the other) engenders the desire to murder the opposing mate.</p>

    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[152,729,1150,536]]]'>It is very possible that the jury was reluctant to convict on the evidence as they heard it during the trial, but that when it came to them through the medium of the judge it took on nuances and colorations which made it sound like something far more convincing than it really was — and a verdict of guilty followed. Even so, it will be noted that there were some doubts in the minds of the jurors. Otherwise, they would not have returned a verdict of second degree murder with a recommendation of mercy.</p>

It would almost appear that he concluded that whatever assistance he could give the Commonwealth would be all for the good. He thus supplied the lightning of his authority to the thunder of the district attorney and, in doing so, the jury returned a verdict which could have been right, insofar as the facts are known to God, and then, again, by the same Omniscience, could have been entirely wrong. .. . . .</p>
