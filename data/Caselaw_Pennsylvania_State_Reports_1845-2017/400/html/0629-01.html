However, if within a reasonable time, there are no children available for the Home in accordance with the terms, provisions, and conditions prescribed in the will, or if for any other reason or for any cause the purpose of the trust has failed or cannot be faithfully carried out, the trust must terminate and the principal thereof must revert, in accordance with the clear language and intent of testator’s will to his estate to be vested in his niece, Sallie M.

If that is so, no explanation appears on the record why they have not been placed in the Pruner Home. Probably it is because there are no children available in spite of the Court’s belief to the contrary. Perhaps this is so because it is a matter of common knowledge that in the last ten years the demand for babies and young children for adoption by yearning parents far exceeds the supply.</p>

A <em>careful </em>examination of the codicils in their entirety reveals, however, that the gift to the niece, Sallie M. Hayes, was not some sort of “reversionary interest”, but was in fact an alternative or substitutional gift to her with the condition that it take effect <em>only </em>in the event that the two boroughs, at the death of the testator, could not for any reason accept the gift as given. Because they could and did in fact accept the gift and its attendant responsibilities, the sole condition under which the niece was to take. never occurred, and nothing further is contained in the will to cut down on the absolute fee held by the boroughs. The effect of this is twofold: First, the decree entered below must be vacated, because • neither the heirs of Sallie M. Hayes nor the heirs of the testator have any interest in the property in question. Second, any suit to enforce the charitable trust, or to invoke the operation of the doctrine of <em>cy pres </em>must be brought by the Attorney General.</p>

Hayes was to take effect only if the boroughs re<a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>fused to take the gifts as given. The complete gift to the boroughs appears in the body of the will itself. It begins with language of general charitable intent, “For the purpose of benefiting humanity and caring for those in need 1 give . . .” and thereafter sets forth the purpose of the trust, describes the properties given, and outlines the restrictions as to the type of children the testator desired to be helped. Nowhere in this paragraph is there any language which even faintly suggests that less than a complete fee was given. The only language in derogation of the complete fee arises in the codicils which immediately follow the testator’s signature to his will, almost as after-thoughts. In their entirety, the codicils provide:</p>

The codicils speak of “reasons” why the boroughs “cannot carry out” the will and cannot “accept the [gift] and carry out the provisions of the will,” and “provided said [boroughs] carry out the provisions of the will.” This language speaks only to the <em>initial </em>ability of the boroughs to take and to perform its function as trustee; it is not at all directed to any concern of the testator with the purpose of the trust failing. In the face of this clear language there must be strong language indicating - the testator was concerned with the failure of the purpose of the trust, so as to indicate he intended that even after the trust would be in operation, Sallie M. Hayes might still take; without strong and clear language I cannot see how the majority can say there is any reversionary interest here conditioned on the failure of the trust purpose.</p>

Hayes. . . .” The testator’s unfortunate use of the word “such” makes it somewhat ambiguous as to what phrase “if such becomes invalidated from any cause” modifies. The majority must argue that this phrase modifies “the purpose of the home,” but this construction is strained because in the ordinary sense one does not “invalidate” a purpose; in that sense a purpose would be frustrated or unaccomplished. When the language is considered in the general context of the paragraph it is more sensibly understood to mean that the gift to the Home as originally contemplated “if such becomes invalidated for any cause” is to be “bequeathed” (a term generally used to denote present giving and not future giving) in the alternative to my niece. The word “invalidated” contemplates some legal restriction on the two boroughs which might prevent them from initially receiving the gift.</p>

The appellant challenges the continuation of the Home in her capacity as an heir of Sallie M. Hayes, whom the appellant claims succeeds to the property of the Home upon failure of the trust. But by holding that the interest of Sallie M. Hayes is invalid because it violates the rule against perpetuities, the Majority has necessarily decided that the suit was improperly brought, since appellant in her capacity as an heir of Sallie M. Hayes has no interest whatsoever in the will. Thus the appeal should at this point have been dismissed for want of a proper plaintiff and the decree vacated. <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>There should have been no further inquiry into the case. If the heirs of the testator wish to come into court and claim their “reversionary interest,” they may do so. But there is no need for us to order the court to go out and bring them in; nor is there any need to decide at this juncture whether the trust purpose has in fact failed. It is the function of the Attorney General as the guardian of the enforcement of charitable trusts to bring such a suit. It is not a function of this Court on its own motion.</p>
