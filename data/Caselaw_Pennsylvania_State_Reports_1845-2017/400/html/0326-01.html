His trial was had in the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery of Dauphin County before Honorable W. C. Sheely, President Judge.of the Fifty - First Judicial District, specially presiding. The ver<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>diet of murder in the first degree with the penalty fixed at life imprisonment was read by the forelady of the jury in open court in the presence of the defendant. At his counsel’s request, the jury was promptly polled. Following that, the verdict was formally recorded by the court and declared so to be by the clerk. Subsequently, sentence in accordance with the jury’s verdict was duly imposed by the court. No appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[237,844,1151,1293]]]'>In support, of the petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>which was filed five years after relator’s conviction and sentence to life imprisonment, he alleges that when the jury was polled two of its members did not answer in the form in which they should have in order to evidence their assent to the verdict as announced by the forelady. The contention is without merit. Relator’s counsel entirely misconceives the purpose to be served by the polling of a jury. The verdict is what is announced to the court by the foreman (or forelady as the case may be) after the clerk’s interrogation of the jury as to whether a verdict has been agreed upon. The purpose of the poll is to give any juror, who may possibly have been under pressure from other members of the jury to acquiesce in the verdict, an opportunity to speak out and declare to the court that the verdict as announced by the foreman was not voluntarily joined in by the answering juror. What actually took place in the courtroom when the jury returned to announce its verdict is clearly set forth in the opinion of Judge Si-ieely, who sat specially in the Court of Common Pleas in Dauphin County for the purpose of passing on the relator’s present petition for a writ, as follows:</p>

He said: “That brings us to the trial judge’s denial of the defendant’s request that the jury be polled. The reason given by the court for its refusal of the request was that it had come too late.

The procedure had its genesis in ancient common law . . . and has long been both approved and uniform practice in this state, [citing numerous cases] . . . Suffice it to say that as early as Walters v. Junkins, supra, Mr. Justice Rogers recognized for this court that There are many cases in the books, of a jury changing their verdict, immediately after they have .pronounced it in open court, and before it was received and entered , . . The polling of the jury is the means for definitely determining, before it is too late, whether the jury’s verdict reflects the conscience of <em>each of the jurors </em>or whether it was brought about through the coercion or domination of one of them by some of the fellow jurors or resulted from sheer mental or physical exhaustion of a juror.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
