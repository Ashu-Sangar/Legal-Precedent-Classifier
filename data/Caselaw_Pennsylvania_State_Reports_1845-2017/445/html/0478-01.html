At the behest of the Secretary of Environmental Resources, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through the office of the Attorney General, filed a suit in equity seeking preliminary relief to enjoin appellees from operating beehive coke ovens,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> in Mt. Pleasant Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth’s complaint alleged two violations of the Air Pollution Control Act, Act of January 8, 1960, P. L. (1959) 2119, as amended June 12, 1968, P. L. , No. 92, 35 P.S. §4001 et seq. (Supp. 1971), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder: (1) operation of an air contamination source after modification, without a permit; (2) violation of Regulation IV because the ovens were emitting <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>smoke from a combustion unit in excess of the regulatory standard set forth in Regulation IV, which is Ringelmann No. 2. The Commonwealth also alleged that the operation of the ovens created a public nuisance. After studying the record, it is my view that the evidence clearly established that the ovens were emitting smoke in violation of Regulation IV, and this, in itself, required the issuance of the injunction requested.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[201,779,1154,591]]]'>The salient facts are these. The beehive coke ovens in controversy were put in operation late in 1969, after approximately sixteen years of nonuse. Immediately after the ovens began operating, residents of the area began to suffer great discomfort due to the noxious odor which was discharged from the ovens as a result of the coking process. A resident of the area, one Helen A. Fitch, lodged a complaint with the Department of Health (the predecessor of the Department of Environmental Resources) and an immediate investigation was undertaken.</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[201,1390,1155,657]]]'>The inquiry showed that the ovens were in full operation, and the by-products of the coking process were being discharged directly into the air, without any attempt to filter out the noxious pollutants. A letter was dispatched from the Department requesting that appellees take immediate steps to control the air pollution. One of the appellees responded saying an engineer would be contacted, and plans would be submitted to the Commonwealth showing how the problem would be corrected. Five months later, no steps had been taken to correct the problem, nor had a qualified pollution engineer been consulted.</p>

Three <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>residents of the area testified that as a result of the noxious odors they were caused personal discomfort such as sinus problems, eyes watering, sneezing, and choking, and equated the odor to sewage. They stated further that their homes had become increasingly dirty and had taken on an unpleasant odor. Moreover, one witness stated that she was unable to sleep at night, and another complaining party said she was unable to sit outdoors during the summer months.</p>
    <p id="b513-3" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[135,830,1150,714]]]'>Additionally, the Commonwealth brought forth three expert witnesses who testified as follows. Mr. Venkataraman Ramadass, the regional air pollution control engineer, stated that beehive coke ovens, of the nature of those in controversy, discharged the following volatile matter and gases directly into the atmosphere: ammonia, tar, oils, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulpher dioxide and hydrogen cyanide. Furthermore, he stated that in the course of one month 1600 tons of coal is charged into the ovens, and 1200 tons of coke is produced, with approximately <em>400 tons of by-products, </em>of the aforementioned nature, discharged directly into the air without any filtering whatsoever.</p>

Wonders, an air pollution control engineer, testified that on December 1, 1970, he tested the density of the smoke from four different ovens with a scientific device known as a smokescope and determined that all the emissions were in excess of the standards set out in Regulation IV, with three of the ovens emitting smoke which was 60 percent black and one oven discharging smoke which was 40 percent black.</p>

    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[187,959,1156,487]]]'>I realize that since this appeal is from a decree refusing a preliminary injunction that our scope of review is limited.

Although this section of Regulation IV is not written in prohibitory terms, I am of the opinion that the lower court fell into error by limiting its consideration to just this section of the entire statutory scheme. To properly ascertain the purpose of a set of regulations promulgated under a valid statute, it is imperative that a reviewing party return to the body of the statute itself to determine the purpose of the regulation in light of the goal of the statute. A review of the declaration of policy of the statute in question, Act of 1960, supra, 35 P.S. §4002 (Supp. 1971), indicates to this writer that the obvious end result which the Legislature intended was the prohibition of air pollution. This seems to me the only logical conclusion that can be reached because the Legislature chose to employ phrases such as <em>“protect </em>the air resources of the Commonwealth”, <em>“protection </em>of public health, safety and well-being”, <em>“prevention </em>of injury to plant and animal life and to property”, and <em>“protection </em>of the comfort and convenience of the public.” (Emphasis supplied.) The only reasonable means through which these goals may be achieved is to prohibit the activity that causes the undesired results.</p>

The language employed by the Legislature in this section leads me to conclude that although the regulations were to be definitional in character, by their purpose, i.e., set standards to carry forward the prohibitory goal of the statute, they had to be prohibitory in nature.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> ****8</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[184,1129,1153,154]]]'>Moreover, a review of the text of the statute convinces me that the Legislature intended these regulations to be prohibitory:</p>
    <p id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[543,1344,432,34]]]'>Unlawful Conduct</p>

It is beyond the comprehension of this writer how a person can “violate” a regulation if that regulation does not prohibit certain conduct. Hence, on the basis of this reasoning, I feel that the rule of law applied by the lower court was clearly wrong.</p>
    <p id="b517-4" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[137,666,1151,1666]],["BL_518.1",518,[199,345,1152,322]]]'>Secondly, I take issue with the lower court’s alternative finding that the Department must first issue an order before it can institute equitable proceedings. The court came to this conclusion because of the following language in Regulation IV, Section 1.3: “Whenever a local air pollution problem is deemed to exist, the Department may in accordance with the procedures provided in the Air Pollution Control Act, issue an order directing the person or persons charged with causing, suffering, allowing or permitting such air pollution problem to control, abate or prevent such air pollution problem.” Regulation IV, supra. To reach its decision the court below had to read the word m-a-y as m-u-s-t. This reading overlooks the three methods made available to the Department to enforce the provisions of the statute: (1) administrative, Act of 1960, supra, 35 P.S. §4004(4.1) (Supp. 1971); (2) equitable, Act of 1960, supra, 35 P.S. §4010(a) (Supp. 1971); and (3) penalties in the form of monetary fines, Act of 1960, supra, 35 P.S. §4009 (Supp. 1971). It appears to me that the Legislature intended the Department to have three separate and distinct avenues of enforcement available, rather than a combination of an administrative order and either an injunction or penalties. I believe that this interpretation is justified by examining Section 4010(a) of the statute, Act of 1960, supra, 35 P.S. §4010(a) (Supp. 1971), which provides for injunctive relief. This section uses the phrase “for an injunction to restrain all violations of this act.” If the Legislature intended the Department to first obtain an order, Sec<a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>tion 4010 (a) would read-—for an injunction for a violation of an order. Moreover, reviewing Sections 4008 and 4009 together, Act of 1960, supra, 35 P.S. §§4008, 4009 (Supp. 1971), shows no indication that the Department has to secure an order before it can seek monetary penalties.</p>
    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[268,678,1017,44]]]'>Lastly, looking at Section 4010(b) which reads:</p>

    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.6",518,[197,891,1155,543]]]'>“(b) The penalties and remedies prescribed by this act shall be deemed concurrent and <em>the existence of </em>or exercise of <em>any remedy shall not prevent the department from exercising any other remedy hereunder, at law or in equity.” </em>(Act of 1960, supra, 35 P.S. §4010 (b) (Supp. 1971). (Emphasis supplied.) We there see that the remedies can be concurrently exercised, and the existence of one remedy does not preclude the Department from employing any other remedy. Thus, I believe the lower court committed error on this point.</p>

Pottstown Boro., </em><a href="/pa/407/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="407 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="1307371" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0531-01">407 Pa. 531</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20921" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="180 A.2d 921">180 A. 2d 921</a> (1962). The facts of the instant case fit within the <em>Schwab </em>test as follows: (1) The Commonwealth’s right to relief is clear <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>because there is an obvious violation of a statute enacted to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth; (2) There is an urgent necessity to grant the injunction because of the quantity and quality of the air contamination, and, there is irreparable harm under the <em>Israel </em>doctrine, which cannot be compensated for by damages; and (3) Greater injury is being done to the citizens of the Commonwealth at large, and to the citizens in the immediate area of the air contamination source by disturbing their peaceful use and enjoyment of their homes and property, and obviously endangering their health, than would be done to the appellees, who are carrying on an unlawful activity. See Act of <em>1960, </em>supra, 35 P.S. §4008 (Supp. <em>1971).</em>
