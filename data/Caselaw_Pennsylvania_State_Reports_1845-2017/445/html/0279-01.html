Two years later appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (PCHA) which was dismissed following a hearing on May 23, 1968. Because the notes of testimony of this hearing were unavailable on appellant’s first appeal to this Court in 1968, we remanded the case to the court below for a rehearing on appellant’s PCHA petition. Again the lower court refused relief by order on September 10, 1970. This appeal followed.</p>

He went to the jury on a plea of self-defense. He here asserts two grounds for PCHA relief: first, that his conviction was obtained <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>through the use of perjured testimony; and second, that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to call three witnesses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> These contentions are without merit.</p>

Unfortunately for the defendant, however, he failed to prove that the testimony which he questions was false or perjured. His contention is based on the fact that a key witness for the Commonwealth testified at trial that the decedent was “maybe 6 feet” away when defendant shot him, whereas her estimate of the distance was substantially different at the preliminary hearing when she fixed the distance between the two men by holding her hands apart a distance characterized at the time by defense counsel as about 18 inches.</p>

Furthermore, we are convinced from an independent review of the record that there was a reasonable basis for counsel’s decision not to call these witnesses and conclude that counsel’s stewardship of the challenged proceeding in light of the available alternatives was adequate. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Commonwealth v.
