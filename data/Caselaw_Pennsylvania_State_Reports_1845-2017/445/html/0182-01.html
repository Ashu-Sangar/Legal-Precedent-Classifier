It is averred that the B&amp;O and C&amp;O have . . improperly and illegally maintained and exercised control of Reading.” Appellants also stated that Reading owns 48.97% of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey. They assert C&amp;O owns 2.3% of Jersey Central, and through its control of Reading dominates the affairs of Jersey Central as well. Appellants claim that this pyramid and concentration of control has allegedly been employed by C&amp;O and B&amp;O to the disadvantage of Reading and Jersey Central. Nine specific transactions are listed being in furtherance of what amounted to a “plan or design” and an “improper conspiracy” of mismanagement on the part of B&amp;O and C&amp;O, the substance of which will be detailed below.</p>

Rather the dispute centers on the nature of the amended complaint. Appellants urge they are not attacking the legality of the acquisition of control of Reading by B&amp;O and C&amp;O but only the improper and unlawful manner in which the control is being exercised to Reading’s disadvantage. The railroads counter that the gist of the amended complaint is the existence of a conspiracy to effectuate a merger of Reading and Jersey Central into the C&amp;O and B&amp;O system at depressed merger values—an issue purportedly within the primary jurisdiction of the ICC. Thus, prior to investigating either appellants’ standing or the IOC’s primary jurisdiction, we must examine the amended complaint in some detail.</p>

In 1931, the C&amp;O and B&amp;O purportedly caused Reading to enter into an agreement with the B&amp;O concerning a division of expenses incurred in running Perishable Products whereby Reading shouldered more than its fair share of the costs. Then in 1953, appellees supposedly compelled Reading to grant an option to purchase 611,049 square feet of the Perishable Products terminal to a B&amp;O subsidiary at a price that was assertedly one half of the terminal’s fair market value. Next, in 1961 the C&amp;O and B&amp;O allegedly engineered a plan pursuant to which the Reading permitted the B&amp;O to move its terminal agent’s office force from Pier 24 in Philadelphia to the Perishable Products terminal where they obtained rent-free office space, even though rent-paying tenants were displaced. Finally, some time in 1963 the C&amp;O and B&amp;O supposedly caused Reading to transfer its interest in Perishable Products to the B&amp;O for a “grossly inadequate consideration.”</p>

The applicability of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction becomes readily apparent. In paragraph 12(i) of the complaint, the appellants challenge Reading’s rejection of a proposed Penn-Central merger offer. Appellants also later seek a decree enjoining the C&amp;O and B&amp;O from voting their respective Reading <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>shares. In effect, such a decree would divest the C&amp;OB&amp;O system of its Beading control and transfer the control to appellants or other shareholders. This judicial tampering with interlocking railroad systems would be wholly inappropriate at this juncture.</p>
    <p id="b235-3" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[154,612,1148,653]]]'>Appellants urge that the ICC has never “approved” of the C&amp;O and B&amp;O’s acquisition of de facto control over Reading. While appellants may be technically correct, for there has been no separate hearing on the issue, B&amp;O’s holdings in Reading have always been a matter of public record. See e.g., <em>Penn-Central Merger and I\T &amp; W Inclusion Cases, </em>supra at 519, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20S.%20Ct.%20602" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="88 S. Ct. 602">88 S.

Two petitions are pending in that litigation: one by the Reading Company for inclusion on fair and equitable terms within the C&amp;O-B&amp;O system, and one by the reorganization trustees of Jersey Central requesting a similar assimilation. Appellants have also interjected themselves into the joint application for merger by the Norfolk and Western and the C&amp;O at Finance Docket 23832, raising the same allegations as contained in paragraphs 12(a), (e), (f), and (g) of the amended complaint.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> Our Court should not interrupt these proceedings.</p>

Because we conclude that the Commission is imbued with primary jurisdiction, we need not and do not reach the issue of exclusive jurisdiction. It has been suggested that the distinction is somewhat ephemeral: “Primary jurisdiction situations arise when the original jurisdiction of a court is being invoked to decide the merits of a controversy; the facts, the law, the relief, and it is held that the jurisdiction of the court either to decide one of the relevant issues or to entertain the action at all has been superseded by agency jurisdiction.
