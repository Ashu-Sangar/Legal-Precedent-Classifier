    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.7",522,[216,452,1156,487]]]'>William M. Campbell, III was indicted for tbe murder of William B. Thompson. Campbell was found guilty by a jury of voluntary manslaughter. Twenty motions for a new trial were filed and argued and denied, and he was sentenced to a period of from five to ten years in solitary confinement. This appeal was taken by the defendant, who was represented throughout all the proceedings in the lower Court, as well as in this appeal, by two Court-appointed attorneys.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.8",522,[215,949,1154,485]]]'>The sordid facts in this case were established by the testimony of defendant himself and several other witnesses. On the afternoon of November 22, 1967, defendant met Thompson by chance at a bar in Philadelphia. Both men were homosexuals and they had known each other casually for some time. After drinking together for a few hours, they left the bar at approximately 10:80 P.M. by taxi for Thompson’s apartment in Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County.</p>
    <p id="b522-6" data-blocks='[["BL_522.9",522,[213,1446,1154,265]]]'>Defendant testified that when they reached the apartment, he went into the kitchen to make a drink for both of them. While in the kitchen, he took from his pocket a cube of sugar on which he knew LSD had been placed and he chewed it up.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>

Soon thereafter, defendant began to feel the effects of the LSD and started jumping up and down on the sofa. Defendant suggested that they sniff amyl nitrate, a drug which produces a drowsy forgetfulness. Defendant and Thompson sniffed the amyl nitrate and went into the bedroom to pack a suitcase for a trip to Florida which they had been talking about. After <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>packing the suitcase, defendant placed the suitcase in the hallway outside the apartment. When he went back into the apartment, he undressed and both men then went to bed together. Defendant testified that his last recollection was that he and Thompson were again sniffing amyl nitrate in bed.</p>
    <p id="b523-3" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[158,670,1148,540]]]'>The next thing that defendant said he could remember was when he awoke and found Thompson dead beside him with a knife in his throat. Defendant testified that he withdrew the knife and attempted to revive Thompson with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Defendant then tried to wipe off and clean the knife, and then tried <em>to </em>flush his bloodstained shirt down the toilet. Soon thereafter, defendant left the apartment and hitchhiked a ride into the central part of Philadelphia.</p>

One of the men who were present in Dewey’s at the time informed a Philadelphia policeman of defendant’s statements, and defendant was arrested at 4:50 A.M. Defendant was questioned, searched and examined for possible use of narcotics because his eyes were “glassy.” The police found in defendant’s possession an envelope containing a Sears Roebuck &amp; Company credit card with Thompson’s name thereon. A detective, John Hoff, attempted to telephone Thompson and, after receiving no answer, released the defendant. Defendant thereupon returned to his room at the YMCA, and telephoned his mother to tell her he was coming home for Thanksgiving. Defendant then <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>boarded a bus for Chicago, where his parents were living.</p>
    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[170,450,1157,649]]]'>Defendant spent a couple of days with his parents in Chicago and, on November 26, 1967, went to Miami, Florida. He spoke with his mother by phone on Wednesday, November 29, and during the course of the conversation his mother told him that the F.B.I. had been there searching for him. The following morning at 10:30 o’clock, defendant went to the F.B.I. offices in Miami, where, after being given the required legal warnings, he gave a formal statement or confession. A short time thereafter he returned to Montgomery County, where he was indicted and prosecuted for the murder of Thompson.</p>
    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[167,1113,1155,196]]]'>Defendant testified, inter alia, that he had no recollection of the events occurring between the hours of midnight November 22nd and 2:00 A.M. November 23, 1967.</p>

He testified that in his professional opinion the defendant was telling the truth when he said that he had taken LSD and that his lack of recollection or amnesia <em>during the critical hours </em>of November 23rd was due to his ingestion of LSD. He further testified that as a result of this LSD, defendant did not know the difference between right and wrong or the consequences of his acts, and that during these critical hours he was legally (temporarily) insane. He also testified about the differences between (a) the effects of alcoholic intoxication and (b) mental aberrations brought about by LSD. Basically, his testimony was that alcoholic intoxication produces a predictable effect,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> while the <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>effects of LSD on <em>each </em>individual can vary greatly and are not predictable. LSD (he said) affects each individual differently and often affects the same individual in a different manner on each occasion. We repeat: Dr. Bartle testified, based upon (a) what defendant told him, and (b) his two examinations of defendant, and (c) upon his professional knowledge, and (d) his aforesaid analytical testimony, that <em>(luring the period of the hilling </em>defendant was legally insane. Dr. Bartle admitted that when he saw the defendant, the defendant knew the difference between right and wrong and knew that it was wrong to kill. Moreover, there was no evidence that defendant had ever been psychotic before.</p>
    <p id="b525-3" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[179,1099,1148,485]]]'>This defense and Dr. Bartle’s testimony raise very important and novel legal questions: (1) Should the voluntary ingestion of LSD or similar drugs have the <em>same legal effect </em>in a killing as <em>voluntary intoxication </em>from alcohol, i.e., reduce the crime from murder in the first degree<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> to murder in the second degree, if there was no intention to take life, or (2) should it have the same legal effect as legal insanity, namely, be a complete legal defense to any crime?</p>
    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[179,1597,1147,431]]]'>Appellant’s principal contention is that the lower Court erred in charging the jury that “insanity” caused by the voluntary taking of LSD could not completely excuse a killing, but would reduce the gravity (and degree) of the crime from first degree murder to second degree murder if the jury believed that the (voluntary Ingestion of) LSD prevented defendant from forming a specific intent to take decedent’s life.</p>
