Accordingly, the Third Circuit vacated the judgment of the District Court with a direction to order the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus unless the Commomnwealth granted appellant a new and public <em>Jackson v.

Between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m. on the morning of May 23, 1964, appellant was brought to the office of Sergeant Bennett of the Special Investigation Squad of the Philadelphia Police Department in connection with a police investigation of a robbery-killing. At the outset appellant insisted on having a lawyer. Sergeant Bennett told him that he had a right to have a lawyer and that “you do not have to talk to us.” When appellant requested that his attorney, Robert Nix, be summoned, Sergeant Bennett replied that appellant would have to call Robert Nix himself and provided him with a telephone directory and access to a telephone situated on a desk in the same room.</p>

Appellant asked what Hamilton was doing there, and Sergeant Bennett answered, “He’s telling us things.” At that juncture and without further prompting of any sort, appellant uttered an oral confession implicating Willie Hamilton and himself.</p>

In contrast to the questioning conducted earlier in the day by Sergeant Bennett, the afternoon interrogation was <em>not </em>preceded by any warning to appellant that he had a right to remain silent. Instead, Detective Caruthers asked appellant whether he understood that anything he said could be used “for or against” him at trial and whether he was prepared to make a statement of his own free will and without any promises or threats having been made to him. Appellant replied affirmatively to both questions and proceeded to dictate and sign a written statement substantially confirming his earlier oral confession to Sergeant Bennett.</p>

P. 323, dealing generally with the procedure for the suppression of unconstitutionally obtained evidence, provides in pertinent part: “(f) The hearing, either before or at trial, shall be held, upon the request of the defendant or his attorney <em>or by the Judge on Ms own motion, </em>in the presence of only the defendant, counsel for the parties, court officers and necessary witnesses. <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>In any event, the bearing shall be held outside of the hearing and presence of the jury.” (Emphasis added.) Under compulsion of the Third Circuit’s ruling, we are required to conclude that the trial judge is no longer empowered to conduct an <em>in camera </em>suppression hearing on his own motion.</p>
      <p id="b44-7" data-blocks='[["BL_44.2",44,[193,2097,1154,122]]]'>We note, however, that a defendant can still seek the benefits of a private hearing if he so requests. We note further that Buie 323 continues in full force and effect in all other respects.</p>
