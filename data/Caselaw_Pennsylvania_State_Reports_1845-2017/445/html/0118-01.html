It is obvious from the testimony that the information required by the challenge affidavits prescribed by this Section was considered irrelevant by the defendants. As the court below found, the sole criterion for the taking of student applications after September 11 was that the applicant had a matriculation card or some other evidence to show that he was a student; no effort was made to determine residence. Similarly, the Board of Elections would not have cancelled or suspended registrations under Section 34.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> To say, as the Court does, that there was an adequate statutory remedy under these circumstances is to close one’s eyes to reality.</p>

        <em> </em>There is a preliminary question as to the standing of the appellants to raise the question of jurisdiction. No preliminary objections were filed below. This is a prerequisite where the defense to a bill in equity is an adequate <em>non-statutory </em>remedy at law. <em>Bee, </em>Pa. R. C. P. 1509(c) ; <em>Carelli v. Lyter, </em><a href="/pa/430/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="430 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="1915687" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0543-01">430 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%206" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="244 A.2d 6">244 A. 2d 6</a> (1968). Whether the same rule should apply where the defense is an adequate <em>statutory </em>remedy is an open question, expressly left undecided by this Court in <em>Devlin v. Osser, </em><a href="/pa/434/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="434 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1922561" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0408-01">434 Pa. 408</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=254%20A.2d%20303" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="254 A.2d 303">254 A. 2d 303</a> (1969), another case under the Election Code. The issue could be avoided in that ease because the Court held that the asserted statutory remedy was neither adequate nor exclusive. In the instant case, however, the Court is holding to the contrary. It should, therefore, consider whether the statutory remedy asserted is truly jurisdictional, incapable of being waived, or whether it goes only to the form of action and so is waived if not properly pleaded.</p>
