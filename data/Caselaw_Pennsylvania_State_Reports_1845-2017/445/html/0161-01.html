If that is both wise and necessary—and it certainly is!—it is equally wise and necessary to permit a Judge before whom a <em>direct </em>criminal contempt has occurred to impose a reasonable sentence upon the disorderly or disruptive or contemptuous person who has made a mockery of our citadels of Justice and our Judicial System.
