The evidence established on behalf of the claimant showed that while he was driving a twenty year old, ten ton fire truck, it became necessary to engage the emergency brake to keep the truck from slipping backward during a turn about; that the emergency brake mechanism (a lever with a push button on top) would not release readily because in the exigency of the situation it had been pulled back too far; that claimant bent over into an awkward position and exerted an additional force to free the brake lever; that in so doing, claimant suffered immediate chest pain and was hospitalized within several hours as a result of an infarct; that claimant was totally disabled from the date of the occurrence on March 16,1964 until July 9, 1964 when he returned to work on a limited basis in his regular employment as a carpenter; and that he remained on limited duty, thus suffering a reduction in earning capacity, until September 30, 1964 when he resumed full employment with no further loss in wages.</p>

In concluding that Hilt’s collapse following his effort to release the hand brake was not an accident, the Board stated: “We do not believe that these events constituted an excessive work-load. Firemen, including the claimant, are constantly exposed to great physical exertion. The testimony of the claimant only shows a greater effort required to release the brake. It does not establish that the effort was <em>unusual to Ms work </em>generally.” (Emphasis supplied.) Further, the Board concluded: “Doing an occasional act involving sustained muscular effort, though the work is hard, will not support the inference of an accident if the act is of the kind and quality usual to the employment, <em>and normally, part of the workman’s duties. </em>Dolinar v. Pittsburgh Coal Corp., 140 Super. 543 (1940). We do not believe that the incidents related are so unusual as to be excluded from this category.” (Emphasis supplied.) The Court of Common Pleas, likewise, was cognizant of the correct version of the unusual strain rule, and emphasized, citing <em>Pudlosky v. Follmer Trucking Co., supra, </em>that <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>the test for unusualness “is whether the task <em>was am unusual one for the claimant.”</em>
