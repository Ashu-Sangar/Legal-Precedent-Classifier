In September, 1967, he married the deceased, Argie Dallessandro Fox, who had four children from a former marriage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Theirs was a brief and stormy union, and the divorce was finalized on January 23, 1969. The deceased’s eldest daughter, Donna Jean Rush, testified that appellant was extremely possessive and jealous and that the couple also fought continually over money. According to this witness, appellant threatened to kill his wife on at least five occasions. ■</p>

There must be (1) ... [a] capacity to communicate, including as it does both an ability to understand questions and to frame and express intelligent answers, (2) mental capacity to observe the occurrence itself and the capacity of remembering <em>what it is </em>that she is called to testify about and (3) a consciousness of the duty to speak the truth.

One is that a party should not be denied justice because reliance necessarily must be placed upon the testimony of a child of tender years. But, on the other hand, experience has informed us that children are peculiarly susceptible to the world of make-believe and of suggestions. Care must be exercised to keep the balance true as between these conflicting claims. So it is that much must be left to the <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>discretion of the trial judge who hears and sees the witness.” Id. at 621, <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.2d%20307" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="156 A.2d 307">156 A. 2d at 310</a>.</p>
