The heyday of beneficial associations was during the latter part of the nineteenth century and the principles governing these entities have remained unchanged since that time.

The benefits, although secured by contract, and for that reason to a limited extent assimilated to the proceeds of insurance, are not so considered. Such societies are rather of a philanthropic or benevolent character: their beneficial features may be of a narrow or restricted character; the motives of the members may be to some extent selfish, but the principles upon which they rest is founded in the considerations mentioned. These benefits, by the rule of their organization, are payable to their own unfortunate, out of funds which the members have themselves contributed for the purpose, not as an indemnity, or security against loss, but as a protective relief in case of sickness or injury, or to provide the means of a decent burial in the event of death.

Exceptant points to the term “trustees” describing the administrators of the fund as being probative of the establishment of a formal trust. One of the fundamental elements in the creation of a trust is the manifestation of the settlor’s intent: “A trust, as the term is used in the Restatement of this Subject, when not qualified by the word ‘charitable’, ‘resulting’ or ‘constructive’, is a fiduciary relationship with re<a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>speet to property, subjecting the person by whom the title to the property is held to equitable duties to deal with the property for the benefit of another person, which arises as a result of a <em>manifestation of an intention </em>to create it.” Restatement (2d) Trusts, §2 (1959) (emphasis added).</p>
    <p id="b105-4" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[152,693,1148,479]]]'>The 1877 agreement manifests a clear intention to create a beneficial association. Such a fund unquestionably has elements of a trust, and its administrators are in a fiduciary relationship with the contributors. However, the existence of a fiduciary relationship does not call into being a formal trust. Corporate directors serve in a fiduciary relationship to a company’s shareholders, yet it would never be contended that a corporation has to be managed in the same fashion as a trust fund.</p>
    <p id="b105-5" data-blocks='[["BL_105.6",105,[154,1184,1151,1138]]]'>Similarly, we are unpersuaded by exceptant’s assertions that the fund here at issue had to be administered according to formal rules of trust. The original 1877 resolution contained no provision for amendment. From the beginning, as we interpret the association’s rules, only contributors “actually injured in the employment of the Company” were entitled to benefits. Membership in the fund undoubtedly terminated with severance of the employment relationship. Hence, we agree with the chancellor that it was entirely reasonable for the trustees to restrict the 1955 vote to those actively employed by the company. Although prior to 1955 the trustees alone had changed the rates of contribution and benefits on ten occasions, we would be presented with a more difficult question had they unilaterally enlarged the fund’s purposes. But that is not our case. The trustees submitted the question of the anthracosilicosis benefits to the then contributors, and not a single vote was cast in opposition to that portion of the resolution. The amendment extending benefits to anthracosilicosis approved by the majority was entirely proper.</p>
