Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied, and appellant was sentenced to concurrent five-to-twenty-year prison terms on Nos. 173 and 303. Sentence on No. 235 was suspended.

    <p id="b285-4" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[146,1160,1149,1139]]]'>With respect to No. 173, police, armed with a search warrant, searched appellant’s apartment and seized a quantify of narcotic drugs. The affidavit in support of the issuance of the search warrant was made by a police officer in the following language: “Information received this date that subject Charles Dial, of 2007 Webster Ave. is selling cocaine and heroin on Centre Ave, at Arthur Sts. and that he is packaging same in his residence. Subject Charles Dial is known to the narcotic squad as a dealer in narcotics having been arrested by Federal Agents three weeks ago for sale of heroin. Informant has supplied information in the past leading to the arrest of Meryl Bedford and Mary Hughes at 226 Dinwiddie St. and a large seizure of heroin and cocaine also the arrest of Robert Monroe at 2040 Forbes St. and a large seizure of marihuana. Affiant observed this subject on this date transacting business with known drug addicts on Centre Ave. in vicinity of Arthur St. in company with members of narcotic squad, after this surveillance [sic] this warrant was obtained.”</p>

      <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>Appellant argues that this affidavit did not set forth underlying circumstances sufficient to permit the magistrate to issue the search warrant. Appellant emphasizes that the phrase “transacting business” does not necessarily mean that appellant was dealing in narcotics. However, the affiant testified that the expression “transacting business” meant “dealing in dope,” and a common sense reading of the affidavit supports this testimony. Consequently, there can be no doubt that this affidavit easily satisfied the requirements of <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em><a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">393 U.S. 410</a>, <a href="/us/393/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="393 U.S. 410" data-case-ids="11317375" data-case-paths="/us/393/0410-01">89 S.

    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[201,1065,1153,707]]]'>Appellant also argues that in executing the warrant at No. 173, the failure of the officers to give appellant reasonable opportunity to admit them before the officers broke down the door invalidated the search. However, in <em>Commonwealth v. Newman, </em><a href="/pa/429/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="429 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1913528" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0441-01">429 Pa. 441</a>., 444, <a href="/citations/?q=240%20A.2d%20795" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="240 A.2d 795">240 A. 2d 795</a>, 797 (1968), we recognized that the procedure set forth in <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A73109" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="18 U.S.C. §3109">18 USC §3109</a> was “reasonable” in terms of the Constitution’s protection against “unreasonable” searches. This statute states: “The officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance. . .</p>

Thus, unlike the situation in <em>Newman, </em>the police did announce their identity, authority and purpose. Then, according to police testimony, they heard the sound of running from inside the apartment. This factor, the sound of running, distinguishes this case from <em>Commonwealth v. DeMichel, </em><a href="/pa/442/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="442 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1935345" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0553-01">442 Pa. 553</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=277%20A.2d%20159" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="277 A.2d 159">277 A. 2d 159</a> (1971), where we held that a five to fifteen sec<a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>ond delay, alone, cannot constitute support for a belief that evidence was being destroyed. We agree with the opinion of the Superior Court that “When they heard sounds of running and the door was not opened, they were warranted in thinking that they were refused admittance and that an effort was underway to destroy evidence. They did not need to wait until the evidence was destroyed.” <em>McClure v.

In the early morning hours of July 11, 1968, appellant and a female companion were arrested on a charge of loitering and prowling.

Upon seeing them for the fifth time, the police ordered them to go home. Instead, the couple went into an open all-night market, about thirty yards from the intersection. When the police returned, appellant and his companion were standing on the corner near the market and the woman was holding a package purchased there. When again requested to leave, the couple told the officers that they were “watching for a jitney.” The officers told the couple that the jitney stand was across the street.
