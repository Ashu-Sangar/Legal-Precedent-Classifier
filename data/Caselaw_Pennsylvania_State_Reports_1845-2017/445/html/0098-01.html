Appellant, Stanley Hoss, was tried under the Split Verdict Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which provides a two phase trial on the questions of guilt and sentence. He here asserts numerous trial errors including the prejudicial effect of pretrial publicity and the denial of a change of venue, the limits on the scope of questioning at the voir dire, and the admission of certain evidence at the guilt and penalty phases of the trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Upon review of the record and consideration of these contentions, we affirm the conviction, but conclude that appellant must be afforded a new sentencing hearing because of evidence improperly admitted at the penalty phase of the trial. The facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, are as follows.</p>

Police departments throughout the county were <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>promptly notified of the escape but their immediate efforts to recapture appellant failed.</p>
    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[165,456,1159,1613]]]'>Hoss was first seen by one Fred Mangol on September 19, 1969. Mangol, who had known appellant for eleven years and was aware of his recent escape from prison, immediately notified the Pittsburgh Police Department that appellant had just left a restaurant and was driving a yellow Chevrolet in the direction of Allegheny Eiver Boulevard. This information was relayed by the Pittsburgh Police to the Oakmont Police who in turn notified the Penn Hills and Yerona Police Departments. Shortly thereafter, Officer Joseph Zanella of the Verona Police Department spotted a Chevrolet with Ohio license plates. Believing the occupant was the appellant, Officer Zanella had him pull his car over to the side of the road on Plum Street in Oakmont. After giving appropriate warnings, he approached appellant’s car with his revolver drawn. Two shots rang out, one of which proved fatal to Officer Zanella. Appellant immediately fled, hitching a ride in the direction of Tarentum, Pennsylvania. Two days later, he abducted Karen Malgott at gunpoint in Lower Burrel, Pennsylvania and forced her to drive him through sections of Maryand and West Virginia. During the 18-hour abduction appellant stated that he had shot a “Verona cop”. Appellant was finally captured by the local police in Waterloo, Iowa on October 4, 1969 and immediately arraigned before a United States Commissioner for various federal charges including interstate flight from prosecution which was based on appellant’s escape from prison pending sentencing on the rape charge.</p>

Hoss was returned to Pittsburgh on October 9 and the next day was sentenced on the rape charge for which he had been convicted before his escape.</p>

He now contends that the death of the Verona policeman, Officer Zanella, and the events surrounding appellant’s escape, arrest, and pending trial generated so much inflammatory publicity that he could not receive a fair trial in Allegheny County. This claim raises two questions: (1) whether the pretrial publicity was so prejudicial that only a change of venue could guarantee appellant a fair trial; (2) whether the precautions taken by the trial court and the conduct of the voir dire were sufficient to provide appellant a fair trial.</p>

In <em>Irvin, </em>the barrage of newspaper accounts not only announced the accused’s confession but repeatedly thereafter referred to the accused as the “confessed slayer” and reported all the details of the accused’s offer to plead guilty.

In <em>Swanson, </em>the arrest for armed robbery was preceded by a barrage of publicity (30 newspaper articles and 45 television newscasts in Cambria County—the scene of the crime) and the accused was even described as a “punk, arrogant person”. The involvement of the accused in other crimes for which he had not yet been tried was repeatedly referred to by the m'edia. The accused was filmed walking the one and one-half blocks from the jail to his preliminary hearing and arraignment. We held in <em>Swanson </em>that because most of the reporting was factual in nature and the only potentially damaging publicity was the speculation by a television station as to the motive for the crime, the denial of change of venue was proper. <a href="/pa/432/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="432 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1919725" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0293-01">432 Pa. 293</a>, 299-300, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%2012" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="248 A.2d 12">248 A. 2d 12</a>, 15-16 (1968).</p>

        <em> </em>In <em>Irvin, </em>the'United States Supreme Court observed: “To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror’s impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.” <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em><a href="/us/366/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="139" data-cite="366 U.S. 717" data-case-ids="1285471" data-case-paths="/us/366/0717-01">366 U.S. 717</a>, 723, <a href="/us/366/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="366 U.S. 717" data-case-ids="1285471" data-case-paths="/us/366/0717-01">81 S.

Appellant maintains that the trial court improperly denied his requests for a continuance, first after the trial court ruled that a Dr. Koskoff could not conduct neurological tests on appellant in his office because of inadequate security, and second at the time appellant received copies of his confessions to the FBI two days before trial. In the first instance, there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court because Dr. Koskoff refused to conduct the tests because of the problems of security raised by the court. Furthermore, Dr. Koskoff did agree to and did in fact review the results of similar tests conducted at the State Correctional Institution. In addition, appellant had two weeks before trial in which to seek other testing arrangements which satisfied the demands of security raised by the court. In the second instance, the substance of the confessions were provided to appellant almost two months before trial. Appellant also contends that the Commonwealth’s use of three witnesses not listed on the Bill of Particulars prejudiced appellant. The record indicates that the witnesses were not discovered until the day of trial. Appellant’s counsel was given the opportunity to question the witnesses before they testified.</p>
      <p id="b148-7" data-blocks='[["BL_148.7",148,[174,1938,1155,394]]]'>Appellant also contends that his motion to disqualify the judge, based on the judge’s telephone call to Dr. Koskoff concerning security arrangements for the scheduled neurological tests, was improperly denied. Appellant maintains this was prejudicial communication between the court and a prospective defense witness. There is no merit to this contention. The court was only exercising its supervisory powers over cases before it by trying to insure the security of the examination to be conducted in a private physician’s office.</p>
