    <p id="b377-7" data-blocks='[["BL_377.12",377,[145,1365,1150,633]]]'>The Act of July 8, 1968, P. L. , 24 P.S. §§2400.1 et seq. (Act 150), establishes a comprehensive three step procedure for the formulation and adoption of plans for school district reorganization. Initially, each county board of school directors is directed to prepare and submit such a plan to the State Board of Education. The State Board in turn reviews each plan and either approves or amends it. Finally, any school district which considers itself aggrieved by a plan approved by the State Board may appeal to the court of common pleas of the county where the school district is located.</p>

For reasons appearing below, we hold <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>that an appeal does lie from a decision of the court of common pleas and that the court of common pleas did err in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[188,500,1155,478]]]'>The present appeal arises as follows: On October 7, 1968, the Allegheny County Board of School Directors adopted a plan of school district reorganization for Allegheny County and submitted it to the State Board of Education pursuant to Act 150. The plan provided, inter alia, for the creation of a Unit 38, comprised of the School Districts of the Boroughs of Swissvale and Braddock Hills, and a Unit 40, consisting of the School District of the Borough of Edgewood alone.</p>
    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[189,989,1154,577]]]'>Although it had operated jointly with the Swissvale School District since 1965, the Braddock Hills School District petitioned the State Board of Education, requesting that proposed Units 38 and 40 be merged into one unit. The Edgewood School District was granted leave to intervene, and hearings were conducted by the State Board on February 11 and May 9, 1969. On the latter date, the State Board rendered an adjudication dismissing Braddock Hills’ petition and approving separate Units 38 and 40 as established by the County Board.</p>
    <p id="b378-6" data-blocks='[["BL_378.6",378,[188,1586,1156,693]]]'>On June 9, 1969, Braddock Hills appealed the State Board’s decision to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, and Edgewood was again permitted to intervene. Upon motion of the State Board, Swissvale was joined as a necessary party but did not file any pleadings or otherwise participate in the proceedings. Instead, its counsel informed the court that Swissvale was neutral with respect to the challenged reorganization plan. Additional evidence was taken at a hearing-held on March 16, 1970, and on June 1, 1970, the court of common pleas entered an order reversing the adjudication of the State Board and directing that all three school districts be merged into one unit.</p>

    <p id="b379-3" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[161,722,1150,483]]]'>We are confronted preliminarily in this appeal with appellee Braddock Hills’ contention that there is no right of appeal from an order of the court of common pleas made pursuant to Act 150. In so arguing, appellee refers to the last sentence of Section 5 of the Act, 24 P.S. §2400.5, which declares that the order of the court of common pleas “shall be a final order”. We are unpersuaded that the quoted language in any way precludes further appellate review.</p>

L. , No. 351, 12 P.S. §§1111.1-.2. Section 1 of that Act provides that “[ejxcept as provided in Section 2 [pertaining to orders already appealable by statute] there shall be a right of appeal under this act from <em>a final order, </em>decision, judgment or sentence of a court of record to an appellate court as provided by Section 9 of Article V of the Constitution. The aforesaid appeal shall be taken to the Superior Court unless otherwise provided by statute. . . .” (Emphasis added.) We think it clear that Article V, Section 9 and the Act of December 2, 1968, together establish a right of appeal from a final order of the court of common pleas pursuant to Act 150, and Ave further conclude that such an appeal prior to the effective date of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>Act of 1970 was properly taken in the first instance to the Superior Court.

    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[190,767,1159,912]]]'>In considering this issue we are faced at the outset with an apparent ambiguity in the text of Act 150. Section 5 of the Act begins by affording a right of appeal to the court of common pleas “by petition setting forth that such approval [by the State Board] is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law”, but goes on to grant to the court of common pleas the ostensibly broader power to amend the plan “as the court, in its discretion, shall find necessary or desirable.” All parties to this appeal agree, as indeed they must, that the latter language must be read in conjunction with the former, and so viewing the statute we are of the opinion that the correct interpretation of Section 5 is that a court may not amend a plan of reorganization unless it finds that the State Board has abused its discretion or has acted arbitrarily, capriciously or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>

It is true that the mere possession of discretionary power by an administrative body does not make it wholly immune from judicial review, but the scope of that review is limited.</p>

Although these comments were made in <em>Chartiers </em>in the course of our conclusion that the School Reorganization Act did not constitute an illegal delegation of legislative power, they are equally relevant here and lend further support to the view that the Legislature did not intend the court of common pleas to substitute its own discretion and judgment, however well considered, for that of the State Board of Education.</p>

A pertinent question, therefore, is whether Units 38 and 40 possess the capability to provide a comprehensive program for the pupils in their respective areas. We feel that each unit has this capability.</p>
    <p id="b382-7" data-blocks='[["BL_382.7",382,[196,2025,1154,314]],["BL_383.1",383,[150,315,1148,362]]]'>“Unit 38 has a pupil enrollment in excess of 2,000.

The <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>educational program offered to the pupils in the Unit 38 is meeting the diversified needs of its children in the academic, business and vocational fields.

It follows that the Superior Court was the proper forum for Edgewood’s appeal notwithstanding the subsequent partial repeal of the Act of December 2, 1968. Whether or not the Superior Court is the proper forum for such appeals filed subsequent to the effective date of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act is a question not now before this Court.</p>
