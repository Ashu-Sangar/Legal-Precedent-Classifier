While Edwards and a Mrs. Saunders, another guest at the party, were talking in one of the rear rooms of the apartment, Speller entered the room, quickly pulled a .32 calibre automatic pistol from an inside coat pocket, pointed it at the head of Edwards and pulled the trigger. A bullet pierced the left frontal area of the skull at the hairline fracturing the cranium bone. Edwards was taken <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>to a hospital almost immediately, where he died from the bullet Avound eight days later. Speller fled the scene after the shooting and left Pennsylvania. Efforts by the police to locate him failed. Speller voluntarily surrendered to the police in Philadelphia on March 6, 1949.</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[191,671,1152,199]]]'>During the trial of the case, Speller admitted the shooting but said it was unintentional. He stated the gun discharged accidentally as he was exhibiting it to Edwards.</p>

    <p id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.6",66,[186,1112,1154,374]]]'>Before this challenged testimony was admitted, the doctor, Avho administered emergency aid to Edwards when he entered the hospital, described his “critical" condition, the nature of the wound and stated that Edwards was then “in imminent danger of death." Under the circumstances, it was not error to admit the testimony as a dying declaration.</p>

In other words, the admissibility of such evidence depends primarily upon the state of the declarant’s mind. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[146,1078,1150,979]]]'>Appellant also assigns as error the excusing of a juror for cause, merely because the juror expressed objections during voir dire examination to imposition of the death penalty. Since the penalty fixed by the jury in the instant case was life imprisonment, it is admitted that the minimum constitutional standards as to the exclusion of jurors in homicide cases, as announced in <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/391/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="391 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="1767501" data-case-paths="/us/391/0510-01">391 U.S. 510</a>, <a href="/us/391/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="391 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="1767501" data-case-paths="/us/391/0510-01">88 S. Ct. 1770</a> (1968), were not violated. Cf. <em>Bumper v. North Carolina, </em><a href="/us/391/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="391 U.S. 543" data-case-ids="1767611" data-case-paths="/us/391/0543-01">391 U.S. 543</a>, <a href="/us/391/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="391 U.S. 543" data-case-ids="1767611" data-case-paths="/us/391/0543-01">88 S. Ct. 1788</a> (1968). But, we are urged to extend the <em>Witherspoon </em>rule and hold that the exclusion of jurors merely because of conscientious scruples against capital punishment tends to affect the jury’s decision of guilt and lead to “a stacked jury” in violation of due process. This position is based on the assertion that “jurors not opposed to the death penalty tend to favor the prosecution in determination of guilt.”</p>

These motions were subsequently denied, and this appeal followed.</p>
