These complaints alleged that on or about <em>June 80, 1961, </em>and at other times within the last three years, the appellant attempted to influence Joseph O. Canby to persuade the Board of Assessors of Bucks County to act favorably on Silverstein’s appeal from a tax assessment on his <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>land and industrial building located in Warminster Township, Bucks County. In order to enlist Oanby’s aid, the appellant allegedly arranged for the transfer of 100 shares of stock in Camden Trust Company from his wife’s name to the name of Canby’s wife. At the time of the transfer Canby was serving as the Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners. While the Board of County Commissioners has nothing directly to do with tax assessments, they do have the power to hire and fire members of the Board of Assessments.</p>

On April 24, 1970, appellant filed a motion to quash the indictments, alleging that each count was defective on its face. After argument, Judges Satterthwaite and Garb, of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas, granted the motion to quash with respect to Counts 1, 3 and 5, but denied the motion with respect to Counts 2 and 4.</p>

      <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>In the first place, the indictment not only alleges that certain offenses were committed on June 30, 1967, but also “at divers other times”. “Where the offense consists of a succession or continuation of acts not limited to any particular day, it is proper to allege it as having been committed on a certain day named, and on divers days and times between such day and the day of finding of the indictment, or any other specific subsequent day prior thereto; <em>and such allegation is sufficient although the first date mentioned is beyond the period of limitations, provided the latter date is within such </em>period(Emphasis added.) 42 C. J. S., <em>Indictments and Informations </em>§125g (1944). <em>See, United States v. Schmidt, </em><a href="/f-supp/15/0804-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="15 F.

For some unarticulated reason the majority disregards this continuando and only looks to the specific date. Over sixty years ago, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, speaking for a unanimous Supreme Court, refused to quash an indictment charging a conspiracy, formed on a day certain, beyond the applicable statutory period, and continuing until the presenting of the indictment. <em>United States v. Kissel, </em><a href="/us/218/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="218 U.S. 601" data-case-ids="8289042" data-case-paths="/us/218/0601-01">218 U.S. 601</a> (1910). Although conspiracy, unlike bribery and corrupt solicitation, is regarded a continuing crime by its very nature, it must be remembered that the indictment alleges that appellant continued to bribe and solicit Joseph O. Canby. By quashing this indictment before the receipt of evidence, the majority ignores the very real possibility that the commission of these offenses continued until the date the indictment was presented.</p>
