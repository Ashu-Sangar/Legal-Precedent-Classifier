On May 13,1970, appellant’s counsel filed three petitions: a motion to suppress a confession, an application for the appointment of an investigator, and a petition to have bail set. On June 2, 1970, the application for an investigator was granted and the other petitions continued.</p>

    <p id="b84-6" data-blocks='[["BL_84.7",84,[182,1583,1154,314]]]'>The determinative issue before the habeas court was whether appellant had, in fact, requested and received a continuance for good cause shown.

Although this record does not disclose precisely when delivery to the appropriate prosecuting officer actually occurred, presumably it was within a few days after July 14, 1969. Accordingly, the 180-day period expired a few days subsequent to January 10, 1970.</p>

While the witness was not absolutely positive the motion had been made on that exact date, a finding to that effect was certainly permissible from the testimony.</p>
    <p id="b85-3" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[142,719,1148,426]]]'>Appellant’s counsel testified at the hearing that extensive plea bargaining had occurred prior to January, 1970. He also stated that in all probability he informed the assistant district attorney on January 2, 1970, that he might file an application to suppress a confession, which was in actuality filed on May 13, 1970, when, according to counsel, plea bargaining attempts were faltering.</p>
    <p id="b85-4" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[144,1156,1151,805]]]'>We believe the hearing court’s disposition of this issue possesses sufficient support in the record. Appellant cannot lull the prosecution into plea bargaining attempts only to file for a discharge after the expiration of 180 days. Likewise, the Commonwealth cannot delay trial indefinitely while half-hearted and ephemeral plea bargaining occurs. However, in the present case, it appears the plea bargaining was in good faith and without purposeful delay. Furthermore, testimony was elicited that appellant had, in fact, requested a continuance. While in other cases it is to be expected that the motion for a continuance and the moving party will appear as a matter of record to preclude the difficult issue of fact presented to the habeas court, we are unwilling to find any error on the record before us.</p>
