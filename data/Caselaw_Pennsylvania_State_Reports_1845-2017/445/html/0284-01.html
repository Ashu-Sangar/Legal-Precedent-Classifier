After the denial of post-trial motions, this appeal was filed raising numerous contentions. The principal contention challenges the trial court’s refusal to grant appellant’s motion for a mistrial after a prejudicial statement by the prosecutor during cross-exaxniation of appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> We agree and vacate the judgment of sentence and grant a new trial.</p>

On cross-examination, the folloAving exchange occurred: “Q. [Prosecutor] : Did you tell him [public defender] that the police had just beaten you up? Did you shoAV him the marks on your face? A. [Appellant]: No sir. Q. Why not? A. Why not? Q. Yes, Avhy not? A. He wasn’t concerned about any marks on my face. Q. I suggest to you, Mr. Potter—A. You suggest to me what? Q. I suggest to you that the reason that you didn’t say anything about it is because what you have said about being beaten by the police is a malicious lie like all the rest of your testimony. A. No, it is not. [Counsel] : Objection, Your Honor. That was not a question, Your Honor. [Prosecutor]; I suggested to him that he was lying. [Counsel]: I move for a mistrial. The Cotjbt: Motion for a mistrial denied. [To the prosecutor] I criticize you . . . for characterizing it that way. Yon don’t need to do that.”</p>
