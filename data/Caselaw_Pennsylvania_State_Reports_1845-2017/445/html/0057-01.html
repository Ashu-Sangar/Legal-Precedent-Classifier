The City of Allentown has three hospitals: Allentown General, Allentown Osteopathic, and Sacred Heart, a Catholic, church-related hospital. Some time ago it became evident that all three institutions were in need of extensive improvements. A joint campaign was agreed upon to raise the necessary funds, and the hospitals organized a non-profit corporation, Allentown Ahead Fund, Inc., primarily for this purpose. Over |6,800,000 has been raised in cash and pledges for the contemplated renovations. However, a dispute eventually developed as to the degree to which the hospitals would participate in establishing a joint facility.</p>

The proposed amendments would have authorized a joint facility that allegedly would have reduced Sacred Heart’s status as a general services hospital and school of nursing and destroyed the character and integrity of Sacred Heart as an independent, church-related institution. The complaint also sought, inter alia, to restrain Ahead Fund from disbursing funds held for Sacred Heart, and to prevent any encumbering of Sacred Heart’s assets or transferring of any of its services to the proposed joint facility.</p>
    <p id="b91-4" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[136,905,1149,364]]]'>The answer denied the allegations in the complaint and attacked what appellees have characterized as the “remarkable” legal position that the power conferred by the Pennsylvania Non-Profit Corporation Law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to amend a charter is suspended whenever the power comes into conflict with the hospital’s Catholic character.</p>

The petition averred the Board had breached its fiduciary duty and violated the March 3, <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>1970 agreement by talcing steps to implement construction of a joint hospital facility -without the approval of Bishop McShea and before a consultant retained to analyze the financial feasibility of the project had completed his study. The petition sought to enjoin the Board and representatives of the Joint Planning Committee from entering into any joint venture agreement with the Allentown Hospital Association, encumbering Sacred Heart’s assets for the advancement of the joint facility, transferring any of the hospital’s services or staff, and taking any action inconsistent with the operation of Sacred Heart as a church-related institution.

It is argued that the primary reason for appellants’ petition for supplemental relief is that appellees approved certain expenditures for the joint hospital project prior to the receipt of the consultant’s report. The completed report is attached to the motion, and the report concludes the joint facility is financially feasible. The motion also avers that on March 12,1971, the Boards of Sacred Heart and Allentown Hospital Association approved a joint venture agreement, and articles of incorporation and bylaws of a new nonprofit corporation established to implement the joint hospital venture with full recognition of the obligations of the parties under the March 3, 1970, settlement agreement.</p>
