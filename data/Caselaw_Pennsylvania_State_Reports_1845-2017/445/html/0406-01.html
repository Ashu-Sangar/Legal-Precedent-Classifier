Alexander and one Loureatha Vicks evidencing a wedding between those parties on July 5, 1952, in Pelham, Georgia. He also introduced a certified copy of a divorce a.v.m. obtained from the same woman, granted by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County on August 9, 1967.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Appellant further testified that his former wife (Miss Vicks) was still living, because he had seen her in July, 1968.

It is clear that if that marriage was not terminated by divorce or by the death of Loureatha prior to the 1961 wedding ceremony between the present parties, the purported marriage to appellee would be void, and appellee would not be entitled to support. <em>Heffner v.

On the one hand, with reference to the first marriage, that of 1951, the law presumes that it continues until the death of one of the parties or a divorce. On the other hand, the law recognizes the presumption of innocence in contracting a second marriage as well as a presumption of the validity of the second marriage. In <em>Watt Estate </em>we stated that the second presumption, in itself, does not overcome the first presumption, but that “[t]he real thrust of the several presumptions is to place the burden of proving the invalidity of the second marriage upon the person <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>who claims such invalidity and to require proof of some nature that the first marriage was not dissolved by death or divorce at the time of the second marriage.” <em>Id. </em>at 54.</p>
