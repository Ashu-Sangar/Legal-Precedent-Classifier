Appellant’s motion <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>for a new trial was denied by the Court <em>en banc </em>and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[200,446,1160,687]]]'>On the evening of April 6, 1968, the appellant and four male friends firebombed the home of Mrs. Mary Ampio in Pittsburgh. In the ensuing fire Mrs. Ampio was severely burned. She was hospitalized until her death two months later. No autopsy was performed at the time of death, but five months later, Dr. Cyril Wecht, the Allegheny County Coroner, examined the exhumed remains and testified at appellant’s trial that the immediate cause of Mrs. Amplo’s death was broncho-pneumonia which, in his opinion, “developed as a result of the extensive burns of the body, and the type of treatment, namely immobilization that was required to treat those burns.”</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[198,1154,1153,206]]]'>Appellant’s sole contention on this appeal is that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the firebombing caused the victim’s death. We disagree and affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>

The action of the defendant must constitute a direct and substantial factor in causing the death of the victim and a showing of probability is insufficient. <em>Commonwealth v.

But a defendant cannot escape criminal responsibility for homicide where his violence produces a condition causing death, although the violence itself is not the immediate cause of death. <em>Commonwealth v.
