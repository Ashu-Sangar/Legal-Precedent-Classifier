    <p id="b394-4" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[254,605,1059,41]]]'>The record discloses the following pertinent facts:</p>
    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.5",394,[176,658,1161,960]]]'>On September 29, 1968, at approximately 6:50 p.m., Busier was operating a motor vehicle south on Route 66. Road conditions were clear and dry. Route 66 is a two-lane highway running north and south. The highway, north of Goheenville, Armstrong County, traverses a hill. Prom the crest of the hill Route 66 south proceeds down a grade to a dip which is approximately 500 feet from the crest. Route 66 south then curves slightly and proceeds up an incline. Busier’,s motor vehicle collided with a northbound vehicle operated by Doris Jean Pierson,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the impact occurring at a point 50-75 feet south of the dip and in the northbound lane of traffic. An officer, Arrow, who investigated the scene obseiwed a line of skid marks measuring 203 feet from the point of impact, northward. Between the north and southbound lanes, from the crest to a point about 100 feet north of the dip is a broken line indicating a passing zone.</p>
    <p id="b394-6" data-blocks='[["BL_394.6",394,[170,1637,1160,477]],["BL_395.1",395,[184,331,1150,416]]]'>According to the testimony of a Commonwealth witness, Patterson, Busler’s motor vehicle had been traveling to the rear <em>of </em>five vehicles proceeding south on the downgrade. First in line was a camper, followed by Patterson’s vehicle, a station wagon, two automobiles and then Busier. Busier passed the two cars immediately in front of him and then returned to the southbound lane. He then pulled out again and passed both the station wagon and Patterson. When Busier was <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>approximately 50 feet beyond Patterson, lie started to pass the camper, which was 70 feet beyond Patterson’s vehicle, slowing np the entire line of traffic. The brake lights of the Busier vehicle then went on and the vehicle abruptly turned and skidded sideways down the hill to a point about 70 feet south of the dip where further movement was aborted by collision with the Pierson vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b395-3" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[180,768,1152,531]]]'>The trial court concluded Busler’s conduct in the operation of his motor vehicle was reckless based on the following findings of fact: (1) His vehicle was operated at an excessive rate of speed immediately before the accident; and (2) when his vehicle attempted to pass the camper, Busier did not have an unobstructed view of at least 500 feet as required by Section 1008(b) of The Vehicle Code, Act of April 29, 1959, P. L. 58, 75 P.S. §1008 (b). The record fails to sustain either of these two findings.</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[178,1310,1149,318]]]'>The trial testimony established that the speed limit on the highway involved was 55 miles per hour. The evidence offered by the Commonwealth was that Busler’s vehicle was traveling at a rate of speed of 50 miles an hour at most. Hence, it was being operated within the permissible speed limit.</p>
    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.6",395,[173,1638,1152,646]]]'>The court’s finding that Busier attempted to or made an illegal pass is also controverted by the Commonwealth’s own evidence. In this connection, the point in time on which we must focus is the moment Busier completed his pass of the Patterson vehicle and began to overtake the camper. The police officer who investigated the accident testified for the Commonwealth that Busier was in a passing zone at this point (evidenced by broken lines) and that he “had lots of room” to make the pass. The officer also estimated that Busler’s visability from the point he began his pass of the camper was 500 feet.</p>
