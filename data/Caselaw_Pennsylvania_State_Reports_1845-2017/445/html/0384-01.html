The answer pleaded, under “New Matter”, that the statements were privileged, having been made in good faith, with sufficient cause for believing them to be true, on a proper occasion, from a proper motive and as a matter of public interest, information and comment.

Gerhart spent the night at a motel near the radio studio to facilitate his getting to work the next day. During a newscast intermission in the talk show the following morning, Mrs. Gerhart telephoned her husband. She related, among other things, that on the preceding evening she had had their driveway at home plowed by Mr. Matus, and that the charge for this work had been $35. Mrs. Gerhart testified that her husband “got a little mad” on hearing the cost. Gerhart himself testified that he “was rather staggered” and “thought it was an exorbitant price. . . .” Returning to the air following the newscast, Gerhart engaged the newscaster in conversation on the subject of snowplowing, and said he had been charged $35 for having his own driveway plowed. The newsman asked who had done the job, and Gerhart replied, as he testified, “I <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>don’t know ... I got the name from Sue [Mrs. Gerhart] during the news. I think it was a company called Matus or something like that.” There followed a discussion in which, as he said, Gerhart issued a “moral warning”, that “goodness sake, watch out for this kind of thing going on”. Gerhart testified that “people called in, and they would relate similar incidents . . . nobody seemed able to top that one, however, on that particular day”.</p>
    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[188,786,1154,416]]]'>Three others in addition to Gerhart testified concerning the broadcast: Matus himself and two acquaintances, one a customer and one a fellow police officer. The customer, one Schultz, could not recall what was said, but did remember hearing Matus’ name mentioned in “a short conversation about the snowplow business and didn’t think that was too right”. He was then asked:</p>

It was much too high and people like this shouldn’t be in business, and he mentioned the name Matus”. Matus himself heard only a tape replay of the program at the WFIL studio after suit was brought. He testified: “He [Gerhart] said that this Matus garage had plowed his driveway and charged him $35 and his wife was home alone, and people like this, talcing advantage of a woman at home alone, and he said they shouldn’t be in business.” Asked how long the “announcement” took, Matus replied: “He talked about it for a couple of minutes and then later on in the show he got a call, I believe, from a lady in New Jersey, and she said that was outrageous, and she was talking to him about it and didn’t mention my name again. And later on in the show he <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>made a remark about it again but didn’t mention my name.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

She said that after the plowing she had paid a Mrs. D’Angeli, who came to the door from the snowplow vehicle and announced “I am here to collect for Matus”, explaining that “he” was in the truck. Mrs. Gerhart said, “I guess I did get a little upset, but I paid her the cash and she left.”</p>

In refutation of these denials, appellants produced Mr. D’Angeli, who testified that he had been asked by Matus to plow a couple of driveways on the night ia question, including Gerhart’s, that he had done so, and that Mrs. D’Angeli, who was with him on the plow vehicle, had indeed collected $35. The witness stated that he considered this charge reasonable for a circular 75' driveway under the drift conditions he encountered. He testified that his arrangement with Matus was that Matus was to receive $20 for the job, and that the witness paid him this sum a day or two later.</p>

      <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>Appellants’ first argument on this appeal is that the words used by Gerhart were not actionable because they did not touch appellee in his business or profession; that they did not “impeach” Matus’ skill, knowledge or professional conduct. The basis of this contention appears to be that the broadcast statement referred to but one incident of overcharge and not to a course of conduct; there was no suggestion in the broadcast that his services were unsatisfactory or unworkmanlike. While we might be inclined to agree that the appellee presented a marginal case of libel <em>per se, </em>particularly since the exact words employed were never introduced in evidence, we decline to consider this assignment of error. As noted above (footnote 2), appellants did not move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, nor do they now press insufficiency of the evidence as ground for a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Moreover, the brief of appellants seems to concede that the trial court was not in error in its preliminary finding that the words allegedly used were capable of a defamatory meaning. Appellants’ assertion that the court’s charge in effect told the jury that they should find that the words used were understood by the recipients to be defamatory is without merit; viewed as a whole, the portion of the charge dealing with this aspect was not erroneous.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

      <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>Appellants next urge that the court erred in its charge as to loss of privilege. The court charged that the appellants, as a radio broadcasting station and an employee of the station, respectively, in conducting a program of discussion and comment about local matters, had a conditional privilege. This was not disputed by appellee. The court went on to charge that because of this privilege appellee could not recover unless he proved that the statements in question were false, and were made either with knowledge of the falsity or “without reasonable care to ascertain their truth or falsity before making them.” The words “without reasonable care” were equated with negligence, which was properly defined in terms of lack of that due care which a reasonable man would have used under the circumstances to ascertain whether the statements were true before giving them currency. The court declined appellants’ points for charge which would have required appellee, in order to destroy the conditional privilege, to prove by clear and convincing evidence either (1) knowledge of falsity or (2) actual malice in making the statements, defined as reckless disregard of whether the statements were true or false. The court thus employed the traditional Pennsylvania law on the subject of conditional privilege, without reference to the federal constitutiona] dimension of the privilege as it has recently evolved.</p>

Speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Kepiiakt, the Court said: “In considering the basis of liability for defamation by radio and in balancing the conflicting interests, due regard must be had to the rights of all parties, and to the ultimate and collateral effects any pronouncement might have on public interests. A rule unalterably imposing liability without fault on the broadcasting company under any circuía<a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>stances is manifestly unjust, unfair and contrary to every principle of morals. A fair aspect of the harm to the persons injured must be considered as well as the circumstances under which the incident occurred.” The Court there held that the broadcasting company was not liable for a nonemployee’s false defamatory statement (“that’s a rotten hotel”) interjected into a prepared script which the company had inspected and edited and where it had no reason to believe that an extemporaneous defamatory remark would be made. But the opinion added that “[wjhere the broadcasting station’s employee or agent makes the defamatory remark, it is liable, unless the remarks are privileged and there is no malice.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> No claim of privilege was there asserted. We have had occasion recently to make an exhaustive analysis of the Pennsylvania law of defamation : <em>Corabi v.

The Court, affirming the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, held that the <em>New York Times </em>standard did apply. The “event of public or general interest” involved in <em>Metromedia </em>was the prosecution of the plaintiff for a violation of the obscenity laws of Philadelphia resulting from his distribution of nudist magazines. A plurality of the court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> held that this event was one of public concern because “[t]he community has a vital interest in the proper enforcement of its criminal laws, particularly in an area such as obscenity where a number of highly important values are potentially in conflict: the public has an interest both in seeing that the criminal law is adequately enforced and in assuring that the law is not used unconstitutionally to suppress free expression.” <a href="/citations/?q=403%20U.S.%2043" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="403 U.S. 43">403 U.S. 43</a>.

It is clear that there has emerged from our cases decided since New York Times the concept that the First Amendment’s impact upon the state libel laws derives not so much from whether the plaintiff is a ‘public official’, ‘public figure’, or ‘private individual’, as it derives from the question whether the allegedly defamatory publication concerns a matter of public or <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>general interest. See T. Emerson, 'The System of Freedom of Expression’, 531-532, 540 (1970).

The “announcer” states that his wife has been overcharged by plaintiff, calling him by name, for clearing their driveway of snow, and that “people like that shouldn’t be in business”. We have no doubt that Gerhart could with impunity talk all he wished about the weather (it is sometimes difficult to say enough bad things about the weather), and to discuss the problems of snow removal. We see no justification, however, for the interjection of Matus’ name into the discussion or for the expression of opinion as to his business ethics or fitness, to be in business. This was no contribution “to robust debate on public issues”; it was by no stretch of imagination a matter of public concern that Gerhart thought he or his wife had been bilked by Matus the evening before; it was but a matter of private pique. The great values of the First Amendment are not served by making it a haven for unprovoked and defamatory gossip-mongering of interest only to the speaker merely because he happens to be on the radio at the time of speaking. The “breathing space” which the Amendment requires in terms of modification of traditional libel <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>laws will not be restricted by tbe normal application of tbe law of Pennsylvania in this case.

At tbe close of plaintiff’s case, appellants moved for a compulsory nonsuit on tbe specific ground tbat plaintiff bad failed to prove tbat tbe broadcast was defamatory. This same claim was reiterated in appellant’s motion for new trial, and in their brief in this appeal. In these circumstances I fail to understand why tbe majority now declines to consider this assignment of error.</p>
