The government for its part introduced no evidence other than the record of the prior administrative proceedings before the Immigration and Naturalization Service. By opinion and order dated May 29,1970, the court of common pleas denied the petition for naturalization, and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b121-3" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[135,919,1155,977]]]'>It was the government’s original position in this case that appellant’s petition for naturalization was deficient in three respects. It contended that he had not adequately demonstrated his attachment to the principles of the Constitution; that he had not sufficiently proven his eligibility to take the conscientious objector version of the oath of renunciation and allegiance; and, finally, that he could not, as required, promise in good faith to perform work of national importance under civilian direction. Although the government has now apparently abandoned the first two grounds, and the court of common pleas based its decision denying naturalization solely on the third ground, we must discuss all three asserted defects in appellant’s petition. This is so because this appeal is in the nature of a broad certiorari,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the record so permits, and our present resolution of all three issues will conclude the matter.</p>

As to the oath issue, the court noted that petitioners had stated that they would only perform Avork which was in their Anew not inconsistent Avith their religious beliefs and if the orders to perform such work did not issue from a draft board. Inasmuch as all orders to report for civilian work do in fact emanate from draft boards, it was a virtual certainty that petitioners, if naturalized, would not be able to abide by the terms of the oath.

Ct. 569</a> (1931), citizenship was denied to a person who wouid take the oath only with the reservation “as my conscience as a Christian will allow.” In <em>United, States v. Mackintosh, </em><a href="/us/283/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="283 U.S. 605" data-case-ids="434121" data-case-paths="/us/283/0605-01">283 U.S. 605</a>, <a href="/us/283/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="283 U.S. 605" data-case-ids="434121" data-case-paths="/us/283/0605-01">51 S. Ct. 570</a> (1931), citizenship was denied to a person who would bear arms only if the war was morally justified. And in <em>United States v.

Ct. 448</a> (1929), citizenship was withheld from one who failed to prove that his expressed pacifistic beliefs would not conflict with his oath of allegiance. The United States Supreme Court stated that these decisions merely stood for the general proposition that an alien who refuses to bear arms will not be admitted to citizenship, and all three decisions were specifically overruled.

This nation has always been profoundly dedicated to the universal rights of man, and our very Declaration of Independence declares it self-evident that all men “are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.” We can scarcely conclude that the elected national representatives of such a nation intended to deny citizenship to an otherwise qualified and worthy individual merely because he expresses the view that he can <em>conceive </em>that there might be some laws so abhorrent to his conscience that he could not obey them.</p>
