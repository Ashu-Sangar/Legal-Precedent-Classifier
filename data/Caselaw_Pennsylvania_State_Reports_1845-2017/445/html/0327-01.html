There is no evidence and appellant does not even suggest that the new ordinance was directed specifically against it or <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>its property. The Borough Zoning Commission advertised a public meeting on the proposed rezoning two weeks prior to appellant’s application, and the proposed ordinance was available for public inspection one week prior to the application. These facts taken together constitute a sufficient “public declaration by the municipality that it intended to rezone the area.” <em>Lhormer v. Bowen, </em><a href="/pa/410/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="410 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="1884578" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0508-01">410 Pa. 508</a>, 511, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.2d%20747" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="188 A.2d 747">188 A. 2d 747</a>, 748 (1963). We therefore conclude that the proposed ordinance was “pending” at the date of appellant’s application and that the Borough Manager’s refusal of a building permit was not improper.</p>
    <p id="b363-4" data-blocks='[["BL_363.5",363,[168,1004,1150,819]]]'>The recent case of <em>Mutzig v. Hatboro Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/440/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="440 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1932217" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0455-01">440 Pa. 455</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20694" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="269 A.2d 694">269 A. 2d 694</a> (1.970), involved a similar issue of whether or not an ordinance was pending at the date of an application for a building permit. Although this Court was divided in <em>Mutzig, </em>every Justice who participated in that decision expressed the view that an ordinance is pending when a Borough Council has resolved to consider a particular scheme of rezoning and has advertised to the public its intention to hold public hearings on the rezoning. We believe that the same conclusion should prevail where, as here, the Borough Zoning Commission proposes a new zoning ordinance, makes the proposal open to public inspection, and advertises that the proposal will be discussed at a forthcoming public meeting.</p>
    <p id="b363-5" data-blocks='[["BL_363.6",363,[167,1836,1147,431]],["BL_364.1",364,[169,337,1150,99]]]'>Appellant argues that the pending ordinance doctrine should not be so extended but should apply instead only to those situations whei*e the proposed ordinance has been formally introduced into the Borough Council and the <em>Council </em>has scheduled and advertised public hearings. In so arguing, appellant contends that a period of one, two or even more years might elapse before final action by Council. It is submitted <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>that such a burdensome restraint upon an individual’s use of his property should not be countenanced.</p>
    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[167,449,1154,761]]]'>We are of course sensitive and sympathetic to the potentially onerous situation depicted by appellant and fully appreciate that “[t]he adoption of a zoning ordinance normally requires an extended period of time.” <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Fairview Township Board of Supervisors, </em><a href="/pa/438/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="438 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="1929212" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0457-01">438 Pa. 457</a>, 459, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%2084" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="266 A.2d 84">266 A. 2d 84</a>, 86 (1970). Nevertheless, in determining when a party obtains a vested right to a building permit, we must attempt, however difficult the task may be, to balance the interest of the municipality in effecting a change in its zoning laws free from the perpetuation of nonconforming uses against the interest of the individual property owner to be free from lengthy restraints upon the use of his property.</p>
    <p id="b364-5" data-blocks='[["BL_364.5",364,[167,1223,1154,760]]]'>If the pending ordinance doctrine were limited, as appellant advocates, only to the period of time during which the proposed ordinance is formally before the Borough Council for final action, any one or number of property owners could gain an unqualified right to a soon to be prohibited land use by the simple expedient of applying for a permit between the time the Zoning Commission announces the proposal and the time the proposal is before the Borough Council for consideration. Though the question is admittedly not easy, we believe that the Borough’s interest in precluding this eventuality is paramount and of greater concern than any regrettable but unavoidable harm suffered by an individual landowner.</p>
    <p id="b364-6" data-blocks='[["BL_364.6",364,[169,1995,1151,321]],["BL_365.1",365,[176,332,1147,873]]]'>A word of caution is nevertheless in order. While Ave do not in this instance countenance a “race to the courthouse steps” by landoAvners to obtain rights to a nonconforming use, our present decision is not to be construed in any sense as granting a license to a municipality to use the pendency of a zoning ordinance as <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>a device to impose either a general or selective moratorium on local land development. However much a rapidly expanding municipality may wish to declare “time out” and stop all development, such effect, by whatever means achieved, would be constitutionally impermissible. Moreover, even aside from questions of improper purpose, it is to be emphasized that the various governmental authorities charged with the responsibility of proposing, promulgating and administering local zoning and planning laws are under a basic duty to act reasonably. In sum, a building permit may be properly refused in situations such as the one at bar <em>only </em>when the municipality acts initially in good faith to achieve permissible ends and thereafter proceeds with reasonable dispatch in considering the proposed rezoning.</p>
