Appellant’s statement to the police had not been made until he had been detained for a period of six days following his arrest and counsel had hoped that, on the basis of the then-recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Turner v. Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/us/338/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="338 U.S. 62" data-case-ids="3937819" data-case-paths="/us/338/0062-01">338 U.S. 62</a> (1949), such statement would be inadmissible at trial.

    <p id="b543-3" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[133,1073,1151,822]]]'>The Commonwealth, although not formally introducing appellant’s unsigned statement into evidence, did introduce the gun into evidence along with testimony of various police officers as to how appellant had led them to where the gun was hidden. The introduction of the gun, when considered along with evidence of appellant’s previous threats to rob the jewelry store in question; evidence that broken watch crystals found at the scene of the crime matched the watch appellant was wearing at the time of his arrest; and evidence that another watch identified by the victim’s family was found in a sewertrap in appellant’s place of residence fully justified the fears on the part of appellant’s trial counsel that appellant faced the likelihood of a death penalty if the case went to the jury.</p>

According to the testimony of the surviving co-counsel, such efforts originally met with difficulty because appellant continued to protest his innocence. Finally, after two previous changes of mind on the part of appellant, appellant was convinced to plead guilty by his trial counsel and an old friend of appel<a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>lant’s who could speak to appellant in Polish, appellant’s native tongue.</p>

No explanation. Do you want to change your plea from Not Guilty to Guilty without no [sic] explanation, Guilty of Murder generally?

Rather, it shows that he had been advised that if he took the stand, his prior record would be introduced, and that record, the gun and the other evidence, considering the fact that this case involved a felony murder, made the threat of the death sentence a distinct possibility. The trial judge testified at the hearing that the chief <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>trial counsel had told him, when the plea was first discussed, that appellant was fully informed of the consequences of the plea, that he knew that the district attorney’s office had recommended life imprisonment, and that he knew that the court was not bound by such recommendation.</p>
    <p id="b545-3" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[152,687,1151,756]]]'>When we consider the testimony of appellant’s own witnesses that appellant ivas reluctant to plead guilty and only did so after much persuasion concerning the distinct possibility that he faced a death penalty if the case went to the jury, it is apparent that the court had ample reason not to believe the appellant’s statement that he believed he was to get probation or a light sentence of a few months in the county jail if he agreed to plead guilty to murder generally. After all, if appellant really believed that his practical choices were between pleading guilty and getting a sentence of a few months or going to a jury and getting a possible death sentence, he would not have required so much persuasion.</p>
    <p id="b545-4" data-blocks='[["BL_545.5",545,[157,1465,1150,711]]]'>As for appellant’s contention that the plea was motivated by the unconstitutional introduction of the gun into evidence, in order to avoid a guilty plea allegedly based on unconstitutional evidence, an appellant must show all of the following: “(1) an involuntary pretrial confession (or presumably any other constitutionally infirm incriminating evidence); (2) that the guilty plea was primarily motivated by such evidence; and, (3) that defendant was incompetently advised by counsel to plead guilty, in the circumstances, rather than stand trial.” <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[190,451,1163,1102]]]'>In 1950, when this trial was held, the whole question of whether lengthy detention, alone, was enough to invalidate a confession for being involuntarily made had not been settled. The fact situation in <em>Turner v.

In the instant case, however, although the appellant claimed that other forms of coercion were used, all of the police officers involvea testified to the contrary. At the time, it was equally unclear whether the introduction of the gun which was found as the result of appellant’s statement could be successfully challenged. Since these issues were new and complex, counsel must be relied upon to make the initial determination as to just what an appellate court would do on appeal. Mere error on the part of counsel, especially if this professional misjudgment is evident only through hindsight, will not suffice to permit the plea to be attacked collaterally. See <em>Commonwealth v. Garrett, </em><a href="/pa/425/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="425 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="1906753" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0594-01">425 Pa. 594</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=229%20A.2d%20922" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="229 A.2d 922">229 A. 2d 922</a> (1967).</p>
