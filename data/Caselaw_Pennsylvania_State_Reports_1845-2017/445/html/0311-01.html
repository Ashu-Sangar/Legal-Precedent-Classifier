Besides the very nature of these two assaults, the amount of evidence introduced by the Commonwealth certainly accentuated these incidents in the jury’s mind. Whereas sixteen individuals were arrested, only five were charged in the band member assault and one appellant attacked the spectators and yet police identification testimony tended to link all sixteen with these assaults by references to <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>“a” group. Even when identification was more precise, the constant shifting of names presented to the jury might possibly blur the jury’s vision. Quite simply, there is a very real possibility that those appellants having no connection with the assaults were nonetheless prejudiced by that evidence.</p>
    <p id="b348-4" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[203,667,1155,709]]]'>While proper instructions might have clarified the jury’s thinking, the court’s instructions can best be characterized as “too little, too late.” Indeed, the trial court’s recitation of the evidence concerning the malicious attack on the three spectators after that individual had pled guilty was both unnecessary and prejudicial to the remaining appellants. As best stated by Judge Spaulding in his dissenting opinion, “the complexity of the evidence and the extreme variation in the amount and type of evidence against the various defendants required marshalling the evidence against and for each defendant separately.” <a href="/pa-super/217/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="217 Pa.
