On January 8, 1963, he filed a claim for the family exemption. The auditor appointed by the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County, Orphans’ Court Division, recommended that appellant’s claims be denied. The lower court confirmed the auditor’s recommendation. Appellant filed exceptions to the auditor’s report on June 30, 1964 which were denied by the lower court on March 20, 1970. This appeal followed.</p>

On May 29, 1942 they both appeared before the Selective Service Board at Easton and signed and swore to the following:</p>

We agree. We believe that this particular case is <em>sui generis </em>and that it is difficult to derive much guidance from the particular facts of cases previously decided by this Court. The principles upon which we are to decide each case are clear, however. A common law marriage is established by words in the present tense, uttered with the view and for the purpose of establishing the relation of husband and wife. <em>Stauffer Estate, </em><a href="/pa/372/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="372 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1238058" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0537-01">372 Pa. 537</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20726" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="94 A.2d 726">94 A. 2d 726</a> (1953). The courts have been <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>frequently called upon to make distinctions between the valid <em>verba in praesenti </em>and the invalid <em>verba de futuro. </em>See, e.g., <em>Blecher Estate, </em><a href="/pa/381/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="381 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1258888" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0138-01">381 Pa. 138</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20129" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="112 A.2d 129">112 A. 2d 129</a> (1955), and cases cited therein.</p>
    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[165,581,1148,484]]]'>The language in the case before us is clearly <em>in praesenti: </em>“I . . . declare that I consider and regard Ada Gower Gulick ... as my wife <em>... do now . . . </em>endow her with full rights and privileges of a wife . . .”; and, as to decedent: “I . . . have read the declaration and statements of my husband . . . made for the purpose of establishing marriage status . . . and I hereby subscribe to Ms statements in every particular and respect.”</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[165,1080,1147,485]]]'>Not only is it clear that the words used are in the present tense, it is also clear from the writing that the parties intended that, at least on that day “now, and . . . forever hereafter,” they were openly accepting each other as man and wife. Obviously, the “intention of the parties may not be disregarded.” <em>Brown v. Nolen, </em><a href="/pa/298/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="298 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1120347" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0384-01">298 Pa. 384</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20A.%20498" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="148 A. 498">148 A. 498</a> (1930). Both appellant and the decedent stated that the purpose of the writing was for “establishing marriage status.”</p>
    <p id="b589-6" data-blocks='[["BL_589.6",589,[164,1579,1148,319]]]'>We do not believe that the appellant’s “establishing marriage ... in order to avoid conscription for military service” renders invalid his otherwise valid common law marriage. The reason or motive underlying the decision to marry is not relevant to a finding of the <em>intention </em>to marry.</p>
    <p id="b589-7" data-blocks='[["BL_589.7",589,[164,1912,1147,373]]]'>In short, we believe that the writing is sufficiently probative to overcome the presumption that once a meretricious relationship is entered into it continues until the obstacle to a valid marriage is removed, and a valid marriage is established by clear and convincing evidence. Cf. <em>Pierce v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/355/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="355 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="468877" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0175-01">355 Pa. 175</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20346" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="49 A.2d 346">49 A. 2d 346</a> (1946).</p>
