The sole question presented is whether constitutional due process was violated at trial by the evidentiary use (over objection and after a timely motion to suppress) of oral admissions and a recorded and executed inculpatory statement given by Marabel to the police.</p>
    <p id="b469-7" data-blocks='[["BL_469.10",469,[225,1621,1051,41]]]'>The record discloses the following pertinent facts.</p>
    <p id="b469-8" data-blocks='[["BL_469.11",469,[155,1675,1147,362]]]'>On May 4, 1968, the State Liquor Store on Torres-dale Avenue in Philadelphia was robbed. Three clerks were present at the time of the robbery and their wallets were also stolen. During the perpetration of the felony, one clerk, John Bucykowski was shot by the felon and shortly thereafter died as a result of this wound.</p>
    <p id="b469-9" data-blocks='[["BL_469.12",469,[154,2056,1148,204]],["BL_470.1",470,[182,329,1153,251]]]'>Eyewitnesses at the scene of the crime ( three young girls) told the investigating officers that a new red or maroon sports car (either a Camaro or Mustang) was parked up the street from the State Liquor Store with <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>its motor running just before the crime. The witnesses also informed .the police that one occupant of this vehicle went into the store just before nine o’clock p.m., and they saw him leave the store on a run about five minutes later.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[177,602,1157,1022]]]'>The police instituted an investigation of the crime and learned that appellant was the owner of a vehicle that matched the description given by the witnesses. The police also had information, through an informer, that appellant was in some way involved in the crime. On May 6th, appellant was picked up at his home and taken to police headquarters. (The police contend that this was merely a routine investigation of all people they could locate who owned vehicles matching the description given by the eyewitnesses, and appellant was just one of many people brought in who owned new red sports cars.) Appellant was questioned for six hours about his activities on the night of the robbery murder and he was also given a polygraph test. He admitted ownership of a new sports automobile similar to the one described by the young girl eyewitnesses, but denied any knowledge of the erime. At no time on the 6th of May was appellant advised of his constitutional rights. After being detained for six hours, he was released.</p>
    <p id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[175,1633,1155,424]]]'>On May 15th, the appellant was again escorted to police headquarters. He was questioned for three hours about the “whole job”, again without being advised of his constitutional rights. He still insisted that he knew nothing about the crime, but he did tell the police that he was with George Kenney on the night of the robbery and murder. (George Kenney was the man who actually robbed the store and killed the clerk.)</p>

After extensive questioning by five officers, as well as a lie detector test, <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>he gave an oral confession and ultimately signed the written confession that is now in issue. (The police contend that the only reason he was picked up on the 17th was the result of statements that incriminated him that were taken from other people who had knowledge of the crime.)</p>

The United States Supreme Court in <em>Miranda n. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.

See <em>Commonwealth v. Sites, </em><a href="/pa/427/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="427 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1910381" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0486-01">427 Pa. 486</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20387" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="235 A.2d 387">235 A. 2d 387</a> (1967). When appellant was picked up on this occasion, the police were aware that he was the owner of an automobile matching the description given by the eyewitnesses to the felony. Moreover, an informer had apprised the police of the fact that appellant was somehow involved in the crime. With this knowledge, de<a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>spite protestations to the contrary, it is difficult to believe that .the police viewed appellant as anything other than a suspect. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Bennett, </em><a href="/pa/439/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="439 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1931046" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0034-01">439 Pa. 34</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20706" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="264 A.2d 706">264 A. 2d 706</a> (1970). In <em>Bennett, </em>the facts indicated that the police were informed 'that a man who worked on a green and white garbage truck might have been in the neighborhood on the night of the killing. The defendant was questioned on the job along with other workers, and on the following day he was taken to the police station. On these facts, we ruled that the defendant was a suspect and he was entitled to his constitutional warnings before being questioned. See also <em>Commonwealth v. Banks, </em><a href="/pa/429/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="429 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1913544" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0053-01">429 Pa. 53</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20416" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="239 A.2d 416">239 A. 2d 416</a> (1968). The same conclusion is dictated here.</p>
    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[195,1104,1155,584]]]'>The next question that must be analyzed is whether the atmosphere where appellant was questioned gave rise to “custody” or “depriving him of his freedom in any significant way.” Clearly, when questioning takes place in a police station there can be custody. See <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>supra. On the occasion under discussion, appellant was taken to a police station and questioned for a period of six hours. This is the type of atmosphere which leaves the individual questioned no freedom of choice and is inherently coercive, <em>Commonwealth v. Banks, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b472-5" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[193,1699,1156,589]]]'>An issue that is interwoven with this question is what elements must be weighed to determine if there was custody or deprivation of freedom. It has been suggested that the state of mind of the questioning officer is controlling, or the reasonable belief of the one questioned, or a straight objective test should be employed. In the instant case, appellant suggests that we employ the “objective test” as set forth in <em>United States v. Hall, </em><a href="/f2d/421/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="421 F.2d 540" data-case-ids="2156324" data-case-paths="/f2d/421/0540-01">421 F. 2d 540</a> (1969), <em>cert. denied </em><a href="/us/397/0990-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="397 U.S. 990" data-case-ids="12092747,12092796,12092839,12092904,12092950,12092975,12093025" data-case-paths="/us/397/0990-01,/us/397/0990-02,/us/397/0990-03,/us/397/0990-04,/us/397/0990-05,/us/397/0990-06,/us/397/0990-07">397 U.S. 990</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20S.%20Ct.%201123" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="90 S.

      <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>“The Court [Miranda Court] could scarcely have intended the issue whether the person being interrogated had ‘been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his liberty in any significant way’ to be decided by swearing contests in which officers would regularly maintain their lack of intention to assert power over a suspect save when the circumstances would make such a claim absurd, and defendants would assert with equal regularity that they considered themselves to be significantly deprived of their liberty the minute officers began to inquire of them . . .</p>
    <p id="b473-3" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[137,943,1149,360]]]'>“The test must be an objective one. Clearly the Court meant that <em>something </em>more than official interrogation must be shown.

State, </em><a href="/md-app/3/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="3 Md. App. 534" data-case-ids="2329721" data-case-paths="/md-app/3/0534-01">3 Md.

[T]he custody requirement of Miranda does not depend on the subjective intent of the law enforcement officer-interrogator, bujt upon whether the suspect is physically deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way or is placed in a situation in which he reasonably believes that his freedom of action or movement is restricted by such interrogation.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=240%20A.2d%20288" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="240 A.2d 288">Id.</a> </em>at , <a href="/citations/?q=240%20A.2d%20288" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="240 A.2d 288">240 A. 2d at 290</a>. The above test has the element of objectiVeness since we look at what the suspect could believe as a reasonable man, and by focusing on the suspect, compliance with the thrust of the <em>Miranda </em>decision is achieved. Under the instant facts, appellant as a reasonable man could have been led to believe that he was in custody or significantly deprived of his freedom since he was taken to a police station, detained for six hours, not told that he could see anyone, and subjected to a polygraph test. On these facts, we conclude that the appellant could reasonably believe he was in custody or at the very least deprived of his freedom.</p>

The evidence, therefore, was obtained by means “sufficiently distinguishable to purge it of the primary taint," in that the confession was not the produce of exploitation of the original illegality, but rather, the result of confronting appellant with evidence totally devoid of any illegality.

During the first interrogation the defendant admitted ownership of a vehicle which matched the description given by several eyewitnesses as involved in the crime. His attempt during this interrogation to create an alibi was frustrated when the person he said he was with on the night of the crime initially refuted <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>the story. During the second session of questioning an even more damaging admission was procured.

True, he raised no vocal objection to this, <em>but it would be quite unrealistic to believe that his actions were completely free of compulsion.” </em>(Emphasis added).

The defendant was subjected to two lengthy interrogations at the police station, one of six hours and one of three hours.

Instead the majority purports to adopt a test which looks at the objective reasonableness of the defendant’s perception. This reasonable-man test, whatever its efficacy in other areas of the law, has no relevancy to the determination of whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings should be administered. The test should not be whether a reasonable man reasonably believes that his freedom of action has been deprived, but what <em>this individual </em>reasonably believes. A subjective test of reasonableness is necessary to take <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>into account the disparate levels of sophistication and knowledge that exist within onr society.</p>

If the confession was a direct “exploitation of . . . illegality” or “the fruit of the poisonous tree” it is inadmissible. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em><a href="/us/371/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="371 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="450611" data-case-paths="/us/371/0471-01">371 U.S. 471</a>, 488, <a href="/us/371/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="371 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="450611" data-case-paths="/us/371/0471-01">83 S. Ct. 407</a>, 417 (1963) ; <em>Commonwealth v. Ware, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth v. Moody, </em>supra. Alternatively, if the psychological effects of the earlier admission or confession derived from the illegal interrogations are such that the defendant’s waiver was not knowing and intelligent, the confession is not voluntary. The vice of an earlier illegally obtained confession was cogently summarized by Justice Jackson <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>in <em>United States v. Bayer, </em><a href="/us/331/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="331 U.S. 532" data-case-ids="6158265" data-case-paths="/us/331/0532-01">331 U.S. 532</a>, 540, <a href="/us/331/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="331 U.S. 532" data-case-ids="6158265" data-case-paths="/us/331/0532-01">67 S. Ct. 1394</a>, 1398 (1947) : “[A]fter an accused has once let the cat out of the bag by confessing no matter what the inducement, he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantage of having confessed. He can never get the cat back in the bag. The secret is out for good. In such a sense a later confession always may be looked upon as fruit of the first.”</p>
    <p id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[175,763,1154,1151]]]'>The admissions made by the defendant during what the majority concedes to be illegal interrogations are clearly distinguishable from the statements made in <em>Commonwealth v. Frazier, </em>supra, relied upon by the majority. In <em>Frazier, </em>this Court found: “. . . nothing appellant said before he was warned was used to incriminate him. No other link was shown between the questioning to which appellant was subjected without warnings and his subsequent confession. . . .” Id. at 181, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%2033" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="279 A.2d 33">279 A. 2d at 35</a>. Here there is a definite link; surely the police were encouraged by the damaging statements made by defendant during the illegal interrogations. More importantly the psychological effects of the earlier admissions almost certainly vitiated any chance that defendant’s confession was voluntary. The majority agrees as it must that defendant’s statement that he was with the person known to have actually perpetrated the robbery and murder “could be viewed as a damaging admission.” On this record the majority should also concede that for all practical purposes “the cat was out of the bag.”</p>
