If appellant’s construction of the will is correct, he will receive practically the entire estate and the testatrix’s charitable intention as expressed in the residuary clause would be meaningless and ineffective. Furthermore, the testatrix specifically directed that all estate and inheritance taxes be borne by the “general estate” and all “legacies, devises and other gifts of principal and income” to her beneficiaries, be free of such taxes. Under appellant’s construction of the will, testatrix’s tax direction would be frustrated since no assets would be left to satisfy these tax obligations. To give meaning to the residuary clause and the allocation of the tax burden, appellant’s construction of the phrase “including the contents thereof, absolutely” cannot be accepted.

(1962) (per curiam). There the will left a house “together with all furnishings and all property and articles of whatsoever nature found therein” to two named beneficiaries and also created a charitable trust of the residuary estate. The named beneficiaries there, as the nephew here, claimed that the contents of the house included not only the furnishings but also United States Savings bonds which constituted a substantial part of the estate. In rejecting this claim, the Court observed: “If the dispositive provisions in respect of the house and contents in the instant will comprehend all of the testatrix’s property, another portion of her will, which manifested an intention of setting up a charitable trust, is rendered ineffective because of lack of available assets. Considering the circumstances surrounding the drafting and execution of the will : . . and reading the will in its entirety in accordance with well established canons of construction, we cannot agree that the testatrix contemplated the disposition of her entire estate to respondent thereby preventing the establishment of a charitable trust.” Id. at 417, <a href="/citations/?q=224%20N.Y.S.2d%20899" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="224 N.Y.S.2d 899">224 N.Y.S. 2d at 902-03</a>. Likewise, in the present case, the orphans’ court division properly determined that testatrix did not intend to leave her entire estate to her nephew thereby making meaningless the charitable bequests designated in her residuary clause. The court’s rejection of appellant’s interpretation of the will is clearly supported by testatrix’s expressed intent as reflected in her residuary and tax clauses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
