    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[155,566,1151,1080]]]'>The facts of the case are as follows: In 1964 Miss Marcus, then fourteen years of age, answered an advertisement placed in a local newspaper by the American Red Cross for volunteer hospital aides, commonly known as “candy-stripers”. Miss Marcus was interviewed by workers for the Red Cross; in the course of that interview she indicated her preference as a volunteer was for child service or office work. After obtaining her parents’ written permission and a certificate of good health from her family doctor, she was assigned by the Red Cross to the volunteer program conducted by Frankford Hospital. Together with other volunteers, she was given a two-day course of training and orientation by the hospital which consisted, <em>inter alia,, </em>of lectures, demonstrations in giving out meals and flowers and making beds occupied by patients, and a tour through the hospital. Under the Frankford Hospital volunteer program, aides were not permitted to work in the departments of pediatrics and obstetrics or the emergency, accident or operating rooms.</p>

On her third day of work at approximately 11:00 a.m., Miss Marcus was asked by a nurse to help her and a second nurse with an elderly male patient. Miss Marcus was asked to hold the patient up by his shoulders while the nurses washed the man and attended to his numerous bed sores. The man was unconscious and <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>completely naked, and the lower part of Ms body was covered with excrement. After she had been in attendance for several minutes, Miss Marcus began to feel nauseated and told one of the nurses that she did not feel well; shortly thereafter she fainted and in falling struck her face against an oxygen tank, lacerating her nostril and suffering a compound comminuted fracture of her nose.</p>
    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[184,776,1154,629]]]'>Plaintiff was operated on at the hospital by Dr. Large, a plastic surgeon on the hospital staff, and remained hospitalized for four days. For a period of three months thereafter, she felt unable to go out in public because of the bulbous condition of her nose. Plaintiff was discharged from the operating physician’s care in January, 1965, at which time, according to Dr. Large’s testimony, there was no residual deformity. At the time of trial, some four years after the accident, there was a small scar on plaintiff’s right nostril; Dr. Large testified that he believed the sear would disappear in time.</p>
    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[183,1427,1154,420]]]'>The present suit was brought by the minor plaintiff through her parents and by her parents in their own right.

L. 736, Art. I, §104, as amended, 77 P.S. <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>§22,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and therefore is limited to the remedies set forth in that Act. To establish that the minor plaintiff was an “employee” of the defendant it is necessary to establish that she performed her services “for a valuable consideration”. As a matter of common sense Miss Marcus’ status as a volunteer aide, a characterization which appellant accepts, would seem to belie the contention that she was an employee performing services for valuable consideration. In opposition to this position, however, the Hospital cites the fact that during her service as a volunteer, Miss Marcus was entitled to receive free meals in the Hospital cafeteria, a privilege of which she availed herself on one occasion. In our view, the privilege of receiving such meals on the premises of the Hospital was no more than a nominal gratuity extended by the Hospital incidental to plaintiff’s services. It does not amount to “valuable consideration” within the meaning of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. See e.g., <em>Brook v. Bowser, </em><a href="/pa/376/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="376 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1246177" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0209-01">376 Pa. 209</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.2d%20121" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="102 A.2d 121">102 A. 2d 121</a> (1954); <em>Harris v.

There is no evidence, however, that the plaintiff received any training other than that minimal instruction in hospital procedures which was necessary to enable her to perform her volunteer duties properly. We cannot find that the court below erred in <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>holding that Miss Marcus was not an “employee” within the meaning of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.</p>
    <p id="b244-4" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[188,442,1154,1348]]]'>Appellant urges, alternatively, that its motion for judgment n.o.v. should have been granted because, as a matter of law, it was not negligent; it was not negligent, it says, because it owed no duty of care to Rochelle Marcus. We disagree. Although, as we have determined, Rochelle was not an employee within the meaning of the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act, she nevertheless stood in the position of servant to the Hospital. It is conceded she was subject to the control and direction of appellant, acting through its nursing staff. In situations where, as here, the Compensation Act is not applicable, it continues to be the law that, within certain limitations not here relevant, a master owes a duty not to subject its servants to unreasonable risks of harm, and incurs a common law liability if the duty is breached.

As to this, it is sufficient to note that plaintiff testified without contradiction that her training was specifically designed to enable her to make beds with patients in them in a manner which would preclude the exposure of the patients. Neither that training nor plaintiff’s previous experience in the surgical wards would have indicated to plaintiff that she would be asked to assist in activities of the sort which precipitated her fainting spell nor was there evidence that plaintiff could or should have known what her reaction would be to her experience with the elderly patient.

First, even before appellee ivas assigned by the Red Cross to Frankford Hospital, she was examined by a family doctor and granted written permission by her parents. At the hospital, as the opinion in support of the order observes, “she was given a two-day course of training and orientation by the hospital which consisted, inter alia, of lectures, demonstrations in giving out meals and floAvers and <em>making beds occupied by patients, </em>and a <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>tour through the hospital.” (Emphasis added.)

There is also no reason why appellee should recover in the present case where she was asked to assist in the cleaning of a patient. While the exposure may have been unpleasant, the likelihood of equally unpleasant exposures would have existed whenever appellee changed an occupied bed.
