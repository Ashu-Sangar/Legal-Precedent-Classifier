Brletich, is the appellant here and was plaintiff below in this trespass action against United States Steel Corporation, defendant-appellee (Steel), for personal injuries suffered by him while working on Steel’s Donora property as an employee of Luria Brothers &amp; Company, Inc. (Luria). Luria was there as demolition contractor under certain agreements with Steel. Luria subcontracted with D. J. Betters Truck &amp; Salvage (Betters) to provide a crane and operator in connection with demolition of an ore trestle. It was the conduct of Betters’ crane operator in this trestle demolition that caused appellant’s injuries.</p>

Bet<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>ters brought Luria into that suit as additional defendant on the ground that a Luria employee’s negligence was responsible for the injuries. The other suit, the one before us was a separate suit by appellant against Steel charging Steel with certain responsibilities as land owner or possessor including alleged duties of care as to appellant despite the contract with appellant’s employer, Luria. Steel brought Luria and Betters into this case as additional defendants. Both suits were consolidated for trial, but appellant settled with Betters for $39,000, and gave Betters a joint tort feasor’s release.</p>
    <p id="b559-3" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[137,1004,1150,588]]]'>This case (the one that originated against Steel), was tried to a jury. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge entered a compulsory nonsuit in favor of Steel. The case against Luria and Betters were submitted to the jury, resulting in a joint verdict by the jury against Luria and Betters for $165,000. Appellant-plaintiff’s motion to remove the nonsuit was refused, and Luria’s and its insurance carrier’s motions for a new trial, and Luria’s motion for judgment n.o.v., were dismissed by a court <em>en banc. </em>This appeal questions the propriety of the nonsuit and the refusal to take it off.</p>
    <p id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[135,1604,1151,632]]]'>The two relevant contracts between Steel and Luria provide for the dismantling of the trestle and for the sale to Luria of certain material therefrom. Both contracts provided that Luria was to be responsible for the proper performance of the work and for insuring the safety of all persons who might enter upon the premises, including the contractor’s employees. The contracts further require that the work to be performed was subject to the inspection and approval of Steel’s designated engineer, but that such inspection and approval would not relieve Luria of its responsibility to properly perform the work.</p>

On the date of the accident, appellant’s supervisor, also a Luria employee, assigned him to a crew that was dismantling the trestle. The crew consisted of an employee of Betters, who operated a mobile crane; appellant, who was assigned by his supervisor to work on the trestle; and a third employee, also Luria’s, who stood on the ground and acted in response to signals received from appellant. In dismantling the trestle, employees, known as “burners”, burned through the beams in order to reduce them to segments 22 feet long. A little piece of each steel beam would be left to steady the cut beam. The appellant’s job, which he performed pursuant to instructions from his (Luria’s) sujjervisor, was to attach a single sling in the middle of the beam, after which appellant would move away and signal the crane operator who would then lift the beam from the trestle and lower it to the ground.</p>

First, and principally, appellant theorizes that while he may not have been able to show actual control over the operation by Steel, he could present evidence from which the jury could infer the existence of a duty owing by Steel to appellant which was breached by Steel. This alleged duty, appellant argues, grows out of Steel’s alleged power to take from Luria the control of the premises. This power could be exercised on the basis of inspections which Steel was permitted to make. Appellant argues from this that Steel retained and had <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>a duty to exercise responsibility for the safety of Luria’s employees, notwithstanding the agreement to the contrary which put this burden of care solely upon Luria. In short, appellant urges us to hold that an owner or possessor of land who commits his premises to an independent contractor may not, even by contract, free himself from a continuing duty to be responsible for the safety of the contractor’s employees. lie contends that, at least in this case, the holding he seeks is warranted and that he should have been permitted to go to the jury on certain liability theories based upon the provisions of Sections 318, 343 and 344 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

We cannot agree with either <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>contention. We find that <em>Hader </em>is neither overruled by <em>Glass, </em>nor distinguishable, and note that <em>Fisher </em>has since been reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> specifically on the ground that <em>Hader </em>expressed the law of Pennsylvania and that, in a case likes this one, <em>Glass </em>was readily distinguishable. In <em>Fisher, </em>as here, it was contended that the presence of the defendant’s resident engineer at the site “who had authority to require the contractor’s compliance with a safety plan”, assisted by two inspectors, put the defendant in possession within the meaning of Restatement Section 318, and subject to the obligations of possessors of land, as this section was “adopted as law and applied by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Glass v. Freeman, <a href="/pa/430/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="430 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1915734" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0021-01">430 Pa. 21</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=240%20A.2d%20825" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="240 A.2d 825">240 A. 2d 825</a> (1968).” In reversing, the Circuit Court stated: “The law of Pennsylvania makes it clear that one who employs an independent contractor may also employ a person to ascertain that the work is done according to plans and specifications and that the employment of such a person in no way indicates that the independent contractor is being subjected to control.

This is a corollary to the long recognized general right of inspection and supervision that an owner normally enjoys and exercises to insure his receiving from the contractor the benefit or total performance bargained for.

Freeman, supra. There the court recognized that supervision by the owner-possessor of the land was especially called for because an amateur work group had been assembled and such a temporary group could not be expected to supervise its own project as a professional contractor might.
