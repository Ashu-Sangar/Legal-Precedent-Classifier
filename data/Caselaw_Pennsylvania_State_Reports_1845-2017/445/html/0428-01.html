Emrick (father), were married in 1946 and five children were born of that marriage. Unfortunately, difficulties arose between the parties and the marriage was eventually terminated by a Nevada divorce decree in 1960. An agreement between the parties, incorporated into the divorce decree, pertinently provided:</p>
    <p id="b461-11" data-blocks='[["BL_461.15",461,[142,1903,1148,428]]]'>“5. [The father] is hereby ordered to pay [the mother] for the support and maintenance of the said minor children, the sum of Seventy ($70.00) Dollars per month, per child, the first of which monthly payments shall be made on January 1, 1961, and to continue with regard to each child until he or she reaches the age of 21 years, married, [sic] dies, or is proved by [the father] to be self-supporting.</p>

    <p id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[178,669,1154,372]]]'>Pursuant to this decree and agreement, the father paid $350.00 per month, without default, until two of these children reached twenty-one. Although he is presently paying $210.00 per month as support for the three minor children, the father has refused to pay the educational expenses of two children currently enrolled in different colleges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

    <p id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[175,1055,1156,483]]]'>The mother sought to enforce this agreement and a hearing was held. While the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Family Division, ordered the continued payment of $210.00 per month, that court dismissed the mother’s claim for educational expenses. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed per curiam over the dissenting opinion of two judges. <em>Emrick v. Emrick, <a href="/pa-super/218/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="218 Pa.

Despite the fact that he has had no children by his second marriage, the father’s counsel stated that, “[the father] has not been able to accumulate any savings [or] put away anything for his old age or retirement.” On the other hand, the father’s income has risen since the date of the Nevada decree.</p>

While the support order might be challenged on this theory alone, the parties’ support agreement provides a sounder basis for the conclusion we reach. Indeed, the Superior Court has indicated that the above statement of the law does not apply where there is an agreement between the parties. <em>E.g., Com. ex rel. Smith v.

    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[151,1398,1147,763]]]'>By the terms of the agreement and decree, the father was bound “to provide a four-year college education for each of said children, if commensurate with his ability to provide the same. ...” It is our opinion that the father is able to pay some portion, if not all, of his children’s educational expenses. The father was previously able to pay $350.00 per month when his income was smaller and there is no evidence of an adverse change of circumstances. Moreover, his obligation to support the minor children has decreased by $140.00 per month, thereby increasing his ability to pay educational expenses. Whether the father’s financial ability is greater than that figure can only be determined after another evidentiary hearing.</p>
