One of the boys was introduced to her as Johnny Johnson. After the introduction, some of the boys obtained a bottle of wine and went into an old house on Bonsall Street.</p>

With John Johnson holding her by both wrists, the two boys carried complainant through the alley to a back door. Despite complainant’s demands that the boys let her go, she was grabbed again by John Johnson and dragged into the house.</p>

At the top of the stairs, complainant attempted to get back down, but her way was blocked by the other boy. At this point one of the boys other than John Johnson ripped the bottom of complainant’s dress off. Complainant was then taken into a back room where some members of the group ripped off her remaining clothes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

She testified that she tried to get away from the boys, but that some of them were holding her down. She testified that John Johnson told her to hold still and promised her one of his sister’s dresses if she stopped fighting and trying to get away. She testified that she could see John Johnson inside the house.by means of the light shining through the window of the house.</p>

    <p id="b307-4" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[170,773,1152,1078]]]'>Appellant’s questioning of the definiteness, consistency and reliability of complainant’s identification testimony is more troublesome. Complainant could remember the names of none of her attackers except that of John Johnson, and one of the reasons that appellant’s name became fixed in her mind was that while she was being attacked, several of her assailants stated that they were “not” John Johnson. Additionally, complainant could remember nothing specific about petitioner’s appearance on the night in question, despite the fact that three witnesses, including one policeman, testified that petitioner had his arm in a cast on the night of the alleged rape. In fact, complainant testified that John Johnson used both hands to carry her through the alley to the back of the house. Nevertheless, keeping in mind the trauma likely to be generated by the gang rape and by recounting tbe rape in open court, we cannot say as a matter of law that the hearing judge could not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that John Johnson raped complainant.</p>
