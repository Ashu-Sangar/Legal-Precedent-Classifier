        "text": "Opinion by\nMu. Justice Jones,\nHelen McGreevy (decedent), an Allegheny County resident, died intestate on August 17, 1967, and letters of administration in her estate were issued to Jane E. Byrnes (appellant), decedent\u2019s sister and sole heir at law.\nDecedent for some years had been mentally incompetent and appellant had been acting as guardian of her estate. For many years decedent had been \u00e9ntitled to monthly disability retirement annuity benefits paid by the United States Civil Service Commission under the provisions of an Act of Congress providing for retirement of civil service employees. These retirement annuity benefits due and owing to decedent during her lifetime had been paid to appellant as decedent\u2019s guardian.\nAppellant, as personal representative of decedent\u2019s estate, filed an account in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County, which showed a balance of $6,655.92. By stipulation between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and appellant, the appellant was permitted to pay decedent\u2019s funeral bill and the costs of a marker, leaving a balance of $5,395.92 in the account for distribution.\nFor over twenty-nine years the decedent had been a patient in the Mayview State Hospital and her care and maintenance at such institution was paid by the Commonwealth. At the audit of the account, the Commonwealth presented a claim in the amount of $28,-413.56 for such past care and maintenance of decedent. Appellant resisted payment of the Commonwealth\u2019s claim in reliance on section 8346(a) of the federal statute, supra, which states: \u201cThe money mentioned by this subchapter is not assignable, either in law or equity, or subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.\u201d The auditing judge disallowed the Commonwealth\u2019s claim and awarded the balance of the estate to appellant as the sole heir and next of kin of decedent. Exceptions were filed by the Commonwealth and the court en banc unanimously sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s exceptions, allowed the claim of the Commonwealth and directed payment of the account balance ($5,395.92) to the Commonwealth. From that decree the instant appeal was taken.\nThe sole question at issue is: are monies derived by a decedent\u2019s estate from monthly disability retirement annuity benefits paid, during decedent\u2019s lifetime, to her guardian by the United States Civil Service Commission exempt from the Commonwealth\u2019s claim for the cost of decedent\u2019s care and maintenance at a state institution?\nThe question as posed is one of first impression in the Commonwealth although there is case law interpreting somewhat similar provisions of other federal statutes.\nA reading of \u00a78346(a), supra, reveals a Congressional intent to protect the monthly retirement annuity payments from assignment, execution, levy, attachment, garnishment or other legal process until the funds reach the hands of the recipients. The rationale of Stein\u2019s Case, 118 Pa. Superior Ct. 549, 180 A. 577 (1935) is most apposite to the problem in the case at bar: \u201cHowever, the general rule is that language relating to exemptions is to be strictly construed: [citing an authority]. Nor do we question the power of Congress to protect pension money, and make it inaccessible to the payment of attorney\u2019s fees, or exempt it from seizure by creditors, under our state laws, until it shall have passed into the hands of the pensioner: [citing an authority]. But the laws and regulations relating thereto do not apply to money after it has passed into the hands of the beneficiary. The weight of authority sustains the proposition that when the transmission of pension money is ended, and the pensioner or his guardian has received it, the government\u2019s authority ceases.\u201d (p. 553). Stein\u2019s Case was upheld in Hines v. Stein, 298 U.S. 94, 56 S. Ct. 699 (1938) wherein, inter alia, the Court stated: \u201cNothing brought to our attention would justify the view that Congress intended to deprive state courts of their usual authority over fiduciaries, or to sanction the promulgation of rules to that end by executive officers or bureaus.\u201d (298 U.S. at p. 98). See also: McIntosh v. Aubrey, 185 U.S. 122, 125, 22 S. Ct. 561 (1902).\nWe hold that once the monthly retirement annuity benefits reached the hands of her guardian the exemption provisions of \u00a78346(a), supra, ceased to control the ultimate disposition of the payments received. The essential equity of so holding is clearly illustrated in the case at bar. For upwards of 29 years the Commonwealth cared for and maintained the decedent in one of its institutions and assumed and performed sole responsibility during this period of time for the welfare of the incompetent. For the expenses and costs involved in the assumption of such responsibility the Commonwealth is clearly entitled to be paid.\nJones Estate, 15 Fiduc. Rep. 397 (1965) and Kauffeld Estate, 20 Fiduc. Rep. 612 (1970), relied upon by appellant, to the extent that such decisions conflict with the instant holding are overruled. Beall Estate, 384 Pa. 14, 119 A. 2d 216 (1956) is clearly inapposite.\nDecree affirmed. Appellant pay costs.\nMr. Justice Eagen concurs in the result.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell, Mr. Justice Roberts and Mr. Justice Barbieri took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nPub. L 89-554, September 6, 1966. 80 Stat. 557, 5 U.S.C. Chapter 83, \u00a7\u00a78301-8848, incl.\nThe funds in Stein\u2019s Oase were paid by the Veterans\u2019 Administration to the guardian of the estate of an incompetent.\nCf. Department of Public Assistance v. Engell, 6 Pa. D. & C. 2d 563 (1956) ; Commonwealth v. Garlick, 26 Pa. D. & C. 2d 389 (1961).",
