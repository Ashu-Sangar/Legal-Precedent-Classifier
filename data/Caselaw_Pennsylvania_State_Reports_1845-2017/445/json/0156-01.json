        "text": "Dissenting Opinion\nby Mr. Justice Roberts :\nI must dissent.\nAppellant Wilbur Allen was convicted of the unlawful sale and possession of narcotics following trial by jury. Post-trial motions were argued and denied, and on June 13, 1969, appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of from 5 to 10 years. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence, we granted allocatur, and this appeal followed.\nAs aptly summarized in Judge Hoffman\u2019s dissenting opinion in the Superior Court, Commonwealth v. Allen, 216 Pa. Superior Ct. 228, 229, 263 A. 2d 775 (1970): \u201cThe evidence upon which appellant was convicted consisted of the testimony of one witness, the buyer of the narcotic drugs. She testified as to a series of transactions between appellant and her, in which she exchanged various sums of money for quantities of heroin and cocaine. These transactions involved only the two parties. No other parties, agents, [or] witnesses were involved. Appellant neither presented witnesses of his own nor took the stand to testify in his own behalf.\u201d\nIn the course of the district attorney\u2019s closing argument to the jury, appellant\u2019s counsel objected as follows : \u201cI would like on the record, your Honor, that my recollection is that the district attorney twice said in his closing argument that the Commonwealth\u2019s case was uncontradicted. ... I think the . . . statements were a violation of Griffeth [sic] vs. California, in that they were an adverse comment on the taking of the Fifth Amendment . . . .\u201d I must agree with appellant\u2019s counsel.\nAppellant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination is secured by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, by Article I, Section 9, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and by the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, \u00a710, 19 P.S. \u00a7631, which provides: \u201c. . . nor may the neglect or refusal of any defendant, actually upon trial in a criminal court, to offer himself as a witness be treated as creating any presumption against him, or be adversely referred to by court or counsel during the trial.\u201d\nThis Court has held on a number of occasions that a statement to the jury that the Commonwealth\u2019s case is uncontradicted is not reversible error. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Bolish, 381 Pa. 500, 522, 113 A. 2d 464, 475 (1955). It is equally settled, however, that any comment would violate the Act of 1887 if it \u201cdraws attention to or focuses on the fact that no one except the defendant can rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s case . . . .\u201d Commonwealth v. Reichard, 211. Pa. Superior Ct. 55, 58, 233 A. 2d 603, 604 (1967). Moreover, as the Fifth Amendment is now applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489 (1964), this matter must now be resolved in light of federal standards, and our pre-Hogan decisions are no longer necessarily controlling.\nThe seminal federal decision in this area is, of course, Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229 (1965), proscribing adverse comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in his own behalf. Upon the present record, I believe that the prosecutorial comment about the \u201cuncontradicted\u201d nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s case runs directly afoul of the Griffin prohibition.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s sole witness, a convicted possessor of narcotic drugs who was serving a prison sentence at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, was the alleged purchaser of appellant\u2019s drug sales. She testified that she purchased cocaine and heroin from appellant on several occasions. It does not appear that anyone else was present at the time of the transactions. Thus, under the Commonwealth\u2019s factual theory, appellant was the only person who could have rebutted her testimony. Accordingly, the district attorney\u2019s argument to the jury that the Commonwealth\u2019s case was uncontradicted was virtually tantamount to a comment concerning appellant\u2019s failure to offer himself as a witness at trial. In these circumstances, such a statement would reasonably and naturally invite the jury to draw an adverse inference from appellant\u2019s failure to testify.\nThe Court\u2019s per curiam order of affirmance in this appeal cites our recent decision in Commonwealth v. Camm, 443 Pa. 253, 277 A. 2d 325 (1971), which also involved a prosecutor\u2019s comment upon an accused\u2019s silence at trial. Inasmuch as the comment at issue in Camm was held to be \u201charmless error\u201d, one can only suppose that the present majority believes that this case likewise presents an instance of harmless error. 1 cannot agree.\nEven assuming that Camm was correctly decided, a view which I do not share, that case is clearly distinguishable. Writing for a majority of the Court in Camm, Justice Pomeroy noted that \u201cThe assistant district attorney\u2019s statement . . . must be viewed in light of the fact that here the defendant was in fact a witness, even though for a limited purpose. The only ground on which Camm could have been acquitted was not evidence of his innocence, for there was none, but a finding that the confession was involuntary. The facts stated in the confession, while subject to disbelief by the jury, were not put in issue in any way, and there was damaging circumstantial evidence in the form of a witness\u2019 testimony which was corroborative of the confession.\u201d Id. at 269, 277 A. 2d at 333.\nThe instant case contains a much different aggregation of incriminating evidence. Appellant had not confessed nor was there any other circumstantial evidence of his guilt. Rather, the Commonwealth\u2019s entire case rested upon the word of a convicted felon. Had any of the jurors harbored any doubt as to her credibility, tbe balance might have very well tipped by virtue of the district attorney\u2019s indirect reference to appellant\u2019s apparent unwillingness to testify. In these circumstances, I fail to see how we can declare a belief that those unconstitutional references were \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 828 (1967).\nMr. Justice Eagen and Mr. Justice O\u2019Beibn join in this dissent.\nSee Commonwealth v. Camm, 443 Pa. 253, 274, 277 A. 2d 325, 336 (1971) (Mr. Justice EagRn and Mr. Justice Roberts, dissenting).",
