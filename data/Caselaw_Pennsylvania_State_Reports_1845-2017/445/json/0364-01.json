        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nAppellant was found guilty by a jury of first-degree murder and aggravated robbery. After being sentenced to life imprisonment, he bings this appeal.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s principal direct evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt consists of his very detailed confession and it is the admission of this confession which appellant challenges now as he previously did in filing a pretrial petition to suppress evidence and in filing post-trial motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, all of which were denied. The facts surrounding the receipt of this confession are as follows:\nAppellant was picked up in New Jersey on a parole violation. Two detectives from the Philadelphia police, who had been looking for appellant as the result of the identification of a photograph of him by an eyewitness to the robbery of Charles Tovsky\u2019s grocery store and the shooting of Mr. Tovsky, went to the homicide section of the Newark police department upon news of appellant\u2019s arrest. Immediately upon first contact with the Philadelphia detectives, appellant was given his Miranda warnings. Later the same day, a third detective brought a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest for homicide, which warrant had been issued in Philadelphia.\nAppellant was questioned by the Philadelphia detectives in the Newark station from 12:50 p.m. to 1:50 p.m., and from 2:15 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Some time during that period, appellant made an oral confession. Appellant was again questioned, starting at 4:00 p.m., and, after again receiving Miranda warnings, appellant signed a typed, formal statement.\nAppellant first argues that Ms confessions should not have been admitted into evidence because his original arrest by the Newark police department was without probable cause. However, even if the arrest by the Newark police was illegal, a question we cannot determine on this record, the evidence complained of here did not come as the \u201cfruit\u201d of any such illegality, but was instead obtained \u201cby means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the [alleged] primary taint.\u201d Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, at 488 (1963) ; Bowlen v. Scafati, 395 F. 2d 692, 693 (1st Cir. 1968. See Commonwealth v. Moody, 429 Pa. 39, 44-45, 239 A. 2d 409 (1968) ; Commonwealth v. Bishop, 425 Pa. 175, 182-184, 228 A. 2d 661 (1967). Here, there is no doubt that the Philadelphia police independently had probable cause to arrest appellant. Consequently, even if appellant had shown that his arrest by the Newark police was illegal, any illegality which may have attached to this arrest in no way tainted his confession.\nAppellant next argues that the admission of his confession would deprive Mm of due process because the police allegedly failed to inform him of the crime with which he was charged at the time he was given Miranda warnings. Relevant to this contention, two separate points need be made, both of which prevent appellant from bringing the situation within the principles enunciated by three Justices of this Court in Commonwealth v. Collins, 436 Pa. 114, 259 A. 2d 160 (1969). First, this allegation was not raised in the court below, and so cannot be raised initially at this time. Second, the facts show that appellant was fully aware of the charges against him, and why he was being questioned. He did not mistakenly think he was about to be questioned concerning another offense. In such circumstances, he cannot establish that his waiver of counsel and the privilege against self-incrimination was not intelligently made.\nAppellant also contends that the court erroneously admitted hearsay testimony against him. This allegation concerns the testimony of Lucille Fields, who lived within a block of the victim\u2019s store. She testified that she saw appellant approximately fifteen minutes before she heard from her father that Charles Tovsky had been shot. Appellant contends that this was hearsay. We disagree. It was not offered to prove the truth asserted by the out-of-court declarant, her father. The hearsay rule has no application where the question is whether certain things were said or Avritten by a third person and not whether they are true. See Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence, \u00a7441, pages 434-435.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eagbn concurs in the result.",
