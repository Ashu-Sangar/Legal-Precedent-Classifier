        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Roberts,\nProtesting shareholders and directors of the Reading Company have attempted to enjoin the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company and the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company from voting their Reading shares and otherwise mismanaging the Reading Company. They also sought an accounting with respect to various intercorporate transactions between the B&O, C&O and Reading which assertedly resulted in loss or injury to the latter. The protestors were successfully halted by preliminary Objections, and the validity of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of their complaint is now before our Court.\nTwo principal issues are presented in this appeal: whether the protesting shareholders possess standing under Rule 1506 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure to obtain relief for defendants\u2019 alleged violation of their corporate fiduciary duties and whether any or all of the subject matter of this equity action is more properly within the exclusive or primary jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. We affirm the chancellor\u2019s decree dismissing the complaint.\nBackground\nThe parities have stipulated some of the pertinent facts, and others are of public record. The relevant corporate structures are both important and complex. Pursuant to the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 899, 49 U.S.C. \u00a71 et seq., the C&O and the B&O presented a plan to the Interstate Commerce Commission whereby the C&O was to acquire capital stock control of the B&O. The proposed affiliation was determined by the Commission to be consistent with the public interest, Chesapeake & Ohio Ry.\u2014Control\u2014Baltimore & Ohio R. R., 317 I.C.C. 261 (1962), and appropriate judicial tribunals have concluded .that the Commission\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence. See Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees v. United States, 221 F. Supp. 19 (1963), aff'd, 375 U.S. 236, 84 S. Ct. 341 (1963) (per curiam). Thus, since 1963 the C&O has controlled the B&O.\nThe B&O has been a substantial stockholder of the Reading Company since 1902. As of December 7, 1904, the B&O owned 23.66% of Reading\u2019s outstanding shares. B&O\u2019s buying program continued, and by November 1.8, 1963, the B&O controlled 49.92% of Reading. Since 3S65, B&O\u2019s proportional share of control has been reduced to 38.26%.\nThe instant litigation originated on May 24, 1965, with the filing of a complaint in equity in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas by seven Reading shareholders and directors naming the B&O, C&O, and Reading as defendants. The C&O filed preliminary objections asserting the court lacked proper jurisdiction in that the C&O owned no track or other real estate and operated no trains or other facilities within Pennsylvania. The Reading demurred and also objected to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, contending, inter alia, that the ICC possessed primary jurisdiction over this litigation. The B&O challenged the specificity of the pleadings, asserted plaintiffs had no standing, and asked the complaint be dismissed because of laches.\nWithout passing on the other objections, the chancellor sustained Reading\u2019s and B&O\u2019s demurrers on January 17, 1967, because of a failure to sufficiently distinguish between a derivative and a representative cause of action.\nAn amended complaint was filed by two of the original plaintiffs and one new plaintiff (hereinafter termed \u201cappellants\u201d) on August 21, 1967. In it, appellants contend they are bringing the action \u201c.. . derivately [sic], in behalf of themselves and all other stockholders of Reading similarly situated.\u201d They allege that the C&O owns 10.71% of the Reading and that thus the C&O, through the B&O\u2019s 38.26% share of the stock, controls approximately 49% of Reading\u2019s outstanding voting shares. It is averred that the B&O and C&O have . . improperly and illegally maintained and exercised control of Reading.\u201d Appellants also stated that Reading owns 48.97% of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey. They assert C&O owns 2.3% of Jersey Central, and through its control of Reading dominates the affairs of Jersey Central as well. Appellants claim that this pyramid and concentration of control has allegedly been employed by C&O and B&O to the disadvantage of Reading and Jersey Central. Nine specific transactions are listed being in furtherance of what amounted to a \u201cplan or design\u201d and an \u201cimproper conspiracy\u201d of mismanagement on the part of B&O and C&O, the substance of which will be detailed below.\nThe Reading and the B&O renewed their preliminary objections, raising, inter alia, issues of jurisdiction, improper addition of a party, and lack of capacity to sue. A separate petition to dismiss was filed by the B&O asserting the ICC had primary jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 action.\nOn March 29,1968, the chancellor wrote to the General Counsel of the ICC and requested an amicus brief concerning the Commission\u2019s view of its exclusive or primary jurisdiction over the issues in this litigation. The Deputy General Counsel responded in a letter detailing the Commission\u2019s position. Counsel for all litigants were then invited to submit their comments.\nFinally, on January 10, 1969, the chancellor sustained the preliminary objections concerning the primary jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission and appellant\u2019s standing to sue. Otherwise, the preliminary objections were not decided. The amended complaint was dismissed without prejudice to another complaint being filed in accordance with the chancellor\u2019s opinion issued that same day. Our review is limited to the chancellor\u2019s ruling, and we do not here consider the respective merits of the preliminary objections expressly left undecided.\nThe Amended Complaint\nAs will become evident, there is little disagreement in this litigation concerning the applicable principles of law. Rather the dispute centers on the nature of the amended complaint. Appellants urge they are not attacking the legality of the acquisition of control of Reading by B&O and C&O but only the improper and unlawful manner in which the control is being exercised to Reading\u2019s disadvantage. The railroads counter that the gist of the amended complaint is the existence of a conspiracy to effectuate a merger of Reading and Jersey Central into the C&O and B&O system at depressed merger values\u2014an issue purportedly within the primary jurisdiction of the ICC. Thus, prior to investigating either appellants\u2019 standing or the IOC\u2019s primary jurisdiction, we must examine the amended complaint in some detail.\nThe perimeters of the complaint have already been noted, and we now turn to the nine specific acts of mismanagement set forth in section 12 of the bill.\nParagraphs 12(a)-(d) recount four alleged incidences of improper control concerning Reading\u2019s interest in the Philadelphia Perishable Products Company, an enterprise which operated a warehouse and terminal facilities for the handling of produce shipped to Philadelphia by rail. In 1931, the C&O and B&O purportedly caused Reading to enter into an agreement with the B&O concerning a division of expenses incurred in running Perishable Products whereby Reading shouldered more than its fair share of the costs. Then in 1953, appellees supposedly compelled Reading to grant an option to purchase 611,049 square feet of the Perishable Products terminal to a B&O subsidiary at a price that was assertedly one half of the terminal\u2019s fair market value. Next, in 1961 the C&O and B&O allegedly engineered a plan pursuant to which the Reading permitted the B&O to move its terminal agent\u2019s office force from Pier 24 in Philadelphia to the Perishable Products terminal where they obtained rent-free office space, even though rent-paying tenants were displaced. Finally, some time in 1963 the C&O and B&O supposedly caused Reading to transfer its interest in Perishable Products to the B&O for a \u201cgrossly inadequate consideration.\u201d\nIn paragraph 12(e) it is averred that the C&O and B&O effectuated the sale of a number of rehabilitated box cars by Reading Dispatch, Inc., a Reading Company subsidiary, to Railease, a C&O subsidiary, for inadequate consideration. The cars were then leased to B&O for a term of fifteen years.\nThe next paragraph in the complaint (12(f)) asserts that in June, 1964, appellees made Reading lease a number of used hopper cars to the B&O \u201c. . . on terms and conditions which were arbitrarily arrived at rather than through arms length negotiations. . . .\u201d\nIn 12(g) appellants complain that at some unspecified time the C&O and B&O wrongfully compelled Reading to lease a large amount of railroad equipment from \u2022the B&O at exorbitant rents even though Reading had no bona fide need for the equipment.\nParagraph 12(h) states that up until March 22, 1967, appellees brought about the negligent, wasteful, and improper management of Jersey Central in order to acquire that foundering railroad for \u201clittle or no consideration.\u201d It is also alleged that Jersey Central has had to file a petition for reorganization pursuant to section 77(b) of the Bankruptcy Act.\nFinally, in paragraph 12(i) appellants claim that in July, 1967, appellees wrongfully caused Beading to reject a merger proposal tendered by the Pennsylvania and the New York Central Railroads even though the proposal was purportedly more favorable to Beading than the one propounded by the C&O and B&O system.\nBy reason of these acts of mismanagement, appellants demand that B&O and C&O be enjoined from voting their Beading shares, continuing the mismanagement of Beading, and misusing Reading\u2019s corporate assets. An accounting is also requested.\nStanding\nThe parties have stipulated that the earliest acquisition of shares by any of the appellants was on April 1, 1964. The issue becomes whether appellants possess adequate standing to challenge the acts of mismanagement alleged in their amended complaint.\nAppellants\u2019 principal hurdle is Rule 1506 of the Pennsylvania Buies of Civil Procedure. A two-pronged argument was pressed before the chancellor. First, appellants urged that the Act of August 27, 1963, P. L. 1355, \u00a71, 15 P.S. \u00a71516A superseded the Rule. Secondly it was contended that the 1963 Act did not apply to the instant litigation as the Act related only to actions against an officer or a director of a corporation.\nThe chancellor disagreed and ruled that the 1963 Act did not govern railroads, because the Act was part of the Business Corporation Law, which specifically does not apply to . . any corporation incorporated for the purpose of acting as a railroad as defined in the Public Utility Law.\u201d See Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, Art. I, \u00a74, as amended, 15 P.S. \u00a71004B(2) (ii). Rule 1506 was thus deemed controlling.\nAppellants now contend that regardless of the correctness of the chancellor\u2019s reasoning as to the applicability of Rule 1506, they have sufficiently satisfied the rule\u2019s requirements to enable them to maintain this equity action. They urge that compliance with the rule is to be found in the allegation of a continuing conspiracy. We disagree.\nThe Act of April 18, 1945, P. L. 253, No. 114, \u00a71, 15 P.S. \u00a7432 began the process of bringing Pennsylvania into line with the federal practice. The 1945 Act applied to derivative suits \u201cagainst any officer, or director, or former officer or director of a corporation, domestic or foreign\u201d, and was duplicated in the Act of August 27, 1963, supra.\nAppellants argued before the chancellor that since the present litigation was not against an officer or director, the statutes had no application here. However, they also maintained the 1963 Act superseded Eule 1506.\nThe chancellor properly ruled that if the 1945 Act was read to permit appellants to maintain the present litigation notwithstanding the issue of the timely acquisition of shares, it would be inconsistent with Eule 1506. Since the latter became effective in 1952, if supersedes the 1945 Act. See Act of June 21, 1937, P. L. 1982, No. 392, \u00a71, as amended, 17 P.S. \u00a761; Schofield Discipline Case, 362 Pa. 201, 66 A. 2d 675 (1949) ; Lojeski v. Quirk, 202 Pa. Superior Ct. 471, 198 A. 2d 410 (1964). As noted above appellants\u2019 contentions concerning the 1963 Act are equally unavailing, since the Act does not apply to railroads. Hence Eule 1506 clearly controls.\nThe underlying rationale of Buie 1506 has been well summarized: \u201cOwnership at the time of the transaction complained of is a safeguard against speculation in corporate causes of action and is designed to remove the incentive to champerty and maintenance. It also seems to be a sound and wholesome principle of equity, for it prevents persons who have not been harmed from receiving a windfall.\u201d G-oodrich-Amram, Standard Pennsylvania Practice, \u00a71506-4.\nBy its terms, the rule requires that each plaintiff be a shareholder at the time of the occurrence of the challenged transaction. The chancellor correctly ruled that paragraphs 12(a)-(e) failed to satisfy the rule, for appellant Walter E. Schoenfeld did not acquire his shares until September 24, 1964. Appellants attempt to surmount this difficulty by an allegation of a continuing conspiracy. There has been little comment by Pennsylvania courts on the subject. However, because of Bule 1503\u2019s close affinity with Bule 23.1 of the Federal Buies of Civil Procedure and statutes of at least six other jurisdictions, we feel justified in looking outside of our own reported cases for assistance.\nThe Federal rule has been generally rationalized as operating to prevent courts from being used to litigate purchased grievances and becoming parties to speculative suits against corporations. See e.g., Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 556, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 1230 (1949); Bateson v. Magna Oil Corp., 414 F. 2d 128, 131 (5th Cir. 1969).\nActually, little improvement has been made on the well known opinion of Roscoe Pound in Home Fire Ins. Co. v. Barter, 67 Neb. 644, 93 N.W. 1024 (1903), decided when he was sitting as a commissioner with the Supreme Court of Nebraska:\n\u201cSound reason and good authority sustain the rule that a purchaser of stock can not complain of the prior acts and management of a corporation. Hawes v. Oakland, 104 U.S. 450, 26 L. Ed. 827; Dimpfell v. Ohio & M. R. Co., 110 U.S. 209, 3 Sup. Ct. 573, 28 L. Ed 121; Taylor v. Holmes, 127 U.S. 489, 8 Sup. Ct. 1192, 32 L. Ed. 179; Southwest Natural Gas Co. v. Fayette Fuel-Gas Co., 145 Pa. 13, 23 Atl. 224.... In Alexander v. Searcy, supra, [81 Ga. 536, 8 S.E. 630 (1888)], the court says: \u2018The weight of authority seems to be that a person who did not own stock at the time of the transactions complained of, can not complain or bring a suit to have them declared illegal.\u2019 In United Electric Securities Company v. Louisiana Electric Light Company, [68 F. 673 (1895)] it is said: \u2018As a general proposition, the purchaser of stock in a corporation is not allowed to attack the acts and management of the company prior to the acquisition of his stock; otherwise, we might have a case where stock duly represented in a corporation consented to and participated in bad management and waste and, after reaping the benefits from such transactions, could be easily passed into the hands of a subsequent purchaser, who could make his harvest by appearing and contesting the very acts and conduct which his vendor had consented to.\u2019 ... [T]he present stockholders ... by contesting these acts, which did not injure any of the present stockholders in the least, are recovering back a large part of the purchase price of stock which was admittedly worth all that they paid for it. Such cases illustrate forcibly the wisdom of confining complaints of this kind to those who were stockholders at the time or their successors by operation of law.\n\u201cThe rule that a suit for mismanagement can not be maintained by one who was not a stockholder at the time . . . has its foundation in a sound and wholesome principle of equity, namely, that the rules worked out by chancellors in furtherance of right and justice shall not be used, because of their technical character, as rules, to reach inequitable or unjust results. . . . The right of the stockholder to sue exists because of special injury to him for which otherwise he is without redress. If his interest is trifling and the injury thereto of no consequence, he can not sue to compel righting of wrongs to the corporation. . . . Hence there is obvious reason for holding that one who held no stock at the time of the mismanagement ought not to be allowed to sue unless the mismanagement or its effects continue and are injurious to him, or it affects him specially and peculiarly in some other manner. . . . Except in such cases, the purchaser ought to take things as he found them when he voluntarily acquired an interest. If he was defrauded in the purchase, he should sue the vendor. As to the corporation and its managers, so long as he is not injured in what he got when he purchased, and holds exactly what he got and in the condition in which he got it, there is no ground of complaint____\u201d Id. at 656-58, 93 N.W. at 1028-29 (citations omitted). See also Capital Wine & Spirit Corp. v. Pokrass, 277 App. Div. 184, 98 N.Y.S. 2d 291, aff'd, 302 N.Y. 734, 98 N.E. 2d 704 (1951) ; see generally Baker & Carey, Corporation 666-67 (3d ed. 1959).\nTurning to appellants\u2019 allegation of continuing wrongs, we note that the charge is wholly unsupported in the complaint. We here adopt the test for continuing transactions enunciated by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Palmer v. Morris, 316 F. 2d 649 (5th Cir. 1963), where plaintiff alleged that pursuant to an earlier transaction the company was still paying out sums of money for allegedly nonbeneficial services and exorbitant rentals. It was there stated: \u201cEach of the counts . . . sufficiently stated the facts and circumstances touching on the alleged illegality of the payments currently being made so that these counts could not be dismissed as dealing only with transactions that had completely occurred and been terminated prior to plaintiff\u2019s acquisition of his stock.\u201d Id. at 650. Accord, Bateson v. Magna Oil Corporation, supra; cf. Hoover v. Allen, 180 F. Supp. 263 (S.D.N.Y. 1960); see generally Prunty, Business Associations, 35 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 1467 (1960).\nUpon examination of the amended complaint, we conclude that the transactions in paragraphs 12(a)-(e) \u201chad completely occurred and been terminated\u201d prior to appellants\u2019 acquisition of the stock. To maintain a cause of action based upon a \u201ccontinuing wrong\u201d, appellants must allege specific on-going wrongs as to factually alleged acts. Cf. Lawson v. Baltimore Paint & Chemical Corp., 298 F. Supp. 373 (D. Md. 1969). Reading finally severed its more than thirty year connection with Perishable Products Company and the terminal in 1963, and the policies of Rule 1506 would be totally frustrated if 1964 shareholders were permitted to challenge transactions stretching back to 1931. Thug, appellantg have no gtanding regarding the acts of mismanagement set forth in paragraphs 12 (a)-(d).\nParagraph 12(e) concerning the sale of box cars by Reading to Railease is likewise a completed transaction. The continuing lease of the cars is between Rail-ease and B&O, and appellants, as Reading shareholders, have no standing to question its propriety.\nThe hopper car transaction in 12(f) rests on a different footing. Here, Reading itself has allegedly made an improper lease to B&O. This, we believe, is a continuing wrong, and as such appellants possess standing under Rule 1506 to challenge the transaction. However, as will appear below, the issues embodied in this paragraph are more appropriately before the ICC.\nWith respect to the remaining paragraphs of the amended complaint, it is impossible to determine the applicability of Rule 1506 to paragraph 12(g) because no date is given. Appellants do collectively meet the requirements of the rule as to the acts of mismanagement set forth in paragraphs 12(h) and (i), but, similar to 12(f), consideration of the issue in these paragraphs by our Court is inappropriate at the present time.\nTo recapitulate, we conclude that appellants are without standing with regard to paragraphs 12(a) through (3) and paragraph 12(g) is too vague to enable us to ascertain Rule 1506\u2019s applicability. Appellants do possess standing as to the transactions alleged in paragraphs 12(f), (h), and (i).\nPrimary Jurisdiction\nWe are in accord with the chancellor that the ICC possesses primary jurisdiction over the issue of the acquisition and exercise of control over Reading by the C&O\u2014B&O system with respect to two of the issues appellants are qualified to raise in the amended complaint.\nThe principles of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction are well settled. The United States Supreme Court \u201c. . . recognized early in the development of administrative agencies that coordination between traditional judicial machinery and these agencies was necessary if consistent and coherent policy were to emerge. . . . The doctrine of primary jurisdiction has become one of the key judicial switches through which this current has passed.\u201d Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Trans-Atlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 68, 91 S. Ct. 203, 208 (1970) (footnote and citations omitted). The doctrine . . requires judicial abstention in cases where protection of the integrity of a regulatory scheme dictates preliminary resort to the agency which administers the scheme.\u201d United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 353, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 1736 (1963). Such abstention is necessary to promote \u201c. . . proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties. . . .\u201d United States v. Western Pacific Railroad Co., 352 U.S. 59, 63, 77 S. Ct. 161, 165 (1956). Accord, Whitney National Bank in Jefferson Parish v. Bank of New Orleans, 379 U.S. 411, 85 S. Ct. 551 (1965) ; Far East Conference v. United States, 342 U.S. 570, 72 S. Ct. 492 (1952); cf. Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Company v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, 430 Pa. 339, 243 A. 2d 358 (1968). See generally 3 Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7\u00a719.01-.07 (1958); Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1037 (1964) ; Latta, Primary Jurisdiction in Regulated Industries and the Antitrust Laws, 30 U. of Cin. L. Rev. 261 (1961) ; Schwartz, Legal Restriction of Competition in the Regulated Industries; An Abdication of Judicial Responsibility, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 436 (1954).\nThe doctrine is clearly applicable to tbe present litigation. The Interstate Commerce Commission bas unquestionably embarked upon and is continuing: \u201c. . . a vast reorganization of rail transportation implementing tbe congressional policy of encouraging consolidation of the Nation\u2019s railroads into a \u2018limited number of systems.\u2019 Section 407 of tbe Transportation Act of 1920, amending \u00a75(4) of tbe Interstate Commerce Act, 41 Stat. 481 (1920). That policy bas been with us, in one form or another, for more than 45 years. Tbe original idea of tbe 1920 Act, that tbe ICC would formulate a national plan of consolidation, proved unworkable. It ran into heavy opposition from carriers and eventually bad to be abandoned. Tbe 1920 Act was replaced by tbe Transportation Act of 1940 . . . governed tbe Commission\u2019s examination of tbe present transactions. Under the 1940 Act, the initiation of tbe merger and consolidation proceedings is left to the carrier themselves, and tbe Commission possesses no power to compel carriers to merge. However, tbe congressional directive for a limited number of railroad systems has not been changed. The only change bas been in tbe means of achieving that goal. . . Penn-Central Merger and N & W Inclusion Cases, 389 U.S. 486, 492, 88 S. Ct. 602, 605 (1968) (citation omitted).\nThe Commission has been endowed with extensive regulatory powers to enable it to further national transportation policy. It is not our purpose to here review the history of the ICC. If it sufficient to note that the Commission has exclusive authority over mergers, for it is unlawful for any person, except with Commission approval obtained in an appropriate proceeding, to \u201c. . . accomplish or effectuate, or to participate in accomplishing or effectuating, the control or management in a common interest of any two or more carriers, however such result is attained, whether directly or indirectly, by use of common directors, officers, or stockholders, a holding or investment company or companies, a voting trust or trusts, or in any other manner whatsoever. It shall be unlawful to continue to maintain control or management accomplished or effectuated after the enactment of this amendatory paragraph and in violation of its provisions.\u201d Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104, Pt. 1, \u00a75, 24 Stat. 380, as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a75(4) (hereinafter referred to as the Act).\nThe Commission has the power to initiate investigation in cases of effectuation of control by nonprescribed methods (Section 5(7) of the Act), and its authority in the area of mergers and consolidations \u201c. . . shall be exclusive and plenary, and any carrier or corporation participating in or resulting from any transaction approved by the Commission thereunder, shall have full power ... to carry such transaction into effect and to own and operate any properties and exercise any control or franchises acquired through sand transaction. . . .\u201d Section 5(11) of the Act (emphasis added). Further, the ICC has the authority to make such appropriate supplemental orders as it may from time to time, for good cause shown, deem necessary. Section 5(9) of the Act.\nMindful of the Commission\u2019s extensive mantle of power and authority, we turn again to the amended complaint. The applicability of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction becomes readily apparent. In paragraph 12(i) of the complaint, the appellants challenge Reading\u2019s rejection of a proposed Penn-Central merger offer. Appellants also later seek a decree enjoining the C&O and B&O from voting their respective Reading shares. In effect, such a decree would divest the C&OB&O system of its Beading control and transfer the control to appellants or other shareholders. This judicial tampering with interlocking railroad systems would be wholly inappropriate at this juncture.\nAppellants urge that the ICC has never \u201capproved\u201d of the C&O and B&O\u2019s acquisition of de facto control over Reading. While appellants may be technically correct, for there has been no separate hearing on the issue, B&O\u2019s holdings in Reading have always been a matter of public record. See e.g., Penn-Central Merger and I\\T & W Inclusion Cases, supra at 519, 88 S. Ct. at 619. When the ICC approved C&O\u2019s acquisition of the B&O, see Chesapeake <\u00a3 Ohio Ry.\u2014Control\u2014Baltimore \u00e9 Ohio R. R., supra, the C&O-B&O system\u2019s dominance over Reading and Jersey Central received implied agency authorization.\nFurthermore, the issue is presently pending before the Commission. The C&O-B&O system filed for an order approving control of the Western Maryland Railroad Co. The acquisition was initially approved, see Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. and the Baltimore and Ohio R. R.\u2014Control\u2014Western Maryland Ry., 328 ICC 684 (1967), but the order is presently under reconsideration at Finance Docket 23178. Two petitions are pending in that litigation: one by the Reading Company for inclusion on fair and equitable terms within the C&O-B&O system, and one by the reorganization trustees of Jersey Central requesting a similar assimilation. Appellants have also interjected themselves into the joint application for merger by the Norfolk and Western and the C&O at Finance Docket 23832, raising the same allegations as contained in paragraphs 12(a), (e), (f), and (g) of the amended complaint. Our Court should not interrupt these proceedings.\nAppellants repeatedly stress that they are contesting only appellees\u2019 exercise of control over Reading rather than the acquisition of control. Their injunction request belies such protestations. Additionally, even appellees\u2019 exercise of its Reading control is a matter more appropriate for the Commission. See e.g., Hewitt-Robins v. Eastern Freight-Ways, Inc., 371 U.S. 84, 83 S. Ct. 157 (1962). Thus, we may not consider paragraph 12 (i) of the amended complaint.\nParagraph 12(f) concerning the leasing of hopper cars by Reading to the B&O meets a similar fate. Section 1(14) of the Interstate Commerce Act provides: \u201c(a) The Commission may, after hearing, on a complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, establish reasonable rules, regulations, and practices with respect to car service by common carriers by railroad subject to this chapter, including the compensation to be paid and other terms of any contract, agreement, or arrangement for the use of any locomotive, car, or other vehicle not owned by the carrier using it (and whether or not owned by another carrier), and the penalties or other sanctions for nonobservance of such rules, regulations, or practices.\u201d Considering the pendency of the general control issues before the ICC and its ability to afford relief on the hopper car transaction, we must again abstain.\nAs to paragraph 12(g), we have already indicated that it lacks adequate clarity to enable us to determine the applicability of Rule 1506. Even were the paragraph sufficiently specific so as to give appellants standing, we would refrain from passing on the issues raised therein because of the above quoted Section 1 (14) of the Act.\nFinally, with respect to paragraph 12(h) and the alleged irregularities regarding ithe Jersey Central, the matter is presently pending before the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. A reorganization proceeding was instituted in that court on March 22, 1967, by Jersey Central pursuant to Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7205. On March 25, 1968, the following order was entered:\n\u201cPursuant to Section 77(c) (9) of the Bankruptcy Act the Trustees are hereby directed to report to the Court any facts pertaining to irregularities, fraud, misconduct or mismanagement as a consequence of which the Debtor [Jersey Central] may have a cause of action arising therefrom against any person or corporation.\n\u201cIt is further requested that the Interstate Commerce Commission or such of its agencies as it may designate, report to the Court any facts pertaining to irregularities, fraud, misconduct or mismanagement as a consequence of which the Debtor may have a cause of action arising therefrom against any person or corporation.\u201d In the Matter of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, Debtor No. B-401-67, Order No. 116.\nWe are confident that the bankruptcy court is giving full consideration to all aspects of the proceedings, and various interested parties have not hesitated to test that court\u2019s ruling on appeal. See e.g., In re Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, 429 F. 2d 507 (3d Cir. 1970), cert. denied sub nom. Bondholders Protective Committee v. The 3\u00bc% Mortgage Bondholders Protective Committee, 401 U.S. 938, 91 S. Ct. 931 (1971) (application of Bondholders Protective Committee to intervene denied) ; In re Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, 411 F. 2d 1178 (3d Cir. 1969) (trustee authorized to appoint officer of B&O as chief operating officer of Jersey Central, and Court of Appeals would not review I.C.C. order) ; In re Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, 391 F. 2d 417 (3d Cir. 1968) (intervention of Rehigh Valley Railroad Co. allowed). We therefore will not entertain the issues raised in paragraph 12(h).\nTo summarize, appellants do not possess standing to raise issues presented in paragraphs 12(a)-(e). With respect to paragraphs 12(f) and 12(i), we defer to the primary jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Paragraph 12(g) is too vague for us to consider, and even were we to conclude it possessed sufficient clarity, the issue raised would be more properly one for the Commission. Finally, the matter raised in paragraph 12(h) is pending before the Federal District Court of New Jersey. We have considered all other portions of the complaint and conclude it must be dismissed.\nAccordingly, the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia dismissing the amended complaint is affirmed.. Costs on appellants.\nMr. Justice Jones concurs in the result.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nBy agreement, these objections have been continued and remain outstanding.\nThis was done in accordance with the practice adopted in ,/. M. Huber Corp. v. Denman, 367 F. 2d 104 (5th Cir. 1966).\nThe Commission's view accords substantially with that of the chancellor and the one we announce today.\nThe earliest date of acquisition by any of the plaintiffs on the original complaint is May 20, 1964.\nRule 1506 provides:\n\u201cIn an action to enforce a secondary right brought by one or more stockholders or members of a corporation or similar entity because the corporation or entity refuses or fails to enforce rights which could be asserted by it, the complaint shall set forth\n\u201c(1) that each plaintiff was a stockholder or owner of an interest in the corporation or other entity at the time of the transaction of which he complains or that his stock or interest devolved upon him by operation of law from a person who was a stockholder or owner at that time, and\n\u201c(2) the efforts made to secure enforcement by the corporation or similar entity or the reason for not making any such efforts.\u201d\nThe Act of August 27, 1963 reads in pertinent part: \u201cA. In any suit brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one or more shareholders against any officer, or director, or former officer or director of a corporation, domestic or foreign, because such corporation refuses to enforce rights which may properly be asserted by it, the plaintiff or plaintiffs must aver and it must be made to appear, that the plaintiff or each plaintiff was a shareholder or holder of a beneficial interest in such shares at the time of the transaction of which he complains, or that his shares or beneficial interest in such shares devolve upon him by operation of law from a person who was a shareholder or holder of a beneficial interest in such shares at such time: . . . .\u201d\nThe Act of April 18, 1945, reads in relevant part: \u201cIn any suit brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one or more shareholders or members of a corporation organized on a mutual plan without capital stock against any officer, or director, or former officer or director of a corporation, domestic or foreign, because such corporation refuses to enforce rights which may properly be arrested [sic] by it, the plaintiff or plaintiffs must aver and it must be made to appear, that the plaintiff or each plaintiff was a stockholder or was a member of such corporation at the time of the transaction of which he complains. . . .\u201d This act was repealed \u201cas to business corporations\u201d by the Act of August 27, 1963, supra.\nSee note 9 infra.\nRule 23.1 provides in pertinent part:\n\u201cIn a derivative action brought by one or more shareholders or members to enforce a right of a corporation or of an unincorporated association, the corporation or association having failed to enforce a right which may properly be asserted by it, the complaint shall be verified and shall allege (1) that the plaintiff was a shareholder or a member at the time of the transaction of which he complains or that his share or membership thereafter devolved on him by operation of law, and (2) that the action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction on a court of the United States which it would not otherwise have. . . .\u201d\nRule 23.1 was adopted in 1966. However, it is very similar to Rule 23(b) which was adopted with the original federal rules in 1938, and about which the Advisory Committee on Rules has observed:\n\u201cThe rule has a long history. In Hawes v. Oakland, 1892, 104 U.S. 450, 26 L. Ed. 827, the Court held that a shareholder could not maintain such an action unless he owned shares at the time of the transactions complained of, or unless they devolved on him by operation of law. . . .\n\u201cFollowing the decision in Hawes v. Oakland, and at the same term, the Court, to implement its decision, adopted former Equity Rule 94, which contained the same provision above quoted from rule 23 F. R. C. P. The provision in former Equity Rule 94 was later embodied in former Equity Rule 27, of which the present Rule 23 is substantially a copy.\u201d Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules following Rule 23.\nThe jurisdictions are California, Delaware, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, and Wisconsin. However, the problem is not confined to states with statutes similar to Rule 1506. The policy of contemporaneous shareholder ownership in derivative actions has been judicially adopted. See e.g., Duncan v. National Tea Company, 14 Ill. App. 2d 280, 144 N.E. 2d 771 (1957).\nAs was stated in Weinstein v. Behn, Misc. , 65 N.Y.S. 2d 536 (1946), aff\u2019d, 272 App. Div. 1045, 75 N.Y.S. 2d 284 (1947) :\n\u201cBy using the present tense plaintiff seeks to create the impression that there is some sort of continuing general wrong, and that if it be made to appear that the transactions complained of continue to the present day she at least would have a right to pursue the action in relation to wrongs committed after the date of the acquisition of the stock by her. The answer is twofold. In the first place these aUegations are merely conclusory and must be disregarded. . . .\n\u201cIn the second place, it is clear to this court that the quoted allegations refer back to the alleged original wrongs specified in some detail under other paragraphs of the complaint, all of which occurred some time before plaintiff obtained her stock. These acts may not by the specious device of employment of appropriate language be transformed into recurring wrongs for the purpose of overriding . . . [the applicable statute]. They are not distinguishable from the original wrongs. . . .\u201d Id. at , 65 N.Y.S. 2d at 540 (citations omitted).\nSimilarly, in Newkirk v. W. J. Rainey, Inc., 31 Del. Ch. 433, 76 A. 2d 121 (1950) it was observed:\n\u201cAlthough a conspiracy culminating in the 1948 merger is alleged, the fact is the plaintiffs complain of and seek relief with respect to three specific transactions. They involve three stock purchases in the years 1944 and 1945. Those purchases in my opinion are the transactions in the sense in which the term \u2018transaction\u2019 is employed in Section 51A. I say this because they are the wrongful acts which plaintiffs want remedied and which are susceptible of being remedied in a legal tribunal.. The allegation of a conspiracy cannot obscure the hard fact that the stock purchases are the wrongs which plaintiffs want rectified. Once it is decided, . . . that the stock purchases are the \u2018transactions\u2019 of which plaintiffs complain, it almost necessarily follows under the undisputed facts that such transactions were consummated prior to the date plaintiffs acquired their stock.\n\u201c. . . Those wrongful acts cannot by the specious device of employing appropriate language be transferred into continuing wrongs. . . .\u201d Id. at 437, 76 A. 2d at 123-24 (citation omitted).\nWe have dealt with the question of standing because it afforded an opportunity to clarify the significance of Buie 1506 and the concept of \u201ccontinuing wrongs\u201d. However, even were we to conclude that appeUants did possess standing with regard to the issues concerning the Philadelphia Perishable Products Company, we would be obliged to take account of the recent proceeding of Klinger v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, 432 F. 2d 506 (2d Cir. 1970) where the issue of B&O\u2019s use of the terminal and its other relationships with Philadelphia Products was thoroughly and completely aired in a shareholders derivative suit. The complaint was dismissed, and it was concluded that Beading had suffered no damages.\nParagraphs 12(f) and (i).\nAppellees make a double argument that the TOO possesses exclusive jurisdiction over the issues in this appeal and if that is not acceptable, at least the ICO possesses primary jurisdiction. Because we conclude that the Commission is imbued with primary jurisdiction, we need not and do not reach the issue of exclusive jurisdiction. It has been suggested that the distinction is somewhat ephemeral: \u201cPrimary jurisdiction situations arise when the original jurisdiction of a court is being invoked to decide the merits of a controversy; the facts, the law, the relief, and it is held that the jurisdiction of the court either to decide one of the relevant issues or to entertain the action at all has been superseded by agency jurisdiction. Primary Jurisdiction is pro tanto exclusive jurisdiction; insofar as the agency has jurisdiction it excludes the courts.\u201d Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1037, 1037-38 (1964).\nPor a thorough history of the changes in the means of achieving the goal of a limited number of railroad systems, see St. Joe Paper Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 347 U.S. 298, 315-21, 74 S. Ct. 574, 584-87 (1954) (appendix).\nOther recent proceedings before the Commission involving the implementation of the Congressional policy favoring the consolidation of railroads include: the proceeding approving the N & W\u2014 Nickel Plate\u2014Wabash merger, Norfolk & Western Ry. and New York, Chicago & St. Louis R.

The situation is in a state of flux at present, however, for the N&W and C&O have filed an application with the I.C.C. for the approval of a merger, and the Penn-Central is in the process of reorganization under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe National Transportation Policy has been defined by Congress as follows: \u201cIt is hereby declared to be the national transportation policy of the Congress to provide for fair and impartial regulation of all modes of transportation subject to the provisions of this Act, so administered as to recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of each; to promote safe, adequate, economical, and efficient service and foster sound economic conditions in transportation and among the several carriers; to encourage the establishment and maintenance of reasonable charges for transportation services, without unjust discriminations, undue preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices; to cooperate with the several States and the duly authorized officials thereof; and to encourage fair wages and equitable working conditions;\u2014all to the end of developing, coordinating, and preserving a national transportation system by water, highway, and rail, as well as other means, adequate to meet the needs of the commerce of the United States, of the Postal Service, and of the national defense.\u201d Act of September 18, 1940, e. 722, Title I, \u00a71, 54 Stat. 899, 49 U.S.C. note preceding \u00a71.
