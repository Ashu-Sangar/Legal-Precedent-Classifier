        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThis appeal requires that we determine whether the specific devise of a house \u201cincluding the contents thereof, absolutely\u201d is a gift of not only the furniture and furMshings but also of three savings accounts, a checking account, three savings bank certificates and uncashed checks payable to testatrix. These latter items, all found in the home, amount to $46,140.63, and constitute a substantial part of the estate.\nTestatrix, Marie A. Lamb, died April 27, 1971, leaving a will dated October 22, 1968, wMch was duly admitted to probate. The sole specific bequest in the will devised the \u201cproperty 4907 Cedar Avenue . . . including the contents thereof, absolutely\u201d to her nephew; the residuary estate was bequested in equal shares to five named charities.\nThe nephew-appellant claims that testatrix\u2019 gift to him of the contents of the house included the savings and checking accounts, the savings bank certificates and the uncashed checks. The charities-appellees contend that these bank items are not part of the \u201ccontents\u201d of the house and are properly includable in the residuary clause. The court decreed distribution of these assets to the appellees. Appellant filed exceptions which were denied by the court eu banc. This appeal followed. We affirm the adjudication of the orphans\u2019 court.\nIt is well settled that \u201c. . . the duty of the court is to ascertain, if possible, the intent of the testator . . .\u201d and \u201c. . . the court must garner, if possible, the intent of the testator from a consideration of all the language contained in the four corners of the will, together with all the surrounding and attendant circumstances and from the scheme of distribution and not merely from isolated clauses or provisions of the will. . . .\u201d Hill Estate, 432 Pa. 269, 272, 247 A. 2d 606, 608-09 (1968) (emphasis in original); Schappell Estate, 424 Pa. 390, 392, 227 A. 2d 651, 652 (1967) ; Vandergrift Estate, 406 Pa. 34, 26, 377 A. 2d 432, 438 (1962).\nThe testatrix clearly manifested an intent to leave her nephew a specific devise and the residuary estate to the five named charities. If appellant\u2019s construction of the will is correct, he will receive practically the entire estate and the testatrix\u2019s charitable intention as expressed in the residuary clause would be meaningless and ineffective. Furthermore, the testatrix specifically directed that all estate and inheritance taxes be borne by the \u201cgeneral estate\u201d and all \u201clegacies, devises and other gifts of principal and income\u201d to her beneficiaries, be free of such taxes. Under appellant\u2019s construction of the will, testatrix\u2019s tax direction would be frustrated since no assets would be left to satisfy these tax obligations. To give meaning to the residuary clause and the allocation of the tax burden, appellant\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201cincluding the contents thereof, absolutely\u201d cannot be accepted. As this Court observed in Yandergrift, supra, \u201c. . . a construction which renders any of the words nugatory and futile must be rejected. . . .\u201d 406 Pa. 34, 26, 177 A. 2d 432, 438 (1962).\nA similar issue was presented to the New York courts in Re Falvey\u2019s Will, 15 App. Div. 2d 415, 224 N.Y.S. 2d 899, aff\u2019d, 12 N.Y. 2d 759, 234 N.Y.S. 2d 713 . (1962) (per curiam). There the will left a house \u201ctogether with all furnishings and all property and articles of whatsoever nature found therein\u201d to two named beneficiaries and also created a charitable trust of the residuary estate. The named beneficiaries there, as the nephew here, claimed that the contents of the house included not only the furnishings but also United States Savings bonds which constituted a substantial part of the estate. In rejecting this claim, the Court observed: \u201cIf the dispositive provisions in respect of the house and contents in the instant will comprehend all of the testatrix\u2019s property, another portion of her will, which manifested an intention of setting up a charitable trust, is rendered ineffective because of lack of available assets. Considering the circumstances surrounding the drafting and execution of the will : . . and reading the will in its entirety in accordance with well established canons of construction, we cannot agree that the testatrix contemplated the disposition of her entire estate to respondent thereby preventing the establishment of a charitable trust.\u201d Id. at 417, 224 N.Y.S. 2d at 902-03. Likewise, in the present case, the orphans\u2019 court division properly determined that testatrix did not intend to leave her entire estate to her nephew thereby making meaningless the charitable bequests designated in her residuary clause. The court\u2019s rejection of appellant\u2019s interpretation of the will is clearly supported by testatrix\u2019s expressed intent as reflected in her residuary and tax clauses.\nDecree of the orphans\u2019 court division is affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Barbieri took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nThe hearing court\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201ccontents thereof\u201d to include only the furniture and furnishings but not savings and checking accounts, savings bank certificates, and uncashed checks is in accord with the general usage of the phrase: \u201c \u2018Normally when used in its ordinary sense, the phrase \u201ccontents of a home\u201d designates those items of personal property which convert an empty house into a home. It would include furniture, floor coverings, electrical appliances, pictures, articles of decoration, linens, kitchen and silverware, and other articles of similar character commonly used in maintaining a home. Usually the expression would not include cash, jewelry, choses in action or evidence of debt.\u2019 \u201d McCartney\u2019s Estate, 61 Pa. D. & C. 112, 113 (O.C.
