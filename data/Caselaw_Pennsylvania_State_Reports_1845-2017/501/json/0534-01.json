        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nIn this appeal we are called upon to decide whether the discharge of a tenured professional employee, in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the Public School Code of 1949 (Code) on the ground of \u201cimmorality\u201d gives rise to a grievance under a collective bargaining agreement and is thus subject to mandatory arbitration under the Public Employee Relations Act (PERA). Having concluded that such discharge is not a grievance arising out of the interpretation of the instant collective bargaining agreement (Agreement), we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court, 59 Pa.Cmwlth. 63, 428 A.2d 1023 (1981), sustaining the dismissal.\nI.\nRobert Hess, a tenured teacher of the Neshaminy School District (District), was convicted on March 16,1978 by a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County of simple and aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, terroristic threats and felonious restraint, and was sentenced to fifteen days\u2019 limited confinement. In April 1978 Hess received written notice from the Neshaminy District Board of School Directors (Board) to appear at a Board hearing on April 15, 1978. Following hearings on that date and on April 22, 1978, in which Hess participated, the Board on June 23,1978 voted 6-3 to dismiss him. Formal dismissal was effected on June 27, 1978. Hess did not exercise his statutory right to appeal the Board\u2019s decision.\nOn August 18, 1978, Hess filed a demand for arbitration, pursuant to section 5-3 of the Agreement, alleging that he had been discharged without \u201cjust cause\u201d and requesting reinstatement. On November 8, 1978 the District filed a complaint in equity against Hess, the Neshaminy Federation of Teachers (Federation) and the American Arbitration Association (Association) in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County. The District sought a temporary decree restraining the Association from holding a hearing on Hess\u2019s grievance. That request was denied. The arbitrator, after conducting hearings, ruled that Hess\u2019s discharge was an arbitrable grievance pursuant to the Agreement and that Hess was dismissed without \u201cjust cause.\u201d Thus he ordered Hess\u2019s reinstatement.\nThe District appealed the arbitrator\u2019s award to the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County. On February 29, 1980, that court granted the District\u2019s petition to set aside the award and upheld the dismissal, holding that while Hess\u2019s grievance was arbitrable, his dismissal by the Board for \u201cimmorality\u201d was justified. On appeal from that decision, the Commonwealth Court rejected the arbitrability of the discharge and affirmed. This Court granted the Federation\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nII.\nThe policy of this Commonwealth not only favors but mandates the submission to arbitration of public employee grievances \u201carising out of the interpretation of the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.903; County of Allegheny v. Allegheny County Prison Employees Independent Union, 476 Pa. 27, 381 A.2d 849 (1977); Board of Education of the School District of Phila delphia v. Philadelphia Federation of Teachers Local No. 3, AFT, AFL-CIO, 464 Pa. 92, 346 A.2d 35 (1975) (hereinafter Local No. 3, AFT). The issue of the scope of the grievance arbitration procedure under a given agreement is determined, in the first instance, by the arbitrator. Pittsburgh Joint Collective Bargaining Committee v. City of Pittsburgh, 481 Pa. 66, 391 A.2d 1318 (1978); Local 3, AFT, supra. Nevertheless, whether or not a matter is properly within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator depends upon the intention of the parties as expressed in the terms of the agreement. Leechburg Area School District v. Dale, 492 Pa. 515, 424 A.2d 1309 (1981); County of Allegheny v. Allegheny County Prison Employees Independent Union, supra; Community College of Beaver County v. Community College of Beaver County, Society of the Faculty (PSEA/NEA), 473 Pa. 576, 375 A.2d 1267 (1977). See also Independence Development, Inc. v. American Arbitration Association, 460 Pa. 390, 333 A.2d 781 (1975); Borough of Ambridge Water Authority v. Columbia, 458 Pa. 546, 328 A.2d 498 (1974); Women\u2019s Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. American Arbitration Association, 440 Pa. 34, 269 A.2d 888 (1970). As we noted in Leechburg Area School District v. Dale, supra, the question of the arbitrability of a particular dispute\nrequires a determination as to whether the terms of the agreement encompass the subject matter of the dispute. Where it is determined that the subject matter of the dispute is encompassed within the terms of the agreement, the validity of the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation is not a matter of concern to the court.\nId. 492 Pa. at 520-521, 424 A.2d at 1312-1313.\nOnce it is determined the agreement encompasses the subject matter of the dispute, review of the arbitrator\u2019s finding is limited to whether the decision draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. This \u201cessence\u201d test is set forth in Community College of Beaver County v. Community College of Beaver County, Society of the Faculty, supra:\nTo state the matter more precisely, where a task of an arbitrator, PERA or otherwise, has been to determine the intention of the contracting parties as evidenced by their collective bargaining agreement and the circumstances surrounding its execution, then the arbitrator\u2019s award is based on a resolution of a question of fact and is to be respected by the Judiciary if \u201cthe interpretation can in any rational way be derived from the agreement, viewed in light of its language, its context, and any other indicia of the parties\u2019 intention.. . \u201d Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co. v. Fletcher, 405 F.2d 1123, 1128 (3d Cir.1969).\nId. 473 Pa. at 593-594, 375 A.2d at 1275 (emphasis supplied).\nFor the reasons discussed below we are satisfied that the terms of the Agreement do not encompass the instant subject matter, i.e., dismissal of a tenured employee and for that reason we conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s award was properly rejected.\nA.\nThe crucial provisions in the instant controversy are sections 4 \u2014 1, 4-2 and 4-8 of Article IV of the Agreement:\nARTICLE IV\nRIGHT OF PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES\n4-1 Nothing contained herein shall supersede the provisions of the School Laws of Pennsylvania, 1949, as amended, or other applicable laws and regulations.\n4-2 An Employee will not be disciplined, reprimanded, reduced in rank, contractual compensation or contractual advantage without just cause. Any just [sic] actions asserted by the Board or any agent or representative thereof shall be subject to the grievance procedure herein described.\n4-8 In conferences dealing with an unsatisfactory rating, demotion, suspension, or dismissal of an Employee, the Employee may invite a representative of the bargaining unit to be present. Except in an emergency, the Employee will be given at least 24 hours notice of the scheduling of such conference.\nOur analysis must first focus upon whether section 4-2 intended to encompass \u201cdismissal.\u201d If the agreement did not intend to encompass the question of dismissal, then such action is not arbitrable under the agreement and the arbitrator had no authority to address the question. Sley System Garages v. Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, Local 700, 406 Pa. 370, 178 A.2d 560 (1962).\nIt is obvious from a reading of section 4-2 that it does not employ the term \u201cdismissal.\u201d Therefore we must determine whether the term \u201cdiscipline\u201d in section 4-2 of the Agreement was intended by the parties to include \u201cdismissal.\u201d If this was their intention, dismissals would be \u201cactions asserted by the Board . . . subject to the grievance procedure\u201d set forth in Article V of the Agreement. Such an interpretation is untenable for several reasons.\nInitially, it is clear that the language of the Agreement lends no support to the argument that the parties intended the term \u201cdiscipline\u201d to include \u201cdismissal\u201d of a professional employee for any purpose. At the outset, the Agreement makes it clear the parties intended not to supersede or contravene the provisions of the Code. See section 4-1. The Code specifically discusses \u201ctermination of contract,\u201d \u00a7 11-1130, \u201cdismissals,\u201d \u00a7 11-1127 and \u201cdischarge,\u201d \u00a7 11-1122. The Code does not employ the term \u201cdiscipline,\u201d nor does it attempt to establish standards for its imposition. Thus, the use of the term \u201cdiscipline\u201d in the Agreement, consistent with the Agreement\u2019s stated intention of not superseding the Code, would appear to refer to actions other than \u201ctermination of contract,\u201d \u201cdismissal\u201d and/or \u201cdischarge,\u201d which are specifically provided for in the Code.\nFurther, it is highly significant that, while the term \u201cdismissal\u201d is not used in section 4-2, which defines matters subject to mandatory arbitration, that word is found in section 4-8, which gives an employee the right to have a union representative present at \u201cconferences dealing with . . . dismissal.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) This explicit reference to \u201cdismissal\u201d in another section of the same Article refutes the contention that the parties intended \u201cdismissal\u201d to be subsumed by the term \u201cdiscipline\u201d in section 4-2. The significance of the omission of the term \u201cdismissal\u201d in section 4r-2 is further highlighted by reading sections 4r-2 and 4-8 together: The term \u201cdemotion\u201d is employed in section 4-8, while a precise definition of that term appears in section 4-2, \u201creduction] in rank, contractual compensation or contractual advantage.\u201d Demotion is the only other type of Board action against a professional employee which entitles that employee to the procedural safeguards prescribed in sections 1127-1132 of the Code.\nsuch board of school directors shall furnish such professional employee with a detailed written statement of the charges upon which his or her proposed dismissal is based and shall conduct a hearing. A written notice signed by the president and attested by the secretary of the board shall be forwarded by registered mail to the professional employe setting forth the time and place when and where such professional employe will be given an opportunity to be heard either in person or by counsel, or both, before the board of school directors and setting forth a detailed statement of the charges. Such hearing shall not be sooner than ten (10) nor more than fifteen (15) days after such written notice. At such hearing all testimony offered, including that of complainants and their witnesses, as well as that of the accused professional employee and his or her witnesses, shall be recorded by a competent disinterested public stenographer whose services shall be furnished by the school board at its expense. Any such hearing may be postponed, continued or adjourned.\nSection 1151 provides:\n\u00a7 11-1151. Salary increases; demotions\nThe salary of any district superintendent, assistant district superintendent or other professional employe in any school district may be increased at any time during the term for which such person is employed, whenever the board of school directors of the district deems it necessary or advisable to do so, but there shall be no demotion of any professional employe, either in salary or in type of position, except as otherwise provided in this act, without the consent of the employe, or, if such consent is not received, then such demotion shall be subject to the right to a hearing before the board of school directors and an appeal in the same manner as hereinbefore provided in the case of the dismissal of a professional employe.\n24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1151 (Supp.1982-83) (Emphasis supplied).\nHowever, section 1151 of the Code differs from section 1122 of the Code in two important respects: (1) the hearing is at the employee\u2019s option and (2) no standard governing demotion is set forth in the Code. Thus, including demotion among the subjects of mandatory arbitration would not supersede or contravene any standard or procedure mandated by the Code. Cf. Rylke v. Portage Area School District, 473 Pa. 481, 375 A.2d 692 (1977). In contrast, an attempt to read \u201cdismissal\u201d as subsumed within the term \u201cdiscipline\u201d set forth in section 4-2 of the Agreement would contravene the mandatory provisions of sections 1122-1131 of the Code.\nMoreover, the essential distinction which must be drawn between \u201cdismissal\u201d and \u201cdiscipline\u201d must be ascertained not by resorting to a dictionary but by tracing the interplay between the Code and the Agreement. This relationship is carefully recognized in the Agreement itself. Whereas the school board\u2019s power to dismiss a professional employee is explicitly granted by the Code, the board\u2019s broad disciplinary powers are implicit in the board\u2019s statutory responsibilities. See Barth v. Philadelphia School District, 393 Pa. 557, 143 A.2d 909 (1958); Abington School District v. Yost, 40 Pa.Commw. 312, 397 A.2d 453 (1979); see generally 24 P.S. \u00a7 2-211. Section 510 of the Code confers the power to promulgate rules and regulations governing the conduct of employees, including professional employees such as tenured teachers:\n\u00a7 5-510. Rules and regulations; safety patrols\nThe board of school directors in any school district may adopt and enforce such reasonable rules and regulations as it may deem necessary and proper, regarding the management of its school affairs and the conduct and deportment of all superintendents, teachers, and other appointees or employes during the time they are engaged in their duties to the district.\n24 P.S. \u00a7 5-510 (Supp.1982-1983).\nThe only limitations upon this rulemaking power are that rules and regulations be \u201creasonable\u201d and relate to on-the-job behavior.\nThe power to regulate conduct, of course, would be illusory absent a concomitant power to enforce rules through the imposition of some form of discipline. Yet the Code prescribes neither standards for imposing such discipline nor procedures to be employed in the disciplinary process. Thus an employee aggrieved by an unjust disciplinary action would have no recourse but the courts. A contractual provision such as section 4-2 fills this standardless void in the Code, protecting employees from unjust disciplinary actions by making grievances arising from such actions the subject of mandatory arbitration proceedings wherein a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard is determinative. Such provisions serve as a check on a school board\u2019s undefined discretionary authority as well as a desirable alternative to litigation. Thus provisions such as section 4-2 complement rather than supersede the Code, and further the purposes of PERA.\nOnce this definition of \u201cdiscipline\u201d is recognized, the function of section 4-2 within the Agreement and the statutory scheme becomes clear: The Code furnishes no criteria for the discipline, reprimand or demotion of a professional employee; section 4-2 establishes a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard for such actions. Thus section 4-2 embodies a significant concession by the District with respect to a previously indefinite exercise of its authority.\nFinally, if arbitration were permissible under the Agreement notwithstanding the Board\u2019s compliance with the statutory dismissal process, section 4-2 would supersede the Code in violation of the express terms of section 4-1 of the Agreement and of section 703 of PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.703. If the adjudicative processes and jurisdictional grants mandated under the Code were not exclusive, a decision of the Board to dismiss a professional employee would be rendered meaningless, as would any decision adverse to the employee rendered by the Secretary of Education, the Court of Common Pleas or . the appellate courts. Those decisions would not be binding upon the employee should the Board\u2019s initial decision remain perpetually subject to relitigation by an arbitrator applying a different standard. Such a result would offend all notions of finality. Moreover, this Commonwealth\u2019s goal, in providing for arbitration of labor grievances, of avoiding labor litigation, would be frustrated. The availability of parallel remedies, each with full appellate rights, would indefinitely delay the dismissal of any professional school employee. To interpret the Agreement as intending this absurd result, therefore, would be irrational. See Unit Vending Corp. v. Lacas, 410 Pa. 614, 190 A.2d 298 (1963); Berke v. Bregman, 406 Pa. 142, 176 A.2d 644 (1962).\nB.\nAnalysis of the relevant Code provisions concerning \u201cdismissal\u201d compels the conclusion that section 4-1 must be interpreted as excluding \u201cdismissal\u201d from mandatory arbitration. The phrase \u201cthe School Laws of Pennsylvania, 1949\u201d in section 4-1 unquestionably refers to the Code. Because section 4-1 of the Agreement gives explicit preference to the Code, an understanding of the Code provisions affecting the terms and conditions of employment of professional employees is essential to the interpretation of section 4-2, on which our determination of the threshold issue of arbitrability rests. It also demonstrates the parties\u2019 intention to establish compatibility with the previous enactment and not to create a conflict. See Rylke v. Portage Area School District, supra; Milberry v. Board of Education of School District of Philadelphia, 467 Pa. 79, 354 A.2d 559 (1976).\nThe termination of the contract of a tenured professional school employee is controlled by the Code. Brownsville Area School District v. Alberts, 436 Pa. 429, 260 A.2d 765 (1970); Flannery Appeal, 406 Pa. 515, 178 A.2d 751 (1962). As a \u201cprofessional employee\u201d as defined in section 1101(1) of the Code, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1101(1), Hess was subject to the limited dismissal powers conferred upon the District by section 1122 of the Code. See footnote (8), supra. The language of section 1122 makes clear that a tenured professional employee may be dismissed only for the reasons set forth in that section. See West Shore School District v. Bowman, 48 Pa.Commw. 104, 409 A.2d 474 (1979); New Castle Area School District v. Bair, 28 Pa.Commw. 240, 368 A.2d 345 (1977).\nIn addition to the statutory limitation of the grounds for dismissal, the Code accords the tenured professional employee explicit procedural safeguards. 24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 11-1126 \u2014 11-1131. See Milberry v. Board of Education of School District of Philadelphia, supra. A valid dismissal of a tenured professional employee can be effected only if the school district acts in full compliance with these legislatively prescribed procedures. See Commonwealth, Department of Education v. Jersey Shore Area School District, 481 Pa. 356, 392 A.2d 1331 (1978); Tyler v. Jefferson County-Du Bois Area Vocational Technical School, 467 Pa. 595, 359 A.2d 761 (1976); Jost v. Phoenixville Area School District, 267 Pa.Super. 461, 406 A.2d 1133 (1979); West Shore School District v. Bowman, supra; Board of School Directors of Centennial School District v. Secretary of Education, 31 Pa.Commw. 307, 376 A.2d 302 (1977); New Castle Area School District v. Bair, supra; Commonwealth, Department of Education v. Oxford Area School District, 24 Pa.Commw. 421, 356 A.2d 857 (1976); Pointek v. Elk Lake School District, . 26 Pa.Commw. 62, 360 A.2d 804 (1976); Commonwealth, Department of Education v. Great Valley School District, 23 Pa.Commw. 423, 352 A.2d 252 (1976); Abington School District v. Pittenger, 9 Pa.Commw. 62, 305 A.2d 382 (1973); See also Jacobs v. Wilkes-Barre Township School District, 355 Pa. 449, 50 A.2d 354 (1947). Thus the Board could not properly agree to pursue dismissals by a non-statutory method.\nThe Code\u2019s substantive limitations on the range of grounds for dismissal, together with its mandated procedural safeguards, are to be recognized as emoluments of tenured professional status. No such limitations or procedures have been prescribed by the Code in the case of other classes of employees subject to dismissal. Significantly, Article IV of the Agreement, entitled \u201cRight of Professional Employees,\u201d explicitly provides that \u201c[njothing contained [tjherein shall supersede the School laws of Pennsylvania.\u201d In drafting Article IV, the parties must have been aware of the significant statutory rights afforded tenured professional employees by the Code. Thus it is proper to interpret that language in Article IV as intentionally incorporating the Code provisions concerning dismissal into the Agreement. We conclude, therefore, that the parties to the Agreement contemplated that dismissal of tenured professional employees would be governed by the applicable provisions of the Code, not the grievance procedure of the Agreement.\nTo hold otherwise would require the conclusion that the parties did, in fact, intend the Agreement to supersede the Code. Such an interpretation is untenable. Were dismissal subject to the grievance procedure, the Agreement\u2019s \u201cjust cause\u201d standard would supplant the limited statutory grounds for dismissal. Likewise the Code\u2019s mandatory dismissal procedures would be discarded in favor of arbitration. These results would conflict with the express language of the Agreement itself. More importantly, as we indicated above, that construction would render the Agreement inconsistent with and in violation of the Code. In such case the arbitration provisions of the Agreement would be unenforceable, pursuant to section 703 of PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.703, as to dismissals of professional employees. See Milberry v. Board of Education of School District of Philadelphia, supra; Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. State College Area School District, 461 Pa. 494, 337 A.2d 262 (1975). We will not render an interpretation of an agreement which is violative of existing law. See Block v. Mylish, 351 Pa. 611, 41 A.2d 731 (1945); Rau v. Wilkes-Barre and Eastern R.R. Co., 311 Pa. 510, 167 A. 230 (1933); State Line and Sullivan R.R. Co. v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., 277 Pa. 227, 120 A. 829 (1923).\nIII.\nIn light of the above discussion we must conclude that the Board\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Hess was not an arbitrable action under the terms of the Agreement. Accordingly, the dismissal by the Board, which was not appealed, must be sustained.\nThe Order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\n. Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, art. I, \u00a7 101 \u2014 art. XXVII, \u00a7 2701, as amended, 24 P.S. \u00a7 1-101 \u2014 \u00a7 27-2701 (1962 and Supp. 1982-83).\n. Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, No. 195, art. I, \u00a7 101 \u2014 art.

The arbitrator\u2019s report indicated that at some time after 3:00 a.m. on the morning of September 25, 1977, Hess, who had been drinking heavily since early the previous evening, awakened his wife and got his shotgun. During a conversation which lasted ah hour or more, Hess occasionally pointed the shotgun at his wife, and threatened to kill himself and \u201call the others.\u201d At the time Hess\u2019s six year old son by a previous marriage and Mrs. Hess\u2019s daughter and son-in-law were also in the house. The daughter and her husband escaped, using bedsheets to climb from a window, and summoned the police.\n. The merits of that complaint are still pending before the Court of Common Pleas.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 724.\n. Section 11-1130 provides:\n\u00a7 11-1130. Notice of discharge; procedure on decision favorable to employe\nA written notice of any decision of the school directors discharging a professional employe, shall be sent by registered mail to such professional employee at his or her last known address within ten (10) days after such hearing is actually concluded.\nIn all cases where the final decision is in favor of the professional employe, the charges made shall be physically expunged from the records of the board of school directors, but a complete official transcript of the records of the hearing shall be delivered to the one against whom the charges were made.
