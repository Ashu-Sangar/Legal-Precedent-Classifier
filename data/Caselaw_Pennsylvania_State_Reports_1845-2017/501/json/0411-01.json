        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal, by allowance, from an order of the Superior Court, 277 Pa.Super. 470, 419 A.2d 1244, affirming an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County in which appellant Edward Stephens, a juvenile, was adjudged delinquent. Appellant challenges the constitutionality of section 6305 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6305 (formerly \u00a7 5 of the Juvenile Act, Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, 11 P.S. \u00a7 50-301), which authorized the court of common pleas to hold a \u201crehearing\u201d on the petition charging appellant with delinquency following a master\u2019s recommendation that the petition be dismissed. Because we conclude that section 6305 is constitutional, we reject appellant\u2019s challenge and affirm.\nThe delinquency petition, filed in February of 1978, alleged that appellant, then fifteen years old, had been involved in an altercation with Santiago Garcia, then twelve, which caused Garcia to sustain injuries to the mouth, teeth, and cheekbone. Appellant was charged with delinquency for having engaged in acts which constitute aggravated assault and simple assault.\nDelaware County employs members of the Bar as masters as a means of facilitating the prompt and effective disposition of juvenile cases. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6305(a) and 6305(b). Thus the delinquency petition was assigned to a master, who, on June 21, 1978, held a hearing on the petition. At the commencement of the hearing, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6305(b), the master told the parties of their right to have the matter heard in the first instance by a judge, and further told the parties, \u201cUnless there is an objection to this matter being heard before the Master, we are ready to proceed.\u201d Neither appellant nor his counsel objected, and the parties proceeded to present evidence on the petition.\nThe master heard sworn testimony from Garcia and appellant. Garcia maintained that the altercation had been initiated by appellant and that appellant had kicked him in the face. Appellant acknowledged that he had punched Garcia, but claimed that Garcia had initiated the use of force by swinging at him with a stick, pushing him against a wall, and punching him. On cross-examination, appellant stated that he had considered the fight to be \u201cmutual combat.\u201d Marvin Mobley, a cousin of appellant and an alleged eyewitness of a portion of the fight, was also sworn as a witness. He testified that Garcia had sustained his injuries only after falling from a stairway near the point at which the fight had begun.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the master stated:\n\u201cI am certain that the parties, all of them, regret the incident occurred, but at this point in time the Master is not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile defendant should be adjudicated delinquent on the charges of simple assault and aggravated assault and is going to dismiss the Petition.\u201d\nOn a printed form which the Master submitted to the Juvenile Court pursuant to section 6305(c) of the Judicial Code, which requires a master to transmit \u201cwritten findings and recommendations for disposition to the judge,\u201d the master entered the notation \u201cInsufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and circled, as his recommendation, \u201cPetition dismissed.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth filed a written \u201cException to Master\u2019s Recommendations and Petition for a Rehearing,\u201d which alleged that the master\u2019s determination was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d particularly because appellant had \u201cadmitted that he considered the fight mutual combat,\u201d a misdemeanor of the third degree. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701(b). On July 3, 1978, after consideration of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition and an answer filed by appellant, the court of common pleas granted a rehearing and scheduled the matter for a hearing \u201cbefore the regular Hearing Judge at the earliest practicable date.\u201d\nOn July 25, the date on which the matter was to be heard by a juvenile court judge, appellant filed a motion to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s petition on the ground that a rehearing before a juvenile court judge would violate appellant\u2019s right not to be placed twice in jeopardy. See U.S. Const.Amends. Y & XIV; Pa. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10. The motion was taken under advisement and, after the submission of briefs, denied.\nAt the rehearing, held on January 23, 1979, the same persons who had testified at the hearing before the master testified before the juvenile court judge and presented substantially the same versions of the incident as had been presented at the master\u2019s hearing. At the close of testimony, but before the entry of an adjudication, the court explored whether appellant\u2019s parents would be willing to sign a consent decree discharging appellant on the condition that his parents make restitution of $300 to the parents of Garcia within six months. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6340 (consent decrees). Appellant\u2019s father stated that he would sign such a decree, but after an in-chambers conference the court announced:\n\u201cCounsel [for the juvenile] feels that [appellant] would be waiving certain rights if they settled this matter with a Consent Decree. Therefore, the Court finds the defendant delinquent and directs that the parents [of appellant] pay within six months a sum of $300.00 on account of restitution to the parents of the Garcia boy.\u201d\nIn affirming the order of the court of common pleas, a majority of a panel of the Superior Court held that appellant had \u201cwaived his constitutional right not to be placed in double jeopardy\u201d by not objecting to the submission of the matter to the master at the commencement of the master\u2019s hearing. 277 Pa.Super. 470, 473, 419 A.2d 1244, 1245 (1980). Appellant contends that his silence at the commencement of the master\u2019s hearing may not properly be construed as a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right not to be placed twice in jeopardy, as he was not advised of the possibility that the matter could be heard by a judge after having been heard by the master.\nAppellant\u2019s contention is based on the erroneous premise that the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution of the United States and the double jeopardy clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution forbid a rehearing on a delinquency petition before a juvenile court judge following a hearing on that petition before a master. The master\u2019s function is, by the express terms of the Judicial Code, confined to the transmittal of \u201cwritten findings and recommendations for disposition to the judge.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6305(c). The master\u2019s findings and recommendations may become the \u201cfindings and order of the court\u201d only when \u201cconfirmed in writing by the judge,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6305(d), the only official under the legislatively designed system entrusted to enter a binding judgment. Whereas jeopardy attaches at proceedings before a juvenile court judge, \u201cwhose object is to determine whether [the juvenile] has committed acts that violate a criminal law and whose potential consequences include both the stigma inherent in such a determination and the .deprivation of liberty for many years,\u201d Breed v. Jones, 421 U.S. 519, 529, 95 S.Ct. 1779,1785, 44 L.Ed.2d 346 (1975), clearly jeopardy does not attach at a master\u2019s hearing, whose purpose is to facilitate the final disposition of delinquency petitions by a juvenile court judge.\nOur conclusion that appellant was not placed in jeopardy at the master\u2019s hearing is supported by Swisher v. Brady, 438 U.S. 204, 98 S.Ct. 2699, 57 L.Ed.2d 705 (1978), in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of - Maryland\u2019s master system. Like the master system employed in Pennsylvania, the master system at issue in Swisher utilized masters only to make proposed dispositions to a juvenile court judge. In rejecting the contention that Maryland\u2019s master system violated the prohibition against double jeopardy, the Court stated:\n\u201c[I]t is for the State ... to designate and empower the factfinder and adjudicator. And here Maryland has conferred those roles only on the Juvenile Court judge. Thus, regardless of which party is initially favored by the master\u2019s proposals, and regardless of the presence or absence of exceptions, the judge is empowered to accept, modify, or reject those proposals.\u201d\n438 U.S. at 216, 98 S.Ct. at 2707.\nAppellant contends that, by allowing a juvenile court judge to hear testimony on a delinquency petition afresh, section 6305 impermissibly affords the Commonwealth \u201canother opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster at the first proceeding,\u201d Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 11, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978). In support of this contention, appellant relies upon a portion of Swisher in which the Supreme Court rejected a similar challenge to Maryland\u2019s master system, observing that the Maryland system permitted a juvenile court judge to receive additional evidence \u201conly with the consent of the minor.\u201d 438 U.S. at 216,98 S.Ct. at 2706. On this record, however, it is clear that the Commonwealth did not present evidence before the juvenile court judge that it had previously failed to \u201cmuster\u201d: Garcia, the victim of the alleged assault, was the sole Commonwealth witness at both hearings, and presented substantially the same testimony. More important, the Supreme Court in Swisher did not rely upon Maryland\u2019s consent requirement as a condition of that system\u2019s constitutionality, but rather recognized that Maryland had conferred the role of factfinder and adjudicator only on the juvenile court judge.\n\u201cProperly operated, the juvenile system is capable of giving understanding and sympathetic treatment for each juvenile by providing the correctional, rehabilitative and instructional attention appropriate to each case.\u201d Terry Appeal, 438 Pa. 339, 349, 265 A.2d 350, 355 (1970), aff\u2019d sub. nom. Terry v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971). Because the master system established by section 6305 of the Judicial Code is an appropriate, constitutional means of effectively allocating professional and judicial resources within our system of juvenile justice, the order of the Superior Court must be affirmed.\nOrder affirmed.\n. Section 6305(a) authorizes this Court to \u201cpromulgate rules for the selection and appointment of masters on a full-time or part-time basis,\u201d and provides that masters are to be \u201cmember[s] of the bar of this Commonwealth.\u201d Subsection (b) of section 6305 provides that \u201c[t]he court of common pleas may direct that hearings in any case or class of cases be conducted in the first instance by the master in the manner provided in this chapter [(Chapter 63 \u2014 \u2018Juvenile Matters\u2019) ].\u201d\n. Section 6305(b) provides in relevant part:\n\u201cBefore commencing the hearing the master shall inform the parties who have appeared that they are entitled to have the matter heard by a judge. If a party objects, the hearing shall be conducted by a judge.\u201d\n. Section 6305(c) provides:\n\u201cRecommendations of masters. \u2014 Upon the conclusion of a hearing before a master, he shall transmit written findings and recommendations for disposition to the judge. Prompt written notice and copies of the findings and recommendations shall be given to the parties to the proceeding.\u201d\nThe fact that the master stated, at the close of the hearing on the delinquency petition, that he was \u201cgoing to dismiss the Petition,\u201d is of no consequence for purposes of determining whether appellant was placed in jeopardy at the master\u2019s hearing. As the master\u2019s recommendation demonstrates, the master properly perceived that he was acting pursuant to his statutorily defined role as an advisor, and not as a \u201cjudge.\u201d\n. Rehearings are authorized by subsection (d) of section 6305, which provides:\n\u201cRehearing before judge. \u2014 A rehearing before the judge may be ordered by the judge at any time upon cause shown. Unless a rehearing is ordered, the findings and recommendations [of the master] become the findings and order of the court when confirmed in writing by the judge.\u201d",
