        "text": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an opinion of the Commonwealth Court affirming an order of appellee, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \u201cP.U.C.\u201d), which dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint. The lower court opinion is reported at 66 Pa.Cmwlth. 282, 443 A.2d 1373 (1982).\nAppellants, Gary and Doris Burleson, are the owners of a mobile home located in Smithfield, Pennsylvania. On April 10, 1979, they filed an informal complaint with the Consumer Services Bureau of the P.U.C. claiming that their utility company, West Penn Power Company, the appellee, (hereinafter \u201cWest Penn\u201d) had overcharged them for electric service since January of 1978. The total amount of the alleged overbilling was less than $200.00. After they were denied relief, appellants retained counsel and filed a formal complaint with the P.U.C. dated October 9, 1979 claiming that they had been chronically overbilled from January, 1978 through June, 1979.\nAn Administrative Law Judge heard arguments on the complaint and denied appellants relief by decision dated July 17, 1980. Appellants filed exceptions which were subsequently argued and dismissed. Appeal was then taken to the P.U.C. which affirmed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision after oral arguments were heard in an opinion dated December 11, 1980. Subsequently, appellants appealed to the Commonwealth Court which affirmed the P.U.C. We now affirm.\nIn a complaint for overbilling by a customer of a public utility, the legislature has placed the burden of proof upon the complainant. See 66 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 332(a). The P.U.C. promulgated a rule in Malcom Waldron v. P.U.C., C-77100047, which provided that in such proceedings a complainant may establish a prima facie case that can not be defeated, in limine, by the complainant\u2019s failure to prove the utility\u2019s meter was misread or otherwise inaccurate. Recognizing that technical expertise to test meter accuracy may not be available to a complainant, the P.U.C. in Waldron established other evidentiary criteria for determination upon the whole record of whether a complainant has established a prima facie case.\nUnder these requirements, a complainant may establish a prima facie case by showing that his power usage for the billing period in question was unchanged from earlier periods and his bill for the same period was higher than previous bills. The burden of going forward, not the burden of proof, as appellants\u2019 erroneously contend, then shifts to the utility which must rebut the complainant\u2019s case with co-equal evidence. Under Waldron the fact finder measures the weight of all the evidence so that the mere proof by the utility that its power measuring devices were accurate is no longer the sole determinant as to whether there is a basis to a complaint of overbilling.\nThus, essentially the Waldron Rule is an evidentiary device by which a utility customer\u2019s complaint of overbilling is protected from dismissal during the early stages of litigation. Even if the rule\u2019s requirements are met, a complainant remains obligated to prove his case after the utility presents its rebuttal evidence. Therefore, unless a utility customer\u2019s complaint is dismissed for his failure to establish a prima facie case, the applicability of Waldron at the appeal stage of litigation is irrelevant. Here, appellants\u2019 case was dismissed for their failure to meet the required burden of proof, not because they failed to establish a prima facie case under the Waldron rule. The Commonwealth Court, consequently, properly disregarded the rule and confined its scope of review to the question of whether appellants met the required burden of proof. See 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704. See also, Norfolk and Western Railway Co. v. P.U.C., 489 Pa. 109, 413 A.2d 1037 (1980) (providing that the scope of appellate review of administrative agencies is to determine if there is substantial evidence in the record to support the lower tribunal\u2019s findings, whether there was an error of law or abuse of discretion or whether constitutional rights were violated). We agree with the Commonwealth Court that appellants\u2019 failed to meet their burden.\nAppellants retained the services of Dr. Charles Claar who testified that the Burleson\u2019s power usage for the period in question did not significantly change from prior patterns despite the abnormally high bills which they received from West Penn. On cross-examination he stated that certain factors such as \u201ca ground fault\u201d or \u201ctheft\u201d may have explained the increase of appellants\u2019 power use during the period in question. On redirect, he explained that these possibilities were remote.\nWest Penn presented numerous exhibits and expert testimony establishing that the power measuring devices were accurate and that voltage fluctuation, which appellants\u2019 alleged was a factor in causing the disputed increase, had no impact on the meter readings. West Penn also established that appellants\u2019 neighbors did not experience the same difficulties that affected the Burlesons\u2019.\nAppellants claim the evidence presented by appellee was insufficient to meet West Penn\u2019s burden of going forward to rebut the Burleson\u2019s prima facie case under Waldron and that, as a consequence, they should have prevailed. The crucial flaw in this argument is its failure to distinguish between the processes of establishing a prima facie case and meeting the required burden of proof.\nWhereas a litigant establishes a prima facie case by producing enough evidence to support a cause of action, the burden of proof is met when the elements of that cause of action are proven with substantial evidence which enables the party asserting the cause of action to prevail, precluding all reasonable inferences to the contrary. See Lear v. Shirk\u2019s Motor Express Corp., 397 Pa. 144, 152 A.2d 883 (1959). See also, Pastuszek v. Murphy Plywood Corp., 219 Pa. Super. 59, 280 A.2d 644 (1971).\nIn the instant matter, appellants may have presented enough evidence with Dr. Claar\u2019s testimony to support a prima facie case under Waldron. However, when the evidence presented by both parties is viewed as a whole, it is clear that the P.U.C. could properly have concluded that the Burlesons did not meet the required burden of proof.\nWest Penn complied with its burden under Waldron and presented more than mere proof that its meter accurately measured appellant\u2019s power usage. It also established, among other facts, that voltage fluctuations did not influence power meter readings, that appellants\u2019 neighbors were unaffected by the problems of which appellants\u2019 complained and that, according to Dr. Claar, \u201ctheft\u201d or a \u201cground fault\u201d may have caused the disputed increase.\nThe lower court, exercising its scope of review under Norfolk, balanced West Penn\u2019s evidence with Dr. Claar\u2019s testimony and concluded that the weight of evidence supported West Penn\u2019s position. In view of the fact that appellant\u2019s did little more than attempt to establish a prima facie case, there is no basis upon which to disturb this conclusion.\nAccepting appellants\u2019 position would require that this Court elevate the Waldron decision beyond its status as an administrative rule of evidence to the level of a substantive principle. When applied, this principle would enable a utility customer complaining of overbilling to prevail merely by presenting enough evidence to support a prima facie case. Such a conclusion would ignore the fact that there is a clear distinction between the weight of evidence required -to support a prima facie case and the weight necessary to meet a complainant\u2019s burden of proof. We can not disregard this distinction.\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion in which LARSEN and HUTCHINSON, JJ., join.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142 \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 724(a).",

The statutory burden [see 66 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 332(a) ] is satisfied when a complainant offers evidence that his consumption of power during the time segment in question did not cause the excessive usage in dispute. The error of the Commonwealth Court and the majority\u2019s opinion today is that they implicitly place the obligation upon the complainant of proving an act or an omission of the utility as being responsible for the excessive use. In other words, the thrust of today\u2019s opinion requires the complainant to identify the cause of the excessive usage. Such a burden goes beyond the statutory directive and is clearly unfair.\nI, therefore, dissent and would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nLARSEN and HUTCHINSON, JJ., join in this dissenting opinion.",
