        "text": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nWe have before us the consolidated cases of Appeal of Chartiers Valley, No. 19 W.D. Appeal Docket 1983; John L. Crown v. Township of Ross, No. 20 W.D. Appeal Docket 1983; Robert M. Muchenski v. Township of Ross, No. 21 W.D. Appeal Docket 1983; and, Daniel M. Daley v. Township of Ross, No. 22 W.D. Appeal Docket. The common issue presented by these cases is whether the thirty day period set forth in Section 5571(b) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5571(b), defines the appeal period of all statutory appeals, regardless of specific provisions contained in individual statutes.\nThe appeals of Crown, Muchenski, and Daley (Nos. 20, 21 and 22) involve Section 645 of the First Class Township Code, 53 P.S. \u00a7 55645. That section provides, that in an appeal from a Civil Service Commission decision, which involves the suspension, removal or reduction in rank of a policeman or fireman, \u201c[S]uch appeal shall be taken within sixty days from the date of entry by the commission of its final order.\u201d Id.\nThese appellants were either suspended or removed from the police force of the Township of Ross. In each case, appeals were filed to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. The appeals were filed more than thirty days, but less than sixty days, after the date of entry of the Commission\u2019s orders. The court of common pleas quashed the appeals.\nThe Commonwealth Court, in an unanimous decision, per Williams, J., affirmed. Upon petition to this Court, we granted allocatur.\nThe appeal of Chartiers Valley School District raises the same issue in a different factual context. On June 26,1981, the Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review of Allegheny County, reduced the assessment of property owned by Development Divisions International, Inc. On August 13, 1981% forty-eight days later, Chartiers Valley School District filed an appeal from the reduced assessment to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County.\nThe property owner filed a motion to quash this appeal, asserting that the appeal was untimely under Section 5571(b) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5571(b). Appellant contended that the appeal period in tax assessment cases was controlled by Section 518.1 of the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-518.1, and Section 12 of the Assessment in Counties of Second Class Act, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5452.12. Both sections provided for a sixty day appeal period. The motion to quash was denied.\nOn appeal the Commonwealth Court reversed, relying on their opinion in Crown v. Ross Township, 68 Pa.Cmwlth. 588, 449 A.2d 878 (1982) and ordered the appeal quashed. Upon petition to this Court, we granted allocatur, and ordered this case consolidated with the appeals of Crown, et a1.\nThe Judicial Code was created by the Judiciary Act of 1976, which, in conjunction with the Judiciary Act Repealer Act (JARA) and the Judiciary Act Repealer Act of 1980 (JARA 80), represented \u201cthe culmination of a ten year effort to achieve the first complete judicial codification in Pennsylvania\u2019s history.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 101 to 1700, p. vii (1981).\nAlthough the Judicial Code was enacted in 1976, it did not take effect until June 27, 1978, the effective date of JARA. The primary purpose of JARA (and the Subsequent JARA 80), was to repeal those statutes which had been supplanted by the Code. To this end, Section 2(a) of JARA, 42 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 20002(a), expressly repealed parts or all of more than 1500 statutes, comprising approximately 6000 sections of Purdon\u2019s Pennsylvania Statutes, enacted between 1700 and 1977. In addition to this express repealer, Section 2(g), 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 20002(g) provided:\nAll other parts of those acts which are specified in this section and all other acts and parts of acts are hereby repealed insofar as they are in any manner inconsistent with this act or the act to which this is a supplement.\nAppellants argue that Section 5571(b) is inapplicable where a specific appeal period has been provided by an applicable statute, and that statute has not been specifically repealed. Section 5571(b) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 5571(b) provides:\n\u00a7 5571. Appeals generally\n(b) Other courts. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (a) and (c), an appeal from a tribunal or other government unit to a court or from a court to an appellate court must be commenced within 30 days after the entry of the order from which the appeal is taken, in the case of an interlocutory or final order.\nGiven the overriding purpose of the Judicial Code, the obvious intent of the legislature in enacting this section was to make uniform the appeal period applicable to cases heard by our courts.\nSection 1971 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1971 provides:\n\u00a7 1971. Implied repeal by later statute\n(a) Whenever a statute purports to be a revision of all statutes upon a particular subject, or sets up a general or exclusive system governing the entire subject matter of a former statute and is intended as a substitute for such former statute, such statute shall be construed to supply and therefore to repeal all former statutes upon the same subject.\n(b) Whenever a general statute purports to establish a uniform and mandatory system covering a class of subjects, such statute shall be construed to supply and therefore to repeal pre-existing local or special statutes on the same class of subjects.\nClearly, under this section, Section 5571 accomplished the implied repeal of the sixty day sections relied upon by appellants, and the fact that these sections were not specifically repealed is of no consequence. Thus appellants\u2019 arguments must fail.\nWe therefore affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nLARSEN, J., dissents and would make the majority result prospective only.\n. An additional case, Mesta Machine Company v. Borough of West Homestead, No. 24 W.D. Appeal Docket 1983, was originally consolidated with these cases, but was subsequently removed at the request of the appellant therein.\n. Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142 \u00a7 2.\n. Act of June 24, 1931, P.L. 1206, art. VI as amended by Act of June 3, 1971, P.L. 133, No. 6 \u00a7 1, 53 P.S. \u00a7 55645.\n. Appellants Crown and Daley were dismissed, and appellant Muchenski was suspended, on February 11, 1980, by official action of the Board of Township Commissioners of the Township of Ross. After hearings on May 27, 31, June 1, 3, 7, 10, 12, 18, 19, 25, 28 and 30, 1980, the Commission entered orders sustaining the decisions of the Board of Commissioners. The Commission\u2019s orders were entered on August 11, 1980. Appellants filed their appeals on October 9, 1980.\n. Crown v. Ross Township, 68 Pa.Cmwlth. 588, 449 A.2d 878 (1982).\n. Act of May 22, 1933, P.L. 853 \u00a7 1 et seq., as amended.\n. Act of June 21, 1939, P.L. 626 \u00a7 1 et seq., as amended.\n. In re Appeal of Chartiers Valley School District, 68 Pa.Cmwlth. 592, 450 A.2d 230 (1982).\n. Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202, No. 53 \u00a7 1 et seq.\n. At the times of these appeals, none of the statutory sections here in question had been specifically repealed. However, since that time, the sixty day appeal period in Section 518.1 of the General County Tax Assessment Act, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-518.1, and Section 12 of the Assessment in Counties of Second Class Act, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5452.12, were repealed. See Act of Dec. 20,1982, P.L. 1409 No. 326, art. Ill \u00a7\u00a7 302; 305.\n. Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1339, No. 290 \u00a7 3.\n. Appellant, Chartiers Valley School District, raised an additional argument, i.e., that the tax assessment board was not a \u201cgovernment unit\u201d within 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5571(b), and therefore was not affected by the thirty day appeal mandate. This argument is wholly merit-less. A tax assessment board, as created by 72 P.S. \u00a7 5452.1, clearly falls within the definition of government unit as that term is defined 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 102.",
