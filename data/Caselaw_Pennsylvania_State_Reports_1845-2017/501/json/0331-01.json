        "text": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn April 17,1974, appellee C. Alton Wade, Jr. was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five to ten years. On appeal, this Court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in failing to produce one Sam Stearly as an alibi witness at trial. Commonwealth v. Wade, 480 Pa. 160, 389 A.2d 560 (1978). After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the court of common pleas concluded that trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview Sam Stearly and to call him as an alibi witness constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and granted appellee a new trial. This direct appeal by the Commonwealth followed.\nThe Commonwealth contends that trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to produce Sam Stearly at trial because Sam Stearly could not have provided an alibi for appellee even if he had testified. We agree.\n\u201cThe test of constitutionally effective assistance of counsel is whether a \u2018particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests\u2019.\u201d Commonwealth v. Upsher, 497 Pa. 621, 626, 444 A.2d 90, 92 (1982) (emphasis in original; citation omitted).\nWith respect to the course chosen by counsel in this case \u2014 failing to interview and call Sam Stearly as an alibi witness \u2014 \u201c[i]t is well-settled that the failure of trial counsel to call a potential alibi witness does not constitute ineffective assistance unless there is some showing that the testimony of the absent witness would have been helpful in establishing the asserted defense.\u201d Commonwealth v. Leonard, 499 Pa. 357, 362, 453 A.2d 587, 589 (1982). See also Upsher, supra 497 Pa. at 626, 444 A.2d at 92 (\u201cThe initial factor that is considered in applying this standard is whether the matters counsel is charged with failing to competently pursue had arguable merit.\u201d).\nIn this case, there was no showing that the testimony of Sam Stearly would have helped appellee establish an alibi defense. \u201cAlibi is a defense that places the defendant at the relevant time in a different place than the scene involved and so removed therefrom as to render it impossible for him to be the guilty party.\u201d Commonwealth v. Whiting, 409 Pa. 492, 498,187 A.2d 563, 566 (1963). In this regard, the record reveals the following facts.\nAppellee was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for \u201cstomping\u201d on the abdomen of two-year-old Daniel Strong, the son of the woman with whom appellee was then living, thus causing his death. At trial, Daniel\u2019s mother Regina Strong testified that on December 1, 1973, she brought Daniel into appellee\u2019s and her bedroom \u201csomewheres around four o\u2019clock\u201d; that appellee was in the bedroom at the time; that after Regina Strong took Daniel to the bathroom, she brought him back into the bedroom where he was hit several times with a \u201chorse crop\u201d; that he was taken back to the bathroom for five more minutes; and that he was then brought back to the bedroom, hit several more times with the \u201chorse crop,\u201d and, finally, \u201cstomped.\u201d Michele Sauvage, who also lived in the house with appellee and Regina Strong, testified that some time \u201cbetween two-thirty and three-thirty\u201d she saw Regina Strong take Daniel into the bedroom; that she heard appellee\u2019s voice coming from the bedroom; that she then heard the sounds of leather hitting skin and Daniel crying; and that these sounds continued for twenty to twenty-five minutes.\nBased upon this testimony, an alibi witness for appellee would have to place appellee outside the house and away from Daniel from 2:30 until approximately 4:30 on December 1. The record fails to reveal how Sam Stearly could provide this alibi, however.\nAt the post-trial evidentiary hearing, Sam Stearly testified that he went to appellee\u2019s farm to pick up a chain saw from appellee; that he did not remember what time he arrived at the farm, although it was light outside; that he first went to the house where he saw a lady with a child in underpants or diapers and where he met appellee; and that he stayed at the farm \u201cover an hour, considerably, probably.\u201d Also at the hearing, appellee testified that Sam Stearly had come to the farm to get a chain saw; that he had told his attorney \u201cthat [Sam Stearly] did come to the farm, what he was there for, and that he would substantiate parts of the day, or where I [appellee] was at\u201d; that he recalled that Sam Stearly was at the farm around 4:00 or 4:30 on December 1; that he did not recall where on the farm he met Sam Stearly; and that although Sam Stearly came to visit him in prison prior to the trial, he never informed Stearly that he might be called as a witness at trial.\nThis testimony indicates that neither Sam Stearly nor appellee could state what time Sam Stearly arrived at the farm, how long he stayed, what he did during the time he was at the farm, whether appellee was with him the entire time, or when he left.\nSuch testimony is certainly not sufficient to prove that appellee was in a different place than Daniel and so far removed as to make it impossible for him to have been \u201cdisciplining\u201d Daniel at any time between 2:30 and 4:30 on the afternoon of December 1. We will not speculate as to appellee\u2019s whereabouts during this period of time based upon this meager testimony, nor will we assume that the testimony at a new trial would be any more revealing than was the testimony at the post-trial evidentiary hearing.\nNor does this lack of information appear to be simply the result of the passage of time between the date of appellee\u2019s trial in 1974 and the date of the evidentiary hearing in 1978. At trial, appellee took the stand and testified extensively as to the events and his movements on December 1. Nevertheless, even in response to general questions about his activities and more specific questions as to who was in the barn during the day, appellee never mentioned the name of Sam Stearly, nor did he mention meeting anyone concerning a chain saw.\nAppellee has failed to meet his burden of proving that Sam Stearly\u2019s testimony at trial could have established an alibi defense, and hence that counsel was ineffective. See Commonwealth v. McKenna, 498 Pa. 416, 421, 446 A.2d 1274, 1276 (1982).\nAccordingly, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County granting appellee a new trial is reversed and the judgment of sentence is reinstated.\nROBERTS, C.J., concurs in the result.\n. Three couples \u2014 appellee and Regina Strong, Andrew Ogorzalek and Charlene Hyatt, and Keith McPhee and Michele Sauvage \u2014 and several children were living in the house on appellee\u2019s farm on December 1, 1973. The farm premises consisted of the house, a bam and a garage.",
