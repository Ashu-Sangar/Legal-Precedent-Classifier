        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\nconcurring and dissenting.\nI join the majority in affirming the order of the Superior Court at No. 16 M.D. Appeal Docket, 1982, granting a new trial due to the lower court\u2019s erroneous exclusions of medical testimony regarding the plaintiff\u2019s need for future surgery and of a motion picture depicting the plaintiff in physical therapy.\nHowever, I dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmance at No. 15 M.D. Appeal Docket, 1982, of the Superior Court\u2019s interpretation of the Pennsylvania No-Fault Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.-101 et seq., as abolishing the right of a plaintiff to recover punitive damages in an action arising from a motor vehicle accident.\nInitially, we are faced with the unfortunate consideration that, as with practically every case involving the interpretation of the No-Fault Act, the intention of its drafters is far from clear. Because of this pervasive ambiguity, and because, in my opinion, any enactment (or interpretation) which abolishes a common-law recognized remedy or cause of action without providing a substitute, statutory remedy or cause of action runs afoul of Article I, \u00a7 11 of our Constitution, see dissenting opinion of this author in Carroll v. York, 496 Pa. 363, 437 A.2d 394, 399 (1981) (joined by Flaherty and Kauffman, JJ.), I would hold that absent specific and explicit provisions to the contrary, any cause of action or remedy pre-dating the No-Fault Act, including punitive damages, remains in existence today. Thus, I would resolve all ambiguity in favor of no abolition and continued recognition of common-law remedies and causes of action.\nI believe that such ambiguity exists regarding the effect of No-Fault upon recovery for punitive damages. Section 301(a) of the Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.301(a), provides in part:\nPartial Abolition \u2014 Tort Liability is abolished with respect to any injury that takes place in this State in accordance with the provisions of this Act if such injury arises out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, except that:\n(3) An individual remains liable for intentionally injuring himself or another individual.\nI would find punitive damages recoverable under \u00a7 301(a)(3). Punitive damages are appropriate to punish the actor for outrageous conduct, i.e. conduct exhibiting a bad motive or reckless indifference to the rights of others. Chambers v. Montgomery, 411 Pa. 339, 192 A.2d 355 (1963). See also Fugagli v. Camasi, 426 Pa. 1, 229 A.2d 735 (1967) and Focht v. Rabada, 217 Pa.Super. 35, 268 A.2d 157 (1970). For purposes of the No-Fault Act, I would hold that \u201cintentional injury\u201d includes the willful and reckless disregard for the safety, welfare and rights of others and would therefore hold the defendant\u2019s outrageous conduct in this case \u2014 driving his car through a posted school zone which had caution lights flashing at a speed at least twice the speed limit of 25 m.p.h. \u2014 renders him \u201cliable for intentionally injuring . . . another individual\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 301(a)(3).\nI would further hold that punitive damages are subsumed within the category of \u201cnonreimbursable tort fine.\u201d Section 301(b) provides:\nNonreimbursable tort fine \u2014 -Nothing in this section shall be construed to immunize an individual from liability to pay a fine on the basis of fault in any proceeding based upon any act or omission arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle: Provided, That such fine may not be paid or reimbursed by an insurer or other restoration obligor.\nBoth the trial court and the Superior Court recognized that, unless \u201cnonreimbursable tort fine\u201d is read to include punitive damages, the term, at present, would have no meaning in Pennsylvania. The Superior Court stated, 296 Pa.Super. 205, 442 A.2d 731:\nThere is little doubt that, on its face, this provision admits of no ready interpretation, especially since the term \u201ctort fine\u201d appears to have been coined. In that regard, we empathize with the trial judge when he stated he did not know what a tort fine was.\nThe Superior Court recognized that\nPunitive damages are, in a manner of speaking, a penalty or fine imposed upon a person for engaging in particularly egregious conduct, payable to a victim as a kind of windfall, at least in the sense that the punitive damages are paid in addition to damages necessary to make the victim whole. See C. McCormick, Damages \u00a7 77 (1935); D. Dobbs, Remedies \u00a7 3.9 (1973); Restatement of Torts, 2d \u00a7 908, comment a. Id.\nYet, despite this recognition, the Superior Court chose to leave the term \u201cnonreimbursable tort fine\u201d essentially meaningless and unexplained. The basis of this interpretation, which is contrary to the canon of statutory construction presuming that the General Assembly desires the entire statute to be effective, Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 1921(a), is that the legislative history of proposed federal no-fault legislation indicated that punitive damages were not intended to be covered by the National No-Fault Motor Vehicle Act Senate Committee\u2019s definition of \u201ctort fine.\u201d\nThe history of this proposed federal legislation offers dubious support for the Superior Court\u2019s interpretation. Even assuming, arguendo, however, that the lengthy passages quoted by the Superior Court were relevant to the interpretation of Pennsylvania\u2019s No-Fault Act, it seems to me they support a contrary conclusion. Those passages indicated the term \u201cfine\u201d does not mean solely a criminal penalty, but also includes \u201cany charge, levy, assessment, order, condition or requirement that may be imposed 'in any proceeding.\u2019 \u201d 296 Pa.Super. 205, 442 A.2d 731, quoting Report of the Senate Committee on Commerce, No. 93-382, Calendar No. 358 (August 15, 1973) at 73-74. The reason why punitive damages were not considered by that federal legislative panel on proposed federal legislation to be within the broad definition of \u201ctort fine\u201d was \u201cin part because under some case law decisions awards for punitive damages may be paid by liability insurance, a practice which vitiates the purpose of a punitive damages judgment.\u201d Id.\nIn Pennsylvania, however, it has been established that payment of punitive damages is not reimbursable by an insurance company as such reimbursement would be contrary to public policy. Edmond v. Liscio, 209 Pa. Super. 200, 224 A.2d 793 (1966); See also Wilson v. Maryland Casualty Co., 377 Pa. 588, 105 A.2d 304 (1954). Accordingly, nonreimbursable punitive damages should be held to be within the meaning of \u00a7 301(b) \u201cnonreimbursable tort fine.\u201d A contrary interpretation renders that section void of meaning.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I dissent and would reverse the order of the Superior Court at No. 15 M.D. Appeal Docket, 1982.",
