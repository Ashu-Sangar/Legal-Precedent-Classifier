Raudenbush took a direct appeal challenging the propriety of the lower court’s ruling, to this Court pursuant to the Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, § 2, eff. June 27, 1978, as amended, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 722(2), which confers on this Court the exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of Courts of Common Pleas in cases involving the right to public office.</p>

      <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>Traverse urges this appeal be quashed as premature on the basis that no final judgment was entered pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1038(e). Rule 1038(e) provides in pertinent part:</p>

    <p id="b440-5" data-blocks='[["BL_440.6",440,[266,746,1153,149]]]'>It is true that neither of the parties praeciped for entry of final judgment under Rule 1038(e). However, Traverse overlooks Pa.R.C.P. 1039, which provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b440-6" data-blocks='[["BL_440.7",440,[307,909,1111,254]]]'>In addition to the provisions of any Rule of Civil Procedure or Act of Assembly authorizing the prothonotary to enter judgment upon praecipe of a party, the prothonotary shall enter judgment upon praecipe of a party in the following instances:</blockquote>

    <p id="ATr" data-blocks='[["BL_440.9",440,[265,1350,1153,573]]]'>The meaning of Rule 1039 is clear: When the court does not <em>itself </em>enter judgment, in order to obtain a final judgment the parties must themselves praecipe the prothonotary to enter judgment. However, where, as here, the court does enter judgment, there is a final judgment in the case, and there is obviously no need for the parties to further praecipe the prothonotary to do what has already been accomplished. In the instant case the trial court did not simply render a verdict or preliminary decision as contemplated by Rule 1038; rather, it entered a judgment which was final and appealable.</p>

At a special meeting on January 3, 1980, the Board of Supervisors of Lower Southampton Township appointed Traverse to fill the vacancy resulting from the expiration of Graczyk’s term. Subsequently, on January 7, 1980, a newly constituted Board of Supervisors appointed Raudenbush to fill the vacancy caused by the expiration of Graczyk’s term. The Authority Board seated Traverse and refused to seat Raudenbush. Raudenbush argues the January third appointment of Traverse contravened the provision of the 1978 amendment to Section 7 providing for appointments to fill vacancies only after the vacancies occur, and is, therefore, a nullity.</p>

The Board of Township Supervisors did not have the power at the time they made that appointment to extend his term to January 7, 1980 and therefore that portion of the motion is mere surplus-age. The amendment does not purport to change the terms of incumbents and therefore his term ended at midnight on December 31,1979. Therefore, on January 3, 1980 there was a vacancy which the then incumbent Board <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>of Township Supervisors had the right and power to fill. When they appointed defendant Thomas Traverse they were appropriately filling the vacancy.

In that case, the plaintiff brought an action for no-fault insurance benefits by means of a Petition and Rule to Show Cause. The Superior Court held that the proper procedure was to file a praecipe for a writ of summons, a complaint, or an agreement for an amicable action. However, any objection to the procedure was waived by not being raised.
