    <p id="b619-6" data-blocks='[["BL_619.7",619,[169,789,1152,1217]]]'>The evidence offered by the Commonwealth in support of the verdict was supplied by one Rudy Platt, an eyewitness to the event, and Gerald Woodson, a friend of appellant. Appellant and Platt went to the home of the victim, William Watkins, on September 2,1978 for a social visit. After their arrival at the Watkins’ home, which was located on Broad Street in North Philadelphia, the three men began smoking marijuana. Mr. Watkins proceeded to show his guest a pistol that he had recently purchased because he “was having some trouble with some people.” The weapon was placed on the floor beside where he was sitting and he began preparing another marijuana cigarette. Appellant seized possession of the gun and fatally shot Watkins three times, when he attempted to retrieve the pistol. Platt and appellant fled to the house of Gerald Woodson. At Woodson’s home appellant told Woodson that he had “pulled a heist” at a place on Broad Street. Appellant had concealed the weapon in a shirt. Appellant and Platt exited the Wood-son’s home through the rear door. Later that night appellant was seen retrieving the shirt in which the weapon had been concealed, from the alley behind the Woodson’s home. Appellant eluded apprehension until May 1979. The weapon was not recovered.</p>

      <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>Under the well defined standard for assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> it is eminently clear that the evidence supports the finding that there was a robbery and that the object taken was Watkins’ pistol. There is no suggestion in either the Commonwealth’s or the defense’s version of the facts that any animosity or bad will existed between appellant and the victim when appellant visited the home of Watkins on September 2. To the contrary they went pursuant to an invitation of Watkins. The evidence also fails to disclose any basis for concluding that a disagreement had arisen during the visit prior to the display of the weapon. The testimony is uncontradicted that the situation was harmonious up to the point when the weapon was revealed. It was certainly a reasonable inference that the shooting occurred because of appellant’s intention to deprive the victim of possession of the gun. The fact that appellant removed the weapon from the scene and attempted to secrete it, that he has failed to return it or disclose its whereabouts all reflect his intention to maintain dominion and control over it permanently.

The fact that no money was taken or other items of value removed from the home is of no consequence. The <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>Commonwealth proved that appellant robbed the victim of his gun. He seized the gun without permission; he shot the victim thereby precluding Mr. Watkins from retrieving it, and he was later seen with the weapon by Mr. Woodson. Moreover, shortly after the event, the appellant stated that he had “pulled a heist,” a slang expression for committing a robbery.</p>
    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[212,730,1145,493]]]'>Equally without foundation is the contention that the intention to rob was formed after the killing. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
