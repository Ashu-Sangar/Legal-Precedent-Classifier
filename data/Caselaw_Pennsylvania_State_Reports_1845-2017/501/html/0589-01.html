He was originally tried on these charges on March 18, 1980. This trial ended on March 22, 1980, when a mistrial was declared due to a jury deadlock. The declaration of mistrial was objected to by appellant’s counsel. Thereafter, new charges were filed, and appellant filed a “Motion for Dismissal of Charges”, asserting double jeopardy as a bar to retrial. This motion was denied and on May 5, 1980, appellant’s second trial was begun.</p>

The trial court denied these motions, and appellant was sentenced to a prison term of not less than two years, nor more than fifty-nine and a half months, plus a fine of $2,500.00 on the voluntary manslaughter charge. He was also given identical prison terms on the other two charges, with all sentences to run concurrently. This appeal followed.</p>

Nevertheless, the majority fails to appreciate that the initial error was significantly exacerbated by the court’s direction allowing the picture to be taken out with the jury during their deliberations. The majority attempts to suggest that this photograph did not possess the same emotive qualities as those in <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. 391</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d 155</a> (1981). However, this argument rings hollow in view of the Commonwealth’s concession that the only purpose for offering the photograph was “to show what kind of man he (the victim) was.” There are many instances where the defense of self defense is being raised and a picture of this nature, depicting the victim in the most favorable circumstances, could be highly prejudicial. I concur in the instant result only because of the overwhelming weight of the evidence supporting the verdict reached by the jury.</p>
