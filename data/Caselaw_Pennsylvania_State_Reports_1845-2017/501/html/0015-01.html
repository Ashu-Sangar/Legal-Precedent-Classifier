Accordingly, every judicial proceeding must not only be fair; it must <em>appear </em>to be fair. As the same considerations that lead the majority to conclude that appellant is entitled to resentencing by a different judge apply with equal force to the trial stage of the proceedings, appellant should be granted a new trial by a judge whose impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned.</p>
