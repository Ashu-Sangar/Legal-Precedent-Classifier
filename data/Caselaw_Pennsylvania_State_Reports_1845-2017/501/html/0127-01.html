I find its reasoning, developed in <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>the context of a full adversary proceeding entirely persuasive on the issue. The words of our Constitution plainly direct confidentiality of proceedings before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, unless there is a recommendation for discipline upon the Board’s finding of good cause. Article Y, Section 18(g). It is that finding of good cause which triggers our jurisdiction under Article V, Section 18(h).</p>
