The notes specify that each was to be paid in four equal installments commencing on March 28 of the year in which each note was due. The second, third and fourth notes specify additionally that interest on the unpaid balance of each is “payable beginning March 28, 1977 and each succeeding quarterly period thereafter until the principal is paid. ...” At the time the complaint was filed, two quarterly payments on the first note had been made in the amount of $43,766.50, the complaint alleged defaults in payment of principal on the first note and defaults in payment of interest on the others, and presumably because of an acceleration clause also contained in each of the notes, the amount of the judgment entered was $306,365.50, which represented the unpaid balance of all four notes.</p>

Such an argument is particularly plausible in this case since Parliament’s brief in the “Order in Question” section states that both orders are involved in the appeal; and because Parliament in its “Statement of the Case” section declares: “The appeal to the Supreme Court is only on the Order of the Superior Court reducing the second judgment by the amount of $262,599.” Notwithstanding these difficulties, we recognize that confusion has been generated by old Rule 1701,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and a <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>plain reading of old Rule 1113 gives Parliament a right to appeal from “the order . .. sought to be reviewed” within 30 days, whether or not he had preserved his right to petition for allowance of appeal from the first order of December 1, 1980.

It is our view, however, that the complaint must be considered in conjunction with the Confession of Judgment and that the appearance on the Confession of Judgment of a blank space where a dollar amount of interest should appear following an indication that 7% interest is due signifies merely that an appropriate amount is to be calculated and entered. <em>Compare, Roche v. Rankin, </em><a href="/pa/406/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="406 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1304859" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0092-01">406 Pa. 92</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%20668" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="176 A.2d 668">176 A.2d 668</a> (1962) (Although a judgment by confession must be self-sustaining and cannot be entered where matters outside of the record must be considered to support it, an affidavit of default does not constitute matters outside the record.)</p>

It goes without saying that such a conclusion would be absurd. Accordingly, we hold that when a proceeding to enter judgment by confession is commenced by the filing of a complaint, the complaint and the Confession of Judgment are to be read together in determining whether there are defects apparent on the face of the record, and that in the present case, because Parliament has adequately pleaded that there was a delinquency in payments of interest and principal on the four promissory <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>notes in this case, the trial court was correct in dismissing Vaughan’s petition to strike, since the judgment is not defective on the face. Other defenses, if there are such, may be properly raised on the petition to open judgment.</p>
    <p id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[192,555,1148,1394]]]'>Finally, in order to explain fully our conclusion that no defects appear on the face of the record, we must discuss the acceleration provisions of the notes, for neither the trial court nor the Superior Court has treated these provisions adequately. The trial court decided that since all four notes arose from a single transaction, a default in one note would accelerate the amounts due under all the notes. The Superi- or Court disagreed with this position, as do we. In the absence of specific language in the notes providing for the acceleration of the debt in <em>all </em>notes when there is a default in one note, the debt may not be accelerated except as to the note in default, regardless of the fact that there are other notes between the parties and regardless of the fact that the other notes were made at one time as a part of one transaction. Had the parties intended that a default on one note would accelerate the entire debt related to the underlying transaction, they could have done this in a number of ways, e.g., by drafting one promissory note instead of four, or by stating in the notes that default on one triggers acceleration of the others. The parties did not provide for such a total acceleration, and thus a court is powerless to impose it. <em>Compare, Lincoln Bank v. C &amp; H Agency, </em><a href="/pa/500/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="500 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="1781161" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0294-01">500 Pa. 294</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="500 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="1781161" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0294-01">456 A.2d 136</a> (1982), (The debt on a one-day judgment note cannot be expanded to include other debts beyond the loan underlying that particular note in the absence of specific language providing for such expanded liability.)</p>

In pertinent part, as quoted above, notes 2, 3, and 4 provide that interest on these notes is “payable beginning March 28, <em>1977,” </em>even though installments on the principal amounts are not payable until March 28 of years <em>1978, 1979 </em>and <em>1980 </em>respectively.
