As in <em>Jennings, </em>trial counsel here made no objection to the charge when given the opportunity to do so. The Appellant’s entire defense was based on the theory that the Commonwealth’s witnesses had misidentified DeBose. There was no evidence consistent with both an intent to kill and voluntary manslaughter.

As noted, in the context of this trial the charge was not so erroneous and prejudicial as to require granting a new trial. We will not premise a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel solely on failure to object to such a charge. Indeed, we specifically find that trial counsel clearly had a reasonable basis for not objecting designed to effectuate his client’s best interests. Clearly, counsel’s strategy was to convince the .jury that the Commonwealth’s witnesses had misidentified DeBose. This was the aim.of all his cross-examination, his own evidence, and his argument. A corrected charge on voluntary manslaughter could have diverted the jury’s attention from the objective of having the jury choose between a murder conviction and outright <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>acquittal. <em>Compare, Commonwealth v.
