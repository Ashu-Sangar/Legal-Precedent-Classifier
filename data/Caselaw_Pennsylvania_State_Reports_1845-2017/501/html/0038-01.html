Griswold Flagg, Jr., the father of appellants, the trustees filed a petition for adjudication in the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, seeking judicial approval of their proposed distribution of income to testatrix’s grandchildren. Prior to his death, the trustees had divided the income from this trust equally between S. Griswold Flagg, Jr., and appellee Thomas King Flagg, the sole issue of testatrix’s daughter. In their petition for adjudication, the trustees proposed to continue to distribute one half of the income to appellee and to divide the remaining half among appellants, the three children of S. Griswold Flagg, Jr. Appellants objected to the proposed distribution, arguing that the income should be divided equally among all four of testatrix’s grandchildren on a per capita basis. On May 22,1980, the auditing judge (Taxis, J.) held, consistent with the position of appellee, that appellee “is entitled to receive enough income from the Marital Deduction Trust so that what he receives from both trusts equals one-half the aggregate income of both trusts.” On October 31, 1980, the court dismissed appellants’ exceptions <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>and confirmed the adjudication absolutely.

Thus, appellants argue, as there is no longer any “income payable under Item Seventh (c)(1)” for the trustees to take into consideration, testatrix’s stated intention to achieve equality upon the principle of representation must be disregarded and the matter resolved by canons of construction. Alternatively, appellants argue that, if testatrix did intend a stirpital distribution of marital deduction trust income to her grandchildren, that distribution should be made without regard to income payments from Mr. Flagg’s residuary trust made pursuant to Item Seventh (c)(2).</p>

      <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>Appellants’ attempt to read ambiguity or an intended limitation into testatrix’s references to Item Seventh (c)(1) of her husband’s will cannot succeed in the face of testatrix’s clear expression of her intention “to achieve equality of distribution . . . upon the principal [sic] of representation” “through the addition of the income of [the marital deduction] trust to the income of the trust established under Item Seventh (c)(1) of the will of my late husband.” Although testatrix’s husband’s residuary trust is established by Item Seventh in its entirety and not by Item Seventh (c)(1) alone, there is, of course, only one trust that has been established. Absent any evidence to support the assumption that testatrix intended to divide her husband’s single, cohesive trust plan into two separate instruments, testatrix’s reference to “the trust established under Item Seventh (c)(1)” must be read as encompassing the entire residuary trust.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[240,1228,1152,790]]]'>So, too, it is far more reasonable to view testatrix’s direction to her trustees to take “into account the income payable under Item Seventh (c)(1)” as a shorthand reference to all income payable throughout the life of the trust than to infer from this phrase alone that testatrix intended to alter her scheme of distribution dramatically upon the death of her last surviving child. As the auditing judge observed, the initial language of Item Seventh (c)(2), directing that the issue of a deceased child “shall receive, per stirpes, the amount which such child would have received if living,” depends for its meaning on the directions for distributions to children contained in Item Seventh (c)(1). Thus, appellants’ contention that the death of testatrix’s last surviving child rendered testatrix’s reference to Item Seventh (c)(1) of no further effect must be rejected.</p>

It is clear, however, from a reading of the court’s full opinion, as well as from appellee’s position throughout these proceedings, that the court held that appellee is entitled to an amount equivalent to one half of the aggregate income <em>payable to the grandchildren </em>from both trusts, and nothing more.</p>
