Notice of submission of the matter was presented to the supervising judge on January 12, 1983, shortly after the District Attorney of Philadelphia obtained a copy of an audit of the Funds performed by the City Controller. The audit revealed a series of interest-free loans and unexplained transfers of funds, including a payment of $16,000 to “Stout’s Garage,” an auto repair shop owned by petitioner Raymond Stout, whose brother, Earl Stout, is President of District Council 33. Petitioner was held in civil contempt on March 24, 1983, for refusing to testify or to produce documents in accordance with a subpoena issued by the grand jury on January 14.</p>

This contention, however, is premised upon a misreading of the Investigating Grand Jury Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 4541 et seq. Whereas the Act <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>requires that any matter to be submitted to a grand jury be set forth in a notice of submission to the supervising judge, see 42 Pa.C.S. § 4550, the Act permits the empanelment of an investigating grand jury without specific reference to the criminal activity or activities to be investigated, see 42 Pa.C.S. § 4543(b); see generally <em>Appeal of Washington, </em><a href="/pa/490/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="490 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1763773" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0031-01">490 Pa. 31</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="490 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1763773" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0031-01">415 A.2d 17</a> (1980). Indeed, if petitioner’s interpretation of the Act were correct, whenever an investigating grand jury is in operation and additional criminal activity requiring grand jury resources becomes known, a new grand jury would have to be empaneled. Clearly, the Legislature did not intend so costly an expenditure of the public’s time and money. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 4547 (additional grand juries may be applied for “[wjhenever the attorney for the Commonwealth determines that the volume of work of an investigating grand jury exceeds the capacity of the investigating grand jury to discharge its obligations”); see also 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (Legislature does not intend an unreasonable result).</p>

It should be made clear, however, that neither that Act nor our case law supports the notion that an application for empanelment, once approved, is license to submit <em>any </em>investigation through a notice of submission. Subsequent submissions must be shown either to be within the original application for empanelment or meet the jurisdictional predicate for subject matter to be considered by a grand jury. The effect of a contrary interpretation would remove judicial supervision of the investigative process and gives to the district attorney virtual subpoena power. In order to justify the use of the grand jury’s resources in an investigation unrelated to the areas of need set forth in the application for empanelment, the supervising judge must hold the notice of submission to the same standards of facial adequacy and good faith as are imposed upon the initial application.</p>
