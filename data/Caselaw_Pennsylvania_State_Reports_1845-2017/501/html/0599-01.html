Appellant’s counsel raised this issue in his allocatur petition and attempted to raise it at oral argument. However, this issue was never briefed and the Commonwealth argued that it was consequently waived. We agree with the Commonwealth that the failure to brief this issue constitutes a waiver. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 2101; 2116. Were we to address this issue however, we see no error in the rationale employed by the Superior Court. <em>See Commonwealth v.
