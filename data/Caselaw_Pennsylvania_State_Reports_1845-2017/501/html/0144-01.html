DeAngelis, commenced a suit in equity against appellee, Sandra Schultz Newman, Receiver of the Foeroerer Tract Committee, Inc. seeking specific performance of an Agreement of Sale for a certain tract of real estate. On May 6, 1980, replying to appellant’s complaint, appellee filed preliminary objections avering four grounds for relief: (1) objection raising a question of jurisdiction; (2) demurrer; (3) laches; (4) lack of capacity to sue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Two days later appellant filed a notice to take the deposition of appellee by oral examination pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 4007. Appellee responded to the deposition notice with a motion for a protective order. On May 13, 1980 the court entered a Rule against the appellant to show cause why a protective order should not issue. The Rule was made returnable July 18, 1980. Thereafter the appellant filed a reply to appellee’s preliminary objections. On <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>June 11, 1980, the court sua sponta dismissed appellant’s lawsuit with the following order:</p>

Rather the rule is a statement of the requirement of fairness and establishes an affirmative duty courts are bound to follow in applying all procedural rules whether they be statewide or local in origin.” A rule which mandates summary dismissal of a law suit based upon a nonprejudicial procedural error is inconsistent with the fairness required by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

If the defendant-preliminary objector fails to comply, the objections are dismissed and the defendant is free to defend on the merits. If, however, it is the plaintiff-respondent who fails to strictly meet the brief filing time requirement, the lawsuit is dismissed. It may very well be that in a given case, a plaintiff’s lawsuit should be dismissed. However, a dismissal should not be mandatory when a brief is not filed in strict compliance with a local filing requirement. This would conflict with Rule 126 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
