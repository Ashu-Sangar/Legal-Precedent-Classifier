Article II addresses the obligation of a no-fault “obligor,” i.e., insurer, under the Act. Under Article II, the no-fault obligor is required to provide “basic loss benefits” without any inquiry regarding fault. Basic loss benefits are defined as benefits payable for the “net loss” sustained, 40 P.S. § 1009.103. Section 206(a) of Article II concerns the calculation of “net loss.” Under this section, workmen’s compensation benefits are to be deducted from the victim’s “loss” in determining the amount payable by the no-fault obligor:</p>
    <blockquote id="b809-5" data-blocks='[["BL_809.5",809,[208,929,1106,299]]]'>[A]ll benefits or advantages . . . that an individual receives or is entitled to receive from social security . . . <em>workmen’s compensation, </em>any State-required temporary, nonoccupational disability insurance, and all other benefits . . ., shall be subtracted from loss in calculating <em>net loss.</em>

The No-Fault Act compensates work loss to a maximum of $15,000. 40 P.S. § 1009.-202(b)(2). Accordingly, in a <em>non </em>scope-of-employment vehicular accident, a work loss in excess of $15,000 is recoverable from the tortfeasor with no recovery for the first $15,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Where, however, the injury occurs in the scope of employment, the first $15,000 of work loss suffered by the injured will be composed of both workmen’s compensation benefits and no-fault benefits.</p>

Therefore, by combining these benefits, the injured employee receives full compensation for his work loss: typically, sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the first $15,000 of that loss, i.e., $10,000, will be paid to the injured employee by the workmen’s compensation carrier and thirty-three and one-third percent of that loss, i.e., $5,000 will be paid to the injured employee by the no-fault obligor.</p>

Citing Section 206(a)’s requirement that primary source benefits be subtracted from gross loss to derive net loss, Transport contends that payments by primary sources should be deemed to operate as a “credit” against the liability of the no-fault obligor, thereby reducing that obligation. Thus, according to Transport, if the injured suffered a work loss of $1200 a month, $800 of which was compensated by workmen’s compensation, the no-fault obligor would be obligated to pay, not $400, but $200, bringing the injured’s total recovery to an alleged $1,000 limitation on monthly payments. No provision of the Act supports this argument. The calculation mandated by Section 206(a) is merely designed to prevent double recovery, not relieve the no-fault obligor of its liability under the act. The reference to $1,000 in Section 202(b)(1)(A) is merely a base figure to which a fraction is to be applied in determining benefits in the absence of an agreement in writing of the measure of work loss, not an absolute limit on monthly no-fault work loss benefits.</p>

For example, in a scope-of-employment accident, if third party liability were deemed to commence under Section 301(a)(4), i.e., once there is a loss “not compensated” due to the limits of “basic loss benefits” set forth in Section 202(b), this result would follow: the workmen’s compensation carrier and the no-fault obligor, in compensating a monthly wage loss of $1200, would be required to compensate the injured at the rate of $800 and $400 respectively until the no-fault obligor reached the limits of its obligation to compensate net loss, $15,000, at which point the no-fault obligor would discontinue payment and the injured would be deemed to have an out of pocket loss “which is <em>not compensated </em>because of [the] limitation [set forth in] § 202(b).” This would take almost three years and payment by the workmen’s compensation carrier of benefits in excess of $30,000, resulting, in effect, in the abolition of tort liability, in this example, as to approximately $45,000 of loss suffered ($30,000 of workmen’s compensation benefits and $15,000 of no-fault benefits). Absent a clear indication of legislative intent, we cannot impose such an undue restriction on the express grant of a subrogation claim in the Workmen’s Compensation Act.</p>

By way of dictum, we note an anomaly similar to that discussed in note 4, <em>supra. </em>Where an insured receives “added loss benefits,” 40 P.S. § 1009.207(a), above and beyond the no-fault $15,000 “basic loss benefits” of Section 202(b), the <em>no-fault obligor </em>is expressly granted a claim of subrogation to the extent of any “added loss benefits” paid, 40 P.S. § 1009.111(a). An insured who receives “added loss benefits” <em>is compensated </em>beyond the $15,000 “basic loss benefits” and <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>will not have a “loss ... not compensated” for which the third party is to be liable under Section 301(a)(4). Thus, in that case, Section 301(a)(4)’s wording, “loss ... not compensated,” might be viewed as further limiting third party liability. Such a limitation would conflict with the <em>no-fault obligor’s </em>statutory subrogation claim for any “add.ed loss benefits” paid, 40 P.S. § 1009.111(a).</p>
