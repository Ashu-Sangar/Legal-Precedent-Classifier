Following a non-jury trial, appellant was convicted of murder of the third degree and possession of an instrument of crime. Motions for a new trial and arrest of judgment were denied, and appellant was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of ten to twenty years for murder of the third degree and two and one-half to five years for possession of an instrument of crime. This direct appeal followed.</p>

Specifically, appellant contends that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was insufficient to prove that the killing was not done in self-defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellant produced a gun and announced, “Okay, everybody, this is a stick up.” The decedent made no attempt to resist the robbery and raised his arms in the air. Appellant then fired several shots at the decedent, including a shot that struck decedent in the back, causing his death.</p>
    <p id="b336-6" data-blocks='[["BL_336.6",336,[229,1320,1153,264]]]'>The evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom are sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the aggressor and that he did not reasonably believe that he was in danger of death or serious bodily injury.

At trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of an eyewitness, Mary McGill, whose name was not included on the list of eyewitnesses provided to appellant by the Commonwealth. Over the objection of appellant, Mary McGill was permitted to testify. However, following her testimony, the trial court granted appellant an opportunity to request a continuance in order to conduct an investigation concerning McGill’s testimony. Furthermore, the trial court stated that appellant would have the opportunity to cross-examine McGill following the investigation. A continuance was granted; there was no further cross-examination of McGill.</p>
