The total number of lineal feet to be trenched increased from 13,131 lineal feet to 31,151.80 lineal feet. The increase in the most expensive area of trenching, roadway, rose 336%.

In performing the contract work, the contractor found the backing material to be of a type more difficult to remove than that represented in the plans. There was no finding that the content of the actual backing material was known to the government at the time the bid documents were distributed.

Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the unit price obtained through this calculation would have been the one submitted by appellant had the specifications been correctly represented. Since PennDOT, by accepting appellant’s original bid, tacitly acknowledged its reasonableness, they cannot now be heard to complain of the unreasonableness of appellant’s damages when the amount has been obtained merely by substituting the actual distances for those which were misrepresented.</p>

When DePaul contacted PennDOT’s engineers concerning this discrepancy, he was informed that the engineers had been directed to <em>assume </em>that approximately half of the existing conduit would be reusable. Thus, DePaul was aware that PennDOT’s figure was an “educated guess,” not based upon a knowledge of actual subsurface conditions. It is equally apparent that PennDOT had no knowledge of the condition of the existing conduit. Further, DePaul proceeded to calculate the cost of trenching using its own estimate of 16,658 feet rather than Penn DOT’s estimate. Thus, DePaul did not rely on the PennDOT engineers’ statement in arriving at his unit price of $24.00, which formed a part of appellant’s successful bid for the contract. Absent such reliance there can be no fraud. Thus, even under the majority’s interpretation of <em>Smith, </em>which I reject, appellant is not entitled to recover.</p>
