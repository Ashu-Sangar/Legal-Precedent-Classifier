In spite of this, there was continued discord between the parties. These difficulties centered around the Appellant’s wife’s (hereinafter decedent) affair with another person (hereinafter victim) and issues relating to custody and visitation rights of the Appellant’s eight-year old daughter. There were continuous arguments as to these visitation rights, escalating at times into the use of physical violence. A protective order under the Protection from Abuse Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> was required.</p>

      <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>At approximately 8:30 a.m. on December 14, Appellant picked up his 19-year old daughter to drive her to work in Wilkes-Barre. Either before or after picking her up, Appellant stopped at a store operated by his brother-in-law. According to this witness, Appellant seemed uncontrollably upset and looked haggard (Tr. 221--22). While there, Appellant declared: “I’m going to finish the situation today,” (Tr. 222), and “Give me two packs of Kents. I’ll need them for — I’m going to go to jail, anyhow. I’ll need them” (Tr. 220). Later, while enroute to Wilkes-Barre, Appellant told his older daughter that he had smashed the windows of two vehicles and “after today, you won’t see your father. He’ll be in jail, because I’m going to take what was taken away from me” (Tr. 43).</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[192,1066,1148,796]]]'>A short time later, Appellant entered a bake shop located on Public Square in the City of Wilkes-Barre where the decedent was employed. When decedent refused to talk with him, he left the premises and drove directly to a sporting goods store in Hanover Township, Luzerne County. There, Appellant purchased a Marlin Model 778 pump action shotgun which he told the salesman he desired to buy for his boy (Tr. 82, 89). At Appellant’s request, the salesman assembled and showed him how to operate the weapon. After the salesman indicated the difference between “target load or game load” shells, Appellant specifically requested the more powerful “game load” shells and purchased one box (Tr. 89). Appellant left the store with the weapon assembled, having declined the salesman’s offer to disassemble and box the weapon (Tr. 86).</p>

He then put four or five shells in the chamber (Tr. 256-57) and drove to Wilkes-Barre, intending to “talk” to the decedent. Unable to find a parking space at that time, Appellant drove to Kingston to buy gas (Tr. 313). After obtaining the gas, Appellant observed the victim proceeding toward Wilkes-Barre in his Thunderbird vehicle. He pulled alongside the Thunderbird and motioned this person to stop (Tr. 102-03). <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>There is some conflict concerning this confrontation. The Appellant testified that the victim had gestured for him to stop (Tr. 314), while the victim alleged the opposite (Tr. 216). As the Appellant parked his vehicle, the victim then walked toward the Appellant at which time he was hit by a single blast from the Appellant’s shotgun. The victim fled from the scene and was later taken to the hospital where he suffered the loss of his left hand (Tr. 103). In the interim, the Appellant apparently placed his shotgun back in the vehicle and “raced” (Tr. 376) to the Public Square. With shotgun in hand, the Appellant entered the bakery shop and confronted the decedent. After a brief conversation, Appellant shot the decedent twice and then departed (Tr. 316).</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[245,1004,1153,738]]]'>A patron in the bake shop testified that he heard Appellant say, “Do you want to talk about it now?”, then heard a noise, turned and saw Appellant holding the shotgun (Tr. 162-63). Another witness, the proprietor of the bake shop, testified that she was working in a back- room when she heard Appellant say, “Now will you talk to me?” (Tr. 189). As this witness started out to the front of the shop, she noted that the Appellant shot his wife twice, the second shot being fired within seconds or moments after the first. This witness also testified that between the- first and second shot, she also heard Appellant say, “I told you I would kill you.” (Tr. 190). Another witness, a patron in the shop, testified that she heard Appellant say, “I told you I was going to do it.” (Tr. 167).</p>

This detective testified that Appellant appeared “very calm, and he was grinning at the time” (Tr. 224). The detective testified that he pursued the Appellant’s vehicle and eventually lost the same in the pursuit (Tr. 226). Sometime later, the Appellant surrendered to the Wilkes-Barre Police (Tr. 267-68).</p>
