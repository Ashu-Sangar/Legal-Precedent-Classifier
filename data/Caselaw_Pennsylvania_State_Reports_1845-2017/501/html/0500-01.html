    <p id="b696-12" data-blocks='[["BL_696.11",696,[247,1387,1151,258]]]'>About 12:25 on the morning of March 17, 1979, at the Mummer’s Bar in Philadelphia, appellant fell into an argument with one Robert Nelson. A struggle ensued and both suffered numerous knife wounds. Police came and both were taken to the hospital. Robert Nelson later died.</p>
    <p id="b696-13" data-blocks='[["BL_696.12",696,[246,1676,1152,365]]]'>Appellant, charged with voluntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument of crime, was tried at a bench trial before the Honorable Juanita Kidd Stout. He was adjudged guilty and has taken a direct appeal to this Court from that conviction. Appellant raises a single issue. He contends that the trial judge erred in assessing the admissibility of proffered <em>res gestae </em>statements.</p>
    <p id="b696-14" data-blocks='[["BL_696.13",696,[247,2070,1152,260]],["BL_697.1",697,[175,312,1146,536]]]'>After the altercation, police took both appellant and Robert Nelson to the hospital. During appellant’s treatment, he had an extended conversation with a police officer, in which he gave his version of the events. At trial, where appellant did not testify, he offered the testimony of the police officer <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>to relate the version of the events he gave the officer at the hospital. That version was essentially exculpatory. In his conversation with the officer he said he was unarmed, that Robert Nelson was the aggressor and attacked him with a knife. The offer of the conversation was objected to as hearsay and the objection sustained. The learned trial judge held that a conversation approximately forty five minutes after the event in question was too remote in time to qualify as an excited utterance or <em>res gestae </em>statement. We agree and affirm the judgment of sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b697-4" data-blocks='[["BL_697.5",697,[177,914,1146,694]]]'>An excited utterance is the event speaking and not the speaker. It is an exception to the hearsay rule, carved from human experience, which teaches that an unreflected, spontaneous utterance made under the impact of a shocking, unexpected emotion, precipitated by a traumatic event, renders the speaker the medium and not the message. Such an utterance is allowed in evidence because it is spontaneous and unreflected, without influence from thought, design and reason. It is not accepted because the statement is or must be true, but because it could be at least as true as any other evidence. Before such evidence is received, it must be carefully weighed. As this Court stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Pronkoskie, All </em>Pa. 132, <a href="/pa/477/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="383 A.2d 858" data-case-ids="1738270" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0132-01">383 A.2d 858</a> (1978):</p>

It varies with the circumstances and from case to case. It does not alone decide admissibility. The question is not how long one or when one is seized by an event, but rather was he seized at all.

It is clear that appellant wandered, at will to different subjects of his choice, that he was not compelled by the event and that he had time to gather himself. His question as to whether Robert Nelson, had died, argues a mind aware of the event and its consequences. The time involved left room for inventive forces. That is the antithesis of unflective spontaneity.</p>
