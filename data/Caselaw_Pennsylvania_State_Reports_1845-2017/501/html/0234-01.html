The action sought recovery of damages for a burglary loss at Brogan’s place of business in Glenside, Pennsylvania. The gravamen of appellant’s complaint is the malfunction of a burglary detection system installed by appellee which, it is alleged, caused Brogan to suffer losses in excess of $358,000.00.</p>

      <p id="b434-7" data-blocks='[["BL_434.8",434,[272,1855,1153,466]]]'>. The unfairness of the mandatory harsh, inflexible application of Rule 302(d) is readily apparent in this case. On March 1979, appellee filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings but failed to file a brief within 30 days from the filing of its motion. As a result the motion was dismissed by order of court dated April 24, 1979. However, appellee was free to continue its defense of the case and indeed went on to file a motion for summary judgment. When the appellant failed to file a brief within 30 days from the date of appellee’s brief, appellant’s lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice. It is apparent that in any such appealable matter, the mandatory penalty is usually more severe with respect to the respondent than it is on the moving party for the same procedural error.</p>

I find no such conflict. Our Rule 126 providing for liberal construction and application of rules generally was never intended to prohibit a court from providing procedures which will ensure the expeditious disposition of matters before the Court.</p>

Where the moving party fails to comply, the rule provided that the motion, petition or preliminary objection will be dismissed. Where as here the responding party is in default, the motion, petition or preliminary objection is granted. In each instance, the defaulting party loses the issue. The fact that it may result in a termination of the action where the defaulting party is the respondent does not create a disparity.</p>
