On the basis of this information, the police visited appellant’s home on January 17, 1978 at which time they were told by appellant’s mother that he had recently been in a fight in which he had suffered injuries.</p>

Later the same day, they approached appellant in another part of the city where he had apparently been attempting to evade arrest. Appellant was taken to police headquarters where he confessed to the crime and formal charges against him were prepared. Subsequently, two warrants were obtained; one to search appellant’s residence and a second to search his person for blood, hair and fingernail samples.</p>

As a result, a suppression hearing was convened on March 27 and 28, 1978. The suppression court found that, contrary to appellant’s assertions, there was probable cause to support the arrest. However, appellant’s confession, which he claimed had been coerced, was suppressed. In addition, a black cashmere coat identified as belonging to the victim and found on appellant’s premises, was suppressed as the fruit of an invalid confession. For the same reason, the search warrant affecting appellant’s residence was held invalid.</p>

Probable cause to arrest was founded on the Christmas card and pay stub, each bearing appellant’s name, which were discovered at the crime scene and on the admission by appellant’s mother to police upon their arrival at her home that appellant had recently been injured in a fight. The murder weapon, a knife found near the victim’s body, was discovered to have traces of type O blood smeared on the handle and appellant, who had wounds on his hands when arrested, was later determined to have type O blood. In addition, upon being apprehended appellant stated to police, “I’m glad it’s over.” Motion to Suppress Hearing, 3/27/78 at 68. At the suppression hearing, this statement was held admissible presumably because it was not coerced and it was made incident to an arrest supported by probable cause.

Here, the trial court, during a post-conviction hearing at which defense counsel testified, found no basis to the claims of ineffectiveness and accepted trial counsel’s explanations as true. Trial counsel testified that he described to appellant, in great detail, all developments of the proceedings before, during and after trial and he spent much time before trial discussing strategy and preparing appellant’s defense. <em>See </em>N.T. Evidentiary Hearing, 2/14/79 at 13, 31, 33 and 50. Trial counsel further testified that appellant did not tell him anything about a potential defense witness named Owens. <em>See </em>N.T. Evidentiary Hearing, 2/14/79 at 47, 48. In view of the fact that there is no basis upon which to reject the conclusion of the post conviction hearing court that defense counsel testified truthfully, appellant’s claims raising ineffective assistance of counsel must fail. <em>See Lutz; Sullivan.</em>

The gravamen of this argument is that a reference to the coat, which the victim’s son testified was missing, presented to the jury evidence relating to the charge of robbery, which had been dismissed. In connection with this argument, appellant further claims that the trial court erred when he instructed the jury on the elements of second degree or felony murder.</p>

In addition, police were led to appellant’s residence after discovering a Christmas card and a pay stub near the victim’s body, each bearing appellant’s name.
