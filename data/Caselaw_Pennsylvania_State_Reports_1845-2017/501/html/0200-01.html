The appellee, M.A. Kravitz Co., Inc., petitioned the Board on May 7, 1976 for a curative amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and approval of a proposed townhouse development on a 96 acre parcel of land which it owned. The land is located in an area zoned R-2 Residential, permitting only single-family dwellings. The basis for Kravitz’s substantive challenge was the Ordinance’s alleged unconstitutional exclusion of townhouses. Kravitz also made the alternative argument that even if the Ordinance did not totally exclude townhouse development, it resulted in a <em>de facto </em>exclusion because it made only token provision for such development.</p>

Because the developer in <em>Girsh </em>sought to build only multi-unit high rise buildings, in the common law tradition treating only the facts in the case at hand, our holding in <em>Girsh </em>was that the township could not have “a zoning scheme that makes no reasonable provision for apartment uses”. <a href="/pa/437/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="437 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1927788" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0237-01">437 Pa. at 243</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20395" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="263 A.2d 395">263 A.2d at 398</a>.

The failure to provide for apartments, therefore, operated to exclude population growth, an impermissible result under the <em>National Land </em>rationale. It was this effect of excluding population growth which gave the ordinance the character of an explicit prohibition subject to the <em>Exton Quarries </em>rationale. In <em>Girsh </em>we were not faced with, and therefore did not address, the issue whether the failure to provide for apartments in an area where other types of multiple dwellings were available, which presumably would not have the effect of excluding population growth, would also be equated with an explicit prohibition and fall under the <em>Exton Quarries </em>rationale.</p>

In the opinion of Mr. Kendree, townhouses “could be considered as a permitted housing type under the multi-family district” of the Ordinance. (Hearing of September 28, 1977, p. 3). Townhouses were considered a type of multi-family residential use and were intended to be one of those types of variety of housing permissible in the R-4 zoning area. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 5). Kendree’s company “recommended to the Planning Commission in the Comprehensive Plan discussions and in subsequent adoption of the plan and Zoning Ordinance that . . ., since the Township was single-family at the time, that the higher density residential types be clarified (sic) as multifamily”. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 10). Referring to the separate definitions given for single-family attached dwelling (townhouse) and multi-family dwelling, Kendree testified that the Ordinance “is not intended to distinguish between them. . . .

It is, therefore, necessary to determine whether the Township’s failure to make any provision for that use is exclusionary. A party attacking a zoning ordinance as exclusionary will not succeed by showing only that certain types of architecture are proscribed if the use to which that style is adaptable is not excluded. <em>See </em>Anderson, Law of Zoning In Pennsylvania § 7.08 (1982). Conversely, it <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>should not be enough to show a particular architectural style is allowed, if the use to which it is adapted is proscribed.

Frequently, however, townhouse construction serves to provide families of moderate means with the opportunity to own or rent economical dwellings which preserve some of the benefits of privacy, ease of access and open space normally associated with single family dwellings. <em>See </em>Annot., <a href="/citations/?q=99%20A.L.R.%202d%20873" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="99 A.L.R. 2d 873">99 A.L.R.2d 873</a> (1965). Descendants of the old Philadelphia rowhouses, townhouses provide single family residences for prospective home owners of moderate means. The longitudinal orientation or “row” design makes private yards practical. Moreover, townhouses do not require common interior areas, i.e. hallways, stairways and elevators with their accompanying loss of privacy and difficulty in apportioning maintenance cost and responsibility. The townhouse also has an economic advantage over detached dwellings because of shared wall construction. It is a realistic alternative for moderate income persons who want to own a single family dwelling rather than rent apartment units.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

The Wrightstown Township Zoning Hearing Board found that families earning up to $15,000 a year are primarily restricted to apartments and townhouses with some limited access to detached dwellings. It also found that in the next ten years no housing will be built for less than $40,000.00 and people making less than $13,000 to $15,000 will not be able to afford to purchase home.</p>
