    <p id="b702-14" data-blocks='[["BL_702.14",702,[243,1589,1153,364]]]'>Appellant was convicted on February 14, 1980 of the second degree murder<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> of his girlfriend which occurred on February 8, 1972. In this direct appeal, the Appellant asserts three errors; first, the admission by the trial court of evidence of his prior criminal conduct; second, the trial court’s refusal to give a missing witness instruction; and, last, the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel.</p>
    <p id="b702-15" data-blocks='[["BL_702.15",702,[243,1975,1151,205]],["BL_703.1",703,[150,333,1145,90]]]'>Before reaching the merits of these contentions, however, we must address the Appellee’s argument that Appellant’s first two assertions of error had been waived. The record indicates that the issues of the Appellant’s prior criminal <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>conduct and the court’s refusal to give a missing witness instruction were waived.</p>

Gravely, </em><a href="/pa/486/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="486 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1757600" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0194-01">486 Pa. 194</a>,<a href="/pa/486/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="486 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1757600" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0194-01">404 A.2d 1296</a> (1979) as supporting his argument that because the lower court addressed the merits of these issues in its opinion, the issues were preserved for appeal. Reliance on <em>Gravely </em>is misplaced for several reasons. First, <em>Gravely </em>represented a final, definitive statement as to whether certain issues would be preserved for appellate review despite failure to comply with Rule of Criminal Procedure 1123(a). The essence of the rule announced in <em>Gravely </em>was that “only those issues included in post-verdict motions will be considered preserved for appellate review.” <a href="/pa/486/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="486 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1757600" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0194-01">486 Pa. at 198-99</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="486 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1757600" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0194-01">404 A.2d at 1298</a>. This rule was made prospective only, however, and cases wherein motions were filed prior to September 4, 1979 (60 days after the <em>Gravely </em>decision) were given the benefit of the “substantial compliance” rule which had developed in several previous cases. Appellant’s motion here was filed February 20, 1980.</p>
    <p id="b703-5" data-blocks='[["BL_703.6",703,[151,1372,1149,1000]]]'>Second, and more important, the question addressed in <em>Gravely </em>was the reverse of the question presented here. In <em>Gravely, </em>we considered whether issues <em>not stated </em>in post-trial motions, but nevertheless briefed and considered by the court below, were preserved for appellate review. In this case, the issues <em>were stated </em>in the post-trial motion, but were not briefed or argued. (The court below ruled that these issues had for this reason been waived, but addressed their merits in anticipation of the appealability of the waiver issue itself). In <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">476 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">383 A.2d 503</a> (1978), we held that where issues raised in post-trial motions were not briefed or argued, these issues are waived. The holding in <em>Williams </em>is controlling in this case. We write at length to make explicit what should have been abundantly clear after <em>Williams </em>and <em>Gravely, </em>that only issues which are raised in a post-trial motion in accordance with Rule 1123, and briefed or argued before the court hearing the motion, will be considered preserved for appellate review.</p>

Accordingly, in order to conclude this unsatisfactory situation, we now rule that sixty days after the filing of this opinion, only those issues included in post-verdict motions will be considered preserved for appellate review. We caution that this ruling applies to every post-verdict motion which is filed sixty days hence and to any motion which is already filed, but which may still be supplemented after sixty days from this date. Our ruling is prospective only because of the possibility of reliance by counsel on prior decisions of this Court. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Bailey, </em><a href="/pa/463/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="463 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1707987" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0354-01">463 Pa. 354</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="463 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1707987" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0354-01">344 A.2d 869</a> (1975).</blockquote>

As a brief filed in the lower court in support of a post-verdict motion would merely supplement, clarify and give advocacy to issues otherwise specifically set out in the motion, I would not impose a formal requirement for the filing of a supple<a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>mental brief in every case given the mandate of Blair; i.e., the filing of a specific, written post-verdict motion. In most cases, the supplemental brief would be redundant and reiterate matters already presented in the motion itself. Furthermore, as recognized in <em>Gravely, </em>the practice of permitting the filing of such supplemental briefs led to such confusion, that this Court should not perpetuate the problem by now <em>requiring </em>the filing of a brief in support of post-verdict motions to preserve issues for appellate review. Because I would require only that issues be specifically raised in written post-verdict motions in accordance with <em>Commonwealth v. Blair, <a href="/pa/460/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="460 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="482932" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0031-01">supra,</a> </em>to be preserved for appellate review, I would overrule the requirement of <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">476 Pa. 557</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="476 Pa. 557" data-case-ids="1736899" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0557-01">383 A.2d 503</a> (1978) for supplementing post-verdict motions and hold appellant’s claims regarding the missing witness instruction and evidence of the prior altercation with the victim properly preserved for appellate review as these were properly raised in post-verdict motions.</p>
