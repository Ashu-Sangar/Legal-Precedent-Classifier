In dicta, <em>Lawall v. Groman, supra, </em>relying on the principle that one who undertakes to perform a service for another, even without reward, is bound to exercise reasonable care and can be held responsible for misfeasance, though not for nonfeasance, stated that a third party could bring suit against an attorney in a negligence action if the attorney knew that the third party “was relying on him in his professional capacity.” <a href="/pa/180/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="180 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="888372" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0532-01">180 Pa. at 540</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.%2098" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="37 A. 98">37 A. 98</a>.

The dicta in <em>Lawall </em>were recognized by Common Pleas, which nevertheless held that appellee does not state a cause of action falling within these dicta. The reason that appellee does not reveals the core problem in this case. Appellee does not state a cause of action under the dicta in <em>Lawall </em>because she could not have an attorney specifically undertake for her the writing of a testator’s will which made her the residuary beneficiary of that will. She could not rely on the attorney’s professional expertise because he could not employ his expertise on her behalf in such a manner. Such a beneficiary is left without .any remedy for the failed legacy. Because she is a beneficiary, she could not have had privity with the attorney, nor could any specific undertaking have been arranged between them. The intentions of the testator and the expectation of the named beneficiary are thus frustrated under the strict privity rule, despite the dicta in <em>Lawall.</em>

The fact that the beneficiary is named in the will is not relevant to third party status. The will is not the contract, but rather that which is contracted for. Furthermore, even if the naming of the legatee in the will is taken as indicating the testator’s intent to benefit the legatee, it cannot be taken to indicate that the drafting attorney intended to confer any benefit. It is not at all clear that an attorney ever intends to benefit a third party under a testator’s will in the sense required in <em>Spires. </em>Thus it is very unlikely that a beneficiary could ever bring suit under the <em>Spires </em>requirements.</p>

There is thus a two part test for determining whether one is an intended third party beneficiary: (1) the recognition of the beneficiary’s right must be “appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties,” and (2) the performance must “satisfy an obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary” or “the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.” The first part of the test sets forth a standing requirement. For any suit to be brought, the right to performance must be “appropriate to effectuate the intentions of the parties.” This general condition restricts the application of the second part of the test, which defines the intended beneficiary as either a creditor beneficiary (§ 302(l)(a)) or a donee beneficiary (§ 302(l)(b)), though these terms are not themselves used by Restatement (Second). Section 302(2) defines all beneficiaries who are not intentional beneficiaries as incidental beneficiaries. The standing requirement leaves discretion with the trial court to determine whether recognition of third party beneficiary <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>status would be “appropriate.” If the two steps of the test are met, the beneficiary is an intended beneficiary “unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee.”</p>

The underlying contract is that between the testator and the attorney for the drafting of a will. The will, providing for one or more named beneficiaries, clearly manifests the intent of the testator to benefit the legatee. Under Restatement (Second) § 302(1), the recognition of the “right to performance in the beneficiary” would be “appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties” since the estate either cannot or will not bring suit. Since only named beneficiaries can bring suit, they meet the first step standing requirement of § 302.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Being named beneficiaries of the will, the legatees are intended, rather than incidental, beneficiaries who would be § 302(l)(b) beneficiaries for whom “the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised performance.” In the case of a testator-attorney contract, the attorney is the promisor, promising to draft a will which carries out the testator’s intention to benefit the legatees. The testator is the promisee, who intends that the named beneficiaries have the benefit of the attorney’s promised performance. The circumstances which clearly indicate the testator’s intent to benefit a named legatee are his arrangements with the attorney and the text of his will.</p>

This analysis is based on a common confusion of negligence doctrines relating to standard of care with those relating to scope of the risk, i.e., the class of persons to whom a duty is owed, analyzed in negligence in terms of foreseeability. Thus, although a plaintiff on a third party beneficiary theory in contract may in some cases have to show a deviation from the standard of care, as in negligence, to establish breach, the class of persons to whom the defendant may be liable is restricted by principles of contract law, not negligence principles relating to foreseeability or scope of the risk.</p>

The short answer to this argument is that on the facts of this case the measure of appellee’s damages is her loss of expectancy. It would be inappropriate for us to range afield in an effort to determine whether damages in other cases should be governed by tort principles of proximate cause, substantial factor of foreseeability, or by contract principles precluding an award of “consequential” damages if, indeed, they differ.

Kent died on October 12, 1972.

See N.J.StatAnn. §§ 3A:3-6 &amp; 3A:3-7. The present action was commenced on January 23, 1976, nineteen years after the execution of the will, and more than three years after the death of decedent.

See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 311(3) (1981). At no time during decedent Kent’s life could appellee have bound decedent to the wishes expressed in his 1957 will. As decedent was under no contractual obligation to make a will which named appellee as a beneficiary, decedent was thus free to change his testamentary intent until the day he died. See, e.g., <em>Imhruglia Estate, </em><a href="/pa/479/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="479 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="1742081" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0095-01">479 Pa. 95</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="479 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="1742081" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0095-01">387 A.2d 851</a> (1978). Even at decedent’s death appellee was in no position to rely on a will naming her as beneficiary, for appellee could have no valid claim to decedent’s estate until the completion of probate proceedings.

See Restatement (Second) of Contracts, supra, at § 302(1). Here, the record is clear that appellant and decedent did <em>not </em>intend that appellant would render services to appellee; the sole promise which appellant <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>made to decedent was to write decedent’s will, a promise which appellant performed.</p>

Moreover, decedent would have been obliged to seek relief within four or six years of the execution of the will, depending upon whether the contract was oral or written. See 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 5523(3) &amp; 5527(2). Clearly decedent could not have claimed that relief could be sought by his estate after his death, fifteen years after the execution of the will. Nor, of course, could decedent’s estate have claimed that it was in any respect entitled to the value of the failed bequest.</p>

Such a rule would obviate the need for employing a legal fiction, such as the majority’s reliance on third party beneficiary theory and, contrary to the fear of the majority, requires no factitious formulae. The formula is simple: a duty breached is a tort, and the remedy exists in an action in trespass.</p>
