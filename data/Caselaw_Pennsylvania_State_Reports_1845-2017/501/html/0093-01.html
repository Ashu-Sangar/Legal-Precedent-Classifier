But, we also know that if a patient does have acute myocardial infarction — a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease makes the ability to survive much more difficult because of a lack of oxygen, the injury to the heart muscle due to the thrombosis in the coronary artery be the amount of damage the heart muscle is directly related to how much oxygen gets into that tissue, and if a patient does have the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease superimposed on coronary artery disease, it will — they’ll do very badly with having any evidence of an acute myocardial infarction, so I felt that his lung disease was an important contributing factor to his death when he died in 1974.

III, § 301(c), as amended, 77 P.S. § 411(2) (Supp.1982-1983). The meaning of “result” is quite clear in its common usage: To result is “to proceed, spring or arise as a consequence, effect, or conclusion,” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1937 (1976). <em>“Result </em>is consequence that connotes end or conclusion; it is consequence, therefore, that achieves. Derivatively <em>result </em>means leap back; it contains something of the idea of proving or checking or calculating.” John Baker Opdycke, Mark My Words, a Guide to Modern Usage and Expression 210 (1949). “Result” implies effect from a previous <em>cause, </em>

      <em>Id. </em>at 258, not simply an event which follows, and “contributory factors” are not synonymous with causes. A reading of the statute, giving the plain meaning to the words chosen by the General Assembly, leads me inescapably to the conclusion that the Commonwealth Court correctly affirmed the Board’s determination that the referee’s decision on causation was not supported by the medical evidence of record. “The proper test for the legal sufficiency of expert medical testimony on the issue of causation is that the expert must testify that in his professional opinion the result in question came from the cause alleged.” <em>Crucible Steel, Inc. v.

In <em>Crucible, </em>supra, medical testimony that silicosis was “the most significant cause” of death met the statutorily prescribed burden of proof. In contrast, medical testimony that an occupational disease was a “substantial contributing factor”, at 241, a “major contributing factor,” “contributed in a substantial or significant manner,” or “contributed to and accelerated” the employe’s death simply is not sufficient to prove the death “resulted] in whole or in part from the employe’s exposure to the hazard of occupational disease.” <em>Crucible Steel, </em>supra, 65 Pa.Cmwlth. at 418, <a href="/citations/?q=442%20A.2d%201199" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="442 A.2d 1199">442 A.2d at 1201</a>, and cases cited therein. Thus, where, as here, the medical expert testifies that the occupational disease was “a markedly contributing factor to the death,” such testimony falls short of the standard prescribed by the Act.</p>

It is misleading for the majority to state that the expert medical testimony failed to establish unequivocally that the occupational disease existed, slip opinion at 6, in light of the uncontradicted testimony of the doctors that decedent had been treated for years for pneumoconiosis/silicosis and the nonmedical testimony regarding decedent’s constant workplace exposure to scilica dust. As was noted by the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board in its opinion of June 8, 1978 “this appeal has been limited to the specific issue of whether or not pneumoconiosis was a contributing cause to the death of the decedent. The Defendant apparently does not question the findings that decedent had been exposed to a silica hazard and that he was suffering from pneumoconiosis. It is only how that disease relates to the decedent’s death which is at issue.” Slip opinion of June 8, 1978, at 2.</p>

First, the original award of June 21, 1977 purported to be computed pursuant to the schedules of compensation in the Workmen’s Compensation Act. However, the <em>amount </em>of compensation ($54.00 per week) seems to be the amount specified in the Occupational Disease Act, 77 P.S. § 1407(4). Second, the subsequent award following remand, rendered on December 26, 1978, inexplicably alters the amount of compensation to $100.00 per week until June 6, 1975 and $95.34 per week thereafter. The record does not disclose a basis for the alteration of weekly benefits. The better course, therefore, is to simply remand to the Board for computation of benefits.</p>
