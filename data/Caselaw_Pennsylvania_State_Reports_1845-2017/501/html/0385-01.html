That same day, three officers drove to the address named in the warrant, arriving at approximately 1:00 p.m. Subsequent to the issuance of the warrant, the officers had received information from an unnamed informant that Jones would be arriving at the apartment sometime shortly after one o’clock to cut and package heroin. Although the officers were aware that Beard was at home, they parked their vehicle around the corner from the apartment and began a surveillance of the premises. At about 1:30 p.m., Jones drove up to the apartment and alighted from his car. As Jones walked toward the rear door of the apartment, the police drove their car alongside Jones’s car and stopped. All three officers then emerged from the car and began to follow Jones to the rear of the premises.</p>
    <p id="b581-6" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[180,1374,1149,654]]]'>According to the findings of the suppression court, as Jones reached the back porch, he turned, saw the officers, and ran inside the apartment, shouting “Police!” The officers pursued Jones into the apartment, forcibly entering through the rear door which Jones had shut and locked behind him. Once inside the apartment, they observed Jones in the bathroom flushing something down the toilet. Several packages of heroin were found nearby. Jones was placed under arrest, and both he and appellee Beard, who had been asleep up to this point, were informed of the search warrant. A search of the premises revealed additional drugs, which, along with the heroin, were seized by the officers.</p>

    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.5",582,[250,755,1154,937]]]'>In affirming' the order granting the suppression motions, the Superior Court panel found that the police had acted reasonably in waiting for Jones’s arrival before executing the search warrant. See LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, </em>§ 4.8, n. 62 (Supp.1983). See generally <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gervato, </em><a href="/f2d/474/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="474 F.2d 40" data-case-ids="1251981" data-case-paths="/f2d/474/0040-01">474 F.2d 40</a> (3d Cir.1973). However, according to the majority, once Jones had arrived, “the police could have easily waited until [Jones] entered the premises before they approached. Then, the police could have knocked and announced their identity and purpose and given the appellees the opportunity to surrender their privacy peacefully.” <a href="/pa-super/282/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="282 Pa.

In the majority’s view, the officers’ decision to approach Jones before he entered the house, knowing that Jones would recognize them and possibly run inside, was improperly designed to create “exigent circumstances” which would justify police avoidance of the “knock and announce” requirement of Pa.R.Crim.P. 2007.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Contrary to the view of the majority of the Superior Court panel, neither the “knock and announce” rule nor the Fourth Amendment, which the rule is designed to effectuate, requires that the police delay announcing their authority and purpose until occupants of a dwelling who are outside the premises have gone inside. Thus, it was within the proper exercise of police discretion for the police to have approached Jones to announce their authority and purpose before Jones entered the premises. Jones’s subsequent decision to flee inside the house, even though a possible consequence of the police’s action, in no respect makes the exercise of this discretion unreasonable.</p>

Although the Superior Court panel erroneously concluded that the police conduct precipitating appellee Jones’s flight was improper, it correctly acknowledged that once Jones had fled inside the house, the “knock and announce” requirement was excused by exigent circumstances:</p>
