Each category is qualified by the words “including without limitation.” Yet the categories are not to be nullified, transformed or expanded beyond the primary concern of the section. The effect of appellants’ interpretation is to infinitely expand the subject-matter areas by reading “including without limitation” as “including but not limited to.” The legality of the tax beyond the twenty (20) mill limit, the heart of the matter before us, does not pertain to any of the <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>enumerated subjects, even in their most unlimited sense.

The question of exclusive jurisdiction primarily turns on the point of origin of the enabling authority for the proceedings in which the questioned action was taken.

Such an assumption, needed to adopt appellants’ position, contravenes the rule of construction that “the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd ... or unreasonable.” We will not make such an assumption.

This change gave unpaid tax anticipation notes a status requiring inclusion in the budget of the ensuing fiscal year.

The inclusion of due and owing tax anticipation notes in Section 509 relating to unfunded debt was retained when Section 505 was amended in 1978 and again in 1981 when both sections underwent very minor changes. Thus, the conclusion is inescapable that the 1978 changes in Section 505, rather than repealing the last sentence in Section 509 (which would be the effect of appellants’ interpretation), gave an alternate escape valve for due and owing tax anticipation notes, viz., payment of the obligation from tax receipts of the ensuing year.</p>

The fact that no concomitant duty to comply with applicable provisions governing funded debt exists when the alleged Section 505 conversion occurs is not viewed as critical. We cannot accept that the legislature would intend, by operation of law in Section 505, to give unpaid tax anticipation notes the status of funded debt without subjecting such notes to aggregate debt limitation scrutiny, advertising requirements, filing with the recorder of deeds in the county of issuance or approval by the Department of Community Affairs or the court of common pleas.
