Yet the Code prescribes neither standards for imposing such discipline nor procedures to be employed in the disciplinary process. Thus an employee aggrieved by an unjust disciplinary action would have no recourse but the courts. A contractual provision such as section 4-2 fills this standardless void in the Code, protecting employees from unjust disciplinary actions by making grievances arising from such actions the subject of mandatory arbitration proceedings wherein a <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>“just cause” standard is determinative. Such provisions serve as a check on a school board’s undefined discretionary authority as well as a desirable alternative to litigation.

If the adjudicative processes and jurisdictional grants mandated under the Code were not exclusive, a decision of the Board to dismiss a professional employee would be rendered meaningless, as would any decision adverse to the employee rendered by the Secretary of Education, the Court of Common Pleas or . the appellate courts. Those decisions would not be binding upon the employee should the Board’s initial decision remain perpetually subject to relitigation by an arbitrator applying a <em>different </em>standard. Such a result would offend all notions of finality. Moreover, this Commonwealth’s goal, in providing for arbitration of labor grievances, of avoiding labor litigation, would be frustrated. The availability of parallel remedies, each with full appellate rights, would indefinitely delay the dismissal of any professional school employee. To interpret the Agreement as intending this absurd result, therefore, would be irrational. <em>See Unit Vending Corp. v.

The arbitrator’s report indicated that at some time after 3:00 a.m. on the morning of September 25, 1977, Hess, who had been drinking heavily since early the previous evening, awakened his wife and got his shotgun. During a conversation which lasted ah hour or more, Hess occasionally pointed the shotgun at his wife, and threatened to kill himself and “all the others.” At the time Hess’s six year old son by a previous marriage and Mrs. Hess’s daughter and son-in-law were also in the house.
