Appellee was taken by police to be preliminarily arraigned just over two and one-half hours after his arrest, but because of the unavailability of an arraignment judge was not in fact arraigned until twelve hours after his arrest.

    <p id="b656-11" data-blocks='[["BL_656.10",656,[262,1815,1151,529]]]'>Appellee was arrested pursuant to a warrant on December 17,1978, at 6:20 p.m., charged with rape, simple assault, and indecent assault, and taken to the headquarters of the West Philadelphia Detective Division for questioning. By 7:30 p.m. that same evening, appellee had been advised of his rights and had completed and signed the inculpatory statement at issue. All interrogation ceased, and appellee was placed in a detention room where he remained until 9:00 p.m. while the processing of papers relating to his arrest was completed.</p>

The arraignment judge scheduled to be on duty was, in fact, not present when appellee arrived at the CCTV Room. The judge’s clerk had suffered a heart attack at approximately 8:15 p.m. that evening, and the judge had left the arraignment room to accompany him to the hospital. Efforts by police to secure the presence of the arraignment judge scheduled to be on duty as well as another arraignment judge were unsuccessful, and appellee was not arraigned until 6:25 a.m. that morning, after the judge scheduled to be on duty at 8:00 a.m. came on duty early at police request. No interrogation of appellee occurred during the period of delay occasioned by efforts to locate an arraignment judge.</p>

In so holding, we observed that if the police had continued to detain the defendant beyond the six-hour limit without any interrogation while they attempted to secure a judicial officer, the case would have fallen “within the exigent circumstances dispensation . .. assuming the Commonwealth’s ability to establish its diligent effort in seeking a timely arraignment.” <a href="/pa/500/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="500 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1781128" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0144-01">500 Pa. at 151</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="500 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1781128" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0144-01">454 A.2d at 1007</a>. On this record, the Commonwealth has shown that the police diligently sought to locate an arraignment judge and to secure appellee’s prompt arraignment both before and after it became apparent that the six-hour limit could not be met. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court must be reversed.</p>

Any departure from a rigid application of the six-hour rule of Davenport<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> is a step in the right direction. However, to the extent that our judicial inquiry continues to be focused on the time of arraignment, rather than on the integrity of statements, that focus remains misdirected. This Court should remove its focus from six hours, or what does or does not comprise a permissible exception, or what circumstance is sufficiently exigent; the inquiry should instead center on whether an incriminating statement was obtained coercively. The <em>Davenport </em>rule severely undermines the truth-determining process, and results in the exclusion of constitutionally permissible statements. Since involuntary and coerced statements, and statements obtained in derogation of the rule of <em>Miranda</em>
