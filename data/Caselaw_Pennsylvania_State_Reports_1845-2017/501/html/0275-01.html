The third man entered the second floor speakeasy rooms, warned everyone present not to move, and took or moved Mrs. Rambert’s purse. Appellant, still holding Mr. Farrell around the neck, then followed the first man up the stairway toward the third floor. According to the witnesses, there were two shots and Farrell fell down the stairs, fatally wounded.</p>

Appellant’s defense was that he was an innocent bystander. Appellant testified that he had been at a party earlier that evening, had left the party to obtain some marijuana, and had met up with one Elijah Dennison and some other men who took appellant to 2833 West Diamond in an attempt to purchase the marijuana. Once inside, according to appellant, the other men pulled guns (to appellant’s complete surprise), there was shooting and appellant was injured by the first shotgun blast.

In light of our prior finding that the trial court’s cautionary instruction was quite adequate to eliminate any possible prejudice to appellant caused by these comments, a request for a mistrial would have been baseless and without arguable merit. Furthermore, trial counsel explained at the post-trial evidentiary hearing that he does not ask for a mistrial when he believes he is winning a case, which he so believed in this case. N.T.
