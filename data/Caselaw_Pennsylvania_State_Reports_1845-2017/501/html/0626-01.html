    <p id="b822-5" data-blocks='[["BL_822.6",822,[254,399,1155,417]]]'>On March 20, 1979, while serving three life sentences at Graterford Prison, appellant bludgeoned Felix Mokychic, Captain of the Guards, to death. On November 19, 1979, a jury found appellant guilty of first degree murder, 18 Pa. C.S. § 2502(a), and after a sentencing hearing pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711, returned a death sentence. This is appellant’s automatic direct appeal from that sentence. 42 Pa. C.S. § 9711(h).</p>
    <p id="b822-6" data-blocks='[["BL_822.7",822,[250,834,1155,571]]]'>Appellant claims the trial court erred reversibly in permitting the jury to have appellant’s signed confession during its deliberations in violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114. Appellant made the confession shortly after his arrest and it was reduced to writing in the words of a State Police trooper. Since appellant’s only defense was his subjective mental condition we conclude the availability of a police edited statement emphasizing the criminal act and its conscious planning, but omitting appellant’s arguably delusional statements, was prejudicial to him. We therefore reverse and remand for a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

I began thinking how everyone, guards and inmates, would laugh at me when I walked and climbed stairs. I am a semi-cripple and have difficulty walking and climbing. I decided then that I was going to get even with someone, did not have anyone particular in mind. I began scouting around inside the institution for someone to kill. I went onto C Block. When I was leaving C Block Captain Mokychic was standing at the door asking the inmates for their passes to get off the block. As he asked for mine he gave me a slight push. This irritated me and I became angry, having a flashback. Captain Mokychic and I had an argument sometime ago and I never forgot it.</blockquote>

Everytime I looked at him I could see that he was still breathing so I hit him with the bat in the head again and again. I don’t really know how many times I hit him but it seemed as though he just kept breathing. I then heard someone holler, “Terry, drop it.” I turned and saw a short Sergeant standing in the doorway of C Block. He was in a karate stance so I drew the bat back and told him to <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>come on. Another guard came and hollered, “Terry, drop it.” I turned and saw another officer to my right. He again said, “Terry, drop it. The man’s down.” I told him that I didn’t want to play games. He replied that no games were going to be played for me to drop the bat (sic). I hesitated, then threw the bat on the floor. The guards then came, handcuffed me and took me to the Day Captain’s office.</blockquote>

    <p id="b824-6" data-blocks='[["BL_824.6",824,[259,776,1155,1102]]]'>On cross-examination Trooper Moran acknowledged that when he wrote down appellant’s answers he omitted appellant’s remarks to the effect that the guards were trying to kill him by injecting poison in his legs. He also said that he substituted his words for appellant’s words. Because appellant’s answers were lengthy and Trooper Moran did not type well, he edited the answers. Trooper Moran conceded he could not recall which words in the written statement were appellant’s and which were his own. Moreover, he did not pay any attention to anything appellant said “outside the incident.” He said he did not remember what else appellant said that he did not record and that appellant “probably told me other things but when you go over to . .. Graterford .. . the inmates tell you all kinds of things. They are always telling you that the guards are trying to kill them, . . . trying to poison their food, trying to cripple them ...” N.T. at 236 (November 7, 1979). Moreover, Moran said that appellant’s remarks about being injected with poison were “mixed in” with appellant’s oral statement about the incident. About fifteen minutes of appellant’s oral statement pertained to:</p>

Consequently, the jury needed to see the written confession to determine which words were appellant’s and which were Trooper Moran’s summaries and paraphrases. That claim, however, supports appellant’s contention that the presence of the written confession in the jury room was prejudicial to him. During its deliberations the jury had only the signed confession before it. They did not have the benefit of comparing it to the cross-examination testimony in which Trooper Moran admitted to editing the oral statement. The jury may have believed that the signed confession was sent out with them because it accurately reflected appellant’s state of mind shortly after the killing, a fact which was in dispute. Thus, the Rule 1114 violation was plainly prejudicial.</p>
    <p id="b825-5" data-blocks='[["BL_825.5",825,[177,1137,1147,579]]]'>We must reject the Commonwealth’s contention that the Rule 1114 violation was harmless error. Appellant’s sole defense was diminished capacity, i.e. that he did not have the requisite mental state to commit first degree murder. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weinstein, </em><a href="/pa/499/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="499 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1778805" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0106-01">499 Pa. 106</a>, <a href="/pa/499/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="499 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1778805" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0106-01">451 A.2d 1344</a> (1982); <em>Commonwealth v. Walzack, </em><a href="/pa/468/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="468 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1719630" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0210-01">468 Pa. 210</a>, <a href="/pa/468/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="468 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1719630" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0210-01">360 A.2d 914</a> (1976). While there was ample evidence for the jury to find the killing of Felix Mokychic was planned, premeditated and deliberate, honest fair-minded jurors might have concluded that appellant’s delusional mental state at the time of the killing precluded plan, premeditation or deliberation.</p>
    <p id="b825-6" data-blocks='[["BL_825.6",825,[176,1733,1147,310]]]'>As the Commonwealth admits, there was a serious dispute as to whether the statement signed by appellant or the oral communications between appellant and Trooper Moran best reflected appellant’s mental state shortly after the murder. Moreover, appellant’s oral statement as described by Trooper Moran supported his defense.</p>

Moreover, appellant had a history of epileptic seizure disorder. Dr. Cooke also stated that around 1976 or 1977 appellant had a “psychotic break” with reality and as a result he developed <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>somatic delusions. He testified that appellant believed the guards put gas in his cell and they injected him with poison while he was asleep. Appellant stated that on several occasions he was awakened by the gas and he saw the guards backing out of his cell. Appellant also believed the poisoning was part of a conspiracy between guards and officials to get him and that the guards and other inmates ridiculed him because of a physical disability. Dr. Cooke stated appellant acted in a rage which resulted from his mental illness, that he did not have the capacity to premeditate and deliberate and that his delusional remarks to Trooper Moran supported that conclusion. N.T. at 778-83 (November 13, 1979). <em>it</em>

    <p id="b826-5" data-blocks='[["BL_826.5",826,[268,1012,1155,1164]]]'>Dr. Robert Sadoff, a psychiatrist, testified that in his opinion appellant hallucinated the story of the guards poisoning his legs. He said appellant suffered from paranoid ideation, a condition in which a person projects the blame on others for what he feels for himself. Sadoff testified that appellant picked up the baseball bat because he was afraid he would be hurt or killed and that when the victim pushed him he believed he had to protect himself. He lashed out in rage, with fear and without control. He concluded appellant had the ability to premeditate and the ability to form a specific intent to kill but it was based on his delusion that the guards had killed his “little buddy, Vasquez,” and they were also going to kill him. N.T. at 917 (November 13,1979). We note that simple lack of control is not available in Pennsylvania either to negate <em>mens rea </em>or to establish diminished capacity in a murder prosecution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weinstein, <a href="/pa/499/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="499 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1778805" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0106-01">supra.</a> </em>However, delusions which prevent an accused from understanding the nature and quality of his act, or recognizing it as wrong are relevant. Since this testimony arguably showed the latter it was relevant and admissible. <em>Commonwealth v. Walzack, <a href="/pa/468/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="468 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1719630" data-case-paths="/pa/468/0210-01">supra.</a></em>

The signed statement was coherent and focused only on the inculpatory portions of the oral remarks concerning his mental state and eliminated those portions of his remarks consistent with his only defense. <em>Compare Commonwealth v. Riggins, </em><a href="/pa/478/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="478 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1740538" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0222-01">478 Pa. 222</a>, <a href="/pa/478/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="478 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1740538" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0222-01">386 A.2d 520</a> (1978). Consequently, the Rule 1114 error here involved related directly to the only element of the crime which was in dispute. We cannot therefore conclude, as the Commonwealth contends, that the evidence on appellant’s mental state was so overwhelming or that the error of permitting the written signed confession to go out with the jury was so insignificant that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.
