The need for a public utility to receive a fair rate of return on its property to assure its continued financial integrity, necessary to achievement of the important goal of preserving modern, efficient, and dependable public service, consonant with rights of customers, is not to be ignored. The legislature, seeking to balance these competing interests, has authorized the PUC to employ an automatic fuel cost adjustment, the ECR, to maintain a just and reasonable return. In so doing, the legislature has not conferred broad discretion upon the PUC; rather, Section <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>1307(c) specifically sets forth factors to govern the fuel cost adjustment employed by the PUC.

    <blockquote id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.7",276,[305,1951,1111,419]]]'>For more than a century the central meaning of procedural due process has been clear: “Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified.” (citations omitted) It is equally fundamental that the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard “must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” (citation omitted)</blockquote>

The purpose of this requirement is not only to ensure abstract fair play to the individual. Its purpose, more particularly, is to protect his use and possession of property from arbitrary encroachment — to minimize substantively unfair or mistaken deprivations of property, a danger that is especially great when the State seizes goods simply upon the application of and for the benefit of a private party.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[229,963,1105,632]]]'>If the right to notice and a hearing is to serve its full purpose, then, it is clear that it must be granted at a time when the deprivation can still be prevented. At a later hearing, an individual’s possessions can be returned to him if they were unfairly or mistakenly taken in the first place. Damages may even be awarded to him for the wrongful deprivation. But no later hearing and no damage award can undo the fact that the arbitrary taking that was subject to the right of procedural due process has already occurred. “This Court has not . . . embraced the general proposition that a wrong may be done if it can be undone.” (citation omitted).</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[227,1610,1106,629]]]'>This is no new principle of constitutional law. The right to a prior hearing has long been recognized by this Court under the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments. Although the Court has held that due process tolerates variances in the <em>form </em>of a hearing “appropriate to the nature of the case,” (citation omitted) and “depending upon the importance of the interests involved and the nature of the subsequent proceedings [if any],” (citation omitted), <em>the Court has traditionally insisted that, whatever its form, opportunity for that hearing must be provided before the deprivation at issue takes effect, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>

I would further hold that, under the circumstances of this case, minimum due process requires the procedures (and protections) urged upon this Court by appellants, namely advance notice, access to supporting data, an opportunity to be heard at least by way of written objections, and a determination on the record which responds to those objections. Such informal procedures need not be elaborate and need not be unduly time-consuming. The time-frame of the instant case — six weeks from filing proposed increase until effective date of increase — proved more than adequate time to accommodate these minimum procedural requirements. As Professor K.C. Davis has stated, Administrative Law Treatise, <em>supra, </em>§ 10:1, “balancing to guide the choice between Goss procedure [the author’s term, from <em>Goss v.
