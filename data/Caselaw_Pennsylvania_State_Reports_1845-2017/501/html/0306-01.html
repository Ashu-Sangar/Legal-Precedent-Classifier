During the procedure, and continuing for several hours thereafter, barium solution leaked out of a perforation in appellant’s colon into her abdominal cavity, ultimately necessitating surgery to remove the barium. Further surgeries were required to drain an abscess which had formed after the first surgery, to remove damaged portions of the colon and one ovary, and to repair and remove adhesions which had formed on the colon.</p>
