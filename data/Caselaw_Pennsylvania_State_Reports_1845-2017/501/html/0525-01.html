In this context, appellant alleges that the trial court should not have excused the witness without first establishing the factual basis of the asserted privilege; that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by threatening prosecution which coerced the witness into invoking his privilege; and that trial counsel was ineffective<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> for failing to establish on the record the nature of the defense witness’ anticipated testimony and in failing to question the witness to ascertain whether the threat of prosecution influenced the witness’ decision not to testify. Finally, appellant claims counsel was ineffective for failing to call a co-defendant as a defense witness after the court entered a directed verdict of not guilty in favor of the co-defendant upon the conclusion of the Commonwealth’s case. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b722-5" data-blocks='[["BL_722.5",722,[267,1255,1153,430]]]'>The underlying facts of the instant appeal are as follows: In the early morning hours of November 15, 1977, Allen Page met Luther McCray in a restaurant and asked if McCray and another individual, Carlos Heath, who was with McCray, would assist Page in removing the remainder of Page’s belongings from McCray’s apartment. Page had lived in McCray’s apartment but previously moved to another apartment on north 20th Street in Philadelphia.</p>

Appellant, Johnny Allen, also a resident at the 20th Street location, looked out the window and subsequently came down to admit the three men. Page was the last to enter. Immediately thereafter, appellant slammed the door behind McCray, Heath and Page and proceeded to pull out a butcher knife. Appellant searched and then took McCray’s money, coat and watch. Another individual, Charles Carter <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>appeared at the top of the stairs. Heath was also searched by appellant, but nothing was found. Page was neither searched nor robbed.</p>
    <p id="b723-5" data-blocks='[["BL_723.5",723,[177,477,1145,628]]]'>Appellant then allowed McCray, Heath and Page to leave after warning them not to call the police. McCray called the police from a nearby set of public telephones. Page simultaneously used another telephone and made a call, the contents of which could not be determined because “he tried to keep his voice down” although Heath was standing near Page. While waiting for the police, McCray flagged down a patrol car and informed the officer of the robbery. Upon arrival at the 20th Street apartment with the police, McCray identified appellant, who had changed his clothes, and Charles Carter. Both appellant and Carter were arrested, but the stolen items were not recovered.</p>
    <p id="b723-6" data-blocks='[["BL_723.6",723,[177,1139,1146,690]]]'>Appellant and Carter were tried together. At the close of the Commonwealth’s case, the court directed a verdict of acquittal against Carter. Appellant did not testify, but defense counsel attempted to call Allen Page as a witness. The prosecutor informed the court that there was a question concerning Page’s participation in the incident, and as an officer of the court, the prosecutor suggested that counsel should be appointed to represent Page. The court appointed Walter Dinda, Esquire, to represent Page and upon conferring with Page, Mr. Dinda informed the court that pursuant to his (Dinda’s) advice, Page did not wish to testify and intended to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege. Page was called to the stand and the following colloquy occurred:</p>

Additionally, appellant has failed to show that any purpose would be served by the preservation of the evidence sought to be obtained from Page. If the exercise of the privilege was proper, and we find that it was, no purpose can be served by attempting to memorialize it. Counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue an action which would not inure to the benefit of his client. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tarver, </em><a href="/pa/491/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="491 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1765696" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0253-01">491 Pa. 253</a>, <a href="/pa/491/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="491 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1765696" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0253-01">420 A.2d 438</a> (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilkerson, </em><a href="/pa/490/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="490 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="1763807" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0296-01">490 Pa. 296</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="490 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="1763807" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0296-01">416 A.2d 477</a> (1980); <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant merely alleges that counsel’s failure to present testimony of a co-defendant, <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>Carter, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellant provides no factual basis supporting the conclusion that the co-defendant Carter possessed exculpatory evidence. Appellant’s implicit suggestion that because Carter was acquitted, he therefore was a favorable witness is a non sequitur. The fact that he was present and observed the event readily suggests that he may have been an eyewitness against appellant. Absent a showing that the co-defendant’s testimony would have indeed been favorable, there is no factual predicate for this claim of ineffectiveness. <em>Commonwealth v.
