      <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>Appellants, Gary and Doris Burleson, are the owners of a mobile home located in Smithfield, Pennsylvania. On April 10, 1979, they filed an informal complaint with the Consumer Services Bureau of the P.U.C. claiming that their utility company, West Penn Power Company, the appellee, (hereinafter “West Penn”) had overcharged them for electric service since January of 1978. The total amount of the alleged overbilling was less than $200.00. After they were denied relief, appellants retained counsel and filed a formal complaint with the P.U.C. dated October 9, 1979 claiming that they had been chronically overbilled from January, 1978 through June, 1979.</p>
    <p id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[169,961,1147,460]]]'>An Administrative Law Judge heard arguments on the complaint and denied appellants relief by decision dated July 17, 1980. Appellants filed exceptions which were subsequently argued and dismissed. Appeal was then taken to the P.U.C. which affirmed the Administrative Law Judge’s decision after oral arguments were heard in an opinion dated December 11, 1980. Subsequently, appellants appealed to the Commonwealth Court which affirmed the P.U.C. We now affirm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.6",629,[168,1447,1149,685]]]'>In a complaint for overbilling by a customer of a public utility, the legislature has placed the burden of proof upon the complainant. <em>See </em>66 Pa.C.S.A. § 332(a). The P.U.C. promulgated a rule in <em>Malcom Waldron v. P.U.C., </em>C-77100047, which provided that in such proceedings a complainant may establish a prima facie case that can not be defeated, in limine, by the complainant’s failure to prove the utility’s meter was misread or otherwise inaccurate. Recognizing that technical expertise to test meter accuracy may not be available to a complainant, the P.U.C. in <em>Waldron </em>established other evidentiary criteria for determination upon the whole record of whether a complainant has established a prima facie case.</p>
    <p id="b629-6" data-blocks='[["BL_629.7",629,[166,2150,1147,96]],["BL_630.1",630,[252,298,1153,524]]]'>Under these requirements, a complainant may establish a prima facie case by showing that his power usage for the <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>billing period in question was unchanged from earlier periods and his bill for the same period was higher than previous bills. The burden of <em>going forward, </em>not the burden of proof, as appellants’ erroneously contend, then shifts to the utility which must rebut the complainant’s case with co-equal evidence. Under <em>Waldron </em>the fact finder measures the weight of all the evidence so that the mere proof by the utility that its power measuring devices were accurate is no longer the sole determinant as to whether there is a basis to a complaint of overbilling.</p>
    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[248,845,1156,1218]]]'>Thus, essentially the <em>Waldron </em>Rule is an evidentiary device by which a utility customer’s complaint of overbilling is protected from dismissal during the early stages of litigation. Even if the rule’s requirements are met, a complainant remains obligated to prove his case after the utility presents its rebuttal evidence. Therefore, unless a utility customer’s complaint is dismissed for his failure to establish a prima facie case, the applicability of <em>Waldron </em>at the appeal stage of litigation is irrelevant. Here, appellants’ case was dismissed for their failure to meet the required burden of proof, not because they failed to establish a prima facie case under the <em>Waldron </em>rule. The Commonwealth Court, consequently, properly disregarded the rule and confined its scope of review to the question of whether appellants met the required burden of proof. <em>See </em>2 Pa.C.S. § 704. <em>See also, Norfolk and Western Railway Co. v. P.U.C., </em><a href="/pa/489/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="489 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1762420" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0109-01">489 Pa. 109</a>, <a href="/pa/489/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="489 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1762420" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0109-01">413 A.2d 1037</a> (1980) (providing that the scope of appellate review of administrative agencies is to determine if there is substantial evidence in the record to support the lower tribunal’s findings, whether there was an error of law or abuse of discretion or whether constitutional rights were violated). We agree with the Commonwealth Court that appellants’ failed to meet their burden.</p>

On cross-examination he stated that certain <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>factors such as “a ground fault” or “theft” may have explained the increase of appellants’ power use during the period in question.

    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[164,550,1145,360]]]'>West Penn presented numerous exhibits and expert testimony establishing that the power measuring devices were accurate and that voltage fluctuation, which appellants’ alleged was a factor in causing the disputed increase, had no impact on the meter readings. West Penn also established that appellants’ neighbors did not experience the same difficulties that affected the Burlesons’.</p>
    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.6",631,[164,939,1146,367]]]'>Appellants claim the evidence presented by appellee was insufficient to meet West Penn’s burden of going forward to rebut the Burleson’s prima facie case under <em>Waldron </em>and that, as a consequence, they should have prevailed. The crucial flaw in this argument is its failure to distinguish between the processes of establishing a prima facie case and meeting the required burden of proof.</p>

The statutory burden [see 66 Pa.C.S.A. § 332(a) ] is satisfied when a complainant offers evidence that his consumption of power during the time segment in question did not cause the excessive usage in dispute.
