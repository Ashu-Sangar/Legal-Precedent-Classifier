    <p id="b420-8" data-blocks='[["BL_420.8",420,[249,720,1154,735]]]'>This case arose from the denial by the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Pittsburgh of appellee’s request to occupy the property she leases in Pittsburgh as a boarding house. That decision, as affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, was based upon the fact that appellee’s property is located in an R-4 residential district where under § 937.02 of the Pittsburgh Code boarding homes are not permitted. The Commonwealth Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> however, reasoned that boarding homes could not be rationally excluded from the R-4 residential districts when rooming houses were allowed in such districts. Therefore, that court held § 937.02 of the Pittsburgh Code to be unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection of the law. We now reverse.</p>
