    <p id="b369-16" data-blocks='[["BL_369.15",369,[179,1821,1149,526]]]'>Appellant Frank Hart appeals from a judgment of sentence of imprisonment of five to fifteen years imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia upon a verdict of murder of the third degree entered after a bench trial. Appellant seeks a new trial on the ground that his trial counsel allegedly provided ineffective assistance in failing to object to the competency of two of the Commonwealth’s eyewitnesses, both of whom were minors. Having found <em>no </em>basis on the record for the disqualification of these eyewitnesses, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[250,285,1159,1210]]]'>
      <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>Appellant was tried on charges of murder generally and voluntary manslaughter for the beating death on August 26, 1977, of sixty-six year old Jessié Hines. The Commonwealth’s case against appellant was established through the testimony of three eyewitnesses: Mary Johnson, an adult, and Will McCray and Shawn Dukes, both minors. McCray, then thirteen years of age, testified that, immediately before the beating, he had observed appellant standing on the sidewalk outside the victim’s home, had heard appellant say “I’m going in there and get Jessie,” and had seen appellant enter the victim’s home. McCray also testified that through the front window of the victim’s home he had seen appellant punch the victim five or six times on the head and face, and shake the victim severely. Shawn Dukes, then eleven years of age, testified that he, too, had seen appellant enter the victim’s home and punch the victim, although he stated that appellant had not announced that he was going to “get Jessie” until the victim had been beaten. Mary Johnson, the adult eyewitness, corroborated the testimony of both minors concerning the beating. Additionally, testimony of a medical examiner revealed that the cause of death had been a subdural hematoma, an injury consistent, with a beating.</p>

The matter was transferred to the Superior Court, which, in a per curiam opinion, rejected two claims of trial error, but declined to reach the merits of appellant’s present allegation of ineffective assistance because trial counsel was impermissibly attempting to argue his own ineffectiveness. <em>Commonwealth v.
