Jones was given lesser concurrent sentences for the other convictions. Notice of Appeal to this Court was filed on July 7,1980. Under former 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 722(1), Act of 1976, July 9, P.L. 586, No. 142, § 2, <em>as </em>amended, Act of 1978, April 28, P.L. 202, No. 53, § 10(4) (rewritten, Act of 1980, Sept. 23, P.L. 686, No. 137, § 1, effective in 60 days), this Court has jurisdiction of an appeal from a finding of guilt of a felonious homicide, where the appeal was filed before November 22, 1980.</p>

On May 3, a woman, accompanied by the Appellant, tried to withdraw money from Scott’s savings account, but was refused for lack of verifiable identification. The following day at another branch, a man and woman succeeded in withdrawing $1,500.00 from Scott’s account. On May 6, Scott’s body was found in the bedroom of her home, shot nine times in the head. Police detectives found her car about one block away. Examination of the car turned up several items of clothing.</p>

The following day another anonymous caller stated that the Appellant Jesse Jones had been driving Scott’s car and that he lived at 3015 Colona Street. On May 12, Delores Jones, wife of the Appellant, was questioned by police, and positively identified several items of clothing found in the trunk of Scott’s car as belonging to her husband. She also testified that she had seen him with a gun wrapped in a plastic bag on May 11. Based on the foregoing and other evidence, the police obtained an arrest warrant for Jesse Jones, who was taken into custody on May 12, 1977. While in custody, Jones gave a statement to police which was later used at his trial.</p>

Near the end of a lengthy summation, the prosecutor picked up the gun identified as the murder weapon, pulled the trigger several times, pretended to reload the gun, and pulled the trigger again, all within close range of the jury. Jones argues that these actions could only result in a determination of guilt that was the product of fear or vengeance rather than intellectually compelled after a disinterested, impartial, and fair assessment of the testimony. The Commonwealth correctly argues that because defense counsel immediately objected (which objection was sustained), but made no request for mistrial or curative instructions, the issue has been waived. <em>See Commonwealth v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa/467/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="467 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1717257" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0512-01">467 Pa. 512</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="467 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1717257" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0512-01">359 A.2d 393</a> (1976). Even if preserved for review, however, the Appellant’s claim is meritless. The trial judge noted in his Opinion his strong disapproval of the prosecutor’s gesticulations, but not every impropriety on the part of the prosecutor warrants reversal. The trial judge, being in the best position to determine the appropriate remedy, will not be reversed except for abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth v.
