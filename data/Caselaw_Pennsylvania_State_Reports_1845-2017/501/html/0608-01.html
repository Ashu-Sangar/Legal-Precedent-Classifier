This appeal was discontinued when the PUC granted reconsideration of its order.

The PUC then affirmed, with some modifications, the order of the administrative law judge. Appellants appealed that order to the Commonwealth Court.

In examining the law governing the writ of prohibition, it is clear that the writ is intended for use against an administrative agency when it is acting in a “Quasi-Judicial” <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>capacity. <em>See Carpentertown Coal &amp; Coke Co. v.

However, an agency engaged in rulemaking is not considered to be acting in a “quasi-judicial” function; rather, the agency is considered to be involved in a “quasi-legislative” function. <em>See Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v.

    <p id="b805-4" data-blocks='[["BL_805.5",805,[163,896,1148,863]]]'>I disagree with the Commonwealth Court’s and the majority’s application of the law to the facts in this case. The finding that the PUC was acting in a quasi-legislative capacity does not square with the commission’s activities. The order of the PUC, which is contested by appellants, is a finding that the PUC has jurisdiction to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for CATV Pole Attachment Agreements. The PUC made the decision by interpreting the various provisions of the Public Utility Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> I find this kind of action by the PUC to be more in the nature of a “Judicial” decision as opposed to “Legislative” activity. Accordingly, the PUC order is properly the subject matter of a petition for a writ of prohibition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a>
