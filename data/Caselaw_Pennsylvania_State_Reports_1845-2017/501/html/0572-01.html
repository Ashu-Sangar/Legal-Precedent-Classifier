Appellant responded: “I’m against the system, period.” The judge then warned appellant that failure to stand the next time court formally opened would be punished with contempt. Appellant replied: “You can give me a contempt now, but I will never rise.” At that point, the court held appellant in contempt and sentenced him to six months imprisonment.</p>

    <p id="b772-5" data-blocks='[["BL_772.5",772,[250,984,1154,1115]]]'>It must be emphasized that the narrow issue here presented is whether a defendant’s refusal to rise, <em>without more, </em>is sufficient to sustain a criminal contempt citation under section 4131(3). The federal cases are instructive in our present determination of the Pennsylvania summary contempt statute. Although this Court has recognized that “. . . the law of contempt never commands a party to exhibit fawning respect for the court and the proceedings . . <em>.Commonwealth v. Reid, <a href="/pa/494/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="494 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1769135" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0201-01">supra</a> </em>494 Pa. at 208, <a href="/pa/494/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="494 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1769135" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0201-01">431 A.2d at 222</a>, it is clear the rising requirement serves both substantive and procedural interests and constitutes an integral part of the judicial process. Moreover, as a reasonable regulation of courtroom behavior, the absence of a mechanism for its enforcement would render the requirement illusory. Thus, there is little question that appellant’s intentional failure to observe the rising requirement in the instant case constituted “misbehavior in the presence of the court.” However, as the federal cases make clear, under the federal counterpart to section 4131(3), when applied to a criminal defendant, it is the resulting obstruction of the proceedings that is critical to sustaining a criminal contempt citation.</p>
