Appellant challenges the constitutionality of section 6305 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6305 (formerly § 5 of the Juvenile Act, Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, 11 P.S. § 50-301), which authorized the court of common pleas to hold a “rehearing” on the petition charging appellant with delinquency following a master’s recommendation that the petition be dismissed.

    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[225,466,1153,1269]]]'>Appellant’s contention is based on the erroneous premise that the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution of the United States and the double jeopardy clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution forbid a rehearing on a delinquency petition before a juvenile court judge following a hearing on that petition before a master. The master’s function is, by the express terms of the Judicial Code, confined to the transmittal of “written findings and recommendations for disposition to the judge.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6305(c). The master’s findings and recommendations may become the “findings and order of the court” only when “confirmed in writing by the judge,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6305(d), the only official under the legislatively designed system entrusted to enter a binding judgment. Whereas jeopardy attaches at proceedings before a juvenile court judge, “whose object is to determine whether [the juvenile] has committed acts that violate a criminal law and whose potential consequences include both the stigma inherent in such a determination and the .deprivation of liberty for many years,” <em>Breed v. </em>Jones, <a href="/us/421/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="421 U.S. 519" data-case-ids="541745" data-case-paths="/us/421/0519-01">421 U.S. 519</a>, 529, <a href="/us/421/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="421 U.S. 519" data-case-ids="541745" data-case-paths="/us/421/0519-01">95 S.Ct. 1779</a>,1785, <a href="/us/421/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="421 U.S. 519" data-case-ids="541745" data-case-paths="/us/421/0519-01">44 L.Ed.2d 346</a> (1975), clearly jeopardy does not attach at a master’s hearing, whose purpose is to facilitate the final disposition of delinquency petitions by a juvenile court judge.</p>

In support of this contention, appellant relies upon a portion of <em>Swisher </em>in which the Supreme Court rejected a similar challenge to Maryland’s master system, observing that the Maryland system permitted a juvenile court judge to receive additional evidence “only with the consent of the minor.” <a href="/us/438/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="438 U.S. 204" data-case-ids="1769280" data-case-paths="/us/438/0204-01">438 U.S. at 216</a>,98 S.Ct. at 2706. On this record, however, it is clear that the Commonwealth did not present evidence before the juvenile court judge that it had previously failed to “muster”: Garcia, the victim of the alleged assault, was the sole Commonwealth witness at both hearings, and presented substantially the same testimony. More important, the Supreme Court in <em>Swisher </em>did not rely upon Maryland’s consent requirement as a condition of that system’s constitutionality, but rather recognized that Maryland had conferred the role of factfinder and adjudicator only on the juvenile court judge.</p>
