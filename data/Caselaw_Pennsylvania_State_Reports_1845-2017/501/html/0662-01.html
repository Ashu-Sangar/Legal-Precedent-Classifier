Because of this pervasive ambiguity, and because, in my opinion, any enactment (or interpretation) which abolishes a common-law recognized remedy or cause of action without providing a substitute, statutory remedy or cause of action runs afoul of Article I, § 11 of our Constitution, see dissenting opinion of this author in <em>Carroll v. York, </em><a href="/pa/496/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="496 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1772948" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0363-01">496 Pa. 363</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="496 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1772948" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0363-01">437 A.2d 394</a>, 399 (1981) (joined by Flaherty and Kauffman, JJ.), I would hold that absent specific and <em>explicit </em>provisions to the contrary, any cause of action or remedy pre-dating the No-Fault Act, including punitive damages, remains in existence today. Thus, I would resolve all ambiguity in favor of no abolition and continued recognition of common-law remedies and causes of action.</p>

      <a id="p664" href="#p664" data-label="664" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*664</a>I believe that such ambiguity exists regarding the effect of No-Fault upon recovery for punitive damages. Section 301(a) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 1009.301(a), provides in part:</p>

For purposes of the No-Fault Act, I would hold that “intentional injury” includes the willful and reckless disregard for the safety, welfare and rights of others and would therefore hold the defendant’s outrageous conduct in this case — driving his car through a posted school zone which had caution lights flashing at a speed at least twice the speed limit of 25 m.p.h. — renders him “liable for intentionally injuring . . . another individual” within the meaning of § 301(a)(3).</p>

Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>however, that the lengthy passages quoted by the Superior Court were relevant to the interpretation of Pennsylvania’s No-Fault Act, it seems to me they support a <em>contrary </em>conclusion.
