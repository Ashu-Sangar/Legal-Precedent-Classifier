At issue is whether the evidence was sufficient to permit the Board to conclude (1) that denial of the variances would result in unnecessary hardship to Ms. Horen and (2) that Ms. Horen’s proposed commercial use of her property would not be contrary to the public interest. Having reviewed the record in accordance with the well-established principles of judicial review governing variances, we conclude that the Board’s findings were supported by substantial evidence and should not have been disturbed. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the Court of Common Pleas affirming the Board’s action.</p>

On January 3, 1980, Richard J. Sheward, an architect retained by Ms. Horen, sought permission from the Philadelphia Department of Licenses and Inspections to convert the Ridge Avenue property into a take-out steak and sandwich shop and a two-family dwelling. Since the property was situated in a district rezoned single family residential in August 1978, both uses were summarily refused. Ms. Horen then sought variances from the Board to permit such uses. Mr. Sheward and representatives of appellee Valley View Civic Association (Valley View) and three other civic groups opposing the grant of variances testified before the Board on January 24, 1980. By a unanimous vote, the Board granted the requested variances on February 14, 1980. Valley View obtained review in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas by way of a writ of certiorari, and Ms. Horen was permitted to intervene in the proceedings before that court. No additional evidence was taken. After oral argument, the Court of Common Pleas affirmed the Board’s action. Valley View subsequently appealed to the Commonwealth Court, and on June 22, 1982, a three-judge panel of that court, one judge dissenting, reversed. Following denial of reargument, this Court granted Ms. Horen’s petition for allowance of appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

While evidence of the owner’s inability to sell his property has unquestionable probative value, <em>see e.g. Peirce </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Adjustment, supra; Ferry v. Kownacki, supra, </em>it would be unreasonable to force a property owner to attempt to sell as a prerequisite to the grant of a variance. We reiterate that the only showing required by our case law is that (1) an unnecessary hardship will be worked upon the property owner if the variance is denied, and (2) the proposed variance will not be contrary to the public interest. It is the function of the zoning board to determine whether the evidence satisfies that test and the courts will not disturb that determination unless it is not supported by substantial evidence, i.e., such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.</p>

That evidence paints a picture of a property flanked by a large convenience store and a gas station on a heavily travelled roadway, surrounded by a patchwork of commercial and industrial businesses, vacant lots and intermittent dwellings. It would not be unreasonable to infer that a property so situated would be undesirable and hence unmarketable for residential use. Thus there was substantial evidence to support the Board’s findings and we need look no further.</p>

Furthermore, the Board found from a visual inspection of the block on which the property is located that other uses on the block include: another gas station, a beauty shop and barber shop, a haberdashery, a beer distributor, a trash removal business and at least seven occupied dwellings. Thus, evidence of hardship was essentially limited to the existence of commercial uses in the vicinity of Appellee’s property.</blockquote>

The factual findings of the Zoning Board of Adjustment must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Center City Residents Asso. v.

The <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>record shows the applicant’s only testimony in support of her variance was from her architect who described commercial uses in the block surrounding the applicant’s property in the majority opinion. In the same block, however, there were seven residential dwellings. No witness testified that the commercial use of adjacent land prevented the use of this property for residential purposes. There was no evidence that the existing commercial uses were disharmonious with residential use of the subject property. No one testified that if the applicant’s property was restricted to residential use, it would have no value or distress value. In fact, the record is barren of any testimony which would support the grant of a use variance other than a description of the block which demonstrates mixed commercial and residential use. As the Commonwealth Court aptly observed, most telling is the fact that under the proposed variance the subject property would be used for both commercial and residential purposes. Consequently, Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that the record did not include substantial evidence to support the Board’s finding of unnecessary hardship. <em>See e.g., Richman v.
