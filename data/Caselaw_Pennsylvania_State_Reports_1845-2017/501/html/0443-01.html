    <p id="b638-13" data-blocks='[["BL_638.12",638,[248,1234,1152,366]]]'>Appellant, George Jodziewicz, was convicted of murder of the first degree and endangering the welfare of children in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County after a change of venue from Luzerne County. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life for murder and one to two years for endangering the welfare of children, the sentences to run concurrently. He appeals the judgment of sentence.</p>

We have considered these arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>
