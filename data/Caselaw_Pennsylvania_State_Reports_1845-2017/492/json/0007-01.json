        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County which granted the appellee mother\u2019s petition to involuntarily terminate the parental rights of the appellant father with respect to their daughter, J. L. Z. The court below held that appellant had, for a period of at least six months, failed to perform parental duties under Section 311(1) of the Adoption Act.\nThe standard of review in cases where parental rights have been terminated is limited to a determination of whether the decree was supported by competent evidence. In re Adoption of Baby Boy P., 479 Pa. 138, 387 A.2d 873 (1978). With regard to the parental duties required under Section 311(1), this Court stated in In re Adoption of F. D. S., 490 Pa. 43, 46, 415 A.2d 23, 25 (1980):\n[W]e have repeatedly held that, for the purposes of this section, \u201cthe parental obligation is a positive duty which requires affirmative performance. .. . [citations omitted] .... This affirmative duty encompasses more than a financial obligation; it requires continuing interest in the child and a genuine effort to maintain communication and association with the child .... [citations omitted] .... Because a child needs more than a benefactor, parental duty requires that a parent exert himself to take and maintain a place of importance in the child\u2019s life.\u201d In re Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights of S. C. B. and K. T., 474 Pa. 615, 624, 379 A.2d 535, 540 (1977).\nIn view of the standard of review, and the affirmative duties imposed upon a parent, we cannot say that the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division is not supported by competent evidence. J. L. Z. was born in 1973 and in 1975 her parents were divorced, following which J. L. Z. resided with her mother. Under the terms of a custody agreement entered pursuant the divorce, J. L. Z.\u2019s mother retained custody, subject to visitation rights of the father. The father, who lived approximately twenty miles from J. L. Z., failed to visit or provide support for the child from January, 1976 until the instant termination proceeding commenced in November, 1978. The father testified that the mother\u2019s actions prevented or discouraged contact with the child, but the court below described this testimony as \u201cnot at all convincing.\u201d According to the father, his admitted lack of contact with J. L. Z. after January, 1976, and his decision not to institute an action to enforce visitation rights against the allegedly uncooperative mother, were due to his belief that, in view of J. L. Z.\u2019s young age, it was in the child\u2019s best interest not to be exposed to the animosity and conflict between himself and the child\u2019s mother. Certainly, situations may arise where circumstances would temporarily justify a parent in absenting himself from association with his child, for the child\u2019s benefit, to avoid the emotional stress inflicted upon a child when visitation necessitates a hostile confrontation in the child\u2019s presence. At most, however, the present record indicates that the father encountered moderate frustration in maintaining contact with J. L. Z., due to difficulties in ascertaining the mother's address and phone number and in agreeing on suitable days for visitation. A parent has a duty to exercise persistence in attempting to overcome obstacles placed in the path of the parent-child relationship. In re D. J. Y., 487 Pa. 125, 408 A.2d 1387 (1979). The difficulties encountered by the appellant father were not of such a magnitude as could conceivably justify, however, the virtually complete lack of communication and association with the child during the nearly three year period in question. The record is devoid of evidence of such an unavoidable and intense confrontation as might warrant, even temporarily, a parent in abstaining from performance of parental duties.\nDecree affirmed; Each party to bear own costs.\n. Section 311 of the Adoption Act provides:\n\u00a7 311. Grounds for involuntary termination\nThe rights of a parent in regard to a child may be terminated ... on the ground that:\n(1) The parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least six months either has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to a child, or has refused or failed to perform parental duties; or ...\nAct of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, No. 208, art. III, Sec. 311, 1 P.S. \u00a7 311 (Supp.1980).\nParental rights may be terminated upon proof of a six month failure to perform parental duties, without need to show a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to a child.
