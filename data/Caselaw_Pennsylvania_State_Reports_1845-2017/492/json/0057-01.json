        "text": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM:\nThe Court being equally divided, the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County is affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nROBERTS, J., files an Opinion in Support of Affirmance, joined by O\u2019BRIEN, C. J., and LARSEN, J.\nFLAHERTY, J., files an Opinion in Support of Reversal, joined by NIX and KAUFFMAN, JJ.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from the unanimous decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, sitting en banc, which denied the admission of the will of decedent Susanna H. Proley to probate. The court en banc affirmed the finding of the auditing judge that, in writing her name on a printed will form in the portion normally used for identifying the document when properly folded, decedent failed to comply with the statutory requirement that a will be signed \u201cat the end thereof,\u201d 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502, and therefore failed to execute a valid will. Because the unanimous decree of the court en banc is based on a correct and consistent reading of all the cases in which this Court has interpreted this legislative mandate, it should be affirmed.\nIn a misguided effort to effect what they perceive to be decedent\u2019s intent, the members of this Court who would reverse the decree make two flawed assertions. First, they contend that, because the identification section of the will appears on what they consider the final page, decedent \u201cevidently\u201d believed she was signing her will at its end. This purely speculative argument ignores the consistent holdings of this Court that a decedent's intent or belief is irrelevant to a determination of whether his signature appears at the end of his will. \u201cThe question is not what a testator mistakenly thinks he is doing, but what he actually does.\u201d Bryen\u2019s Estate, 328 Pa. 122, 128, 195 A. 17, 20 (1937); accord, Glace Will, 413 Pa. 91, 196 A.2d 297 (1964); Kretz Estate, 410 Pa. 590, 189 A.2d 239 (1963); Baldwin Will, 357 Pa. 432, 55 A.2d 263 (1947); Coyne Will, 349 Pa. 331, 37 A.2d 509 (1944); Brown Estate, 347 Pa. 244, 32 A.2d 22 (1943); Churchill's Estate, 260 Pa. 94, 103 A. 533 (1918); Dietterich\u2019s Estate, 127 Pa.Super. 315, 193 A. 158 (1937).\nThe Opinion in Support of Reversal then asserts that, in any event, decedent complied with the statutory requirement by signing her will \u201cliterally at the end.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d this argument runs, \u201cthis signature appears at the end of the will in that it is the last item and the only item to appear on page four. This is true, notwithstanding that blank space appears above the signature and that the signature is written at right angles to the page.\u201d (Opinion in Support of Reversal at 141).\nIn fact, there are no page numbers on the document, and what the Opinion in Support of Reversal characterizes as \u201cpage four\u201d appears as the title page when the document is properly folded, providing a ready identification of the author of the contents, and no more. The words stand alone, at right angles to the rest of the writing in the document, unrelated to its substance in any way.\nAs our well settled case law has consistently held, \u201c[t]he end contemplated by the Act is not the point which is physically furthest from the beginning of the writing. As we said in Kehr Will, 373 Pa. 473, 479, 95 A.2d 647 (1953): \u2018 \u201cThe end contemplated by the statute is the logical end of the language used by decedent in expressing his testamentary purpose,\u201d \u2019 or, as was said in Coyne Will, 349 Pa. 331, 333, 37 A.2d 509 (1944): \u201c\u2018. . . there must be a sequence of pages or paragraphs which relates to its logical and internal sense, and the signature must be placed at the sequential end.\u201d \u2019 See, also, Baldwin Will, 357 Pa., supra.\u201d\nKretz Estate, supra, 410 Pa. at 595, 189 A.2d at 242; accord, e. g., Weiss Estate, 444 Pa. 126, 279 A.2d 289 (1971); Knupp Will, 428 Pa. 409, 235 A.2d 585 (1967).\nEven if one were to accept the argument of the Opinion in Support of Reversal that these words constitute the \u201cliteral\u201d end of the document, by no stretch of the imagination may they be said to appear at the \u201csequential end\u201d of the paragraphs relating to the will\u2019s \u201clogical and internal sense\u201d or at the \u201clogical end of the language used by decedent in expressing [her] testamentary purpose.\u201d\nThe Superior Court recognized the impermissibility of such a distorted characterization in Dietterich\u2019s Estate, supra, a case involving a similar printed will form and cited as authority by this Court in Pavlinko Will, 394 Pa. 564, 148 A.2d 528 (1959), Brown Estate, supra, and Bryen\u2019s Estate, supra. In Dietterich\u2019s Estate the decedent signed her name beneath the printed words \u201cWill of\u201d in the endorsement section of the document. After a discussion of numerous prior cases dealing with the requirement that a will be signed \u201cat the end thereof,\u201d the court held that \u201c[t]he place where [decedent] signed had no relationship to the nature of the Will or its contents.\u201d 127 Pa.Super. at 323, 193 A. at 161. The Opinion in Support of Reversal seeks to distinguish the Dietterich will from the will of Susanna Proley on the ground that in the former a line was provided for the testator\u2019s signature, whereas the latter \u201chad no hint of a place for testatrix to sign.\u201d In fact, the form used by decedent Susanna Proley contained an obvious area for signing at the bottom of the final interior page immediately beneath the words \u201cIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto subscribed by name and affixed my seal ...\u201d (see reproduction in Opinion in Support of Reversal at 139). In any event, as we have noted, the issue is not where decedent may have thought she should sign. The sole issue under section 2502 of the Wills Act and our cases interpreting that section is whether decedent signed at what objectively appears as the logical or sequential end of her testamentary language. Here as in Dietterich\u2019s Estate, she did not.\nThe frustration of decedent\u2019s apparent testamentary intent by her own failure to observe the proper formalities may seem at first a harsh result, but it is a result which is required by our Legislature and which this Court may not alter. \u201cThe courts must consider that the legislature, having regard to all probable circumstances, has thought it best, and has therefore determined, to run the risk of frustrating the intention sometimes, in preference to the risk of giving effect to or facilitating the formation of spurious wills.\u201d Churchill\u2019s Estate, supra, 260 Pa. at 101, 103 A. at 535. \u201cThe strictness with which this section of the Wills Act must be enforced is a matter of legislative mandate. As we said in Brown Estate, supra, [347 Pa. at 246, 32 A.2d at 23]: \u2018The Wills Act requires signing at the end. The purpose of the Act was to remove all possibility of fraud .... Even if the testamentary intention of this particular testatrix is frustrated, it is much wiser to refrain from weakening the sound and well established mandate of the Legislature. Were we to do so, we might in future cases facilitate fraudulent or unauthorized alterations or additions to wills.\u2019 \u201d Coyne Will, supra, 349 Pa. at 334, 37 A.2d at 510-11 (emphasis in original); accord, Glace Will, supra.\nIn denying the admission of decedent\u2019s will to probate, the auditing judge and the orphans\u2019 court en banc obeyed the clear mandate of the Legislature. This Court can do no less. The unanimous decree of the orphans\u2019 court en banc should be affirmed.\nO\u2019BRIEN, C. J., and LARSEN, J., join in this opinion.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThe sole issue in this case is whether the Will of Susanna H. Proley was signed at the end thereof, as required by 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502, the Decedents, Estates & Fiduciaries Code.\nSusanna H. Proley died on April 14,1977, survived by ten nieces and nephews as her heirs at law. The document in question is dated June 14, 1972. It is a printed form of a will. On the first and second pages, decedent, by her own hand, itemized various gifts of personal property and cash, directing that this property be devised to Florence R. Bye, a niece. Various items of furniture were left to Maurice Fox, decedent\u2019s executor; and to her other nieces and nephews, decedent left the sum of one ($1.00) dollar each. Finally, funeral and burial arrangements were mentioned. At the top of the third page there appears a printed residuary clause followed by a half page of ruled lines, which were left blank. Near the middle of the third page the form provides for the appointment of an executor, and decedent wrote the name of Maurice Fox as executor in spaces provided for that purpose. Immediately following the appointment of an executor, near the bottom of the third page, the form reads as follows, as indicated by the photographic reproduction below:\nThe signature of Susanna H. Proley is written at the middle of the fourth page of the printed form beneath the printed words, \u201cWill of,\u201d which words appear in a vertical position when the form is folded twice, as indicated on the following photographic reproduction:\nThe lower court found that decedent requested that a Mr. & Mrs. Bentley witness her will and directed them where to sign their names. Decedent told the Bentleys that the document was her will, but they did not see her sign the document. After a hearing held on July 20, 1977, the Register of Wills of Philadelphia County admitted Susanna H. Proley\u2019s will to probate, having determined that the will was signed \u201cat the end thereof,\u201d as is required by the statute. One of the disinherited heirs took an appeal from this determination to the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, which reversed the decree of the Register of Wills, and denied admission of the will to probate. The proponent of the will then filed exceptions to the decree of the hearing judge, which were dismissed by the Orphans\u2019 Court Division sitting en Banc by Decree of March 7, 1980. The present appeal followed. We would reverse the decree of Orphans\u2019 Court Division.\nThe lower court reluctantly sustained the appeal below, which challenged the admissibility of the will to probate, because it felt that evidence of intent was not relevant to a consideration of whether the signature on the will meets the statutory requirements, Glace Will, 413 Pa. 91, 196 A.2d 297 (1964), Baldwin Will, 357 Pa. 432, 55 A.2d 263 (1974), Church ill\u2019s Estate, 260 Pa. 94, 103 A. 533 (1918); and because Dietterich\u2019s Estate, 127 Pa.Super. 315, 193 A. 158 (1937), involving an analytically similar problem, held that the signature written on the back of the printed form, was not written at the end of the will as the statute requires. The reluctance of the lower court to sustain the appeal is understandable in light of its findings that the decedent\u2019s intent was clear and that a strict application of legal formalities seems to result in a frustration of decedent\u2019s testamentary intent:\nThe unfortunate result of the court\u2019s ruling will be that those heirs whom the decedent desired to disinherit by leaving $1.00 to each of them shall receive her estate. This would seem to be a completely unfair result in a case such as this where the intent of the decedent is absolutely clear and there is no possibility of a fraud. However, the law is clear and equitable considerations may not be applied.\nIn the instant case, the decedent substantially complied with the requirements of the Wills Act. There is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that this was intended to be her Last Will and Testament. The sole defect is that she signed the document in the wrong place.\nApart from a rather blatant frustration of testatrix\u2019s intent, the case demonstrates as well the inadequacy of the strict compliance rule in that, applying the rule, we find ourselves unable to agree with the judgment of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division, sitting en Banc, that the will was not signed at the end. Where reasonable minds thus disagree on this issue, the rule itself presents obvious difficulties of application. In our opinion, the will was signed at the end thereof for the following reasons.\nThe printed form is ambiguous as to where the testator should sign. While separate lines are provided for the name(s) of executor(s) and for the date of the will, and while a separate area is provided for the signatures of witnesses, no separate line or area appears on the form for the signature of the testatrix, except that special lines are provided on the fourth page, following the words \u201cWill of\u201d. This is where the testatrix signed.\nThe form is printed on one long sheet of paper, roughly 28 inches long, which is folded horizontally once at mid-point, forming a document having four pages. The second page is thus formed, once the long paper is folded at mid-point, on the back of the first page. Reading or writing on the will form, in other words, is like utilizing a stenographer\u2019s notebook having two sheets of paper in it. After writing on the first sheet, one turns it over, continuing on page two at the point that would correspond to the bottom of page one; then on to page three, which begins below the fold near the bottom of page two; then on to page four, which is printed on the back of page three, the top of page four corresponding to the bottom of page three.\nThis somewhat tedious description of the will form is necessary to explain the sense in which the testatrix may be said to have signed her will at the end thereof. First, there is no indication of a place for the testatrix to sign on page three, even though the printed language, located near the bottom of the page, indicates that the testatrix\u2019s signature is \u201csubscribed.\u201d Faced with this situation, the printed indication of a signature subscription coming near the bottom of page three, the testatrix evidently turned to page four, looking for a continuation of the printed format, just as she had earlier turned from page one to page two in order to continue the text of her dispositions, and on page four she found what must have seemed to her as the place for her signature. Certainly, this signature appears at the end of the will in that it is the last item and the only item to appear on page four. This is true, notwithstanding that blank space appears above the signature and that the signature is written at right angles to the page. In In re Estate of Stasis, 452 Pa. 425, at 430, 307 A.2d 241, at 244 (1973), this Court stated that the end of the document which is contemplated by the act is the \u201csequential end-the logical end of the language used by the decedent ... . \u201d and in present case, the testatrix\u2019 signature appears at what would have been, for her, the logical and sequential end.\nFurthermore, Dietterich\u2019s Estate, 127 Pa.Super. 315, 193 A. 158 (1937), which the lower court cited as controlling, is distinguishable in that Dietterich\u2019s printed form contained a clearly marked line on which the testatrix was to sign her name. Instead, she signed on the back of the will, as did Susanna Proley. The Proley will, however, unlike the Dietterich will, had no hint of a place for the testatrix to sign except for the lines provided on the back of the will. We conclude, therefore, that because of important factual differences, the Dietterich case is inapposite; that it was consistent and reasonable, in light of the design of the form, for testatrix to turn to page four in search of a place to sign the will; and that Susanna Proley signed her will, literally at the end.\nNIX and KAUFFMAN, JJ., join in this opinion.\n.
