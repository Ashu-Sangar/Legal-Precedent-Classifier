        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nWillard Hertzog appeals from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County dismissing his amended petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA) and his petition to withdraw his guilty plea \u201cnunc pro tunc.\u201d We conclude that the court denied relief based on an erroneous belief that the sentence imposed on the plea to charges of aggravated assault is lawful. That portion of the order sustaining the sentence on aggravated assault is vacated and the record is remanded with instructions.\nI\nIn August of 1974, criminal complaints were filed against appellant charging him with involvement in the shooting death of one person and the serious injury of three others. Charges in the complaints include one count of murder, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502, three counts of attempted murder, id. and \u00a7 901, and one count of possessing a prohibited offensive weapon (\u00e1 bayonet), \u00a7 908.\nAlso included in the complaints are three counts of felonious aggravated assault, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702(a)(1). Section 2702(a)(1) makes it a felony of the second degree for a person to\n\u201cattemptf ] to cause serious bodily injury to another, or cause[] such injury intentionally, knowingly or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life....\u201d\nFelonious aggravated assault is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to ten years. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(2).\nAppellant was arrested, preliminarily arraigned, and confined to the Northampton County Prison on the previously listed charges. Before any preliminary hearing, appellant was removed from the prison and committed to Farview State Hospital for psychiatric examination and treatment.\nAppellant was returned to the county prison in May of 1975. On May 15, he was afforded a preliminary hearing on the charges, including felonious aggravated assault, and held for court.\nFour days later, a grand jury returned three bills against appellant. Of the charges originally lodged in the criminal complaints, the true bills returned by the grand jury include the single count of murder, the three counts of attempted murder, and the single count of possessing an offensive weapon. The three counts of felonious aggravated assault charged in the complaints were not approved by the grand jury. Indeed, there is no indication that a bill containing the three counts of felonious aggravated assault was ever submitted to the grand jury. Instead, the record reflects that the grand jury approved only three charges that appellant did \u201cintentionally and knowingly cause bodily injury to [a named victim] with a deadly weapon.\u201d This language states a violation of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702(a)(4), misdemeanor aggravated assault, a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of up to five years, \u00a7 1104(1). This offense differs from the second-degree felony offense, \u00a7 2702(a)(1), punishable by imprisonment of up to ten years, for which appellant was not indicted.\nOn September 22, 1975, appellant appeared at formal arraignment with retained counsel. Appellant pled not guilty to the single count of murder. The Commonwealth withdrew the offensive weapon count. As to the remaining charges, appellant did not formally enter a plea. Instead, counsel for appellant requested and was granted leave to consult with appellant concerning his plea.\nIn an on-the-record discussion, counsel advised appellant on the probabilities of jury convictions of the various degrees of murder. Counsel expressed his belief that murder of the third degree was the likely verdict, with a maximum sentence of twenty years. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(1). Counsel then told appellant that:\n\u201c[o]n the aggravated assault and battery charges, of which there are three, each one carries with it five-to-ten years....\u201d\nThus, even though the indictment charged only misdemean- or aggravated assault, punishable by a maximum of five years imprisonment, counsel proceeded on the assumption, and advised appellant, that appellant was charged with and would be sentenced on the higher, felonious aggravated assault. Counsel further advised appellant that there are three attempt to commit murder charges, each punishable by five-to-ten year terms of imprisonment:\n\u201cIf you were acquitted of the homicide and convicted of aggravated assault, the three of them, and the three attempts to commit murder, you would be facing a thirty-to-sixty year possible sentence.\u201d\nCounsel in no respect advised appellant on the probability of merger of the aggravated assault and attempt to commit murder offenses. (See United States v. Herrold, 635 F.2d 213 (3d Cir. 1980).)\nAgainst this background, counsel informed appellant of his discussion with the district attorney and the district attorney\u2019s willingness to recommend that the court accept a plea to murder of the third degree. As to the other charges, counsel informed appellant that the Commonwealth was willing to drop the charges of attempt to commit murder and recommend acceptance of a plea to the aggravated assault counts. On these terms, according to counsel, the Commonwealth would \u201crecommend not five-to-ten years but rather two and a half-to-five years.\u201d This sentencing \u201crecommendation,\u201d however, was no concession at all. It merely represented the maximum permissible sentence consistent with the grand jury\u2019s indictments on misdemeanor aggravated assault.\nFollowing this discussion, the court was informed of the \u201cagreement\u201d in which appellant would plead guilty to one count of murder of the third degree and three counts of aggravated assault, with the district attorney dropping charges on attempted murder and recommending sentence of two and one-half to five years on each count of aggravated assault, \u201cto run consecutive.\u201d After hearing testimony of a psychiatrist on the question of appellant\u2019s intent to kill, as well as the Commonwealth's admission that it would have difficulty establishing murder of the first degree, the court then discussed the plea with appellant. There is nothing to indicate that the court reviewed the bill approved by the grand jury charging only misdemeanor aggravated assault and not the felony offense. Instead, acting on an assumption that the felony counts of aggravated assault were still in the case, the court asked appellant:\n\u201cDo you understand, Mr. Hertzog, that you are staring a minimum of twenty-five years and a maximum of fifty-years, to be served by you in an appropriate institution picked by me?\n\u201cAnd based upon that knowledge, do you agree to plead guilty accordingly?\n\u201cTo the charge of murder in the third degree and to three charges of aggravated assault and battery, carrying with them each a five-to-ten year term.\u201d\nOn the basis of appellant\u2019s affirmative responses to these questions, the court concluded:\n\u201cI am satisfied and I make a finding that the plea is understanding^ and voluntarily tendered and that this defendant knows that if I accept the plea, he may very well walk out of this courtroom with a sentence of not less than twenty-five years nor more than fifty years.\u201d\nOn December 23, 1975, after review of a pre-sentence report, the court sentenced appellant to ten to twenty years imprisonment on the third-degree murder count. The court did not follow the Commonwealth\u2019s recommendation of two and one-half to five years on each count of aggravated assault. Rather, still acting on the assumption that felonious aggravated assault was charged, the court imposed sentences of three to six years on three counts of felonious. aggravated assault. Thus appellant\u2019s sentence totalled a term of imprisonment of nineteen to thirty-eight years, three years in excess of the maximum sentence consistent with the offenses charged by the grand jury but twelve years less than what the court thought was the lawful maximum.\nUpon the conclusion of sentencing, the court advised appellant of his appellate rights but no appeal followed. Appellant eventually filed a pro se petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, \u00a7 1 et seq., formerly 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 et seq. The court appointed new counsel, who in turn filed the present amended PCHA petition as well as the present petition to withdraw the guilty plea.\nIn the petitions prepared by newly-appointed counsel, appellant alleged that he had requested his guilty plea counsel to file an appeal, but that counsel advised he would no longer represent appellant. Appellant also alleged that public defenders, who had been appointed after guilty plea counsel refused to proceed, failed to carry out appellant\u2019s direction to appeal. Thus, appellant alleged, \u201c[a]s a result of the actions of his prior counsel, [he] was denied his right to direct Appeal, or to attempt to Appeal Nunc Pro Tunc.\u201d Appellant further alleged that previous counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance in failing to supply proper advice at the guilty plea stage.\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the PCHA court denied relief. The PCHA court concluded that following sentencing appellant was dissatisfied with the length of sentence imposed. Even though appointed, post-sentencing counsel failed to pursue appellant\u2019s desire to challenge the sentence, the PCHA court denied all relief, including an appeal, based on its view that appellant\u2019s post-sentencing counsel justifiably believed that a challenge to the sentence would lack merit. According to the PCHA court, \u201c[t]here is no evidence that the sentence was in any way illegal.\u201d The court considered no other aspect of the quality of representation provided, deeming all other ineffectiveness claims waived under section 3(d) of the PCHA by appellant\u2019s failure to take a direct appeal. This appeal followed.\nII\nThe PCHA court erred in making appellant\u2019s right to an appeal turn on whether appointed counsel correctly appraised its merit. It is for the accused, not appointed counsel, to decide whether an appeal should be taken. As the American Bar Association Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice (Criminal Appeals) provides,\n\u201c[cjounsel has the professional duty to give to the client fully and forcefully an opinion concerning the case and its probable outcome. Counsel\u2019s role, however, is to advise. The decision is made by the client.\u201d\nStd. 21-3.2 Commentary (2d ed. 1978). In accord is Standard 21-2.2(b): \u201cWhile counsel should do what is needed to inform and advise defendant, the decision whether to appeal, like the decision whether to plead guilty, must be the defendant\u2019s own choice.\u201d See Pa.Const. art. V, \u00a7 9; Commonwealth v. Cathey, 477 Pa. 446, 384 A.2d 589 (1978); Commonwealth v. Jones, 447 Pa. 228, 286 A.2d 892 (1971); Commonwealth ex rel. Robinson v. Myers, 427 Pa. 104, 233 A.2d 220 (1967); Comment, Criminal Waiver: The Requirement of Personal Participation, Competence and Legitimate State Interest, 54 Calif.L.Rev. 1262 (1966). Here, therefore, we treat the present proceeding as a timely appeal challenging the judgment of sentence imposed. See Commonwealth v. Alston, 473 Pa. 40, 373 A.2d 741 (1977).\nThe record is clear that the PCHA court erred in concluding that the sentence imposed was within permissible statutory limits. The sentencing court imposed consecutive sentences of three to six years imprisonment on each count of \u201caggravated assault.\u201d The grand jury, however, had indicted appellant only on the misdemeanor grade of aggravated assault, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702(a)(4), punishable at most by imprisonment not to exceed five years per count. Thus, \u201c[i]n essence, appellant was sentenced on an offense construed in the courtroom and not upon a bill returned by the Grand Jury.\u201d Commonwealth v. Bruce, 230 Pa.Super. 507, 510, 326 A.2d 628, 629 (1974). Appellant is entitled to relief from the invalid sentence imposed on the aggravated assault charges.\nIll\nOur conclusion that the sentence imposed is unlawful necessitates a remand for imposition of a proper sentence on aggravated assault. We leave undisturbed the sentence imposed on the homicide conviction.\nIn addition, on remand the court must consider appellant\u2019s remaining claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. For here, contrary to the conclusion of the PCHA court, there has been no waiver of these claims. Section 3(d) of the PCHA requires a party seeking PCHA relief to prove \u201c[t]hat the error resulting in his conviction and sentence has not been . .. waived.\u201d For PCHA purposes, however, an issue is \u201cwaived\u201d if:\n\u201c(1) The petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to raise it and it could have been raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated under this act; and\n(2) The petitioner is unable to prove the existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise the issue.\u201d\nIn Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1975), we held that, where trial counsel represents a PCHA petitioner on appeal, the issue of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is not waived under the PCHA if not raised on direct appeal, \u201c[I]t is unrealistic to expect trial counsel on direct appeal to argue his own ineffectiveness.... \u201d 460 Pa. at 100, 331 A.2d at 438. And, in harmony with Dancer, we have held that no waiver of a claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness occurs if the PCHA petitioner, represented by trial counsel, pursues no appeal. Commonwealth v. Jones, 477 Pa. 266, 383 A.2d 926 (1978); Commonwealth v. Mabie, 467 Pa. 464, 359 A.2d 369 (1976). \u201c[I]t is similarly unrealistic to expect counsel to file motions and/or an appeal challenging his own ineffectiveness.\u201d Id., 467 Pa. at 469, 359 A.2d at 371.\nThus where, as here, there has been no realistic opportunity for appellant to raise the issue of previous counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the issue is not waived. Appellant is entitled to an opportunity to be heard on his remaining claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. For appellant to obtain relief he must establish that the ineffectiveness claimed and proven induced his plea of guilty. See Commonwealth v. Jones, supra; Commonwealth v. Marsh, 440 Pa. 590, 271 A.2d 481 (1970).\nAccordingly, the order is affirmed insofar as it sustains the judgment of sentence imposed on the homicide conviction. The order sustaining judgment of sentence on the aggravated assault convictions is vacated and the record is remanded for imposition of proper sentencing. On remand, the court shall make appropriate inquiry into appellant\u2019s remaining, undecided claims of ineffective assistance.\nOrder affirmed in part and vacated in part and record remanded.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins in this opinion and files a concurring opinion.\nKAUFFMAN, J., joins in this opinion and the concurring opinion of FLAHERTY, J.",

Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 99, 331 A.2d 435, 438 (1975), we stated:\nOur Post Conviction Hearing Act and the principles of judgment finality mandate that claims of ineffectiveness of counsel may be raised in PCHA proceedings 1) where petitioner is represented on appeal by his trial counsel, for it is unrealistic to expect trial counsel on direct appeal to argue his own ineffectiveness, 2) where the petitioner is represented on appeal by a new counsel, but the grounds upon which the claim of ineffective assistance are based do not appear in the trial record, 3) where the petitioner is able to prove the existence of other \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d justifying his failure to raise the issue, Post Conviction Hearing Act, \u00a7 4(b)(2), 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(b)(2) (Supp.1974) or 4) where the petitioner rebuts the presumption of \u201cknowing and understanding failure,\u201d Post Conviction Hearing Act \u00a7 4(c), 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(c) (Supp.1974).\nAs this summary of the Post Conviction Hearing Act indicates, when a P.C.H.A. petitioner raises the ineffectiveness of counsel for the first time in his P.C.H.A. petition, not having raised ineffectiveness on direct appeal, his claim is waived unless he can establish (1) \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d or (2) the absence of \u201cknowing and understanding failure\u201d to take an appeal.\nPetitioner must be permitted to raise his claims of ineffectiveness at P.C.H.A. in this case inasmuch as the record establishes both the existence of extraordinary circumstances and the absence of knowing and understanding failure to take an appeal. Petitioner was sentenced on December 23, 1975. On January 14, 1976 he wrote to his guilty-plea counsel as follows:\nI am writing at this time to ask you to inform the court that I do wish to appeal my sentence .... I realize that these are only technicalities, but wish to follow up on them and any other such details to present on my appeal.\nAn appeal was never filed. The failure to appeal, therefore, was not \u201cknowing and understanding.\u201d Further, the failure of counsel to appeal in these circumstances constitutes \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d\nKAUFFMAN, J., joins in this concurring opinion.",
