        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn June of 1975, following a wedding reception at the Otter Club in Van Voorhis, Washington County, a group of youths confronted guests outside the club. The confrontation led to shooting which resulted in the death of one person, Joseph Bankovich, and the serious injury of another, David Sink. Appellant Leonard Harris, one of the youths, was identified as the person firing the shots and charged with murder and aggravated assault. At a jury trial, appellant unsuccessfully claimed self-defense and was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and simple assault.\nOn this appeal from the judgment of sentence imposed (an aggregate prison term of six to twelve years), appellant makes four claims in support of a new trial: (1) that the jury selection system employed in Washington County at the time of trial unconstitutionally caused underrepresentation of blacks and persons under twenty-one; (2) that, during impeachment of the surviving, testifying victim, he should have been permitted to introduce into evidence a medical record showing that, approximately two years before the incident, the victim had been hospitalized for treatment of \u201caggressive tendencies;\u201d (3) that testimony of the deceased\u2019s victim\u2019s widow should not have been permitted; and (4) that a state trooper \u201cshowed off his gun\u201d to the jury. None of these claims warrants reversal.\nI. Underrepresentation\nFor appellant to make out a prima facie violation of the \u201cfair-cross-section\u201d requirement of the sixth and fourteenth amendments, he must show:\n\u201c(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018distinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process.\u201d\nDuren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357, 363, 99 S.Ct. 664, 668, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979). See Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975). Appellant has in no respect established (2), that the relationship between representation of the alleged groups in venires and the number of such persons in the community is unfair and unreasonable.\nThe sole evidence introduced by appellant is the testimony of Harvey Stuart, a Washington County jury commissioner. Stuart, another jury commissioner, and a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County were responsible for selecting prospective jurors. See generally Commonwealth v. Martin, 465 Pa. 134, 150-52, 348 A.2d 391, 399-400 (1975) (plurality opinion). Stuart stated that he selected approximately 400 of the 2000 names placed in the jury wheel, the other two accounting for equal shares of the remainder.\nStuart, however, testified only as to the means of selection he employed. Moreover, he gave no specific figures relating either to the number of group members in either venires or the community. Instead, on direct, he testified only:\n\u201cA [By Stuart]. The 400 I got, I would say everyone of them were over 18.\nQ [By counsel for appellant]. How many of them were under 21?\nA I don\u2019t recall any.\nQ Of the 400 that you submitted Mr. Stuart, how many were black?\nA I couldn\u2019t tell you.\nQ Well, roughly. Were there any?\nA There were some. In that period, I couldn\u2019t tell you how many there were. I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\nThis evidence is insufficient to establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement. Compare e. g., Duren v. Missouri, supra (accused established prima facie case by showing jury venires contained 15% women while relevant community was \u201cslightly over half\u201d women); Commonwealth v. Bastarache, - Mass.App. -, 409 N.E.2d 796 (1980) (accused showed disparity of \u201capproximately 20%\u201d between 18-34 year olds in relevant community and those in jury pool). Thus appellant\u2019s first contention must be rejected.\nII. Medical report\nThe medical report relating to surviving victim Sink is a discharge summary prepared in July of 1973 by an employee of Mayview State Hospital. Appellant sought to introduce the report without presenting testimony of an examining physician with knowledge of its contents.\nIn his brief, appellant concedes that \u201cmedical evidence contained in the records and offered as expert testimony is inadmissible where the doctor is unavailable for cross-examination. Commonwealth v. DiGiacomo, 463 Pa. 449, 455-56, 345 A.2d 605, 608 (1975).\u201d Appellant, however, claims that he did not seek to introduce the report to show any medical opinion. According to appellant, \u201cthese records were offered to show the facts of hospitalization of Mr. Sink and of the treatment he received.\u201d\nAppellant has failed to demonstrate how Sink\u2019s hospitalization and treatment, two years before the incident, in any respect affected Sink\u2019s testimony. We have held that \u201c[m]ere mental derangement on some matter not connected with the subject of the litigation and not affecting the testimonial ability of the witness is not even to be considered by the'jury in determining the credibility of the witness.\u201d Commonwealth v. Kosh, 305 Pa. 146, 156, 157 A. 479, 482 (1931). See generally Commonwealth v. Ware, 459 Pa. 334, 329 A.2d 258 (1974). In any event, appellant\u2019s present characterization of his \u201cpurpose\u201d at trial is contradicted by the record. In sustaining the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to appellant\u2019s introduction of the report, the trial court specifically informed appellant that it would give him \u201ca full opportunity to recall this witness after you [(appellant)] have satisfied the Court that you are prepared to support the contents of this report by way of a live witness who has firsthand knowledge of its contents.\u201d The following colloquy ensued:\n\u201cMR. RETOS [(counsel for appellant)]: We would point out we are introducing this as a medical record. It is verified and notarized and sealed by the hospital, signed originally by the doctor who did conduct this report.\nTHE COURT: It would still be hearsay.\nMR. RETOS: Your Honor, the prognosis in this report is guarded and there is a statement made on this discharge summary that Mr. Sink\u2019s behavior may be affected without his awareness.\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m not saying you won\u2019t be able to use this matter. I have laid out the ground rules for the conditions under which you can use it.\nMR. RETOS: Exception please.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\u201d\nThus it is clear that appellant\u2019s purpose was to put before the jury the very opinion evidence contained in the report which he now concedes is inadmissible. Indeed, appellant\u2019s effort to introduce the medical report allegedly revealing \u201caggressive tendencies\u201d was never renewed. Appellant\u2019s effort appears to have been an attempt to present his claim of self-defense during the course of the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation of its case. \u201cWe have repeatedly held that the order of presentation of evidence is a matter for the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d Commonwealth v. Koch, 446 Pa. 469, 478, 288 A.2d 791, 795 (1972). The order of the trial court denying introduction of the medical report may not be disturbed.\nIII. Spouse\u2019s testimony\nAppellant\u2019s third contention, that the trial court erred in permitting the testimony of the deceased victim\u2019s spouse, Karen Bankovich, is premised on the assertion that her testimony \u201cserve[d] no purpose.\u201d See generally Commonwealth v. Fell, 453 Pa. 531, 309 A.2d 417 (1973). According to appellant, \u201c[t]he real question is whether given the fact the evidence should not have been admitted, did it prejudice [appellant\u2019s] right to a fair trial.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth offered Mrs. Bankovich to testify as to two issues. First, she explained that, during the wedding reception, her husband had removed his dress shirt. The shirt had become soiled with blood as a result of her husband\u2019s contact with a bloodied youth involved in a fight during the course of the reception, before the fatal confrontation following it. (The first fight in which the youth was involved allegedly precipitated the fatal confrontation.) Mrs. Bankovich, who left the reception before her husband, took the shirt home so she could promptly clean it, leaving her husband wearing an undershirt. Mrs. Bankovich also testified as to the fight during the course of the reception. She stated that her husband told her he was not involved in that fight and that there were no other incidents during the reception.\nUnlike appellant, we are of the view that the trial court committed no abuse of discretion in determining that the proffered testimony of Mrs. Bankovich was probative. The Commonwealth\u2019s medical examiner had placed the distance the fatal shot travelled at more than two to three feet. He did so based on the absence of powder burns on the deceased victim\u2019s undershirt. On cross-examination, appellant sought to advance his claim of self-defense. He suggested that, if the victim were wearing an outer garment, the absence of powder burns would be attributable not to the distance that the fatal shot travelled, but to the presence of an outer garment absorbing burn marks. Thus, Mrs. Bankovich\u2019s testimony regarding her husband\u2019s removal of his dress shirt was designed to negate the suggestion that appellant sought to create. As to Mrs. Bankovich\u2019s testimony on her husband\u2019s lack of involvement in the sole altercation during the wedding reception, appellant had previously sought to show by way of cross-examination of Sink as well as another Commonwealth witness that victim Bankovich had been involved in the earlier altercation. Like her testimony concerning her husband\u2019s shirt, Mrs. Bankovich\u2019s testimony regarding her husband\u2019s lack of involvement was aimed at negating any suggestion created by appellant\u2019s cross-examination. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination admitting Mrs. Bankovich\u2019s testimony.\nIV. Gun display\nAppellant\u2019s final claim is that reversible error occurred when, on Commonwealth rebuttal, State Trooper Ambrose \u201cshowed off\u201d his gun to the jury. That factual contention is unsupported by the record. The actual weapon used in the shooting was never found. The Commonwealth recalled Ambrose to the stand to describe the operation and firing of the type of handgun used. Before any demonstration involving a firearm in Ambrose\u2019s possession took place, the court directed Ambrose to return the firearm to his holster. At no time during Ambrose\u2019s discussion on gun-firing did he remove the firearm from the holster or otherwise display it to the jury. Thus, the record indicates that the officer\u2019s firearm was, at most, only momentarily displayed.\nThe trial court, acting well within its discretion, see generally Commonwealth v. Ford, 451 Pa. 81, 85, 301 A.2d 856, 858 (1973), made certain that the officer\u2019s firearm was not improperly used as a part of the officer\u2019s \u2014 witness\u2019s appearance. On this record we are unpersuaded that the brief display of the firearm requires the grant of a new trial.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\n. Jury selection procedure is now codified at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501 et seq. (Act No. 1980-78, Purdon\u2019s Pa. Legislative Service No. 2 of 1980). Under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501(1), \u201c[a]ll persons entitled to a jury trial in a civil action or criminal proceeding shall have the right to jurors selected at random from a representative cross section of the eligible population of the county.\u201d This act took effect June 26, 1980, well after appellant\u2019s trial, conducted in September of 1975.\n. Nor can appellant prevail on an equal protection theory of discrimination. Such a theory would require similar proof of underrepresentation, see e. g., Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 494, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1280, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977), proof wholly lacking here.\n. In connection with his medical record claim, appellant suggests that the court should have inquired into the \u201cfitness\u201d of Sink to testify. Apparently appellant would have the court make a sua sponte inquiry into Sink\u2019s competency on the basis of Sink\u2019s \u201caggressive tendencies,\u201d for at no previous time did appellant raise any question concerning Sink\u2019s competency as a witness. In accordance with Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974), and other cases requiring that the parties to a controversy properly preserve issues, see e. g., Wiegand v. Wiegand, 461 Pa. 482, 337 A.2d 256 (1975) and Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975), we are of the view that on this record appellant was obliged at trial to put the competency of Sink in issue and, appellant not having done so, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.",
