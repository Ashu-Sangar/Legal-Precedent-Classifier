        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nLike School District of Pittsburgh v. Commonwealth, Department of Education, 492 Pa. 140, 422 A.2d 1054 (1980), these cross-appeals present the issue whether, under section 2502(d) of the Public School Code of 1949, the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Education must compute the state basic instructional subsidy of a school district experiencing a teachers\u2019 strike and providing less than the state-mandated number of days of instruction as though no strike had occurred and the full number of days had been provided.\nA teachers\u2019 strike during the 1976-77 school year caused appellee Pennsbury School District to provide only 156 days of instruction. Taking into account this reduced number of days of instruction, the Department determined that appellee district is entitled to an instructional subsidy of $3,970,-312.20. Appellee district protested, claiming as did appellee district in the Pittsburgh case that the Department should not diminish the state basic instructional subsidy because of reduced instructional days. In appellee district\u2019s view, it is entitled to a subsidy of $4,375,452.90, or $405,140.70 more than the Department determined. After a departmental hearing, the Secretary of Education rejected appellee district\u2019s calculation. Appellee district then filed a petition for review (in the nature of mandamus) in the Commonwealth Court. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Commonwealth Court ruled the Department erred in taking strike-related reduced days of instruction into account, but also ruled that because subsidy funds had already been distributed the Department cannot pay appellee district the disputed sum. Thus it ordered the Department to calculate only \u201cfuture final subsidy payments\u201d without regard to reduced instructional days. These cross-appeals, from the order of the Commonwealth Court, 47 Pa.Cmwlth. 428, 408 A.2d 211 at No. 708 C.D. 1978, followed.\nAs in the Pittsburgh case, here we hold that the Legislature requires the Department to take into account that appellee district has not provided the full, statutorily-mandated number of days of instruction. Our reasons for so holding include the \u201cclear implication\u201d of several sections of the Code. See \u00a7 2523, 24 P.S. \u00a7 25-2523 (Supp.1979); Act of June 1, 1977, P.L. 4, \u00a7 1501.1, formerly 24 P.S. \u00a7 15-1501.1; Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 121, \u00a7 1501.2, formerly 24 P.S. \u00a7 15-1501.2; Act of May 11, 1979, P.L. 26, \u00a7 1501.4. See 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1924. We are also persuaded that the Legislature did not intend the unreasonable result of granting a district affected by a strike and furnishing less than 180 days of instruction the same amount of subsidy as if it furnished 180 instructional days. Nor is it the Legislature\u2019s judgment that such a district providing less than 180 days should receive the same subsidy that districts providing 180 instructional days would receive. See 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1922(1). Here as in Pittsburgh \u201c[w]e are satisfied that the Legislature did not intend to favor a strike-affected district with a full subsidy where it provides fewer days of instruction than the number required by state law.\u201d\nThe sole contention appellee district presents here which has not been presented in Pittsburgh is that the method by which the Department seeks to take reductions in the number of days of instruction into account is invalid for want of compliance with the Commonwealth Documents Law, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 769, \u00a7 101 et seq., 45 P.S. \u00a7 1101 et seq. (Supp.1979). See also 45 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 501 et seq. The Commonwealth Documents Law conditions the validity of administrative regulations on the issuing agency\u2019s compliance with prescribed publication requirements. See \u00a7 208, 45 P.S. \u00a7 1208. See generally Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Norristown Area School District, 473 Pa. 334, 374 A.2d 671 (1977). Here, however, the Department\u2019s means of allocating state subsidy funds does not turn upon an administrative regulation. As we noted in the Pittsburgh case,\n\u201cthe Department admits that its power to \u2018establish rules of procedure\u2019 conferred under section 2501(3) in no respect gives it authority to fashion any averaging device for purposes of strike-related days of instruction. See generally B. Schwartz, Administrative Law \u00a7 58 (1976). Rather, as the Department agrees, the averaging device to be employed is determined exclusively by the Legislature\u2019s statutory reimbursement scheme. See generally Rose Tree Media School District v. Department of Public Instruction, 431 Pa. 233, 244 A.2d 754 (1968).\u201d\n492 Pa. at 147-148 n.5, 422 A.2d at 1058 n.5. Thus this contention, like the contentions considered in the Pittsburgh case, must be rejected.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court at No. 708 C.D. 1978 vacated and judgment entered in favor of the Department. Order at No. 285 C.D. 1979 affirmed.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which KAUFFMAN, J., joins.\n. Pennsbury School District also appeals from the order of the Commonwealth Court at No. 285 C.D. 1979 dismissing a separate appeal Pennsbury filed from the Secretary\u2019s determination. The Commonwealth Court dismissed the appeal because Pennsbury did not pursue its appeal. In view of our resolution on the merits, we need not consider or disturb the Commonwealth Court\u2019s disposition.\n. We note that the version of section 2502(d) of the Code which governs this case defines subsidy factors in a manner somewhat different from the manner in which the factors applicable in the Pittsburgh case are defined. Our reasoning in the Pittsburgh case, however, is not affected by the somewhat differing definitions and is equally applicable here.",
