        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nThe Court being equally divided, the decree is affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nROBERTS, J., files an opinion in support of reversal in which NIX and KAUFFMAN, JJ., join.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL\nROBERTS, Justice.\nI would reverse the decree which requires the County of Allegheny rather than the estate of Anna Engel to pay counsel fees incurred not only in the defense of Engel against County-instituted equitable proceedings but also in guardianship proceedings initiated on her behalf.\nOn March 29,1977, the County filed a complaint in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County seeking to compel Engel to vacate what the County determined to be an uninhabitable and unsafe residence. The court of common pleas granted the County\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction and fixed a hearing date of April 4. At the scheduled hearing, however, Engel refused to retain an attorney. Acting on the belief that Engel was incompetent, the court appointed Thomas Purcell, Esq., to defend Engel in connection with the County\u2019s equitable proceedings.\nAfter Purcell was appointed, he not only appeared on Engel\u2019s behalf to defend against the County\u2019s efforts to remove her but also later instituted proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court Division to declare Engel incompetent and appoint a guardian of her estate. The orphans\u2019 court granted the requested relief, naming the Keystone Bank as guardian. Purcell then submitted a bill of over $4400 to the County for all his services, including institution of the incompetency proceedings. The County refused payment, advising Purcell to obtain compensation from Engel\u2019s estate. Purcell nonetheless petitioned the orphans\u2019 court to direct the County to make the requested payment. Despite its continuing supervision of Engel\u2019s estate and Engel\u2019s guardian, the orphans\u2019 court approved Purcell\u2019s petition and directed the County, rather than the estate, to pay Purcell the full sum of $4400. At the end of its opinion, however, the court acknowledged the validity of the County\u2019s position and suggested that the County should institute a separate proceeding against the estate.\nAs the orphans\u2019 court ultimately recognized, the trial court\u2019s appointment of counsel should not be charged to the County. No challenge is made to the reasonableness of Purcell\u2019s fees. Neither in our Rules authorizing appointments of guardians ad litem, see Pa.R.Civ.Pro. 2051 et seq., nor anywhere else is there authority for imposing such costs upon the County where an estate is fully able to pay for services rendered. Indeed, recently in Damario Estate, 488 Pa. 434, 412 A.2d 842 (1980), we have held in a similar setting that a county may obtain reimbursement for defense services from the estate of a defendant adjudged not guilty by reason of insanity. Purcell was performing services throughout only for the benefit of Engel. Because he rendered his services to Engel, her estate should pay for them. Purcell\u2019s claim, therefore, lies in no respect against the County but only against Engel\u2019s estate.\nThere is no basis for requiring these fees to be paid from County funds instead of estate assets. In a proceeding in the orphans\u2019 court involving a claim for attorney fees for services rendered to an incompetent\u2019s estate, the court may either allow all or part of the claim or deny it. But the court is without authority to direct that the fees be paid by a third party, here the County of Allegheny. The orphans\u2019 court\u2019s authority extends only to the supervision of the incompetent\u2019s estate. See 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 711 (10).\nNIX and KAUFFMAN, JJ., join in this opinion in support of reversal.",
