        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nKAUFFMAN, Justice.\nThis appeal is from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia denying appellant, Henry R. Gaddy, relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (\u201cP.C.H.A.\u201d). For the reasons stated hereinafter, we affirm.\nIn 1973, appellant was convicted by a jury of first degree murder, aggravated robbery, and conspiracy. After denial of post-verdict motions by the court en banc, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge and 10-20 years imprisonment on the aggravated robbery charge, sentences to run concurrently. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the judgments of sentence. Commonwealth v. Gaddy, 468 Pa. 303, 362 A.2d 217 (1976). In January 1977, appellant filed a pro se P.C.H.A. petition. Counsel was appointed, an amended petition was filed, and after an evidentiary hearing, relief was denied. This appeal followed.\nIn his P.C.H.A. petition, appellant averred that he is entitled to a new trial (1) because he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel and (2) because Leroy Barnes, a codefendant who testified against appellant at trial, allegedly testified falsely and has now recanted his allegedly false testimony. In this appeal, appellant has abandoned his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and proceeds solely on the claim that the P.C.H.A. court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial in light of Barnes\u2019 sworn statement that he had perjured himself at appellant\u2019s trial.\nAt appellant\u2019s trial, Barnes testified:\nthat in late December, 1971, he and the appellant were first approached by one Nathaniel Odom with the idea of robbing Martin Dobkin\u2019s store, the Green Front Market. Barnes stated that while he himself expressed some reluctance to go along, [appellant] immediately agreed to the proposal. Nothing came of the plan, however, until January 7,1972, when [appellant] and Odom finally persuaded Barnes to accompany them on their misadventure. That day they met at Odom\u2019s house; Odom produced a loaded .32 caliber revolver which he indicated to the others he was taking with him on the robbery.\nAt about 5:00 p. m., Odom, Barnes and [appellant] left the house and went to a bar across the street from Martin Dobkin\u2019s market. Through a window in the bar door they were able to observe the comings and goings of persons to and from the store. At approximately 6:00 p. m., satisfied that no shoppers remained in the store, the three men moved across the street and entered the store. Inside the storeroom, [appellant] and Barnes placed themselves near the checkout counter, where Dobkin was standing, while Odom moved throughout the store removing various items from the shelves. Odom then came to the counter with his \u201cpurchases\u201d and began fumbling in his pockets as though looking for money. Instead of money, however, he withdrew the revolver from his pocket and fired two shots at Dobkin, who fell to the floor clutching his stomach. Odom then leaned over the counter and fired two more shots. Dobkin subsequently died of a gunshot wound to the head.\nAfter the shooting, [appellant] and Odom went behind the counter and rummaged through the victim\u2019s pockets and the cash register. Taking what money was there, Odom, Barnes and [appellant] fled from the store .... (footnotes omitted).\nCommonwealth v. Gaddy, 468 Pa. 303, 308-9, 362 A.2d 217, 219-20.\nAt the P.C.H.A. hearing, however, Barnes testified that he had absolutely no knowledge of the Dobkin murder (N.T.27) and th\u00e1t the whole of his testimony at appellant\u2019s trial was untrue. (N.T.29, 32-74, 83). The P.C.H.A. court found Barnes\u2019 recantation testimony to be \u201cutterly false\u201d and, in fact, held him on charges of perjury and false swearing: \u201cWe are ... convinced that this recantation was motivated not by conscience or a desire to see that truth and justice be done, but rather for ulterior motives on the part of the witness.\u201d (Slip op. at 4).\nIt is well settled that:\nRecanting testimony is exceedingly unreliable, and it is the duty of the court to deny a new trial where it is not satisfied that such testimony is true ... There is no less reliable form of proof, especially when it involves an admission of perjury ... (citations omitted).\nCommonwealth v. Coleman, 438 Pa. 373, 377, 264 A.2d 649, 651 (1970); Commonwealth v. Mosteller, 446 Pa. 83, 284 A.2d 786 (1971). Thus, \u201can appellate court may not interfere with the denial or granting of a new trial where the sole ground is the alleged recantation of state witnesses unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d Coleman, 438 Pa. at 377, 264 A.2d at 651; Commonwealth v. Nelson, 484 Pa. 11, 398 A.2d 636 (1979); Commonwealth v. Mosteller, supra; Commonwealth v. Scull, 200 Pa.Super. 122, 186 A.2d 854 (1963) (allocatur refused).\nThe question of Barnes\u2019 credibility was clearly a matter for the P.C.H.A. court, since it had ample opportunity to observe his manner and demeanor during a full evidentiary hearing. Commonwealth v. Nelson, supra; Commonwealth v. Coleman, supra. The record more than adequately supports the finding that Barnes was totally lacking in credibility at the P.C.H.A. hearing, and we will not disturb that finding on appeal.\nAccordingly, the order of the P.C.H.A. court denying appellant relief is affirmed.\n. Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 et seq.\n. Jurisdiction is exercised pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722(1).\n. Sentence was suspended on the conspiracy charge.\n. Barnes was the Commonwealth\u2019s principal witness.",
