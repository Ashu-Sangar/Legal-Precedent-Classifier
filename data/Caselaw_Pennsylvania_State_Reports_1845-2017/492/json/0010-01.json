        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nThis is an appeal from a final decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, sustaining a claim of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the amount of $6,340.34 against the estate of now-deceased Kenneth Pierce for care and maintenance of Pierce from May 1953 to July 1960 at Torrence State Hospital. Appellant, administratrix of decedent\u2019s estate, contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s claim should have been disallowed on the ground that the portion of the estate the Commonwealth claims constitutes veterans\u2019 benefits exempt from attachment under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101(a). This matter is controlled by Chojnacki Estate, 397 Pa. 596, 156 A.2d 812 (1959), cert. denied, 363 U.S. 826, 80 S.Ct. 1595, 4 L.Ed.2d 1522 (1960), as well as Grcich Estate, -Pa.-(J.319 of 1980, filed this day), where we have held that veterans\u2019 benefits are for the care and maintenance of the recipient and are not designed to provide a windfall inheritance to heirs of a deceased. The decree of the orphans\u2019 court here fully comports with Chojnacki and Grcich. Thus we affirm.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nFLAHERTY, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.",
