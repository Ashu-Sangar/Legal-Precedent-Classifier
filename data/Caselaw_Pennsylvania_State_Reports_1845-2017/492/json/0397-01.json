        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Chief Justice.\nThis appeal is from an order of the Superior Court, affirming an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington county, which granted a petition by appellees, Frank L. Black, Jr., Inc. and United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, to open a default judgment entered by appellants, Albert A. Kennedy, Sr. and Ann G. Kennedy, trading and doing business as Bennington Company.\nBlack was the general contractor for the construction of sewage pumping stations in Carroll Township, Washington County. In August, 1975, Black subcontracted with Kennedy for certain excavation work required for the project. Following a dispute between Kennedy and Black, Kennedy abandoned the job site in May, 1976. On April 28, 1977, Kennedy filed an action in assumpsit against Black, Fidelity, the bonding company for Black and the Carroll Township Authority.\nOn May 16, 1977, counsel for Kennedy contacted the attorney for Black and Fidelity and granted the latter a thirty-day extension to file an answer or other responsive pleading. When no answer was filed, Kennedy\u2019s attorney wrote to counsel for Black and Fidelity, requesting action. On August 2, 1977, the attorney for Black and Fidelity notified opposing counsel that he had not yet had a conference with his clients, but was planning such a meeting in the near future.\nOn October 4, 1977, Kennedy\u2019s attorney telephoned appellees\u2019 counsel and asked when responsive pleadings would be filed. Appellees\u2019 counsel said he had talked with his clients but was somewhat unsure about their position. On October 26, 1977, Kennedy\u2019s counsel, having not heard from appellees, again wrote and requested that some action be taken. Nothing was done and on November 22, 1977, Kennedy\u2019s attorney wrote to appellees\u2019 counsel and gave the following ultimatum:\n\u201cIf you do not take any action on the above case within twenty days of the date of this letter, I will be forced to enter a default judgment.\u201d\nOn December 2, 1977, appellees\u2019 attorney telephoned Kennedy\u2019s attorney and requested an extension until January 1, 1978. The request was granted.\nOn January 18, 1978, Kennedy\u2019s counsel again telephoned to inquire about the case. Appellees\u2019 attorney informed opposing counsel that he would send a letter outlining a counterclaim as a prelude to possible settlement discussions. On February 17, 1978, appellees\u2019 attorney mailed the letter, in which he mentioned that appellees intended to file a counterclaim of at least $331,100 if Kennedy did not drop its lawsuit. Kennedy\u2019s counsel, by letter dated March 1, 1978, informed appellees\u2019 attorney that if appellees would pay debts that Kennedy had incurred for supplies used on the job, and if appellees would forego their counterclaim, Kennedy would drop his suit.\nKennedy\u2019s attorney tried unsuccessfully to contact appellees\u2019 attorney in March, 1978. After talking to appellees\u2019 attorney on April 18,1978, Kennedy\u2019s counsel sent a letter to appellees\u2019 attorney informing him that if an answer was not filed by May 9, 1978, a default judgment would be taken.\nOn May 8, 1978, appellees\u2019 attorney requested an extension for \u201c10 days or so.\u201d The request was granted. On May 23, 1978, Kennedy\u2019s counsel took a default judgment for $80,141.33 because no answer had been filed as of that date.\nOn May 31, 1978, appellees filed a petition to open the judgment with a proposed answer and counterclaim attached. The affidavit, however, was not signed. On July 20, 1978, the answer and counterclaim was filed, with the attached affidavit signed and dated June 5, 1978.\nA hearing on the petition to open the judgment was held on June 26, 1978. On July 6, 1978, the court ordered the judgment opened and permitted appellees to file their answer. Kennedy appealed to the Superior court and that court, sitting as a panel of three, affirmed the trial court with one judge dissenting. Kennedy v. Frank L. Black, Jr., Inc., 271 Pa.Super. 454, 413 A.2d 1104 (1979). We granted Kennedy\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and this appeal followed.\nAppellant argues the trial court abused its discretion in opening the instant default judgment. In McCoy v. Public Acceptance Corp., 451 Pa. 495, 305 A.2d 698 (1973), we reiterated the well-established principle that a petition to open a default judgment is within the sound discretion of the trial court; further, a reviewing court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision on the matter unless there was an error of law or a manifest abuse of discretion. Before a court may open a default judgment, however, the moving party must show that the petition to open was filed promptly, that a meritorious defense existed, and that the failure to act could be reasonably explained. Ruczynski v. Jesray Construction Corp., 457 Pa. 510, 326 A.2d 326 (1974). As we believe the appellees\u2019 excuses for its failure to respond are not sufficient as a matter of law, we must reverse the Superior Court\u2019s order which affirmed the trial court\u2019s order opening the instant default judgment.\nAt the hearing on the petition to open the judgment, appellees advanced the following three excuses for not filing responsive pleadings: (1) appellees\u2019 attorney was confused as to the length of the final extension; (2) Kennedy\u2019s counsel failed to follow a local Washington County custom and did not telephone opposing counsel immediately before entering the default judgment; and (3) appellees\u2019 attorney believed that Kennedy\u2019s counsel would never take a default judgment.\nThe trial court based its decision on the premise that the delay was excusable because the parties were attempting to negotiate a settlement. The court also stated that Kennedy\u2019s attorney failed to notify opposing counsel immediately before taking the default judgment. The majority of the Superior Court panel agreed with the trial court on the discussion concerning settlement negotiations and further held that appellees\u2019 counsel may very well have misunderstood the length of the final extension. For the reasons set forth hereafter, we do not believe that the reasons either advanced by appellees or accepted by the trial and Superior Courts constitute reasonable excuses for appellees\u2019 failure to file an answer which justifies the opening of the judgment.\nThe. Rules of Civil Procedure clearly provide:\n\u201cEvery pleading subsequent to the complaint shall be filed within twenty (20) days after service of the preceding pleading... . Pa.R.C.P. 1026.\u201d\nFurther:\n\u201cThe prothonotary, on praecipe of the plaintiff, shall \u2022 enter judgment against the defendant for failure to file within the required time an answer to a complaint. .. . Pa.R.C.P. 1037(b).\u201d\nYet, appellees failed to file an answer for thirteen months after the original complaint was filed.\nWhile settlements are clearly favored and default judgments are not, we do not believe the attempts in this case to negotiate a settlement can justify appellees\u2019 protracted delay in the filing of an answer. When a party chooses to wait thirteen months to file an answer in the face of repeated requests by opposing counsel to do so, a default judgment may properly be entered.\nWe likewise find no merit to the argument that appellees\u2019 counsel had misunderstood the length of the final extension of time, and further had believed Kennedy would never take a default judgment. While it is true that \u201cerrors of counsel .. . which indicate an oversight rather than a deliberate decision not to defend, have been held to constitute sufficient legal justification to open a default judgment,\u201d Johnson v. Yellow Cab Co., 226 Pa.Super. 270, 272, 307 A.2d 423, 424 (1973), appellees can find no refuge in the above-quoted standard. In McDonald v. Allen, 416 Pa. 397, 400, 206 A.2d 395, 396 (1965), we stated:\n\u201c.. . The Superior Court well stated this kind of a situation in Derbyshire Bros. v. McManamy, 101 Pa. Super. 514: \u2018Whatever return indulgence he had earned by his extension of time to defendants\u2019 counsel had long since been exhausted and the debt was by this time all the other way. In the face of the peremptory demands of September 17th and October 2d, he had no right to rely on the defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s further indulgence and forebearance. As was well said by Judge Henderson, speaking for this court in Logan\u2019s Est., 74 Pa.Super. 82, 86, \u201cThe exercise of generosity does not create a binding obligation for its continuance.\u201d There comes a time when in the interests of justice and his client\u2019s cause further forbearance may properly be refused by an attorney if satisfied that his courtesy is being taken advantage of for purposes of procrastination and delay, and we agree with counsel for appellants that that time had come in this case. No valid excuse for such long continued delay in the face of repeated requests and demands for action was shown and we are of opinion that the judgment should not have been opened. See Hale v. Uhl, 293 Pa. 454 [143 A. 115].\u2019 \u201d\nAs McDonald is on all fours with the instant case, we believe it is dispositive of the arguments advanced by appellees. As Judge Hester stated in his dissenting opinion in the Superior Court:\n\u201cThe record in the instant matter discloses numerous occasions where appellants\u2019 counsel requested a responsive pleading and/or action on the part of appellees\u2019 counsel. In view of the clear and concise letter of April 19, 1978, and the prior thirteen month delay, [sic] I fail to see how appellees\u2019 counsel could misunderstand, or expect a blanket further extension of time. The letter and the prior correspondence of the parties indicates appellants\u2019 desire to proceed in a diligent fashion on April 19, 1978 was entirely reasonable. Rather than supporting appellees\u2019 contention that the failure to file the responsive pleading was due to a misunderstanding or mistake of counsel, the record supports the conclusion that appellees\u2019 counsel flagrantly abused the numerous extensions courteously granted by opposing counsel.\u201d Kennedy v. Frank L. Black, Jr., Inc., supra, 271 Pa.Super. at 465\u2014466, 413 A.2d at 1110.\nFinally, appellees argue that the judgment was properly opened because of the failure of Kennedy\u2019s attorney to follow the Washington County custom of notifying opposing counsel immediately prior to taking the default judgment. Suffice it to say that no such requirement exists in either our rules or case law. In Brooks v. Surman Dental Lab., Inc., 262 Pa.Super. 369, 374, 396 A.2d 799, 802 (1979), the court stated:\n\u201cAlthough the Rules of Civil Procedure do not contain a notice requirement, we have repeatedly chastized counsel for failure to afford that courtesy.\u201d\nInstantly, appellees were informed a number of times about Kennedy\u2019s intent to take a default judgment if an answer was not filed. Appellees thus have no grounds to complain.\nOrder of Superior Court affirming the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County is reversed and the judgment entered by default is reinstated.\n. The Carroll Township Authority is not a party to the instant appeal.\n. But see Pa.R.C.P. 237.1, effective February 1-, 1980.",
