        "text": "OPINION\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, 455 Pa. 525, 317 A.2d 205 (1974), the prosecutor in closing argument engaged in a rhetorical attack upon the defense, calling to the jury\u2019s attention the defendant\u2019s failure to call as reputation witnesses members of the clergy or neighbors. In speaking for a unanimous Court holding that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper and unwarranted, Justice (later Chief Justice) Eagen expressly admonished:\n\u201cThere is no burden on a criminal defendant to establish his previous good reputation. If he fails to introduce testimony in this regard, no adverse influence may be drawn therefrom, nor may such an adverse inference be drawn merely because only a limited number of witnesses were called to testify as to the good reputation of the accused. And, by the same token, no such adverse inference may be drawn merely because the accused failed to call some particular individual as a character witness. The assistant district attorney asked the jury to do just that. His argument was much more than just an attack on the quality of the character testimony offered by Lipscomb \u2014 as the Commonwealth contends.\u201d\n455 Pa. at 530-31, 317 A.2d at 208.\nDuring closing argument in this case, the prosecutor asked the jury:\n\u201cWhere are the school teachers to say that this gentleman is a good boy or a good man? If you were on trial, or a member of your family were on trial, how many people could you get to come in here?\u201d\nThis closing argument is improper under Lipscomb and, accordingly, a new trial must be granted.\nAppellant Elson Brown is charged with criminal homicide, including felony-murder, as well as robbery and conspiracy in connection with the death of Joseph Cohen, operator of a variety store in Philadelphia. According to the Commonwealth, on October 24, 1976, shortly after 9:00 a. m., appellant and three companions entered the victim\u2019s store pursuant to a plan, hung the victim from shelving in a back room, stabbed him to death, and fled with cash.\nThree days after the incident, Philadelphia police arrested appellant and took him into custody. Police obtained an inculpatory statement from appellant the same day. Appellant, seventeen years old at the time police obtained the statement, moved before trial to suppress the statement on the ground that police failed to comply with this Court\u2019s \u201cinterested adult\u201d rule. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. McCutchen, 463 Pa. 90, 343 A.2d 669, cert. denied, 424 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 1147, 47 L.Ed.2d 341 (1975). After a hearing, appellant\u2019s motion was denied. The case proceeded to trial before a jury.\nAt trial, in seeking to establish appellant\u2019s involvement, the Commonwealth relied heavily upon the inculpatory statement which police had obtained from appellant. Appellant defended by challenging the voluntariness of the statement. Additionally, appellant presented a reputation witness, Mary Drew, who stated that appellant had an \u201cexcellent\u201d reputation among those persons she knew in appellant\u2019s neighborhood.\nThe prosecutor did not cross-examine Drew in any respect, or otherwise attempt to refute this reputation evidence. Instead, he called the testimony of Drew into question in closing argument. First the prosecutor sought to comment upon the quality of the testimony:\n\u201cOh, there was some other evidence in the case. I want to tell you something. You people live in the neighborhood in Philadelphia. The defendant has a good character, right? You heard that witness testify about good character. Does he have a good character? Well, he goes to school, he knows people, the family knows people. Obviously that lady is a friend of the mother and father who testified.\u201d\nImmediately thereafter, building upon his statements that appellant \u201cgoes to school\u201d and \u201cknows people,\u201d and that \u201cthe family knows people,\u201d the prosecutor asked the jury the questions now challenged. The court denied, appellant\u2019s immediate request for a mistrial.\nThe jury found appellant guilty of murder of the third degree, robbery, and conspiracy. Written post-verdict motions, including the present contention that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct, were denied. The court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder conviction, with concurrent sentences of ten to twenty years on the robbery conviction and five to ten years on the conspiracy conviction. These appeals followed.\nHere, as in Lipscomb, in rhetorical terms the prosecutor made clear to the jury that appellant had failed to call a particular type of character witness, a school teacher. The prosecutor then asked the jury, again in rhetorical terms, to consider how many different character witnesses they would have called if they or members of their families were in appellant\u2019s position. By this rhetorical tactic, the prosecutor asked the jury to add as many individuals as the jury could imagine to the prosecutor\u2019s list of character witnesses not called. The prosecutor did much more than merely comment upon the quality of the reputation evidence offered. The prosecutor impermissibly asked the jury to draw the same adverse inference as in Lipscomb from appellant\u2019s failure to call reputation witnesses. As in Lipscomb, this rhetorical attack constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.\nThe Commonwealth cites Commonwealth v. Van Cliff, 483 Pa. 576, 397 A.2d 1173, cert. denied, 441 U.S. 964, 99 S.Ct. 2412, 60 L.Ed.2d 1070 (1979), as an instance where \u201c[t]his Court recently rejected a claim of prosecutorial misconduct based upon a summation that was more strongly worded than the challenged comment here.\u201d To the contrary, it is the closing argument in this case which is more strongly, and impermissibly, worded. In Van Cliff, the prosecutor commented upon the quality of the defendant\u2019s character witnesses actually called by telling the jury that \u201call of these people who came before you are all relatives of the defendant.\u201d The prosecutor added that \u201c[tjhere weren\u2019t any members of the community who were not relatives who came forward and testified as to his quote \u2018good character.\u2019 \u201d Nowhere, however, did the prosecutor engage in the pointed rhetoric found here and in Lipscomb. Indeed, this Court in Van Cliff took great care to point out that the challenged remarks \u201cfall on the borderline of permissibility.\u201d 483 Pa. at 583, 397 A.2d at 1177. Here, by asking the jury to consider the absence of a particular type of character witness, as well as the number of persons the jurors would call if they or members of their families were in appellant\u2019s position, the prosecutor crossed \u201cthe borderline of permissibility\u201d established in Van Cliff.\nJudgments of sentence vacated and new trial ordered.\nNIX, J., concurs in the result.\nKAUFFMAN, J., files a dissenting opinion, in which LARSEN, J., joins.\n. Appellant contends that his motion to suppress the statement should have been granted. In view of our disposition, granting appellant a new trial, we do not address this issue.\nFor the same reason we do not address appellant\u2019s other contentions, including (1) that the trial court erred in admitting a tape recording of appellant\u2019s statement, (2) that a mistrial should have been granted when a Commonwealth witness testified that other persons charged had implicated appellant, and (3) that prejudicial and inflammatory evidence, including a photograph of the victim and a knife allegedly used in the killing, was improperly introduced.\n. The Commonwealth suggests that any harm caused by the prosecutor\u2019s tactics was cured by the court\u2019s charge to the jury. At no time, however, did the court specifically address the matter of closing argument. This contention is without merit.",

Here, defendant introduced only one character witness, a family friend. By noting the witness\u2019s bias and by adverting to the weakness of the evidence presented in light of the testimony not offered, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument properly challenged the adequacy of defendant\u2019s attempt to establish his good reputation.
