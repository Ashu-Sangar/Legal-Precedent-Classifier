      <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>This controversy arose in 1976, during the term of a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Authority. For more than forty years prior to this dispute, the Authority and its predecessor, Pittsburgh Railways Company, had engaged in the practice of providing supplemental assistance to employees who were absent from work due to injuries sustained in work-related accidents. This assistance, known as welfare payments, was paid only to those employees who were not contributorily negligent, and was intended to make up the difference between an employee’s workmen’s compensation benefits and his or her normal pay for a forty-hour work week. The determination of contributory negligence was made initially by the injured employee’s supervisor, and was then subject to review by the Authority’s Personnel Department. In the present case, the Union, by letter of March 12, 1976, demanded arbitration in the cases of five employees who were denied welfare payments by the Authority.</p>

The Authority, seeking to vacate the arbitration award, filed a Petition for Review of Award of Arbitrator in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. Upon cross motions for summary judgment, the Court of Common Pleas granted the Union’s motion and denied the motion filed by the Authority. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed and directed that summary judgment be entered in favor of the Authority. <em>Port Authority of Allegheny County v.

We, like the Commonwealth Court, may not substitute our interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement for that of the arbitrators so long as the arbitrators’ interpretation is reasonable. We note, however, that the broader scope of authority assumed by the arbitration panel is, in fact, preferable to the more restrictive scheme devised by the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth Court held that “the Authority retained the exclusive power to make the determination of whether or not to grant benefits,” and limited the role of the arbitration panel to the review of those welfare payment cases in which the Authority had denied benefits to an employee in the absence of any evidence of contributory negligence. <a href="/citations/?q=411%20A.2d%20272" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="411 A.2d 272">411 A.2d at 275</a>. Only in those cases in which the Authority acknowledged that there was no contributory negligence, yet still refused to grant welfare payments, would an arbitration panel have any power to act. The only function then performed by the panel would be an administrative one; the panel would simply order the Authority to make payments that it was already bound to make in accordance with past practice. This scheme completely ignores the true purposes of grievance arbitration: factfinding and dispute resolution.</p>
