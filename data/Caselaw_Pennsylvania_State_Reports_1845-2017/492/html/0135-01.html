    <p id="b265-7" data-blocks='[["BL_265.8",265,[172,1187,1155,1179]],["BL_266.1",266,[266,331,1157,94]]]'>A teachers’ strike during the 1976-77 school year caused appellee Pennsbury School District to provide only 156 days of instruction. Taking into account this reduced number of days of instruction, the Department determined that appellee district is entitled to an instructional subsidy of $3,970,-312.20. Appellee district protested, claiming as did appellee district in the <em>Pittsburgh </em>case that the Department should not diminish the state basic instructional subsidy because of reduced instructional days. In appellee district’s view, it is entitled to a subsidy of $4,375,452.90, or $405,140.70 more than the Department determined. After a departmental hearing, the Secretary of Education rejected appellee district’s calculation. Appellee district then filed a petition for review (in the nature of mandamus) in the Commonwealth Court. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Commonwealth Court ruled the Department erred in taking strike-related reduced days of instruction into account, but also ruled that because subsidy funds had already been distributed the Department cannot pay appellee district the disputed sum. Thus it ordered the Department to calculate only “future final subsidy payments” without regard to reduced instructional days.

    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[263,450,1160,1109]]]'>As in the <em>Pittsburgh </em>case, here we hold that the Legislature requires the Department to take into account that appellee district has not provided the full, statutorily-mandated number of days of instruction. Our reasons for so holding include the “clear implication” of several sections of the Code. See § 2523, 24 P.S. § 25-2523 (Supp.1979); Act of June 1, 1977, P.L. 4, § 1501.1, formerly 24 P.S. § 15-1501.1; Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 121, § 1501.2, formerly 24 P.S. § 15-1501.2; Act of May 11, 1979, P.L. 26, § 1501.4. See 1 Pa. C.S. § 1924. We are also persuaded that the Legislature did not intend the unreasonable result of granting a district affected by a strike and furnishing less than 180 days of instruction the same amount of subsidy as if it furnished 180 instructional days. Nor is it the Legislature’s judgment that such a district providing less than 180 days should receive the same subsidy that districts providing 180 instructional days would receive. See 1 Pa. C.S. § 1922(1). Here as in <em>Pittsburgh </em>“[w]e are satisfied that the Legislature did not intend to favor a strike-affected district with a full subsidy where it provides fewer days of instruction than the number required by state law.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

(Supp.1979). See also 45 Pa. C.S. § 501 et seq. The Commonwealth Documents Law conditions the validity of administrative regulations on the issuing agency’s compliance with prescribed publication requirements. See § 208, 45 P.S. § 1208. See generally <em>Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Norristown Area School District, </em><a href="/pa/473/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="473 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="1730232" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0334-01">473 Pa. 334</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="473 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="1730232" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0334-01">374 A.2d 671</a> (1977).

See generally B. Schwartz, Administrative Law § 58 (1976). Rather, as the Department agrees, the averaging device to be employed is determined exclusively by the Legislature’s statutory reimbursement scheme. See generally <em>Rose Tree Media School District v. Department of Public Instruction, </em><a href="/pa/431/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="431 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1917406" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0233-01">431 Pa. 233</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20754" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="244 A.2d 754">244 A.2d 754</a> (1968).”</blockquote>
