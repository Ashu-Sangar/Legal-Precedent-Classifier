The subject of the proceeding was a 1976 Ford truck van which appellee Guy Walter Wagner had used for the unlawful transportation of marijuana and cocaine. The only defense appellee asserted was that §§ 28 and 29 — the forfeiture provisions — of the Act were “violative of [his] rights to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution.” After holding that the forfeiture provisions of the Act were unconstitutional because they failed to mandate notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to forfeiture, the Court of Common Pleas denied the Commonwealth’s <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>petition. <a href="/pa-d-c3d/6/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Pa.
