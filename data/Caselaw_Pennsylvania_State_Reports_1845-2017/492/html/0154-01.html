Wagner, deceased, was a truck driver for Shreiner Trucking Company. The decedent was killed on January 26,1977, when a company-owned tractor-trailer he was driving ran off the road and overturned. At the time of the accident, decedent did not own a car and thus, had no insurance of his own. Because the accident occurred during the course of decedent’s employment, decedent’s family has been and continues to receive benefits pursuant to the Workmen’s Compensation Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Workmen’s Compensation Act does not affect an employee’s cause of action against a <em>third party </em>tortfeasor, except for prohibiting the third party from recovering contribution from the employer for damages which the third party is required to pay to the employee-victim (77 P.S. § 481). No-fault applies to an action between the employee and the third party. <em>Turner v.

Any fringe benefits, such as life insurance or disability insurance, are voluntarily bargained for and have an independent contractual vitality. The employer or his insurance carrier for these fringe benefits would be, in our view, precluded from asserting the Section 303 immunity”.

Super. 43" data-case-ids="101563" data-case-paths="/pa-super/256/0043-01">supra,</a> </em>did, however, present a matter which requires additional scrutiny. When an employer is self-insured, as in <em>Turner, </em>the no-fault claim must be prosecuted against the very party whose liability is expressly limited to Workmen’s Compensation by Section 303. It would be anomalous to allow a cause of action under no-fault to stand or fall on the arbitrary basis of the carrier’s identity. This problem was addressed in both <em>Mathis, supra, </em>and <em>Ryder, supra. </em>The Michigan Court reasoned:</p>
      <blockquote id="b305-10" data-blocks='[["BL_305.10",305,[272,1925,1084,349]]]'>An employee may have ties with an employer other than the employer-employee relationship. They may be landlord and tenant; trustee and beneficiary; vendor and vendee and so on. We look to the laws governing the particular relationship involved to determine rights and obligations of the parties. The fact that the parties are also employer-employee does not automatically trigger the operation of the exclusive remedy provision of the WDCA. The exclusive remedy provision applies only to employers where conditions of liability under the WDCA pertain.</blockquote>

      <p id="b306-15" data-blocks='[["BL_306.2",306,[255,2151,1124,188]]]'>The New York Court summarily stated the same conclusion. <a href="/citations/?q=44%20N.Y.2d%20364" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="44 N.Y.2d 364">44 N.Y.2d at 372</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=405%20N.Y.S.2d%20666" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="405 N.Y.S.2d 666">405 N.Y.S.2d at 670</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=376%20N.E.2d%201311" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="376 N.E.2d 1311">376 N.E.2d at 1316</a>. The short answer, then, is that there can be no escape from a duty to pay on a no-fault policy by the fortuitous coincidence of being both employer and insurer.</p>
