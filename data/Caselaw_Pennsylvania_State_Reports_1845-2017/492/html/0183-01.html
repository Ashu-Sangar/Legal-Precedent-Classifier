The court of common pleas determined that a Danish custody decree in favor of appellee, Marianne Hoemje, should be modified and custody awarded instead to appellant, Thomas Zaubi. The Superior Court, however, unanimously determined that, in modifying the Danish decree, the court of common pleas had incorrectly applied the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, P.L. 29, §§ 1 et seq., 11 P.S. §§ 2301 et seq., effective July 1, 1977 (hereinafter “Act”). We agree with the Superior Court that the Act compels Pennsylvania courts not only to recognize valid custody decrees from foreign nations but also to decline to accept jurisdiction to modify custody decrees in the absence <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>of a showing, based on evidence not previously considered, of conditions in the custodial household that are physically or emotionally harmful to the children.

In essence, however, appellee Marianne Hoejme, a Danish citizen, was granted custody of her children in Denmark after numerous hearings and an appeal by her husband, appellant Thomas Zaubi, to the High Court of Denmark. At all of these proceedings, appellant was present and represented by counsel. On June 16, 1977, appellee received a final divorce decree. At this time appellant was able to appeal his case once more to the High Court of Denmark, and a hearing was scheduled for November 17, 1977. In August 1977, while the children were in his care during a visitation period, and while his custody appeal was pending, appellant fled with the children to the United States.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

At no time during this period were they enrolled in school. When appellee finally located the children in May 1978, she filed a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Court of Common Pleas of Greene County to obtain enforcement of the Danish custody decree. Service was effected on the Zaubi family in Nemacolin, but appellant again fled with the children to avoid the court’s jurisdiction, returning only after the court had issued a contempt citation against his parents.</p>

Such a conclusion defies not only the stated purposes of the Act but common sense as well. It is inconceivable that in replacing the vague language of the Uniform Act with a more definite and rigorous standard, our Legislature intended to make it easier for a parent who abducts his children to obtain the modification of a custody decree than for a parent who otherwise violates a valid decree. Thus, the courts below were correct in their determination that a showing of “physically or emotionally harmful” conditions in the custodial household was a necessary prerequisite to the exercise by the Greene County court of its jurisdiction to modify the Danish decree.</p>

Instead he evaded the jurisdiction of the Danish court, flouted its decree, and relitigated in a “friendlier” forum the very issues which the Danish court had decided against him.

The parents had been married on May 9, 1968. The couple lived in Denver, Colorado; Cannonsburg, Pennsylvania; Denmark; Nemacolin, Pennsylvania; and Cleveland, Ohio. However, with the aid of an aunt employed in the Danish Embassy in Washington, D. C., Marianne covertly had her children, who were American citizens, included on her passport, and returned with the children to Denmark around April 3,1975. Unable to locate his family’s whereabouts, Thomas, Sr. tried to forestall the mother’s seize and run child snatching by seeking a temporary restraining order against the then Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, so that an American passport might not be issued to the mother. Ironically, the father failed on April 11,1975 because (1) there was no existing court order of custody, (2) there was no showing of irreparable injury, (3) such an order was not in the public interest and (4) the children were probably already in Denmark. <em>Zaubi v. Kissinger, </em>United States District Court, D. C. (Civil Action 75-424, April 11, 1975). The father followed his family to Denmark the next month. Three days before the father’s case was heard in Washington, D. C., the mother had won the race to the courthouse door by obtaining an ex parte temporary custody order dated April 8, 1975 from Copenhagen County. Her seize and run became seize, run and successfully sue. She took up temporary residence with her parents, obtained a nursing position.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">2</a> On November 27,1975 the separation was officially ordered by the Danish court and the mother given custody of the two children. On April 13, 1976, the father’s appeal from the custody award (because of the limitations placed upon his visitations with the children by the mother), was denied by the High Court of Justice for the Eastern District of Denmark.</p>

Under the format of section 9(b), two separate and distinct situations are provided for, which should not be intermingled. The first sentence of section 9(b) uses the language “unless required in the interest of the child.... ” This test not only embodies the physically and emotionally harmful test of the second sentence, but is more encompassing in order for the Act to comply with what has been deemed probably the requirement of every State in the Union; i. e., courts are required to put the child’s interest first. <em>Ford v.
