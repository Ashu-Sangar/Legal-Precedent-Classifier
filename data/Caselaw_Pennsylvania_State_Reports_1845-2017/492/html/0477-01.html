Because neither the character of the writing itself nor the extrinsic evidence supports the decree of the orphans’ court, the decree should be vacated and the case remanded for an evidentiary hearing.

Her choice of language was based on her perception of “how you would send something to a lawyer.” She then gave the writing to testatrix, who received it without comment and without signing it in Brian’s presence.

The majority observes that testatrix “prepared” the writing “while she was ill, only one month before her death and just eight days after she had been discharged from the hospital.” Majority opinion at 1293. From this “evidence,” the majority apparently infers that the writing was “prepared” in contemplation of death. What the majority fails to note, however, is that testatrix had been hospitalized for a foot ailment, serious and painful but hardly terminal, and that she died of pneumonia. Moreover, after her discharge from the hospital, testatrix constantly spoke of her desire to <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>return from Harrisburg, where she was living with appellee, to her home in Pittsburgh.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> Indeed, a week before her death she informed her granddaughter Sharon Duey, appellee’s daughter, that “[s]he had things she wanted to do [with her will] when she got back to Pittsburgh.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a>

The majority views testatrix’s failure to effect delivery of the writing to her daughter as evidence that testatrix intended the writing to function as a will rather than as an <em>inter vivos </em>gift of all her possessions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a> Here, however, as distinguished from the cases cited by the majority, appellants do not argue that the writing represents a failed <em>inter vivos </em>conveyance.

Here, testatrix’s “regularly executed” 1974 will had been carefully preserved by her attorney and was admitted to probate soon after her death. Although she could easily have done so, testatrix made no attempt to instruct her attorney, either by telephone or letter, with regard to the alteration or destruction of that will. Testatrix was not, like the decedent in <em>Kauffman's Will, </em><a href="/pa/365/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="365 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1225577" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0555-01">365 Pa. 555</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20414" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="76 A.2d 414">76 A.2d 414</a> (1950), making a hurried attempt to dispose of property which would otherwise pass by intestacy. Rather, she was contemplating the alteration of a carefully considered and previously executed scheme of distribution. In the circumstances, there is clearly no compelling need to give testamentary effect to this brief writing of dubious testamentary intent, especially where the evidence suggests that testatrix may well have changed her mind. Indeed, to hold on the basis of this record, as the majority does, that an informal writing to which testatrix never referred as her will supersedes her formally executed and probated 1974 will is manifest error.</p>
    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[269,1391,1153,659]]]'>Nonetheless, the proper remedy for this error is not for this Court to find, on this record, that testatrix’s probated 1974 will is her final expression of testamentary intent. The erroneous holding of the orphans’ court that the informal writing is testamentary on its face has thus far denied appellee, the proponent of the disputed document, the opportunity to prove that testatrix intended the later writing to serve as her last will and testament. Therefore, the case should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing to permit the orphans’ court to consider what it said it “might have considered,” as well as any other evidence which may shed light upon testatrix’s true intentions.</p>
