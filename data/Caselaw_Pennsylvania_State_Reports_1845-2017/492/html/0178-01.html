    <p class="author" id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[285,368,348,42]]]'>O’BRIEN, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.6",308,[242,431,1156,198]]]'>This is an appeal from a decree entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County, Orphans’ Court division, awarding certain claims against the estate of Donald Smith.</p>
    <p id="b308-6" data-blocks='[["BL_308.7",308,[241,658,1156,907]]]'>Decedent, Donald Smith, died on November 26, 1973, testate. The will was timely offered for probate and letters testamentary granted thereafter to Mellon Bank, N.A., successor to Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, executor named in the will. Claims were subsequently filed against the estate by Victor P. Smith, Ralph L. Smith and Albert Smith, brothers of decedent and appellees herein. Appellees’ claims alleged, essentially, that certain transactions had been consummated during testator’s lifetime among testator, appellees, and others, the effect of the transactions being as follows: that certain realty ostensibly the property of testator at his death was in fact jointly owned, either as partners or as tenants in common, by testator and various of the claimants; and that certain monies, consideration for or fruits of said transactions, not paid by testator during his lifetime, were owing to claimants by the estate.</p>
    <p id="b308-7" data-blocks='[["BL_308.8",308,[241,1585,1155,528]]]'>Responsive pleadings were filed by the estate and by heirs of the estate, and the cause came on for hearing on August 25,1976. Subsequent to a request by the Orphans’ Court for suggested findings of fact and conclusions of law made to all parties, the court, on July 11, 1978, entered a decree awarding the claims. Exceptions were filed by the estate and certain heirs of the estate, and were argued. On January 24, 1979, the Orphans’ Court entered a final decree dismissing the exceptions and awarding the claims. Hence this appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

We find therein no violation of the Dead Man’s Act, Act of May 23, 1887,. P.L. 158, § 5(e), 28 P.S. § 322. (Substantially re-enacted as 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5930.)</p>
    <p id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.7",310,[261,977,1155,492]]]'>Similarly, we find no merit in appellants’ claim that certain of the claimants’ witnesses testified in violation of the parol evidence rule. Lacking any reference by appellants to the allegedly offensive testimony, our review demonstrates that such parol evidence relative to written instruments as was admitted was for the limited purpose to applying a description to realty conveyed. Such testimony is admissable. <em>Suchan v.
