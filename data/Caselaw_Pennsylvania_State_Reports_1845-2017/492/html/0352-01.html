The executors and their counsel should <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>certainly be compensated for the ordinary and normal work which they have done, and the responsibility assumed, which in an estate of this size, is considerable. Probate, advertising, tax returns, and accounting are only some of the matters which have to date been handled by the executors and their attorneys. The fees and compensation claimed are in amounts which would be fair and reasonable had no extraordinary problems arisen in the estate.’ We therefore reject appellants’ contention that these fees were improper.”</blockquote>

They do not argue that $44,000 is an unreasonable total fee for the work performed. Rather, alleging that $25,000 is the usual fee for services of counsel on behalf of similar estates, they contend that, absent a showing by appellees to the contrary, the excess must be presumed to represent compensation for services on behalf of the executors individually and thus should not have been paid by the estate.</p>

McClatchy would be “on the order of twenty to twenty-five thousand dollars.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On cross-examination, appellants’ witness admitted that he was unfamiliar with many of the myriad complexities in the administration of the McClatchy estate and that his opinion was based only on a reading of the three accounts prepared by the executors and two of the several opinions rendered over the years in the collection of controversies surrounding this estate. Appellants then concluded their presentation with the follow<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>ing statement: “It is our position that, having produced testimony as to what would be a reasonable fee in the circumstances, that if there are extraordinary services performed, it is the burden of the accountants [appellees] to produce testimony of that.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

During that course of time this Court has first-hand knowledge of the many conferences conducted by the Court preparatory to the trials conducted by this Court, the memorandum opinions written by this Court and, on one occasion, affirmed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. To say the least, this is an estate in which extraordinary services were performed by counsel in defense of this estate. At the outset, forty-three objections were filed to the administration of this estate, ten of which were heard by the Court. The other thirty-three were withdrawn as a result of many conferences with counsel for the contending parties. It would serve no purpose to detail in full all of the problems confronted by the executors and the defense of the estate by counsel for the executors. In broad outline some of the children and grandchildren of this decedent were unhappy and disappointed by the way in which this decedent elected to dispose of his interests in corporations and their inability to accept the decedent’s decisions in an estate which at one time grossed approximately $8,000,000.
