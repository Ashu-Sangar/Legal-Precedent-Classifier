Even before the third criteria of section 108(n) was liberalized under the 1972 amendments — from an occupational disease “not common to the general population” to a disease “the incidence” of which “is substantially greater” in the particular “industry or occupation than in the general population” — this Court ruled in <em>Dunn v. Merck &amp; Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/463/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="463 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1707953" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0441-01">463 Pa. 441</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="463 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1707953" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0441-01">345 A.2d 601</a> (1975) that pulmonary emphysema could be an occupational disease within section 108(n) if the claimant could demonstrate the disease was peculiar to his occupation by its “cause and characteristics of its manifestations.” Thus, appellant properly asserted the vacua in the original findings of the Referee, which would justify an ultimate finding that the emphysema was not causally connected to the employment under the provisions of section 108(n). The Board correctly responded by remanding the matter and directing the Referee to determine whether the criteria under section 108(n) had been met.</p>
    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.6",506,[239,2193,1155,151]],["BL_507.1",507,[196,298,1150,1381]]]'>The appellee-employer insists that Finding No. 25 represented the Referee’s conclusion that there was no causal connection between the employment and the pulmonary <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>emphysema and that further clarification was unnecessary. This position clearly cannot withstand scrutiny. First, the appellant’s objection to the Referee’s decision was timely filed, thus it was properly before the Board for consideration and appropriate disposition. <em>Riley Stoker Corp. v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>9 Pa.Cmwlth. 533, <a href="/citations/?q=308%20A.2d%20205" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="308 A.2d 205">308 A.2d 205</a> (1973).

As stated, the absence of evidence of pneumoconiosis did not conclusively establish that appellant was not entitled to compensation for the disability resulting from pulmonary emphysema. Finding No. 25 acknowledged the disability and recognized that it resulted from the disease. The original findings did not reflect that the Referee considered the criteria established under section 108(n) but rather his reference to the “pneumocotic (sic) process” in Finding No. 25 suggested strongly that the Referee determined appellant’s ineligibility solely on the basis of the absence of pneumoconiosis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a> In any event, the initial findings of fact did not clearly set forth the basis for a rejection of the claim under section 108(n).

This claim of error flows from appellee’s basic premise that the initial decision reflected an acceptance by the Referee, in the first instance, of the testimony of Dr. Shively and a rejection of Dr. Kalla’s opinion as to the causal relationship between the employment and the disease. The Commonwealth Court accepted this argument and ruled, in the alternative, “the referee erred in making different findings in his second decision on the same evidence he had before him when he made his first decision.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">7</a> Since we reject the conclusion that the Referee’s reference in Finding No. 25 to the absence of a “pneumocotic (sic) process” evidences a clear acceptance of Dr. Shively’s views, we cannot accept the contradiction that this contention must rest upon.</p>
