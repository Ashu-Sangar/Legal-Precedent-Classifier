In its petition, filed November 19, 1979, Canonsburg General sought immediate judicial review of HSA’s determinations that Canonsburg General had not properly completed its application for approval. Canonsburg General reiterated the position taken in its October 5 letter to the Secretary that its May response to HSA “provided the HSA with the requested information, answering every question raised in the HSA’s letter of April 30, 1979 in a complete manner.” According to Canonsburg General, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20100.106" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="42 C.F.R. §§ 100.106">42 C.F.R. § 100.106</a>(a)(3) and 100.106(a)(4) establish that, as of late August (when Kidder Peabody was to begin its analysis) Canonsburg General had a clear legal right to certification that its project conformed to federal standards for financial assistance.</p>
