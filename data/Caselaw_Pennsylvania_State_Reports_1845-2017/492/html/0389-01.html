First, she explained that, during the wedding <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>reception, her husband had removed his dress shirt. The shirt had become soiled with blood as a result of her husband’s contact with a bloodied youth involved in a fight during the course of the reception, before the fatal confrontation following it. (The first fight in which the youth was involved allegedly precipitated the fatal confrontation.) Mrs. Bankovich, who left the reception before her husband, took the shirt home so she could promptly clean it, leaving her husband wearing an undershirt. Mrs. Bankovich also testified as to the fight during the course of the reception. She stated that her husband told her he was not involved in that fight and that there were no other incidents during the reception.</p>

The Commonwealth’s medical examiner had placed the distance the fatal shot travelled at more than two to three feet. He did so based on the absence of powder burns on the deceased victim’s undershirt. On cross-examination, appellant sought to advance his claim of self-defense. He suggested that, if the victim were wearing an outer garment, the absence of powder burns would be attributable not to the distance that the fatal shot travelled, but to the presence of an outer garment absorbing burn marks. Thus, Mrs. Bankovich’s testimony regarding her husband’s removal of his dress shirt was designed to negate the suggestion that appellant sought to create. As to Mrs. Bankovich’s testimony on her husband’s lack of involvement in the sole altercation during the wedding reception, appellant had previously sought to show by way of cross-examination of Sink as well as another Commonwealth witness that victim Bankovich had been involved in the earlier altercation. Like her testimony concerning her husband’s shirt, Mrs. Bankovich’s testimony regarding her husband’s lack of involvement was aimed at negating any suggestion created by appellant’s cross-examination.

The Commonwealth recalled Ambrose to the stand to describe the operation and firing of the type of handgun used. Before any demonstration involving a firearm in Ambrose’s possession took place, the court directed Ambrose to return the firearm to his holster. At no time during Ambrose’s discussion on gun-firing did he remove the firearm from the holster or otherwise display it to the jury.

In connection with his medical record claim, appellant suggests that the court should have inquired into the “fitness” of Sink to testify. Apparently appellant would have the court make a sua sponte inquiry into Sink’s competency on the basis of Sink’s “aggressive tendencies,” for at no previous time did appellant raise any question concerning Sink’s competency as a witness. In accordance with <em>Commonwealth v. Clair, </em><a href="/pa/458/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="458 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="479736" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0418-01">458 Pa. 418</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20272" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="326 A.2d 272">326 A.2d 272</a> (1974), and other cases requiring that the parties to a controversy properly preserve issues, see e. g., <em>Wiegand v. Wiegand, </em><a href="/pa/461/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="461 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="483688" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0482-01">461 Pa. 482</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="461 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="483688" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0482-01">337 A.2d 256</a> (1975) and <em>Commonwealth v.
