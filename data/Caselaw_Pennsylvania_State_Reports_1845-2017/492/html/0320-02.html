And, by the same token, no such adverse inference may be drawn merely because the accused failed to call some particular individual as a character witness. The assistant district attorney asked the jury to do just that. His argument was much more than just an attack on the quality of the character testimony offered by Lipscomb — as the Commonwealth contends.”</blockquote>

Appellant defended by challenging the voluntariness of the statement. Additionally, appellant presented a reputation witness, Mary Drew, who stated that appellant had an “excellent” reputation among those persons she knew in appellant’s neighborhood.</p>
    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[185,1251,1146,258]]]'>The prosecutor did not cross-examine Drew in any respect, or otherwise attempt to refute this reputation evidence.

      <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>Immediately thereafter, building upon his statements that appellant “goes to school” and “knows people,” and that “the family knows people,” the prosecutor asked the jury the questions now challenged.

    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[264,620,1155,419]]]'>The jury found appellant guilty of murder of the third degree, robbery, and conspiracy. Written post-verdict motions, including the present contention that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct, were denied. The court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder conviction, with concurrent sentences of ten to twenty years on the robbery conviction and five to ten years on the conspiracy conviction. These appeals followed.</p>
    <p id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[264,1058,1155,794]]]'>Here, as in <em>Lipscomb, </em>in rhetorical terms the prosecutor made clear to the jury that appellant had failed to call a particular type of character witness, a school teacher. The prosecutor then asked the jury, again in rhetorical terms, to consider how many different character witnesses they would have called if they or members of their families were in appellant’s position. By this rhetorical tactic, the prosecutor asked the jury to add as many individuals as the jury could imagine to the prosecutor’s list of character witnesses not called. The prosecutor did much more than merely comment upon the quality of the reputation evidence offered. The prosecutor impermissibly asked the jury to draw the same adverse inference as in <em>Lipscomb </em>from appellant’s failure to call reputation witnesses. As in <em>Lipscomb, </em>this rhetorical attack constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.</p>

In <em>Van Cliff, </em>the prosecutor commented upon the quality of the defendant’s character witnesses actually called by telling the jury that “all of <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>these people who came before you are all relatives of the defendant.” The prosecutor added that “[tjhere weren’t any members of the community who were not relatives who came forward and testified as to his quote ‘good character.’ ” Nowhere, however, did the prosecutor engage in the pointed rhetoric found here and in <em>Lipscomb. </em>Indeed, this Court in <em>Van Cliff </em>took great care to point out that the challenged remarks “fall on the borderline of permissibility.” <a href="/pa/483/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="483 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1751180" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0576-01">483 Pa. at 583</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="483 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1751180" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0576-01">397 A.2d at 1177</a>. Here, by asking the jury to consider the absence of a particular type of character witness, as well as the number of persons the jurors would call if they or members of their families were in appellant’s position, the prosecutor crossed “the borderline of permissibility” established in <em>Van Cliff.</em>
