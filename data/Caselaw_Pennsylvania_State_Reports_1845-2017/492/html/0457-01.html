The mother evidenced her wish not to be disturbed by her initial refusal to admit Ms. Johnson. Admission was gained only after Ms. Johnson arrived escorted by a police officer thereby suggesting some official authority for the request. Clearly, coercive aspects of the initial entry are evident. To suggest that these facts constituted a voluntary surrender of custody by the natural mother would strain credulity.</p>

Two of these contacts were initiated by the father to inform the agency that certain goals had been satisfied. The mother had seventeen contacts with the agency during the same period.

In the instant case, in addition to the frequent contacts and visits by the parents, there were several attempts by them to satisfy the requirements imposed by the B.C.S. On November 12,1977, the father informed Mr. Powell that one of the goals had been satisfied. Upon being informed that more had to be done before the child would be returned, the parents moved into another apartment, bought a crib and birthday present for their baby. Efforts on the part of the parents to obtain another apartment, a crib and a birthday present indicate a willingness to provide a supportive environment for the infant within their ability to economically support their baby. Under the existing circumstances, the record establishes appellants’ love and affection for their child and their actions fully comport with the requirement that they affirmatively demonstrate that affection.</p>
