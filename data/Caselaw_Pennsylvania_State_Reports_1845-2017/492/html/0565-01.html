By excluding the crime of involuntary manslaughter from the jury’s consideration in a homicide prosecution, its alternatives are confined to finding a malicious or intentional killing within the meaning of Sections 2502 and 2503 of the Crimes Code, or an acquittal. In the instant case, if the jury had accepted appellee’s assertion that he did not intend to stab and kill Minor, even though rejecting his claims of self-defense, it should have returned a verdict of not guilty of the crimes on which it had been instructed. On the other hand, had instructions on involuntary manslaughter been requested and given, this possibility of outright acquittal could have been foreclosed. The decision to exclude the offense of involuntary manslaughter from the <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>jury’s consideration was not, therefore, without a reasonable objective basis designed to effectuate appellee’s interests, and the Superior Court erred in vacating the judgment of sentence and remanding the case for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Commonwealth v.
