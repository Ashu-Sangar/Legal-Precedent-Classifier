Of the charges originally lodged in the criminal complaints, the true bills returned by the grand jury include the single count of murder, the three counts of attempted murder, and the single count of possessing an offensive weapon. The three counts of felonious aggravated assault charged in the complaints were not approved by the grand jury. Indeed, there is no indication that a bill containing the three counts of felonious aggravated assault was ever submitted to the grand jury. Instead, the record reflects that <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>the grand jury approved only three charges that appellant did “intentionally and knowingly cause bodily injury to [a named victim] with a deadly weapon.” This language states a violation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(4), misdemeanor aggravated assault, a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of up to five years, § 1104(1). This offense differs from the second-degree felony offense, § 2702(a)(1), punishable by imprisonment of up to ten years, for which appellant was not indicted.</p>

As to the other charges, counsel informed appellant that the Commonwealth was willing to drop the charges of attempt to commit murder and recommend acceptance of a plea to the aggravated assault counts. On these terms, according to counsel, the Commonwealth would “recommend not five-to-ten years but rather two and a half-to-five years.” This sentencing “recommendation,” however, was no concession at all. It merely represented the maximum permissible sentence consistent with the grand jury’s indictments on misdemeanor aggravated assault.</p>
    <p id="b764-6" data-blocks='[["BL_764.6",764,[258,1261,1157,827]]]'>Following this discussion, the court was informed of the “agreement” in which appellant would plead guilty to one count of murder of the third degree and three counts of aggravated assault, with the district attorney dropping charges on attempted murder and recommending sentence of two and one-half to five years on each count of aggravated assault, “to run consecutive.” After hearing testimony of a psychiatrist on the question of appellant’s intent to kill, as well as the Commonwealth's admission that it would have difficulty establishing murder of the first degree, the court then discussed the plea with appellant. There is nothing to indicate that the court reviewed the bill approved by the grand jury charging only misdemeanor aggravated assault and not the felony offense. Instead, acting on an assumption that the felony counts of aggravated assault were still in the case, the court asked appellant:</p>

The court did not follow the Commonwealth’s recommendation of two and one-half to five years on each count of aggravated assault. Rather, still acting on the assumption that felonious aggravated assault was charged, the court imposed sentences of three to six years on three counts of felonious. aggravated assault. Thus appellant’s sentence totalled a term of imprisonment of nineteen to thirty-eight years, three years in excess of the maximum sentence consistent with the offenses charged by the grand jury but twelve years less than what the court thought was the lawful maximum.</p>

Appellant also alleged that public defenders, who had been appointed after guilty plea counsel refused to proceed, failed to carry out appellant’s direction to appeal. Thus, appellant alleged, “[a]s a result of the actions of his prior counsel, [he] was denied his right to direct Appeal, or to attempt to Appeal Nunc Pro Tunc.” Appellant further alleged that previous counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance in failing to supply proper advice at the guilty plea stage.</p>

The PCHA court concluded that following sentencing appellant was dissatisfied with the length of sentence imposed. Even though appointed, post-sentencing counsel failed to pursue appellant’s desire to challenge the sentence, the PCHA court denied all relief, including an appeal, based on its view that appellant’s post-sentencing counsel justifiably believed that a challenge to the sentence would lack merit. According to the PCHA court, “[t]here is no evidence that the sentence was in any way illegal.” The court considered no other aspect of the quality of representation provided, deeming all other ineffectiveness claims waived under section 3(d) of the PCHA by appellant’s failure to take a direct appeal.
