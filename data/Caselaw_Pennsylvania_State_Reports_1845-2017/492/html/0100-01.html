Furthermore, the rule espoused by appellee would compel counsel to urge upon the trial court every conceivable theory, on the mere chance that, before his case is finally concluded, one such theory might become the law. Since, by hypothesis, the trial court would have to overrule any objection based on his failure to adopt one of these theories, on appeal, the winning party below would be in the same position as the instant appellee. Indeed this requirement would tend to <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>delay justice, for the court below would still have to consider and rule on each theory.
