Hutchison. The judgment was entered for arrearages accumulated under an order against appellee for the support of appellant Helene E. Hutchison and the couple’s two children. The protracted litigation and events which brought the case to this Court are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b248-10" data-blocks='[["BL_248.10",248,[234,1272,1157,583]]]'>Appellant and appellee were married in 1956 and two children were born of the marriage. In September of 1972, appellee husband took a leave of absence from Westinghouse Electric Corporation, where he was employed as an engineer, and left his residence and domicile in Pennsylvania. He travelled to Clark County, Nevada, where he took up residence in a hotel/motel. After being there for three months and two days, he obtained a decree of divorce from the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada. This divorce decree required appellee to pay appellant child support in the amount of $200.00 per month.</p>
    <p id="b248-11" data-blocks='[["BL_248.11",248,[233,1876,1157,476]],["BL_249.1",249,[215,309,1147,353]]]'>. Approximately two weeks later, appellee returned to Pennsylvania and his employment at Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Shortly thereafter, on January 15,1973, appellee entered into a written separation agreement with appellant. This agreement, in contradiction of appellee’s recently-obtained Nevada decree of divorce, referred to appellee and appellant as husband and wife and described appellee as being of Washington County, Pennsylvania. It provided in pertinent part: that the two could thereafter live separate <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>and apart; that appellee was to pay appellant $250.00 per month in child support; that appellee was to pay to appellant within 90 days the sum of $10,000.00 in full settlement of her marital rights and, failing the same, that the entire agreement was to become null and void; and that the agreement did not prevent either party from obtaining a decree of divorce.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[214,694,1149,519]]]'>On April 10, 1973, appellant commenced an action in divorce against appellee in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County and, in conjunction with this action, petitioned for alimony pendente lite, counsel fees, and expenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellee raised the January 15th agreement as a defense. Although the $10,000.00 had not (and still has not) been paid, the court found for appellee and dismissed the petition, ordering appellant to comply with the agreement. Appellant appealed this order to the Superior Court, which affirmed per curiam on January 1, 1974.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The action sought support for both appellant and the couple’s two children. Appellee was personally served with the complaint but, nevertheless, failed to appear at the hearing <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>on August 21, 1973. An order requiring support payments in the amount of $500.00 per month was entered against appellee and a wage attachment was issued. One week later, an attorney entered an appearance for appellee and motioned for a rehearing, alleging he had been informed that no appearance would be necessary if he merely submitted to the court the order entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County. The motion was granted, the August 21st support order was set aside, and a rehearing was scheduled for September 5,1973. On August 31, 1973, that hearing was postponed until such times as would be mutually convenient for counsel.</p>
    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[239,955,1158,679]]]'>Following the postponement, on September 14, 1973, appellee moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, leaving no forwarding address and without informing his attorney or appellant of his whereabouts.

After being served with the rule, appellee’s attorney petitioned to withdraw as counsel, stating that he also was unable to ascertain appellee’s whereabouts. This petition was granted and, on March 22, 1976, the arrearages were reduced to a judgment in the amount of $15,500.00.</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[209,570,1151,682]]]'>Approximately two months later, appellant received an anonymous letter containing appellee’s Las Vegas address. Nevada counsel was retained and a letter dated November 8, 1976 was sent to appellee informing him that a judgment in favor of his wife in the amount of $15,500.00 had been entered against him in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The letter instructed appellee to contact his wife’s Nevada counsel within ten days, but appellee did nothing after receiving it. Subsequently, on February 23, 1977, appellee was served with a complaint to enforce the judgment. Appellee resisted the enforcement, and this litigation terminated on August 10, 1977, with the Nevada courts concluding that the judgment was entitled to full faith and credit.</p>
    <p id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.6",251,[206,1270,1151,469]]]'>Finally, on September 10, 1977, appellee returned to Pittsburgh and, on September 23, 1977, petitioned the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas to open the judgment. As noted previously, that court granted appellee’s petition and opened the judgment which, on account of further arrearages, had been increased to $21,750.00 by an order dated April 5, 1977. A divided panel of the Superior Court affirmed the order of the court of common pleas,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and we granted appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

Appellee left Pennsylvania after being personally served with a complaint, knowing that support proceedings were pending and that the hearing had only been postponed. He did not notify his counsel or appellant of his departure or whereabouts, and then engaged in conduct obviously designed to conceal the same and insure that he would not be found. Yet appellee now complains that he did not receive notice of the proceedings subsequent to his departure, and that they were <em>ex parte. </em>The affidavits contained in the record, however, establish without contradiction that appellee’s counsel of record was notified of all proceedings up through the first rule to show cause why the arrearages should not be reduced to judgment (after which, he was permitted to withdraw his appearance). This is all that is required by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, see Pa.R.C.P. Nos. 233 and 1027. After having been personally served with process and then concealing himself from <em>appellant, the courts, </em>and <em>his own counsel, </em>appellee cannot now be heard to assert a lack of personal notice as an excuse for his failure to appear.</p>

Appellee in his brief in this Court and in his briefs and pleadings in courts below has consistently and erroneously referred to this matter as an “action for non-support,” even though appellant correctly and fully described the matter in the briefs and exhibits she initially submitted in opposition to appellee’s petition to open the judgment. Support is a cause of action separate and distinct from alimony pendente lite, see <em>Belsky v. Belsky, </em><a href="/pa-super/196/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="196 Pa.

For, appellee asserts that the order of support which was later entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County and which forms the basis for the judgment in question in this case was “void <em>ab initio.” </em>Appellee arrives at this conclusion by reasoning that the Washington County court’s assumption of jurisdiction over the support matters divested the Allegheny County courts of jurisdiction over the same matters. When the action is properly characterized, however, this argument is without factual support and must necessarily fail.</p>

The defenses which appellee has advanced in support of his petition to open the judgment are: 1) the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County was without jurisdiction to enter a support order; 2) the Nevada divorce decree terminated his duty to support appellant; and 3) partial payments were made to appellant while appellee resided in Las Vegas. As we find that appellee did not promptly petition to open the judgment, and that his failure to appear cannot be excused, it is not necessary to address the merits of these defenses. <em>See VanHorn v.
