The action sought specific performance to compel sale of stock in American under purported buy-sell agreements.

Haines of the Atlantic County Superior Court of New Jersey. Of the four cases, Raymond Geftman, acting in the name of American, brought three actions and petitioners here brought one. At the specific request of Raymond Geftman the New Jersey case came to trial on August 13, 1980 with Raymond testifying and undergoing some cross-examination. On August 18, 1980 when trial on the preliminary issues was to resume, plaintiff by Raymond Geftman discharged its New Jersey counsel. Argument set for August 22, 1980 was attended by all counsel, including Pennsylvania counsel. None of American’s old, new or Pennsylvania counsel would participate. Raymond Geftman would permit neither American’s old counsel nor American’s Pennsylvania counsel to represent American at the argument. The Company’s new counsel refrained from active representation on the grounds that he had not been paid a retainer at that time and that he was not prepared. On September 8, 1980 Judge Haines, by written order, enjoined the parties and Raymond Geftman from undertaking any further proceedings, except those involving a request for a continuance, in Pennsylvania because Raymond Geftman, through his Pennsylvania counsel, had indicated in a letter dated August 21, 1980 that American was requesting an expedited listing of the Pennsylvania actions for trial in Montgomery County.</p>

This meeting climaxed prior activities of the parties, Raymond Geftman, counsel and the two judges. Numerous previous attempts of petitioners to proceed to trial in Montgomery County had been successfully resisted by American.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> This resistance occurred at the same time American was pressing for trial in New Jersey. Judge Haines attempted to negotiate the matter of the two jurisdictions with respect to American’s lawsuits. As a result of a conversation had by Judge Haines with the Honorable Richard S. Lowe, President Judge of the Common Pleas. Court of Montgomery County, on August 18, 1980, together with a confirming letter of the same date, Judge Lowe stayed the first and second Pennsylvania actions. The record is unclear as to the final disposition of the stays entered by Judge Lowe; however, the September 15th meeting between Judges Stanziani and Haines did not resolve the bi-state jurisdictional clash. Later that day, Judge Haines orally appointed Joseph M. Nolan, Esquire, a New Jersey attorney, custodial receiver <em>pendente lite, </em>effective immediately. American’s counsel asked for and received a stay pending an application to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey for leave to appeal the appointment. An application for a further stay of the appointment and leave to appeal was denied by the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey and by the Supreme Court of New Jersey. On September 17, 1980 Judge Haines entered a written order appointing Joseph M. Nolan, Esquire, custodial receiver <em>pendente lite </em>of American.</p>

On October 2,1980, Mr. Nolan, the custodial receiver <em>pendente lite, </em>instructed Pennsylvania counsel “to take whatever steps may be necessary to insure [the] discontinuance” which Mr. Nolan had caused to be filed in the first Pennsylvania action. Counsel for petitioners had filed a discontinuance in the second Pennsylvania action (the stockholders’ derivative action requesting an accounting, etc.). After petitioners filed and presented their petition for a writ of prohibition and writ of supersedeas to this writer, the matter was kept under advisement, pending action upon the parties agreement that the jurisdictional question resultant from the filing of the discontinuances be raised before Judge Stanziani. While petitioners filed a petition for rulings on jurisdictional issues with Judge Stanziani, respondent American by Raymond Geftman and counsel, Alan C. Kauffman, Esquire, filed a petition to strike off the discontinuance filed by the New Jersey custodial receiver, Joseph H. Nolan, Esquire. On October 14, 1980 after hearing argument on October 8, 1980, Judge Stanziani entered an order striking off the discontinuance in the first Pennsylvania case wherein American is the plaintiff although the second Pennsylvania case where American and Raymond Geftman are defendants remains discontinued.

The November 25, 1980 order of the Supreme Court of New Jersey afforded comity to the Courts of Pennsylvania and restored order to the judicial processes affected by those matters pending in its appellate courts relating to the Geftman Estate, American and the Geftman brothers. Full faith and credit is no longer an issue here because all of Judge Haines’ orders were stayed pending disposition of a directed appeal in the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey.
