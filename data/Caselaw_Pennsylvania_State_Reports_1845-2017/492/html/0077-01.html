Hosta and Associates and appellee Emergency Association of Southwestern Pennsylvania. <em>Forbes Health System and Geoffrey M. Hosta and Associates v.

At issue is whether, under Medical Assistance regulations and the accompanying statutes, private independent physician groups which contract with hospitals to provide emergency room physician coverage are entitled to Medicaid reimbursement for services rendered to Medical Assistance patients while on emergency room duty, even though these hospitals receive Medicaid reimbursement for all emergency room services, including physician coverage. Because these cases present similar facts and an identical issue of law, they have been consolidated for purposes of appeal. We conclude that the Commonwealth Court exceeded the scope of judicial review of the determination of DPW and that the regulations as interpreted by DPW are valid under state and federal law. Thus, we reverse the orders of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

In March 1977, by letter to appellee Forbes Health System, the Bureau of Medical Assistance (BMA) of DPW terminated payments to appellee Hosta and, similarly, by letter to Monongahela Valley Hospital, Inc., BMA terminated payments to appellee Emergency Association. It stated that the department’s authorization of double payments for a single service had been made in error.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In subsequent letters BMA explained that Medical Assistance payments to hospitals for emergency room visits constituted full payment for all emergency services, including those of emergency room physicians, and that payment to physicians for these services was therefore a contractual matter between the hospitals and physicians. In a letter to Monongahela Valley Hospital, Inc., BMA stated, “the emergency room fee per visit is available either to the hospital or to a physician group practice that has assumed the complete operation of the emergency room, but not to both.” However, because appellant had been in error in authorizing payment to appellees Hosta and Emergency Association, appellant did not seek restitution of payments made.</p>

The appeal of appellees Hosta and Forbes was heard on July 14, 1977 and the appeal of appellee Emergency Association was heard on February 17, 1978, each before a different hearing examiner.
