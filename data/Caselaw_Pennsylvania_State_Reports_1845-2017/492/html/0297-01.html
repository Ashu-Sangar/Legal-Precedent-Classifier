At 3:00 p. m. that day, after discussion with counsel and despite defense objection, the court summoned the jury. The court inquired whether the jury had reached a verdict and, if not, whether with more time it could do so. The foreman answered that no verdict had been reached and that “[w]e have gotten the same verdict for the past few days without any change at all in the last two days.” The court then asked the jury to return to the jury room to determine whether it was deadlocked.

The record reveals two occasions on which the court addressed the jury’s inconvenience: (1) when informing counsel of its decision to summon the jury to inquire into the progress of the jury’s deliberations, and (2) when thanking the jury for its services after a mistrial had been declared. Both sets of remarks indicate a concern for the jury and appreciation for its service, but they do not indicate that the judge considered the jury’s convenience in determining whether there was manifest necessity for a mistrial. Although we agree with appellant that it is not permissible to consider jury convenience in deciding whether manifest necessity for a mistrial exists, our reading of the record satisfies us that the court based its declaration of a mistrial on the jury’s inability to reach a verdict, not on the jury’s convenience.
