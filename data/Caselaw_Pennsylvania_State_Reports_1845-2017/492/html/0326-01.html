An agreement was entered into between the Department and PG&amp;W to remedy and minimize the adverse effect of this federally funded highway project on the turbidity and purity of the water derived from the watershed. This agreement provided that the Department would contribute to PG&amp;W a sum in excess of $2.7 million toward the construction of a new dam, reservoir, and a 30-inch pipeline.

    <blockquote id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.7",460,[277,1417,1114,959]],["BL_461.1",461,[247,282,1108,882]]]'>For public utility accounting and rate making purposes we must reject respondent’s contention. Property, which is used or useful in rendering a public utility service and which has been a part of a public utility’s rate base is dedicated to a public use, and is impressed with a public trust. If (or the proceeds or accruals therefrom) is subject to regulation by the properly designated regulatory body and remains subject to that regulation until such time as that regulatory body duly finds it in the jpublic interest to approve its release from public service. Such property must be regulated in the interest of the public no less than in the interest of the utility. Equities must be balanced and justice must be done to all concerned. Accordingly, when a utility suffers extraordinary losses in service value of utility property abandoned or otherwise retired from service, or suffers unforeseen damages to property which damages could not reasonably be anticipated, and where the utility has not otherwise recovered its investment, this <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>Commission can and, where equities require, does permit the utility to recover from the ratepayers, as a proper and necessary expense of rendering the public service, the necessary amount to make the utility whole. On the other hand, where, as here, the utility recovers an amount or sum as a result of compensation for particular property and the potential consequential injury to the service of the ratepayers for whom that property was dedicated to the public use, the Commission, where the equities dictate, may require that amount received by the utility to be treated, for public utility accounting and rate making purposes, in such manner as will place the utility and the ratepayers in the same position, insofar as reasonably possible, as they were before the extraordinary event or transaction which gave rise to the sum or amount in question.</blockquote>

Clearly, the payment in question resulted and stemmed from consideration of the property’s dedication to public use as a water utility, and recognition of the potential injury to the interests and service of the water utility customers. In situations and circumstances such as this, the customers of a utility are in the nature of third party beneficiaries whose interest in the utility service must be protected. The essence of public utility regulation is the protection of the public and the assurance of adequate service to them at reasonable rates on the one hand, and, on the other, a fair opportunity to the utility to secure a reasonable rate and no windfall from such services. To reflect equitably and meaningfully the near restoration of, or equitable substitution for, the pre-agreement status quo, both the utility and its customers must be made whole insofar as reasonably possible.</blockquote>

The PUC’s functions in valuing utility property<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and in fixing just and reasonable rates of return thereon<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> are exercises of the regulatory powers of the Commonwealth. <em>Cf., Nebbia v. New York, </em><a href="/us/291/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="291 U.S. 502" data-case-ids="1497894" data-case-paths="/us/291/0502-01">291 U.S. 502</a>, <a href="/us/291/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="291 U.S. 502" data-case-ids="1497894" data-case-paths="/us/291/0502-01">54 S.Ct. 505</a>, <a href="/us/291/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="291 U.S. 502" data-case-ids="1497894" data-case-paths="/us/291/0502-01">78 L.Ed. 940</a> (1934).

      <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>The second deep-rooted fallacy in the Commonwealth Court analysis in this area has to do with confusing valuation for eminent domain purposes with valuation for regulatory purposes. These various processes of valuation are no more necessarily interrelated or interdependent than valuation for real property assessment purposes or any other circumstance in which the law requires valuation of property for the performance of a discrete and separate governmental function. <em>See generally </em>Bonbright, Valuation of Property (1937). The mere fact that a particular part of the company’s property was valued at its cost of reproduction in an eminent domain award is not dispositive nor controlling as to its proper valuation for regulatory purposes. The purpose of just compensation in eminent domain is to put the owner “in as good a position pecuniarily as it would have occupied, if its property had not been taken.” <em>U. S. v. New River Collieries, </em><a href="/us/262/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="262 U.S. 341" data-case-ids="6141083" data-case-paths="/us/262/0341-01">262 U.S. 341</a>, <a href="/us/262/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="262 U.S. 341" data-case-ids="6141083" data-case-paths="/us/262/0341-01">43 S.Ct. 565</a>, <a href="/us/262/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="262 U.S. 341" data-case-ids="6141083" data-case-paths="/us/262/0341-01">67 L.Ed. 1014</a> (1923).

In so doing, PG&amp;W contends that the PUC contravened the controlling statutory norm requiring it “to ascertain and fix the <em>fair value </em>of the whole or any part of the property of any public utility.” Public Utility Law, § 311, 66 P.S. § 1151 (emphasis supplied). PG&amp;W further contends that this statutory norm of “fair value” either incorporates by reference the meaning of that term as adumbrated in <em>Smyth v. </em>Ames<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> or, in the alternative, is bottomed on the continuing validity of <em>Smyth </em>as a standard for adjudicating the constitutionality of rate regulation under the Federal Constitution.</p>

Accordingly, we find that the overriding principle governing the PUC’s performance of its duty is to determine “just and reasonable” rates pursuant to Public Utility Law § 301, 66 P.S. § 1141. <em>New York Telephone and Telegraph v. PSC, </em><a href="/ny/309/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="309 N.Y. 569" data-case-ids="2238901" data-case-paths="/ny/309/0569-01">309 N.Y. 569</a>, 579-580, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20N.E.2d%20847" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="132 N.E.2d 847">132 N.E.2d 847</a>, 850-51 (1956). Thus, the “fair value” must reflect rates that are “just and reasonable.” The rate making function consists of a two-step process to effectuate the paramount responsibility of fixing “just and reasonable” rates: fair valuation of utility property and the ascertainment of a reasonable rate thereon. There is ample authority for the proposition that the power to fix “just and reasonable” rates imports a flexibility in the exercise of a complicated regulatory function by a specialized decision-making body and that the term “just and reasonable” was not intended to confine the ambit of regulatory discretion to an absolute or mathematical formulation but rather to confer upon the regulatory body the power to make and apply policy concerning the appropriate balance between prices charged to utility customers and returns on capital to utility investors consonant with constitutional protections applicable to both.

Between these extremes, the question is one of policy for the regulatory body concerning which the judicial branch is not warranted in interposing economic theories.

Then again, the reproduction cost, less depreciation, may not give the present fair value of an old property, for it may not now be desirable to reproduce the old type of plant. Improved machinery, and better methods of operation, may have come into vogue, which would make it true economy to relegate much of the physical structure of an old plant to the scrap heap.
