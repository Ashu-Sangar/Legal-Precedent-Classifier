When no answer was filed, Kennedy’s attorney wrote to counsel for Black and Fidelity, requesting action. On August 2, 1977, the attorney for Black and Fidelity notified opposing counsel that he had not yet had a conference with his clients, but was planning such a meeting in the near future.</p>

On July 6, 1978, the court ordered the judgment opened and permitted appellees to file their answer. Kennedy appealed to the Superior court and that court, sitting as a panel of three, affirmed the trial court with one judge dissenting. <em>Kennedy v. Frank L.

    <p id="b529-8" data-blocks='[["BL_529.8",529,[218,1458,1150,907]]]'>Appellant argues the trial court abused its discretion in opening the instant default judgment. In <em>McCoy v.

Before a court may open a default judgment, however, the moving party must show that the petition to open was filed promptly, that a meritorious defense existed, and that the failure to act could be reasonably explained. <em>Ruczynski v. Jesray Construction Corp., </em><a href="/pa/457/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="457 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="478452" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0510-01">457 Pa. 510</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20326" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="326 A.2d 326">326 A.2d 326</a> (1974). As we believe the appellees’ excuses for its failure to respond are not sufficient as a matter of law, we must reverse the Superior Court’s order which affirmed the trial court’s order opening the instant default judgment.</p>

      <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>At the hearing on the petition to open the judgment, appellees advanced the following three excuses for not filing responsive pleadings: (1) appellees’ attorney was confused as to the length of the final extension; (2) Kennedy’s counsel failed to follow a local Washington County custom and did not telephone opposing counsel immediately before entering the default judgment; and (3) appellees’ attorney believed that Kennedy’s counsel would never take a default judgment.</p>
    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[223,809,1158,690]]]'>The trial court based its decision on the premise that the delay was excusable because the parties were attempting to negotiate a settlement. The court also stated that Kennedy’s attorney failed to notify opposing counsel immediately before taking the default judgment. The majority of the Superior Court panel agreed with the trial court on the discussion concerning settlement negotiations and further held that appellees’ counsel may very well have misunderstood the length of the final extension. For the reasons set forth hereafter, we do not believe that the reasons either advanced by appellees or accepted by the trial and Superior Courts constitute reasonable excuses for appellees’ failure to file an answer which justifies the opening of the judgment.</p>

No valid excuse for such long continued delay in the face of repeated requests and demands for action was shown and we are of opinion that the judgment should not have been opened. See <em>Hale v.
