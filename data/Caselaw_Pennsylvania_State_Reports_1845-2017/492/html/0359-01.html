The order was based on the court’s finding that peremptory challenges are used by some assistant district attorneys in the District Attorney’s Office of Allegheny County to achieve systematic exclusion of blacks from juries in cases involving black defendants and white victims. The lower court certified the order for interlocutory review pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b), and this Court granted the Commonwealth’s petition for permission to appeal. We conclude that appellee has not established that the Commonwealth impermissibly exercised its peremptory challenges to strike black prospective jurors in the trial of his case. Therefore, the order of the court of common pleas is vacated and the case remanded for trial.</p>

Mr. McHenry’s responses to these questions revealed, inter alia, that he. was acquainted with two members of the staff of Western Penitentiary and that he recalled that his wife had mentioned the name “Futch” as having been reported unfavorably in the news media, although he could not recall any details.
