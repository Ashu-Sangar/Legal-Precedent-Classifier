This examination revealed that as of December 31, 1976, Old Heritage was insolvent by $161,386, was in a hazardous financial condition, had violated the laws of this Commonwealth, and suffered from gross mismanagement. The report of this examination was delivered to Old Heritage on August 3, 1977, and the next day the Commissioner suspended the entire business of Old Heritage based on the examination’s finding that the company’s condition posed a danger to its 7,500 policyholders, its claimants, its creditors and the public generally. On <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>August 16, 1977, the Commissioner petitioned the Commonwealth Court for an order to liquidate Old Heritage.</p>

At that time Old Heritage’s management offered to infuse $161,000 into the company to cure its solvency. This proposed infusion was not in cash, but rather to consist of adjustments in accounts between Old Heritage and affiliated agencies owned or controlled by the management of Old Heritage, and would include long-term payments on pre-existing debts between Old Heritage and these agencies.</p>
    <p id="b713-5" data-blocks='[["BL_713.6",713,[180,982,1148,574]]]'>The Commonwealth Court denied Old Heritage’s application for supersedeas and affirmed the suspension order on October 17,1977.

The Commonwealth Court, on February 17, 1978, enjoined these activities as violative of the October 17, 1977 order, and further ordered that “[a]s any and all outstanding policies expire by their own terms, they shall not be renewed or extended.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Because Old Heritage issued only policies of one-year terms or less, all of the company’s policies expired by February 18, 1979.

The Commonwealth Court <em>en banc </em>heard argument concerning these proposed findings and the exceptions thereto on February 6, 1979. While this case was under consideration by the Commonwealth Court, Old Heritage filed a “Motion for Judicial Notice,” seeking to have that court take judicial notice of Old Heritage’s 1978 annual financial statement as proof that the company was not insolvent or in a financially hazardous condition.</p>

The company contends that the granting of this petition would have demonstrated that Old Heritage was solvent. This petition was filed with the court on July 5, 1979, while the court was considering the disposition of the case. On <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>September 5,1979, the same date as its decision ordering the liquidation of Old Heritage, the Commonwealth Court through a separate order by President Judge Bowman denied the company’s authorization petition on the basis that, “we have concluded that [Old Heritage] is insolvent as of December 31, 1976, and have directed the Insurance Commission to liquidate” the company. Appellant contends that the Commonwealth Court erred when it denied the petition without a hearing. On September 11, 1979, Old Heritage appealed from the denial of this petition.</p>

Prior to the December 1977 amendments to the Insurance Department Act of 1921, there was no statutory definition of insolvency. Under these circumstances, this Court created its own definition of insolvency. <em>See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Minister's Protective Society, </em><a href="/pa/294/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="294 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="1113381" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0006-01">294 Pa. 6</a>, 11, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.%20232" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="143 A. 232">143 A. 232</a> (1928).

Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court correctly employed the statutory definition rather than our prior judicial definitions of insolvency. Appellant contends that the Commonwealth Court employed the wrong portion of this new statutory definition in gauging the company’s solvency. This definition is set forth below. The Commonwealth Court and the Commissioner employed that portion of the definition italicized, while Old Heritage contends that the correct test is indicated by the portion underlined:</p>

For any insurer licensed to do business in the Commonwealth as of the effective date of act which does not meet this standard, the term “insolvency” shall mean for a period not to exceed three years from the effective date of this act that is unable to pay its obligations when they are due or that its admitted assets do not exceed its liabilities plus any required capital contributions ordered by the commissioner under provisions of the insurance law.

The Commonwealth Court did not address this controversy. We believe that the interpretation of this section set forth in the Commissioner’s brief to this Court correctly construes the legislature’s intent:</p>

      <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>... Old Heritage argues that Section 503’s definition of “insolvency” allows the company three years in which to make itself solvent. Thus, according to this specious logic, it is impossible for any insurance company to be found insolvent for the three years following the effective date (December 14,1977) of the statute. In view of the General Assembly’s stated purpose for enactment of Article V for “the protection of the interests of insureds, creditors, and the public generally,” it is inconceivable that the legislature of this Commonwealth intended some hiatus in application of the definition of “insolvency” so as to leave the public unprotected from insolvent insurance companies for three years.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b717-4" data-blocks='[["BL_717.5",717,[238,1011,1105,744]]]'>The proper construction of the definition may be summarized as follows: The general definition of “insolvency” is that admitted assets do not exceed liabilities <em>plus </em>surplus required for Old Heritage’s organization. Every insurance company, stock or mutual, is required to have a minimum amount of surplus (and capital if a stock company) for its organization. The minimum depends on the line(s) of insurance the company is authorized to write, as specified in Section 206 of The Insurance Company Law of 1921, <em>supra, </em>40 P.S. § 386. If this general definition of “insolvency” were to be applied to Old Heritage today, it would be required to have $50,000, 40 P.S. § 386(e)(3) (proviso), above the mere “break-even” point indicated on its own optimistic balance sheet, Brief for Appellant at 7.</blockquote>

This Court has had occasion to define “unearned premium reserve:” “When an insurer collects a premium on a policy before its expiration, part of the premium is unearned, i. e., the part collected for that period of time that has not elapsed. If a policy is cancelled before expiration, the insurer must refund the unearned premium. The purpose of an unearned premium reserve is to guarantee that money will be available for any such required refund.

Even if Old Heritage was deficient in its unearned premium reserve, it would still be required to have assets that equal or exceed that deficiency. In the balance sheet presented by Old Heritage to this Court, the company admits that it has insufficient assets to cover the alleged $159,068 “deficiency” in the unearned premium reserve.

In view of our decision that Old Heritage has waived a consideration of whether it was deficient in funding its unearned premium reserve, we need not reach appellant’s contention that § 808 of the Insurance Company Law of 1921, 40 P.S. § 918, applies to the present case. By its terms, § 808 applies only to those mutual insurance companies “which shall be deficient in providing the unearned premium reserve required” by law. Old Heritage is precluded from asserting this section by the company’s failure to provide a proper foundation for the argument that it is deficient in its unearned premium reserve. For this reason we are not able to consider Old Heritage’s contention that it is relieved of its liability for unearned premium reserve because the Commissioner, in the proper exercise of his statutory discretion, failed to approve Old Heritage’s request to assess its policyholders in order to correct the alleged “deficiency” in unearned premium reserve.</p>
