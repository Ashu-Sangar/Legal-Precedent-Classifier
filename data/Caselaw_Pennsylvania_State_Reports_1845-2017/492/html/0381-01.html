The case was originally set for trial on December 15, 1975, simultaneous with appellant’s trial on another offense. The court denied the Commonwealth’s motion to consolidate the two trials and postponed trial on the instant case. On December 17, 1975, appellant proceeded to trial on the other charges. Since under Rule 1100 trial on the instant case was required to begin by January 9, 1976, the Commonwealth filed a timely petition for an extension of time pursuant to Pa.R. Crim.P. 1100(c) which the court granted on December 21, 1975, specifying that trial should begin by April 15, 1976.</p>

In order to determine this claim, as well as the related claim of a Rule 1100 violation and its effect on appellant’s decision to enter a plea of guilty, we vacate the order denying appellant’s post-conviction petition and remand for the filing of an amended petition by counsel not associated with the public defender’s office and an evidentiary hearing thereon.</p>

Since appellant entered a plea of guilty, the only legally cognizable issues in a post-conviction proceeding are those which affect either the voluntariness of the guilty plea or the legality of the sentence. Therefore, appellant will be entitled to relief only if he can prove that he did not knowingly waive his right to be heard and if he can demonstrate that the violation of Rule 1100 induced his guilty plea. <em>See Commonwealth v. Bunch, </em><a href="/pa/466/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="466 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1715010" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0022-01">466 Pa. 22</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="466 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1715010" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0022-01">351 A.2d 284</a> (1976); <em>Commonwealth v.

It is significant that appellant’s uncounseled petition made no attack on the voluntariness of his guilty plea. It is equally significant that appellant does not challenge here the voluntariness. of his plea; appellant’s only claim is that it was error for the trial court to have denied his PCHA petition without a hearing. A challenge to the voluntariness of a guilty plea, of course, will not be entertained in the absence of a motion to withdraw the plea in the trial court.
