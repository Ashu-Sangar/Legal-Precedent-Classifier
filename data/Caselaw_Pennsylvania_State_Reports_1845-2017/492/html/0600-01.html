The charges arose out of a series of sales of marijuana to the same individual which were alleged to have occurred between October 1974 and January 1975. Nine of the possession and delivery counts were dismissed before trial. In June 1975, the Commonwealth brought Hude to trial on three of the remaining possession and delivery charges and on the corruption charge. The Commonwealth’s evidence consisted solely of the testimony of Barry Hagemus who asserted that on numerous occasions during the fall and winter of 1974r-1975, Hude had sold him varying amounts of marijuana.

The differences between collateral estoppel and the traditional aspects of double jeopardy, successive trials and double punishment, are particularly important to our inquiry. First, collateral estoppel does not require that the offenses <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>charged in the two prosecutions be the same. Second, collateral estoppel only bars a redetermination of those issues necessarily determined between the parties in the first proceeding. Third, collateral estoppel requires a final judgment in the first proceeding. Thus it becomes clear that while the traditional aspects of double jeopardy could readily be deemed inapplicable to a subsequent perjury prosecution of a criminal defendant, such is not the case with collateral estoppel. As the <em>Ashe </em>Court noted, collateral estoppel was intended to enhance the traditional double jeopardy protection and to provide relief from the growing threat of multiple prosecutions. To that end that Court directed the principle of collateral estoppel be applied with “realism and rationality” and not “applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book.” <em>Id. </em>at 444, <a href="/us/397/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="397 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12054849" data-case-paths="/us/397/0436-01">90 S.Ct. at 1194</a>.</p>

Three of the possession and delivery charges were dismissed following the preliminary hearing. Prior to the initial trial, in a proceeding in the nature of habeas corpus contesting the committing magistrate’s prima facie determination, six other counts were dismissed by stipulation of counsel. The Commonwealth proceeded to trial on three of the counts charging possession and delivery and the one count of corrupting the morals of a minor. Appellant was acquitted on all charges by the jury. The Commonwealth thereafter went to trial on the remaining counts, over appellant’s objection. In this second trial appellant was convicted of some of these charges and after appeal, those convictions were reversed by the Superior Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Again in the second trial the Commonwealth relied upon the testimony to Hagemus to establish the transactions. Finally in the perjury case, the Commonwealth charged that appellant made three false statements during the first trial. It was contended that he lied: (1) <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>when he stated he owned a certain car; (2) when he stated that he never dealt in drugs; and (3) when he stated he did not have a specified car during a particular period of time. The perjury complaint was heard without a jury. A demurrer was sustained as to the first averment and appellant was found not guilty of the third averment. It is the conviction of the second averment that is presently before us. From this recitation it is evident, even before applying the <em>Ashe </em>analysis, that the Commonwealth was determined to convict appellant on the basis of the testimony of Hagemus.</p>

Hagemus testified to a number of meetings during which the contraband was allegedly transferred. The defendant denied agreeing to sell or selling drugs to Hagemus. There was no question of misidentification nor was it possible to reconcile the conflicting versions. The jury was forced either to accept Hagemus’ testimony or to acquit. They followed the latter course. Thus the critical, in fact the sole issue litigated at the first trial was the credibility of Hagemus, and the jury resolved that issue against the Commonwealth.</p>

A review of that record establishes that the proof of the falsity of the answer depended upon the acceptance of Hagemus’ testimony that appellant was dealing in drugs. To look only to the “ultimate” issue of fact and assess its dissimilarities with the issues in the original trial and ignore the factual predicate upon which that “ultimate” issue of fact must rest would be the “technically restrictive” approach that <em>Ashe </em>instructs us not to follow. The concern that application of the doctrine to “evidentiary” issues rather than confining it to “ultimate” issues of fact makes it more difficult to ascertain that each evidentiary issue was necessarily adjudicated in the original acquittal is not present here where that issue was the only one to be resolved. Thus, in this instance, there is no rational basis to insist upon a distinction between “evidentiary” and “ultimate” and we refuse to adhere to a rule in instances where the reasons for its application are not present. <em>See, United States v.

In his testimony during the first trial, as he did on each occasion where he was called for the Commonwealth, Hagemus’ testimony consisted of a full explication of his alleged knowledge of Hude’s “dealing ... ”. At the time the first trial commenced, there were a number of indictments covering the testimony that <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>was given during the first trial. The Commonwealth elected to proceed only on three of these sale and delivery indictments. It is reasonable to assume that the Commonwealth selected the strongest cases in its first attempt to convict. The defense was a general denial of the course of conduct rather than a specific response to one or more of the dates set forth in the indictments to which appellant was then being called upon to answer. Approaching the record of the first perjury trial with the realism and rationality we are required to employ, we can find no basis for singling out or isolating facts to suggest the jury may have rejected only that on the three dates in the indictments before them, appellant was not engaged in dealing and selling but did engage or deal and sell drugs. To the contrary, the indications are that the first jury’s repudiation of the testimony of Hagemus was complete. We note that in the second trial the jury did convict on some counts and acquit on others. In that posture, the Commonwealth’s argument would have much more substance. However, our concern in this appeal is the finding of the <em>original jury </em>which rejected all of the three indictments they were presented with.</p>

The minor referred to in that indictment was, of course, the witness, Hagemus, who was 16 at the time of the alleged occurrence of this series of events. If the jury had, as the Commonwealth suggests, concluded that Hude was in fact dealing in drugs and dealt in drugs with this young boy but not on the occasions in the indictments before them, the jury could have returned a verdict of corrupting the morals of a minor, although acquitting as to the specific charges of sale and delivery. This they did not do, which is further evidence of the total rejection of the testimony of Hagemus. The Commonwealth attempts to respond to the failure of the jury to make a finding of guilt on the corrupting charge by suggesting that the jury may have acquitted because they believed that the witness, Hagemus, “was already corrupt.” While this is a possibility, it is the <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>kind of labored reasoning that the <em>Ashe </em>Court referred to as “the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book.” In that instance, the corrupting count was clearly an umbrella charge which was intended to fill the gaps if the Commonwealth’s proof failed as to the specific averments. Its rejection indicates the total discredit of the Commonwealth’s case by the jury. Moreover, the Commonwealth’s argument that the jury concluded that Hagemus was already corrupted further supports the view that they totally rejected all of his testimony.</p>

It was not rejected in part; it was rejected fully; and, for that reason, we feel that collateral estoppel can properly be invoked to prevent the relitigation of that issue. Therefore, the Order of the Superior Court affirming the Judgment of Sentence entered in the perjury case is reversed; the Judgment of Sentence is vacated, and the appellant is discharged.</p>

Klinger apparently told O’Reilly that he wanted to turn himself in to his parole officer because he had been in violation of the terms of his parole.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Appellant called his mother from O’Reilly’s office and asked her to pick him up at a nearby shopping center and to drive him to his parole officer. The deceased, Hazel Pulaski, was seen meeting Klinger in her brown Pinto at the shopping center at approximately 7:40 a. m. and the two <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>drove away from that location together. At approximately 9:15 a. m., Klinger arrived at the house of his friend, Carole Durkin, in Camp Hill, without his mother. He arrived at Ms. Durkin’s house in his mother’s car. Mrs. Pulaski, appellant’s mother, was found dead ten days later in a remote mountainous area at Lambs Gap. It was stipulated by counsel and the jury was advised that if Klinger murdered his mother, that act would have occurred within the period between 7:40 a. m. and 9:15 a. m. on May 28, 1976. The disputed trial focused upon the events that occurred during that time frame between 7:40 a. m. and 9:15 a. m.</p>
    <p id="b750-5" data-blocks='[["BL_750.5",750,[246,904,1155,721]]]'>The Commonwealth proceeded on the theory that Klinger and his mother drove to Lambs Gap where he killed her and left her facedown near a small stream. It was contended that he then drove to the home of Carole Durkin where he spent the remainder of the morning. That evening Klinger drove to the Maryland shore with his girlfriend, Allyson Weiss, where the two remained until Monday evening, May 31. By that time, search efforts had begun for Mrs. Pulaski, and suspicion of foul play centered on appellant. Appellant eluded authorities until his arrest on Wednesday, June 2. The Commonwealth’s case stressed Klinger’s motive, an opportunity to kill his mother, his familiarity with the Lambs Gap area and his week in flight to Maryland and other furtive activity following his mother’s disappearance.</p>

Klinger testified that on that morning, he drove his mother to Millers Gap, a site approximately 3V4 miles distance from Lambs Gap, where appellant sought his mother’s help in locating camping equipment that he stated he had left in that location the previous day. According to appellant’s testimony, he and his mother separated in an effort to comb the area in search of the equipment. Once appellant realized that he had lost sight of his mother, he testified that he retraced his steps to the car and drove away intending to spend “one last weekend” with Allyson Weiss before he went to jail for a parole violation.

The defense also attempted to direct suspicion on Robert Pulaski, Klinger’s stepfather, by showing that Robert had both a motive and an opportunity to kill the victim. Cross-examination of Robert Pulaski elicited several inconsistencies as to his activities and whereabouts on the morning in question, and these inconsistencies were utilized by the defense in their effort to place blame on Robert Pulaski. It was agreed by both sides that Klinger could have travelled from Camp Hill to either Lambs or Millers Gap and then to Carole Durkin’s within the time frame agreed upon. The court’s charge to the jury stressed the Commonwealth’s burden of proof and mentioned several facts for the jury to consider: whether another person may have been responsible for the death; whether the killing occurred in an area other than where the body was found; the effect of prior consistent and inconsistent statements; and how the jury should construe evidence of motive and flight.</p>

Included in the charges which the majority leaves standing are the allegations that: (Count II) Klinger lied when he stated that he saw and waved to “two guys” on Lamb’s Gap Road after leaving Miller’s Gap; (Count V) Klinger lied when he stated that one Nielson was the first person to whom he related the events of Miller’s Gap; and (Count VI) Klinger lied when he detailed the route taken from Camp Hill to the mountain.</p>

The District Attorney’s conduct here falls far below the Supreme Court’s standard. His conduct is clearly vindictive and designed to obtain vengeance against Klinger despite the jury’s verdict of acquittal on the substantive charges. Indeed, a clearer record of bad faith prosecution could not be established. Here, after openly admitting and publicizing his personal dissatisfaction with the jury’s verdict of not guilty on the substantive charge of murder, the Perry County District Attorney has proceeded to bring perjury charges against Klinger in disregard of the opinion of the office of the Attorney General, the highest law enforcement officer of this Commonwealth, that prosecution is <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>unwarranted.

For at common law, and under early federal criminal statutes, offense categories were relatively few and distinct. A single course of criminal conduct was likely to yield but a single offense.

In more recent times, with the advent of specificity in draftsmanship and the extraordinary proliferation of overlapping and related statutory offenses, it became possible for prosecutors to spin out a startingly numerous series of offenses from a single alleged criminal transaction.

Pearce, </em><a href="/us/395/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="395 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="1772134" data-case-paths="/us/395/0711-01">395 U.S. 711</a>, <a href="/us/395/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="395 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="1772134" data-case-paths="/us/395/0711-01">89 S.Ct. 2072</a>, <a href="/us/395/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="395 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="1772134" data-case-paths="/us/395/0711-01">23 L.Ed.2d 656</a> (1969). Again, it must be emphasized that this is a <em>Bolden </em>appeal and the scope of review is narrow.</p>

As stated, the Superior Court sustained appellant’s objection to Count I and, therefore, that count is not a subject of this appeal. Count IV was dismissed at the preliminary hearing, and that also is not presently under consideration.</p>

We note that in the alleged statement to Ms. Guise, Klinger is averred to have stated that he struck his mother and left her on the mountain. The original jury’s finding that Klinger did not in fact strike his mother or leave her on the mountain does not preclude a subsequent jury, from determining that he may have told someone that he did. The heart of this averment is not the truth or falsity of the content of the statement, but rather whether he discussed the events of that morning with someone prior to his conversation with Neilson.</p>
