John Stasak was the driver of a car which struck a telephone pole, injuring Timothy E. August and David C. Belzner (appellants) who were passengers in the car. John Stasak and his parents (appellees) did not inform their insurance company of the accident until seven months later on June 25, 1974. Appellant August had already sued the appellees; appellant Belzner sued soon thereafter. The insurance company investigated the claim but refused to defend or indemnify the appellees, asserting that the required prompt notice was not given. Appellees retained their own counsel to defend the suit of appellant August, but on May 28, 1975 August recovered a verdict of $12,150.26. Appellant Belzner obtained a default judgment on August 4, 1975, and a verdict was rendered in the amount of $4,120.00. These trials both occurred well after the insurance company had notice of the accident.</p>

At trial, the court expressly found that the insurance company was not prejudiced by the late notice because the company had access to all the witnesses, the police accident report, and appellee’s personal defense counsel’s files. Furthermore, adequate time to prepare for trial remained even after late notice. However, the court denied relief, holding that the insurance company’s refusal was proper under the prior law. <em>August v. Stasak, </em>No. 387 January Term 1974, No. 356 January Term 1975 (Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County, filed February 1, 1977).

    <p id="b685-10" data-blocks='[["BL_685.11",685,[201,1507,1148,655]]]'>I agree with Mr. Justice Larsen that appellants are entitled to the benefit of this Court’s decision in <em>Brakeman v. Potomac Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">472 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">371 A.2d 193</a> (1977). These cases were pending on direct appeal at the time <em>Brakeman </em>was decided. Manifestly, “it is unfair to litigants whose case is not yet final to subject them to a law that is now recognized as offensive. Even-handed decision-making requires that similarly situated individuals on direct appeal be treated the same.” <em>Commonwealth v. Hill, </em><a href="/citations/?q=492%20Pa.%20108" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="492 Pa. 108">492 Pa. 108</a>, 111, <a href="/pa/492/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="422 A.2d 491" data-case-ids="1767113" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0100-01">422 A.2d 491</a>, 499 (1980) (Roberts, J., Opinion in Support of Reversal, joined by O’Brien, C. J., and Flaherty, J.). The orders of the Superior Court, therefore, must be reversed.</p>
