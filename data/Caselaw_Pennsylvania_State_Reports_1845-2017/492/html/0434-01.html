After denial of post-verdict motions by the court <em>en banc, </em>appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge and 10-20 years imprisonment on the aggravated robbery charge, sentences to run concurrently.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the judgments of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

In this appeal, appellant has abandoned his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and proceeds solely on the claim that the P.C.H.A. court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial in light of Barnes’ sworn statement that he had perjured himself at appellant’s trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Barnes stated that while he himself expressed some reluctance to go along, [appellant] immediately agreed to the proposal. Nothing came of the plan, however, until January 7,1972, when [appellant] and Odom finally persuaded Barnes to accompany them on their misadventure. That day they met at Odom’s house; Odom produced a loaded .32 caliber revolver which he indicated to the others he was taking with him on the robbery.</blockquote>

Through a window in the bar door they were able to observe the comings and goings of persons to and from the store. At approximately 6:00 p. m., satisfied that no shoppers remained in the store, the three men moved across the street and entered the store. Inside the storeroom, [appellant] and Barnes placed themselves near the checkout counter, where Dobkin was standing, while Odom moved throughout the store removing various items from the shelves. Odom then came to the counter with his “purchases” and began fumbling in his pockets as though looking for money. Instead of money, however, he withdrew the revolver from his pocket and fired two shots at Dobkin, who fell to the floor clutching his stomach. Odom then leaned over the counter and fired two more shots. Dobkin subsequently died of a gunshot wound to the head.</blockquote>

The P.C.H.A. court found Barnes’ recantation testimony to be “utterly false” and, in fact, held him on charges of perjury and false swearing: “We are ... convinced that this recantation was motivated not by conscience or a desire to see that truth and justice be done, but rather for ulterior motives on the part of the witness.” (Slip op. at 4).</p>
