At the time of the shooting, appellant was 15 years of age and resided with his family in a house next-door to the residence of the victim and his family. The two families had a deep-seated dislike for each other, and had been engaged in a violent feud for several years. On the day in question, May 7, 1977, the victim went to appellant’s home because of threats and an assault upon the victim’s wife. When he <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>arrived, he was pulled into the door and shot numerous times in the back with two rifles.</p>

It is, however, equally without merit, and is controlled by this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

Here, as in <em>Bhillips, </em>appellant does not allege that his waiver was unknowing or involuntary.

Appellant argues that his mother, with whom he consulted before waiving his rights, was not such an adult because she was also a murder suspect and more interested in her own welfare than his. The Commonwealth contends that appellant’s mother was in fact interested in his welfare. According to the Commonwealth, this was demonstrated by her confessing to the crime in order to shield appellant, and not disclosing appellant’s involvement for over three hours and until she was confronted with appellant’s stepfather’s identification of appellant as one of the shooters. However, for the reasons set forth above, it is unnecessary in this case to decide which interpretation of the facts is correct, and to address the continuing validity of <em>Commonwealth v. Roane and </em>its progeny. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth also did not realize until the last minute that it was not going to introduce the confession into evidence. For, the Commonwealth called the detective who was present for the confession to the witness stand, laid the foundation for introduction of the confession, and then approached the bench and informed the court that it was not going to introduce the statement into evidence. Apparently, at that point, the Commonwealth did not feel it needed the confession to obtain a conviction, and wanted to obviate unnecessary issues on appeal.</p>
