Appellant was found guilty of murder of the first degree, and the jury found the presence of aggravating circumstances, but not mitigating circumstances, thereby mandating imposition of the death penalty. Act of March 26, 1974, P.L. 213, No. 46, § 3.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Following the denial of post-verdict motions, appellant <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>took a direct appeal to this Court. This Court reversed the judgment of sentence and ordered a new trial on the grounds that the jury could have inferred from the testimony of a Commonwealth witness that appellant had been engaged in unrelated prior criminal activity. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa/488/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="488 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="1761046" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0133-01">488 Pa. 133</a>, <a href="/pa/488/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="488 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="1761046" data-case-paths="/pa/488/0133-01">411 A.2d 490</a> (1979).</p>

On cross-examination, appellant’s counsel sought to impeach the credibility of two eyewitnesses to the murder with inconsistencies between their present testimony, and the testimony they gave at the first trial and appellant’s preliminary hearing. In response, the prosecutor read two pages of the witnesses’ testimony from the prior proceedings to the jury during his summation. Appellant’s counsel moved for a mistrial on the grounds that much of what had been read by the prosecutor had not been adopted by the witnesses or otherwise incorporated into the record of the second trial. The trial judge noted that the prosecutor had in fact neglected to introduce that testimony into evidence and, after deliberating for a day, granted the motion for a mistrial. Appellant then moved to have the charges against him dismissed, asserting that retrial was barred by the constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy embodied in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, § 10, of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The motion was denied, and an appeal was taken directly to this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellant, in his brief to this Court at page 11, admits the record supports that conclusion, and it is difficult to perceive how he could assert otherwise in the face of the evidence that had been presented by the Commonwealth at this lengthy trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> For, as the judge who heard appellant’s motion to dismiss on the grounds of double jeopardy observed:</p>

That there was, for the second time, prosecutorial misconduct in appellant’s case is equally obvious.
