West remarked that the victim had assaulted him, and appellant spoke of revenge. Later that evening appellant and West went to the victim’s home, and West threw a brick through the victim’s front window. The victim came out of his house, and West ran away.

Without more, we will not conclude that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to petition for appellant’s transfer to juvenile court. Assertions of ineffectiveness in a vacuum cannot be ineffectiveness.
