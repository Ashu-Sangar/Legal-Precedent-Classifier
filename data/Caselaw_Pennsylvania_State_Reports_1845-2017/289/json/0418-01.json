        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Simpson,\nPlaintiff\u2019s husband was a truck driver for the defendants, E. H. & B. Claar. While at his home, and not in the course of his employment, he ran a splinter into the ball of his left foot. The wound festered and he was unable to work for about a week. At the end of that time, he returned to work and drove the truck a distance of some sixteen miles, using the left foot to depress the pedal which releases the clutch, just as he had always done and was compelled to do by the construction of the machine. The next day the wounded foot was much worse, he was taken to a hospital, and died of tetanus within twenty-four hours.\nClaiming that his employers were liable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, plaintiff initiated these proceedings. The referee made an award in her favor, the workmen\u2019s compensation board approved the finding, but the court of common pleas reversed and entered judgment for defendants. Plaintiff thereupon took the present appeal.\nIt is not claimed that there was an accident, or any unusual happening, in the course of the work decedent did after the splinter ran into his foot; but it is alleged by plaintiff, and denied by defendants, that the pressure on the ball of the foot, in the way he was required to use it, made the wound worse, and hastened his death. It is not necessary for us to consider the evidence bearing on that point, for we are of one mind that defendants are not liable in any event.\nSection 301 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, 738, says that the parties entitled under the statute shall receive \u201ccompensation for personal injury to, or for the death of, such employee, by an accident, in the course of his employment......The terms \u2018injury\u2019 and \u2018personal injury\u2019 as used in this act shall be construed to mean only violence to the physical structure of the body, and such disease or infection as naturally results therefrom.\u201d It is clear that, if the language quoted is to be given its normal meaning, plaintiff cannot recover, for there was no violence to the physical structure of the body, in the course of the employment, nor any disease or infection arising from an accident occurring during that time. Plaintiff alleges, however, that, in furtherance of the beneficial purposes of the statute, we have construed those words liberally, and that such interpretation makes the defendants liable. But this is an error.\nIn McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., 261 Pa. 312, 327, we said that \u201cIt is plain from these provisions that the act before us contemplates injuries by accident only, and, therefore, does not cover what are termed \u2018occupational diseases\u2019......In short, if the incident which gives rise to the injurious results complained of can be classed properly as a \u2018mishap\u2019 or \u2018fortuitous\u2019 happening, \u2014an \u2018untoward event, which is not expected or designed,\u2019 \u2014it is an accident within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law: see House of Lords Case of Fenton v. Thorley & Co., 19 T. L. R. 684, 685; Boardman v. Scott & Whitworth (1902), 1 K. B. 43, 46. When, however, death results from germ infection, to bring a case of this character within the Act of 1915, supra, the disease in question must be a sudden development from some such abrupt violence to the physical structure of the body as already indicated.\u201d\nIn Lane v. Horn & Hardart Baking Co., 261 Pa. 329, 332, we said, \u201cOn the governing rules of law, the commissioner correctly states: \u2018The term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in our act is confined to injuries of accidental origin and such diseases as naturally result therefrom, and must be held to include [only] any form of bodily harm or incap\u00e1city [accidentally] caused by [either] external violence or physical force.\u2019 \u201d\nIn Clark v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., 264 Pa. 529, 533, we said: \u201cIf death comes, during the course of employment, in an ordinary way, natural to the progress of a disease with which one is afflicted, and with which he was smitten before the accident, there can be no recovery (McCauley v. Imperial Co., supra, 327; Lane v. Horn & Hardart Co., supra, 333); but, if the demise is' brought about by an injury due to some mishap, or accident, happening during the course of his employment, the fact that deceased had a chronic ailment which rendered him more susceptible to such injury than an ordinary person would be, will not defeat the right to compensation.\u201d\nIn Mauchline v. State Insurance Fund, 279 Pa. 524, 526, it is said: \u201cTo be an accident, within the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, the injury must usually result from some undesigned event occurring at a particular time\u201d during the course of the employment.'\nIn Gausman v. Pearson, 284 Pa. 348, 354, we said: \u201cThe next question is, Can this claim be sustained on disability resulting from apoplexy? This must be answered in the negative. Treating what happened to claimant that Saturday noon as the beginning of the apoplectic disturbance and a part thereof, it was not shown to have been an accident within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. To constitute an accident there must be some untoward occurrence aside from the usual course of events......Disability, overtaking an employee at his work, is not compensable unless the result of accident. And the burden is on claimant to prove it was such and not from natural causes: Skinner\u2019s Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, 54, and cases there cited. True, Dr. Frederick attributed the exhaustion, or stroke, to claimant\u2019s exertion in the performance of his work and expressed the opinion that but for the work it would not have happened at that time; in other words that the disability was hastened by the work; even so, that alone would not constitute an accident; otherwise it would be unsafe to give employment to anyone advanced in years. Disability, hastened by such exercise, cannot be treated as accidental; neither can death or disability overtaking an employee in the course of his employment, and resulting from a natural cause; if it could, it would render the employer an insurer of the life and health of the employee.\u201d\nFrom this review of the relevant authorities, it is clear that plaintiff is not helped by them. She could not recover unless there was \u201can accident in the course of the employment.\u201d Here there was none. The finding by the referee that there was such an accident, is reviewable by us since there was no evidence to support it (Stahl v. Watson Coal Co., 268 Pa. 452; Vorbnoff v. Mesta Machine Co., 286 Pa. 199, 207); this latter case (page 210) being also authority for the proposition that \u201cwhere, despite the opportunities afforded by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, no relevant evidence at all is produced to sustain a particular finding, the courts are not obliged to return the record to give the one bearing the burden of proof a further opportunity to establish his case.\u201d A fortiori this must be so where, as here, the claimant proves such a state of facts as shows she has no cause of action.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed.",
