    "head_matter": "Mizzer, Appellant, v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co.\nWorkmen\u2019s compensation \u2014 Explosion in coal mine \u2014 Unlawful use of lights \u2014 Act of June 2, 1891, P. L. 196.\nA coal miner cannot recover compensation for injuries received in an explosion in a coal mine, where it appears that the .explosion was caused by himself in lighting a fuse with matches in violation of Rules 9, 10 and 25 of the Mine Law of June 2, 1891, P. L. 196.\nArgued February 7, 1927.\nBefore Frazer, Walling, Kephart and Schaefer, JJ.\nAppeal, No. 148, Jan. T., 1927, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Schuylkill Co., Nov. T., 1926, No. 256, affirming decision of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, affirming referee\u2019s disallowance of claim in case of Agnes Mizzer v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from decision of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.\nBechtel, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThe claimant in this case, Mrs. Agnes Mizzer, is the dependent widow of Peter Mizzer, who died May 1,1925, as the result of bums he sustained in a gas explosion in the Shenandoah City Colliery of the defendant company, occurring April 29,1925.\nThe case turns on the cause of the explosion. There was no one with deceased at the time the explosion occurred. The referee has found as a fact that the explosion occurred as the result of the deceased\u2019s striking a match to light a fuse. The question is whether or not there is any legal, competent evidence to sustain this finding. There can be no question, under the evidence, that the section of the mine in which the deceased worked was gaseous. Safety lamps were used in this section and no naked lights were permitted. The referee\u2019s finding as to the use of matches by the deceased is based upon the testimony of two witnesses, one of whom, Joseph Runsky, was the first man to come to Mizzer\u2019s assistance. He testified that he asked Mizzer what had happened and that Mizzer told him: \u201cI light fuse with matches.\u201d Another witness, Peter Bubness, testified that he asked him how it happened, on the way out. \u201cI said to him, \u2018lighting a shot\u2019 and he shook his head and I said, \u2018with a match\u2019 and he shook his head again and said \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d\nThe credibility of these witnesses and the weight to be attached to their evidence was clearly for the referee. He has accepted it as establishing the cause of the explosion. With that we have nothing to do.\nRule 9 of the general rules of the Mine Law, reads as follows: \u201cIn every working approaching any place where there is likely to be an accumulation of explosive gases or in any working in which danger is imminent from explosive gases, no light or fire other than a locked safety lamp shall be allowed or used.\u201d ,\nRule 10, inter alia, provides as follows: \u201cNo lucifer matches or any other apparatus for striking light shall be taken into said mine or parts thereof.\u201d\nRule 25, makes it an offense to \u201center a place in or about a mine against caution, or carry fire, open lights or matches in places where safety lamps are used.\u201d\nIt will thus be seen that the deceased violated these provisions of the law. This being the case, it is well settled that the deceased had taken himself out of the employ of the defendant company at the time the accident occurred and is, therefore, not entitled to compensation.\nAnd now, November 8, 1926, the decision of the workmen\u2019s compensation board, affirming the referee\u2019s dis-allowance of this petition, is hereby affirmed.\nPlaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was, inter alia, judgment, quoting record.\nRoger J. Dever, for appellant.\nJohn F. Whalen, with him George Ellis, for appellee.\nMarch 14, 1927:"
