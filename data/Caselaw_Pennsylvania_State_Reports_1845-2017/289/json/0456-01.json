        "text": "Per Curiam,\nIn this action of ejectment, plaintiff claimed title under a deed from defendants; the latter asserted the paper in question was a forgery. The narrow issue was: Did defendants execute a deed to plaintiff for the property in dispute?\nPlaintiff produced one who claimed to he a subscribing witness to the deed, before whom it purported to have been acknowledged. The witness testified that he had prepared the instrument at the request of defendants, that he knew them both personally, and that they signed and acknowledged it before him as a notary public. Defendants denied this testimony.\nIn arguing to the jury the issues thus raised, plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cGentlemen of the jury: If you find the defendant in this case did not sign that deed, then you must decide that Joseph P. Lord [plaintiff\u2019s witness] is a forger.\u201d To this remark, defendant\u2019s counsel objected and requested the withdrawal of a juror, which was refused. The jurors were subsequently instructed that, if they found defendant had not signed the deed, it did not necessarily follow they must conclude Lord was a forger, for there was still the possibility that he might have been mistaken in the identity of the woman who executed and acknowledged the instrument in his presence.\nThe refusal to withdraw a juror because of the remarks of counsel is the only matt\u00e9r assigned for error.\nAfter reading the testimony, we cannot say that the remarks complained of constitute unwarranted or improper argument; therefore, we are not convinced of error.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
