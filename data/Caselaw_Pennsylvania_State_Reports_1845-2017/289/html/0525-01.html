The lessee died early in 1919, and his wife, also executrix, remained in possession. In the December following, with the assent <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>of the owner, she offered to sublet the lower floor to W. D. White &amp; Company, druggists, for an annual rental of $9,000. .The firm refused to move its business to a new location unless assured of the right to occupy the premises for a considerable period, and Long first agreed it could remain until 1931, if so desired. Mrs. Poland was unwilling to bind herself for the payment of rental for such a long term, and it was stipulated that a new lease should be entered into with her, expiring in 1926, and she should sublet to the company until the end of this term. An option to the Whites to hold until 1931 was also to be given, though her tenancy ended at the time first mentioned. Thereafter she would hold under the firm, if it exercised the right to continue in possession. These understandings were reduced to writing by the parties on January 2, 1920.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[273,1213,1152,1178]],["BL_553.1",553,[125,349,1153,152]]]'>W. D. White &amp; Company was a partnership, composed of a father and his son Edward. The firm did not desire to make the outlays required for adaptation of the building to its needs unless a long term could be assured. The senior member took up the matter with the owner, Long, and a written understanding, signed by both parties, was reached on January 5th, by the terms of which possession was to be taken under Mrs. Poland until 1926, at a rent of $9,000, and thereafter the holding should be under Long until 1931, with the charge increased to $13,000. The privilege was also granted to remain until 1936, in which event the sum of $15,000 per year was made payable. This agreement was entered into by W. D. White on behalf of the firm, but the other member was not aware of the terms of the contract at the time it was executed. The former died in 1921, having previously assigned his interest in the partnership to William D. White, Jr. The option to hold until 1936 having been obtained from Long, a sublease from Mrs. Poland during her term, which expired in 1926, was accepted, and, at an expenditure of $40,000, the new equipment was secured, necessary improvements made, and <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>the store belongings removed.

The firm of W. D. White &amp; Co. was not made a party defendant to this litigation. A bill was then filed praying that an injunction be granted to restrain forcible removal of the occupants of the premises on the ground that the holding over for an additional term was permissible and lawful. At the hearing, Long produced the contract of January 5, 1920, with the terms of which the surviving member of the firm, as existing at that time, was unaware, and wherein it was provided the rental charge, beginning with April 1, 1926, should be considerably increased. The amount due on the new basis had not been tendered to the lessor because of ignorance as to the agreement to pay a larger sum. When the facts as to this became known the bill was withdrawn, notice of intention to accept the option given, and a check sent for the money actually collectible as rent for April and May, but acceptance of it was refused. A second proceeding was then instituted to restrain Long, the landlord, and Ricketts, the magistrate, from dispossessing those occupying the property, in which bill Mrs. Poland and the firm were plaintiffs, the former holding after April 1, 1926, under W. D. White &amp; Co. It was contended by defendants, on the motion to continue the preliminary injunction, that equity was without jurisdiction in view of the pendency of the ouster proceedings against Mrs. Poland in the common pleas, that the drug firm as now existing could have no interest in the extension agreement, it having been made with the partnership, now dissolved by the assignment of the interest of W. D. White, and, further, that no notice of intention <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>to exercise the option and continue in possession had been given the landlord. After hearing, a decree was entered prohibiting any attempt to remove the plaintiffs from the premises until the determination of the appeal in the landlord and tenant case, and a review of this action by the court below is now asked.</p>
    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[275,683,1156,1719]]]'>It is first insisted the court was without jurisdiction to enjoin defendants from ousting the lessees pending a decision as to the rights of the parties on appeal from the magistrate in the proceedings already referred to. In an ordinary case, where the termination of a tenancy is in controversy, the statutory manner of procedure must be followed, and the right of the lessee to continue his occupancy is to be determined primarily by the official to whom there has been delegated the power to find the fact, subject to the right of appeal to the common pleas, for thereby a complete remedy is provided: Drove Yard Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/123/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="123 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="967136" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0250-01">123 Pa. 250</a>; Brown’s App., <a href="/pa/66/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="66 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="432477" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0155-01">66 Pa. 155</a>. It was early held, however, that the magistrate’s right to adjudicate was limited by the landlord and tenant acts to plain cases (Steel v. Thompson, <a href="/pen-w/3/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 34" data-case-ids="1827612" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0034-01">3 P. &amp; W. 34</a>), and the statutes were not intended to give exclusive jurisdiction to him in matters where elements of fraud or decisions of intricate questions of law were involved. In Denny v. Fronheiser, <a href="/pa/207/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="207 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="933489" data-case-paths="/pa/207/0174-01">207 Pa. 174</a>, where equitable relief was denied, the circumstances not calling for such intervention, it was said (p. 177) : “The jurisdiction of equity to restrain actions at law is too well established to require discussion, and there is nothing in the Act of 1772 [or 1863] to give proceedings under it any immunity from such restraint in a proper case.” The right to enjoin in landlord and tenant cases, when the facts call for equitable relief, has been since expressly affirmed: Steiner v.

The necessity for the exercise of this power is at times apparent, in view of the fact that the appeal taken from the judgment of ouster is-not a supersedeas.</p>

Legal questions were involved as to the validity of the option granted, whether it was properly exercised, and as to the effect of the assignment by one partner of his interest in the firm prior to the date for expressing an intention to continue in possession. It further appeared that the lessor had withheld notice of the outstanding privilege to continue the lease, until after the magistrate had passed on the question of its termination, and only disclosed the existence of the option in the first injunction proceeding for the purpose of showing more rent was due than had been tendered, thereby defeating the pending suit. Whether his conduct may be said to indicate fraud, or not, the circumstances made out such a case as justified equitable intervention, and the decree restraining interference with the lessee’s occupancy, until the hearing of the appeal from the magistrate, having been based on reasonable grounds, will not now be interfered with: Bixler v.

White &amp; Co., and the fact that the present partners are not the same individuals as constituted the firm when the contract was executed. The writing of January 5th shows no intention to enter into a personal covenant with the parties constituting the firm, but to bind the latter as a partnership. “Covenants to renew are not personal, but run with the land, and the legal successors of the lessee, as well as of the lessor, are entitled to the benefits and are burdened with the duties and obligations which such covenants confer and impose upon the original parties”: 35 C.
