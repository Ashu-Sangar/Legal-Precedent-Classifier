Moorehead were married, and she is still his lawful wife. On October 24, 1914, he deserted her without cause, removed from the community in which they had resided, and his whereabouts were unknown until located in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he committed bigamy by an unlawful marriage with a young woman, whom he soon after deserted. Later he was discovered in California. During this period of desertion from his lawful wife, which continued until September 21, 1916, a bill in equity was filed by the wife in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, against the trustees and the absent husband, praying for suitable maintenance for herself, and in that proceeding a decree was entered September 21, 1916, against defendant Moorehead, but not against the trustees, ordering him to pay to his wife the sum of $7,000 annually in equal semi-annual installments. On the date of this decree, September 21, 1916, defendant resumed marriage relations with his wife and remained with her until July 21, 1924, when he again deserted her without reasonable cause, and his whereabouts were unknown until he was discovered in Baltimore, living in adulterous relations with his wife’s sister-in-law, who had left her husband and, she and Moorehead were found living in the same criminal relation in Chicago, where they resided in an apartment largely fitted up with furniture belonging to <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>Ms lawful wife.

Having been made a party to tbe proceedings and served with notice by advertisement, tbe husband has communicated with tbe trustees and their attorneys through go-betweens, who have not divulged bis place of biding, which seems to be somewhere in tbe eastern part of tbe country. Under tbe decree of tbe court of common pleas, referred to above, there was due and unpaid to bis wife on July 1,1926, a total sum of $17,500. Tbe aggregate income arising from tbe trust created by tbe will of bis grandmother is approximately $20,000 a year, and at tbe date of tbe decree by tbe court of common pleas there was in tbe bands of tbe trustees $29,000.</p>

Tbe clause and codicil have certainly created a trust. It might indeed from such restricted interpretation be properly held to be tbe intention of tes<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>tatrix, as is contended, to prevent the application of any part of the income to the support of the wife of respondent in any contingency. But does the will, by all its terms and provisions, taken in its entirety, admit of such a conclusion? Are there not, in parts other than the clause establishing the trust and the codicil setting forth the restrictions, intendments vitally necessary for consideration to arrive at the actual intention of' testatrix with regard to this trust? Not only do we believe there are, but we view the will as signally prolific in expressions which show unmistakably that at the time testatrix executed it, there was distinctly in her mind the welfare of the wife of her grandson, and that there was in fact no intent on her part to empower, if that were possible, her grandson to refuse the commonest claims of his wife, if ever he should choose to indulge in such defiance. To discover, however, that such was her intention, not only must the will be examined as a whole, but the circumstances surrounding testatrix at the time of making it must also be taken into careful consideration. In Postlethwaite’s App., <a href="/pa/68/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="68 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1024532" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0477-01">68 Pa. 477</a>, 480, this court said: “It has been long and well settled, and indeed it is a principle so consonant to reason that the only wonder is that it should ever have been questioned, that all the surrounding circumstances of a testator— his family, the amount and character of his property— may and ought to be taken into consideration in giving a construction to the provisions of his. will,” and in Stambaugh’s Est., <a href="/pa/135/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="135 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="817475" data-case-paths="/pa/135/0585-01">135 Pa. 585</a>, 597, we said “that we must search only for the intent of a testator within the four corners of the will. This is true, but, when we come to consider the will and interpret its meaning, we must do so in the light of all the circumstances by which the testator was concerned when he made it, and by which he was probably influenced.”</p>

Undoubtedly she meant to create a spendthrift trust. Her purpose in this is manifest, as it is obvious in practically every instance of the creation of similar trusts, viz., to protect the object of her bounty from wasting his income by his extravagance and dissipation; and certainly the career Moorehead followed and has continued to follow furnishes ample justification for these protective inhibitions. But that it was her intent to deliberately enable him to unlawfully deprive his family of the necessary care, protection and support which by law he owed them, neither the terms of the will nor the circumstances attending testatrix at the time of making it, permit. The very fact that the name of the wife of her grandson is not mentioned is in itself evidence that such a contingency was not in the mind of testatrix. Determined as she was to protect her grandson from the effects of his own folly and extravagance in his relations with people in general, would she not, had she intended to include the wife within the range of the trust inhibitions as to contracts and debts, have added a provision to that effect ? It will be informing to give attention to dates and events relative to and connected with the execution of the will. It bears date June 13, 1903. The codicil by which she surrounded the trust with restrictions against the liability of her grandson for <em>contracts and debts, </em>was added January 21, 1905. The testatrix died August 21, 1908. The marriage of her grandson took place May 4, 1903. It will thus be seen that the will and codicil were both executed subsequent to the marriage, the first less than two months after and the codicil a year and six months later. She continued in life for five years following the marriage, and we find nowhere in the will the slightest intimation of animosity on her part <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>toward the wife of her grandson, and if after a period of five years’ association with the young wife, the latter’s future welfare and happiness had become in the mind of testatrix a matter of indifference, assuredly not one word in the will provides the slightest evidence of such unconcern. On the contrary, we find by the language of the will itself, and by noting its general tenor of kindness, love and solicitude for those testatrix was leaving, that, while she made no direct reference to the wife of her grandson, she had her solicitously in mind when she executed the will. Taking all the clauses and the codicil into consideration, we do not find one expression which breathes other than the most tender regard and anxiety for the well-being of her relatives and friends. That, in fact, is a plain characteristic of the entire document, and hence to reach the intention of testatrix it becomes necessary to interpret it in this inclusive sense. We said, in Hood v. Penna. Society, etc., <a href="/pa/221/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="221 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="956190" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0474-01">221 Pa. 474</a>, 480, “There is no sound reason in the nature of things why the actual meaning of the person using the words should not he sought in the case of a will exactly as it is in the case of a contract”; and this principle applies whether the meaning sought is to illuminate the actual disposition of a testator in his will towards a particular thing, or to bring out his intent as to words or declarations when it is a question of the mental or emotional attitude of the testator concerning those with whom he Avas dealing when making his will. Looking at the will then with these principles of construction in view, we find that instead of there being a studied purposeful exclusion of consideration for the young wife of her grandson, there was a gracious and intentional inclusion, by the words of the will itself, in the loving and tender farewell with which she concludes the document.</p>

If it be so contended, we answer, there remains a great controlling factor which cannot be justly avoided or ignored in the settlement of this particular case. That factor is found in the fact that there have arisen in this proceeding circumstances not provided for by testatrix <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>in her will, because .not anticipated by her, which in themselves and in their results, plainly contravene the principles of public morals and public policy in their most general and significant application. A testator has a'right, as was said in Broadway Nat. Bank v. Adams, <a href="/mass/133/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="133 Mass. 170" data-case-ids="2150929" data-case-paths="/mass/133/0170-01">133 Mass. 170</a>, “to dispose of his own property witlrsuch restrictions and limitations, not repugnant to law, as he sees fit, and his intentions ought to be carried out, unless they contravene some positive rule of law or are against public policy.” No hard search is required to find in this will an abundance of reasons for declaring that, to place upon it the interpretation respondent says it should have, — a construction, as we have said, the will in its entirety does not allow, — would be to place it in direct antagonism to every recognized claim of morality and to every purpose of public policy. To ignore or dismiss this controlling factor would be to attach the seal of judicial approval to the misconduct of this respondent against his deserted wife and grant him a commission of right to continue those offenses and persist in his career of shamelessness and criminality, in which the crimes of bigamy and adultery signal his triumphs as a violator of law and of public morals. Such conclusion would be to transform his wickedness into a weapon for further use against a defenseless wife. Of this respondent the learned trial judge has said in his opinion, on entering the decree from which this appeal was taken:</p>

In every civilized country is recognized the obligation, sacred as well as lawful, of a husband to protect and provide for his family, and to sustain the claim of the husband in the case at bar would be to invest-him with a right to be both a faithless husband and a vicious citizen. This case reaches beyond the concern of the immediate parties to it. It affects the status of the family as being the foundation of society and civilization, and hence in a very certain sense is of wide public concern.</p>

A debt is a sum of money due by contract, express or implied. But a tax is not a debt. It is not founded upon contract.
