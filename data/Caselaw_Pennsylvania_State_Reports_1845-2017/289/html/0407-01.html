The question arose under the will of Dr. Mayer of Johnstown, who died in 1920. As it relates to the question before us, the will directs that all “just debts consistent with the preservation of my estate be paid,” and, further, “It having been my ambition since early youth to furnish means by which some worthy child might secure a higher education, for that purpose I give and bequeath unto Duke Stouppe and Louise Stouppe......the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,-000) each, to be considered a <em>just debt, </em>to be paid to ......their mother, to be held in trust for the persons as herein set forth.” Finally, “My estate shall be kept intact until the year 1930, at which time my entire estate shall be settled and divided.”</p>

No account has been filed by the executrix. It was stated at the bar of the court that, at the time of the death of the testator, the estate was scarcely solvent; and the executrix, to carry out the purposes mentioned in the will, was required to be very careful in the conservation and administration of the estate. The court below found there was a <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>direct conflict between the direction to treat the gift in question as a “just debt,” and the last quoted provision of the will postponing distribution of the estate until 1930. For that reason it refused the petition, following the rule that, where contradictory clauses appear in a will, the last clause should take effect to the exclusion of any prior or inconsistent clauses.

Of course, it may be possible for the executrix to mdke some arrangement with creditors whereby payment may be delayed so as to preserve the estate, but that was not the purpose of this language. It was intended to lodge a certain discretion as to payment in the executrix, but, since that discretion could not be exercised as to debts due and payable, some other provision of the will must be sought to give effect to this language.</p>

He could not, in this fashion, create an obligation against the estate to the prejudice of debts existing at the time of his death, or of the widow’s interest. Had-a settlement of the estate occurred within the time allotted by law, this estate would not only have been seriously impaired, as we understand it, but it is very doubtful whether these legacies could have been paid in full.

At his death, the personal property was not sufficient to pay the debts. Testator further made his insurance payable to his estate to be used in liquidation of debts, but this amount also, added to the personal property, was insufficient. To further reduce the drain on the estate, the' wife, as executrix, was to receive a small salary, scarcely sufficient to keep her, and until 1930 she and her children were denied any right to participate in the estate, except for trifling bequests of jewelry. One of the testator’s own children was of school age <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>when he died. To have forced liquidation on the death of the testator, with the widow claiming her rightful share, and costs and expenses of administration deducted, the two children, beneficiaries, if they received anything, would have received in all probability the balance of the estate. Knowing this situation, and, desiring to keep the estate together and do justice, as he viewed it, to all, the testator provided that such debts as he could control should be paid consistent with the preservation of his estate; he did not intend that this gift to the two children should be a part of the estate that was to be kept intact until 1930, nor did he intend to embarrass the estate by forced liquidation to pay a “debt” which arose from his conception of what was just.</p>
    <p id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[120,1171,1154,1234]]]'>To carry out testators intention, these gifts, as debts, might well fall into a class by themselves, as to which the executrix, under the first clause of the will, has a discretion to pay consistent with the preservation of the estate. These payments should be sufficient, if possible, to satisfy the testator’s intent, and at the same time should be of an amount not to unnecessarily embarrass or injure the estate. The discretion lodged in the executrix was not absolute, but is one that may be reviewed and supervised by the courts. The direction of the will to keep the estate intact until 1930, while it emphasizes the general thought that testator wanted his income used to pay off his debts, cannot be regarded as a restriction on any payment that has been directed by prior clauses of the will, or, as to this particular gift, on a part payment from time to time as the just and equitable requirements of the trustee for the children may demand, either to reimburse for past expenditures on account of the gift, or future ones as ordered by the will. The amount to be paid, and the time of payment are in the sound discretion of the court; interest, of course, cannot be allowed until the court fixes the time of payment.</p>
