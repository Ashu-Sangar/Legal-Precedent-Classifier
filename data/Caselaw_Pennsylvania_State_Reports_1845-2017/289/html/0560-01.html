    <p id="b586-7" data-blocks='[["BL_586.11",586,[286,1274,1153,799]]]'>Defendant appeals from the judgment entered on a verdict for plaintiff, recovered by her for injuries sustained when she was negligently run into and knocked down by a motorbus belonging to defendant, and operated by one of his employees. The principal assignments of error are those which complain because the court below refused to give binding instructions for defendant, and to enter judgment in his favor non obstante veredicto. As to these complaints, since there are no relevant writings to consider, all the evidence and proper inferences therefrom, favorable to plaintiff, must be taken as true, and all unfavorable to her must be rejected : Wiles v. Emerson-Brantingham Co., <a href="/pa/267/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="267 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1057757" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0047-01">267 Pa. 47</a>; Simon v.

Viewed from this standpoint, the relevant facts are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b586-8" data-blocks='[["BL_586.12",586,[285,2084,1151,314]],["BL_587.1",587,[133,346,1151,688]]]'>Plaintiff went from Philadelphia to Sharon Hill, to deliver a package for her employer. When she had done so, she walked to the intersection of the Chester Pike and what is commonly called the Hook Road, where she intended to take a trolley car on her return trip. None being in sight, she located herself on the sidewalk <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>of the Hook Road, and, while there, was run into by a motorbus (owned by and being operated for defendant), which turned from the pike into the road and ran up on the sidewalk of the latter, striking her in the back and causing the injuries of which complaint is made. Much is said in appellant’s brief as to the indefiniteness of plaintiff’s testimony regarding what struck her, but in defendant’s pleadings, proofs and by statements made at the trial, it is admitted that she was hit by defendant’s motorbus. The only dispute, touching this point, was as to whether she was then on the sidewalk or in the cartway of the Hook Road, and this the jury resolved in her favor.</p>
    <p id="b587-5" data-blocks='[["BL_587.4",587,[129,1053,1154,1345]],["BL_588.1",588,[282,347,1142,96]]]'>The foregoing facts being true, plaintiff was clearly entitled to recover, for she was where she had a right to be, and where defendant’s motorbus had no right to go. Defendant asserts, however, that her testimony as to her exact position on the sidewalk was so contradictory as to render it unworthy of belief; and hence, as she had the burden of proving the negligence of defendant, the trial judge should have given binding instructions for defendant, as he was requested to do. The principle of law thus invoked is well settled, but it has no relevancy to the facts of this case. It would have been applicable, if, from one part of plaintiff’s testimony, it could have been properly inferred that defendant was not liable, while from another part he was. Our cases upon the point are numerous, but it is not necessary to quote from them. It suffices to refer to the following: Mulligan v.
