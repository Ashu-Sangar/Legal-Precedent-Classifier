    <p id="b558-8" data-blocks='[["BL_558.8",558,[273,899,1150,526]]]'>Plaintiff, while standing at a street crossing in the City of Philadelphia, was struck on the head by a section of iron pipe, extending over the side of a passing trailer attached to a tractor belonging to defendant. The pipe was one of a number of sections comprising, with other articles, a load of building material. Plaintiff was quite seriously injured and at the trial received a verdict for $16,710. The court below denied a motion for judgment n. o. v. for defendant but made absolute a rule for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</p>

The result of our deliberation is to convince the trial judge that the ends of justice require that the case should be again tried, in order that. plaintiff might offer evidence, if available, to make more clear the location of the driver’s cab of the tractor, when she took up her stand three feet south of the car track;......this also can be decided with more satisfaction to our judicial conscience, if we are certain that there is before us all procurable evidence as to the exact location of the tractor, when the plaintiff stopped in the cartway, and also as to the visibility of the overhanging material.”</p>
