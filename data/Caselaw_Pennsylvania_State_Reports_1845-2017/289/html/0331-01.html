It appeared that the tenants, in addition, though not obligated to do so, furnished the landlord garden truck, and the wife performed other services for him without compensation. Prior to 1918, a house was built on the land, a part of the price being paid by the lessees. In that year it became necessary to erect a barn. Cridge had no funds which he could apply for such purpose and asked the tenants to advance the necessary money, stating the place would be given to them when he died. During the same year, and the two following, the new structure was constructed at a cost in excess of $3,600, the entire expenditure being borne by the Millers.</p>

He declared that the rent then paid would not furnish him with sufficient support, but he would agree to convey upon the payment of $500 in cash, and $50 per month, with the understanding, as now claimed, that he would provide by will that, after his death, nothing further should be demanded, and a deed would be made to Mrs. Miller. It was agreed that the parties meet at the office of an attorney, Sample, <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>for the preparation of the necessary contract. While driving there on December 20th, he repeated the understanding in the presence of a competent witness, who testified to the facts as stated. The attorney was advised that the consideration was to be on the basis of $400 per acre, and he suggested that the husband be named as one of the grantees. At this time Mrs. Miller seemed dissatisfied, and withdrew from the room to consult with Cridge. What matters were, then discussed is not proven, but it was arranged that Sample should prepare an agreement to be executed at his home on Saturday evening, the 22d.</p>
    <p id="b359-5" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[124,1002,1158,1180]]]'>The contract then submitted was in the form commonly used, including the ordinary printed phrases, and was read by Sample. It provided for the payment of $500 in cash, and $50 per month, with interest at four per cent. When principal to the amount of $5,000 had been paid, then the deed was to be delivered, and a mortgage given for the balance. It appeared by the competent evidence of the attorney, both interested parties being present at the time of the conversation, that the vendees refused to sign, stating that it did not express the true understanding. Cridge then said, “Well now why? You know what I promised you. I will make good; we will go ahead and get this thing fixed up.” Upon this assurance the contract was executed. It will .be noticed that interest at four per cent on the price named would exhaust all of the monthly payments of $50 provided except $2, so that practically a century would elapse, unless installments were increased in amount, before the $5,000 of principal would be turned over and the deed given. The sum of $500 was given to Cridge, and the monthly payments were also turned over to him until February 1, 1924.</p>

According to Stahr, he declared (referring to the Millers) : “We have got an understanding that I will give it to her at my death.” He was asked on cross-examination as follows: “Q. Did he state whether or not he had promised that to her? A. Why, sure, he stated he promised it to her.” Stahr testified to declarations by Cridge on several other occasions, expressing his intention to so will the farm, as it is averred was under<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>stood when the contract was signed.
