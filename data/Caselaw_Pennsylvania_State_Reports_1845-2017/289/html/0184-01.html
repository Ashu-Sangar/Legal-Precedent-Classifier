    <p id="b211-5" data-blocks='[["BL_211.7",211,[153,678,1152,1345]]]'>This is an action of ejectment for an undivided one-half interest in a piece of land in the Borough of Punxsutawney, Jefferson County. In 1857, Sarah J. Miller, the then owner and common source of title devised the land to her three children, Virginia, Anna and Frank. Anna dying intestate and without issue, her interest became vested in Virginia and Frank, each of whom thereby became owner of an undivided one-half of the land. It is admitted that Virginia’s one-half interest became and is vested in the defendants, while this suit involves the one-half interest formerly owned by Frank. This one-half he conveyed by warranty deed to his stepmother, Margaret J. Miller, in 1878; which deed, however, was not recorded until 1907. Meantime, in 1894, Frank’s interest in this land was sold by the sheriff on execution issued upon a judgment obtained by the Mahoning Bank (subsequent to the conveyance above mentioned) and bought by its trustees. Whatever interest the bank acquired in the land was conveyed to Lyda P. Miller in 1903; and on the latter’s death became vested in her daughter, the plaintiff. By the death of Margaret J. Miller, in 1917, her interest in the land became vested in her children, the defendants. On the pleadings the trial court entered judgment for plaintiff and defendants have appealed.</p>

True, section 2 of the Act of May 8, 1901, P. L. 142, as amended by the Act of June 12, 1919, P. L. 478, provides: “That <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>the court may, on rule, enter such judgment on the pleadings in favor of either party as it may appear to the couit the party is entitled to.” The court’s assumption was right when passing upon the defendants’ claim to judgment, but not for the entry of final judgment for plaintiff. The latter can be granted such affirmative relief only when his controlling averments are not denied. In other words, no matter who moves for judgment on the pleadings, neither is entitled thereto except where his necessary averments are not sufficiently denied. Refusal of summary judgment to one party is no ground for granting it to the other. This is not in all respects a demurrer and a party whose averments present a good cause of action cannot be put out of court merely by an unsuccessful challenge of those of his adversary.</p>

An adverse and exclusive possession commencing with the conveyance to Margaret J. Miller in 1878 and continuing until the impetration of this writ, a period of forty-seven years, is properly averred and, if proven, will be a good defense. Appellee’s suggestion, that an adverse possession cannot be invoked because of a tenancy in common, is untenable. When Frank Miller conveyed his one-half part to Margaret J. Miller, his interest ceased and he was no longer a tenant in common of the property. Furthermore, Margaret J. Miller’s interest in the land was received from Frank Miller and she never was a tenant in common therein with him or with those claiming under the sheriff’s sale. If that sale conveyed any title it was for the one-half interest which Frank had conveyed to her and she had no interest in any other part of the land; hence, she could not be a tenant in common with the purchaser at that sale. The other one-half, not here at issue, was and is owned by defendants through a conveyance to them from Virginia Miller’s executor in 1907. Moreover, a joint possession <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>is evidence of the claim of title of each occupant: Jackson v.

Miller was in actual possession of the land at all times (from 1878 to 1917), including that of the sheriff’s sale and of the later conveyance to Lyda P. Miller. If shown, that will be such constructive notice as to protect the title.

Super. 438" data-case-ids="868625" data-case-paths="/pa-super/33/0438-01">33 Pa. Superior Ct. 438</a>, 440: “An unrecorded deed, with possession taken thereunder and maintained, is sufficient notice to subsequent purchasers. It is to be presumed that if the plaintiff had inquired of the defendants she would have been informed of the unrecorded deed.” Actual open possession is sufficient evidence of notice of the title of the possessor: Meehan v. Williams, <a href="/pa/48/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="48 Pa. 238" data-case-ids="422189" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0238-01">48 Pa. 238</a>. Of course, the questions of notice and possession are usually for the jury.</p>

Her entire claim rests on the sheriff’s sale, of which there is record evidence, but she avers neither the acknowledgment nor delivery of a sheriff’s deed, and those acts are essential to vest title in the purchaser and enable him to maintain ejectment, and proper proof of the acknowledgment is <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>the record: Bellas v.

In the instant case, so far as appears, no deed therefor from the sheriff is of record or can be found or ever existed. Plaintiff, however, expresses a belief in her ability to supply any apparent defects in that regard, and we are loath to turn her out of court at this early stage of the proceedings on account of some missing record or document that may be found before the trial. We do not pass upon the effect of defendants’ delay of ten months in moving for judgment on the pleadings. A summary judgment, however, should never be entered in a doubtful case: Franklin Sugar R. Co. v. Lykens M. Co., <a href="/pa/274/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="274 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="1073076" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0206-01">274 Pa. 206</a>; 31 Cyc. 607.</p>

In the instant case, as in other actions of ejectment, plaintiff must recover on the strength of her own title. See Artz v.
