The prayer was refused, and no appeal was taken. Thereafter, plaintiff, another director and stockholder, filed the present bill, joining the other directors as parties defendant with the corporation.

Nor should its application be restricted by technical requirements, but a broad view should be taken of the subject, having always in mind the actual purpose to be attained. The rule should not be defeated by minor differences of form, parties or allegations, when these -are contrived only to obscure the real purpose, — a second trial on the same cause between the same parties. The thing which the court will consider is whether the ultimate and controlling issues have been decided in a prior proceeding in which the present parties actually had an opportunity to appear and assert their rights. If this be the fact, then the matter ought not to be litigated again, nor should the parties, by a shuffling of plaintiffs on'the record, or by change in the character of the relief sought, be permitted to nullify the rule. This is a universal rule and is well stated by our present Chief Justice in State Hospital v. Con. Water Co., <a href="/pa/267/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="267 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="1057765" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0029-01">267 Pa. 29</a>, 37.

The first of these requirements being present, all issues that were actually adjudicated in the former action are concluded (Bower’s Est., <a href="/pa/240/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="240 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="993044" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0388-01">240 Pa. 388</a>; First Nat.

If, then, the issues in the present case could have entered into the determination of the first case, they should have been presented; and if they were omitted for any cause, the judgment or decree entered thereon is conclusive between the parties or- their privies.

But this was the very thing the first proceeding was intended to accomplish. As we read the averment of that bill, and the findings of fact, there can be no question about it. The chancellor there found that money had been paid to the two directors without any authority from the board of directors, contrary to law, and that a promissory note had been given by one of them to cover this payment. Other sums were found to have been paid to employees, and, further, the corporation refused to enter suit on the note above mentioned. The court below held that the amounts given to the directors were not paid with the purpose of defrauding the company, but under a claim of right for services actually <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>rendered; and that there was no fraud or mismanagement in the company’s affairs, the institution of suit on the note being a discretionary matter for the board.

    <p id="b289-3" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[127,626,1153,307]]]'>The prayer in the first bill was for the appointment of a receiver to recover the moneys due the corporation.

    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[125,953,1153,1333]]]'>We conclude, from our examination of the record, that there was an identity of subject-matter, cause of action, parties, and quality in the persons for or against whom the claim is made, in the two proceedings, and the addition of other parties to the original action did not make it a new cause of action, (34 C. J. 396, 757; Loyal Orange Institution v.

If the relief asked in the latter bill could have been obtained in the prior action it should have been asked, and, since the cause of action is the same, all matters which might have been litigated in the former proceeding are concluded. A party cannot escape the bar of the judgment against him by bringing a new suit on the same cause of action, but in a different form of action or proceeding, unless the relief sought in the second action was not or could not have been germane to the first proceeding: see 34 C.

The fact that a different measure of relief is asked by the plaintiffs in the latter suit does not deprive defendants of the protection of the prior proceedings and the decree in their favor: Green v.

It related to the <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>payment of a dividend out of capital. While the averments did not cover this item specifically, the findings of fact did cover the payment in much detail, and the relief asked, — authority to collect “all moneys due,”— would have enabled the receiver to compel the return of the illegal dividend, if the court concluded that such action was proper. While it is unnecessary to discuss this question in view of what we have held above as to the effect of the prior case upon the present bill, we think that the action of the court below denying relief was proper.</p>

Williams, <a href="/us/174/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="174 U.S. 397" data-case-ids="3607412" data-case-paths="/us/174/0397-01">174 U.

E. 958</a>, in a suit by a stockholder to recover his pro rata share of a dividend thus'declared, the corporation, which was solvent, could not justify its refusal to pay on the ground that the dividend was declared out of capital. In Stoddard v. Shetucket Foundry Co., <a href="/conn/34/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="34 Conn. 542" data-case-ids="507739" data-case-paths="/conn/34/0542-01">34 Conn. 542</a>, 544, where the same result was reached as in the Thiry Case, the court said, “when the other stockholders are willing to repay the company the fund they assumed they had withdrawn from it, they will stand in a better condition to call upon the court by some proper application for that purpose to restrain the plaintiff from withdrawing a part of the capital in the shape of a dividend.” The rule with respect to dividends has relation to the protection of creditors whose <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>interest makes it vital that capital should not be impaired. It may, perhaps, be invoked for' the protection of the minority stockholders of a “going concern” when the impairment of capital, while not rendering the corporation insolvent, interferes with its activities and endangers its existence. This question, however, does not arise in the present case since the corporation is in process of liquidation.</p>
