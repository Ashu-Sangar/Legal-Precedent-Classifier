    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.7",414,[265,676,1152,1058]]]'>Appellant operated a colliery at Mt. Carmel. The coal mined and prepared was placed in a building containing pockets from which it was loaded into trucks and wagons by means of chutes. The building was located about seventy-five (75) feet from the colliery. Appellant also provided, for the use of coal haulers, a road leading from the public highway over its property to the chutes. Appellee’s son, a customer who purchased coal from defendant, took his truck, in December, 1924, to the colliery for a load of coal. As there was a heavy demand for coal that day, the trucks to be loaded were obliged to stay in line, a number being ahead of the one driven by appellee’s son. He waited some ten minutes, until his turn arrived; when he attempted to proceed, the starter of his car refused to work, and he stepped out on the side of the car nearest the breaker toward the front to crank it. He had taken about two steps when he was struck on the head by a coupling hook that had been used about appellant’s colliery, and fell to the ground unconscious.</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.8",414,[261,1755,1152,637]]]'>For a long time defendant’s custom had been to have the slate pickers and other employees clean the floor of the colliery and throw the scrap out of the window on the east side of the breaker, to a scrap-heap located immediately below the window and between the breaker and the road provided for the use of patrons. Boys were, at the time of the accident, cleaning the colliery floor in this manner. The window on the east side of the building was from 15. to 20 feet above the ground. Contending that defendant was negligent in disposing of its scrap, appellee instituted this action and recovered a judgment in the court below.</p>

      <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>Appellant argues there was not sufficient evidence to establish any negligence on the part of defendant, that it did not affirmatively appear that an employee of defendant threw the missile, or, by the exclusion of all other causes, that any of defendant’s employees were in a position to have caused the accident; in fact, that there was no positive testimony to show how the iron came to fall, whence it came, or that it did not come from some other part of the breaker: Laven v. Moore, <a href="/pa/211/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="211 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="940087" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0245-01">211 Pa. 245</a>; Fleccia v.

The boy was, therefore, an invitee on the premises and where one is in lawful use of a private road as an invitee, the owner of the premises owes to him the duty of ordinary or reasonable care, under the circumstances, to keep the road safe from the negligent acts of his servants in the discharge of the owner’s affairs, so that such user would not be unnecessarily exposed to danger: Fortunato v.

The piece of iron which struck him was seen in the breaker before the accident happened, and it was seen just a moment before in the hands of one of defendant’s servants. An employee, who at the moment looked out of one of the east windows, saw it passing through the air, falling and striking defendant on the head. It came from the second floor. The identical piece of iron having been traced to the hands of defendant’s employee in the breaker, who was performing a duty required of him by the company, clearing the breaker of rubbish, it was shown to be defendant’s prop<a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>erty. Though the act of throwing was not seen, it could be inferred, from the circumstances related, that an employee carelessly threw the iron too far. There were no other buildings or places from which it could descend, or to which it might have been transferred. It did not appear that any stranger was in the breaker who could have thrown it. Only employees of defendant were there. The time between its different situations and the actual passing in the air was so short, the inference was for the jury whether or not defendant’s servant threw it.</p>
