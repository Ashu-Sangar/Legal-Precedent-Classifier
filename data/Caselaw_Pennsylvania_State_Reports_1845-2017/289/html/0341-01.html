To carry out its operation large financial resources were required, and to raise the necessary funds a mortgage was executed with bonds to the amount of $1,200,000, in which the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh was named as trustee, the stock of the subsidiary companies and other' assets being deposited as security. The mortgagor covenanted that it would keep in good repair the various properties, and provide for the payment of all labor claims, taxes, insurance and other charges. A brokerage firm purchased one-half of the bonds, and agreed to take the remaining portion on condition that $60,000 be sold at 85% of the face value, the proceeds, amounting to $51,000 to be placed in trust to insure the payment of federal taxes covering the years 1917 to 1921, which had been assessed, or which the government might find to be due for the period mentioned.</p>

The contract was signed by the parties, approved by the buyer, and the fund contemplated was handed over. Under the terms of the trust, the money was to be appropriated solely for the payment of taxes as set forth, the amounts when fixed by the federal authorities to be paid to the coal company only on certificates, sworn to by its president and vice-president, showing that the amount asked to be withdrawn was necessary to pay the assessment made by the government, and to be used for no other purpose. The sum of $28,215.95 was so transferred and taxes satisfied pro tanto. A written request <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>was made, after the present attachment was issued, asking the trustee to remit $21,819.81 directly to the internal revenue collector in West Virginia. There still -remains due for the years 1917 to 1921 a sum greater than the balance in the hands of the trustee. The coal company had no interest in the fund until all taxes were satisfied, nor any right to receive any portion except in trust for transmission to the collecting agents. It did have the right to the interest, which might accrue before withdrawal, on the balance remaining in the hands of the trustee, and this amounted to $3,217.52 at the time when this proceeding was instituted.</p>

It also provided that if the exact amounts due had not then been ascertained, and waivers of objection had been filed by the subsidiary companies with the federal authorities, the time of its operation should be extended. This condition occurred, and by agreement, in which the purchasers of the bonds, Moore, Leonard &amp; Lynch, were parties, setting forth that the unpaid taxes are greatly in excess of the balance in the trust fund, it was stipulated that the whole remaining sum be retained by the trustee for the purpose of liquidating, as far as possible, the amounts remaining unsatisfied.</p>

Judgment was entered against the coal company for $28,511.80, and, after the issuance of a preliminary sci. fa., the trustee was called upon to answer the interrogatories propounded. In so doing, the facts as already detailed were narrated.

Further, it was urged that the trust was passive, and that no one had any interest therein except defendant, since the rights established thereunder could not be enforced by the purchaser of the bonds, though they were bought with the understanding that the specific money would be set aside to protect against possible prior claims of the government.</p>

No beneficial interest was retained in the coal company, except as to interest accruing on balances, until the tax claims were satisfied. It could not secure the corpus except for the purpose of liquidating the taxes levied, and then only on certificates found by the trustee to be in compliance with the terms of the agreement, in which the purchaser of the bonds had joined by giving its approval, wherein it was provided, inter alia, that the funds should be used “for said purpose and not otherwise.” The money paid, excepting interest, could not be applied to general corporate purposes, but alone for the object specified, and in so doing the coal company acted in a trust capacity as agent for the depositary. The latter was obliged to make payment to the extent of the fund in its hands, when taxes became due, and this duty could, have been enforced by the purchaser of the bonds in order that his interests be protected against prior liens, and the funds were not subject to attachment by general creditors. It was bound to keep the money at interest, and invest the same “in obligations of the United States or any such other securities as may be designated by the company [trustee] and approved by your firm [the purchasers],” and a different disposition of that accruing and the principal was provided for.</p>

There, the fund was paid to the garnishee, as trustee, with the obligation to pay therefrom for materials and labor required in the construction of a street railway. Though not made clear by the case as reported, the record disclosed that the payments were to be made by the trustee on orders of Lawrence, the president of the contracting company, for work and material actually used, or in payment of drafts for needed supplies. What was said by Justice Fell, in part, at page 113, is pertinent here: “The fund attached was the price of bonds purchased of a contractor who was constructing an electric railway, and who had received them in part payment under the terms of his contract. The road was unfinished and the purchaser, who owned a number of bonds, was unwilling to buy more unless assured that the road would be completed. In order better to secure the investment, it was arranged between these parties that the price of the bonds should, be deposited with the garnishee in trust, and by him used to pay for materials and labor necessary for the completion of the road, as the work progressed. The money was so used. Neither at the time of the service of the attachment, nor at any time thereafter, could the contractor have withdrawn this fund. It was pledged for a specific purpose, and the purchaser of the bonds had a vested right as to its appropriation under the <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>agreement.
