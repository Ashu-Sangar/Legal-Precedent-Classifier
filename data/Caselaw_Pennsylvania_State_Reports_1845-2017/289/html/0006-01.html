    <p id="b32-5" data-blocks='[["BL_32.7",32,[259,835,1151,689]]]'>Defendant operates a railroad extending from Harrisburg to Reading and continuing through the latter city to Allentown and distant points. The tracks in the City of Reading are located at grade and the large volume of freight carried between Harrisburg and Allentown and points beyond these cities, causes excessive congestion and unduly delays traffic in passing through Reading, because of the necessity of such traffic to cross defendant’s main line tracks in that city by means of cross-over switches. There are also delays incident to a heavy grade immediately north of the city, requiring the splitting of freight trains or the use of additional motive power.</p>

At the widest part of the triangle, the greatest distance between the old and the proposed new tracks is approximately five miles. By this route, through traffic will avoid the city, the grade crossing of the main tracks, and eliminate the steep grade referred to above.</p>

Because the land is so held, plaintiff by its bill seeks to enjoin defendant from condemning that portion of its property included in the proposed right of way, alleging defendant is without legal right to appropriate plaintiff’s land for the purposes stated. The court below decided the proceeding to be within the powers conferred on defendant by the Act of March 17, 1869, P. L. 12, authorizing the straightening, widening and otherwise improving of lines of railroads and dismissed the bill. The court below found that “To provide additional tracks required to relieve the existing congested track-age and facilities of defendant’s said line of railroad in and through the City of Reading, by constructing them immediately contiguous to the existing line is impracticable, not only because of great cost in the way of damages to manufacturing and other improved properties and dwelling houses at present located along the line in the City of Reading, but also because such additional tracks, in such case, would be subject to the same heavy grades as the existing line and the present interference in the handling of traffic by reason of the necessity of crossing the company’s main line at grade <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>would in no way be obviated or lessened but actually increased.</p>

It is contended, however, that the power to straighten contemplates merely the construction of new tracks in close proximity to old ones, and only for the purpose of eliminating sharp curves, etc., and that to permit a deviation from the old line, for a distance of nearly five miles, is practically to construct a new line which was not contemplated by the Act of 1869.</p>

It was passed to enable railroads to make such changes in their roadbed as the increase of traffic and the growth of communities might reasonably require.

A mere widening of the existing roadbed through the City of Reading would not eliminate the .main objectionable features but on the contrary would increase the dangers incident to the grade crossing, and circumvent one of the purposes of the act, which is to better secure the safety of persons and property of those having occasion to cross defendant’s railroad: Bigler v.
