Defendant averred, however, that “it has [not] at any time maintained signs on the roof of said building for display purposes by its clients and customers, as provided for and contemplated under the terms of the lease”; that, “at the time of the execution of said lease [and also at the time of the sending out of a circular letter, to which we shall refer later on] said roof was not available for use of erecting and maintaining thereon any electrical sign or signs, in that said roof was so weak and defectively constructed......it could not carry or sustain the weight of an electrical sign such as contemplated and understood between plaintiff company and defendant company and provided for under the terms of said lease, and for which the space on said roof was leased to be used; and [that this condition] was......known and understood by plaintiff company.”</p>

On a rule for judgment, “an affidavit of defense is to be taken most strongly against the defendant, for it is to be presumed that he has made it as favorable to himself as his conscience would allow”: Feather v. Hustead, <a href="/pa/254/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="254 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="1025411" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0357-01">254 Pa. 357</a>, 361, and cases there cited.</p>

Plaintiff, in its brief, construes the above provisions as conferring on defendant “the right of entry......[and]______ .access to the interior of the building,” and there is no averment in the affidavit of defense that such right of entry, to strengthen the roof or for other purposes, was ever denied to defendant by plaintiff.</p>

Weber, <a href="/pa/71/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="71 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1031220" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0429-01">71 Pa. 429</a>, 432; Wood v.

Defendant contends, however, that, since a circular letter sent out by the Federal Factories Co. (not the plaintiff) and received by defendant along with other prospective lessees, contained a notice to the effect that space for a sign on the roof of the building was “avail<a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>able for immediate use,” this circumstance amounts to a warranty that the roof would support such electric signs as a lessee might see fit to place thereon, and takes the present case out of the rule of the authorities last cited; but we cannot so read the communication. In the first place, the circular was not issued by plaintiff company but by another corporation which, according to the affidavit of defense, “owns and controls all, or substantially all,” of the capital stock of the former. While there is no averment in the affidavit explaining what is meant by the phrase “substantially all of the capital stock,” or alleging that plaintiff authorized the issuance of the circular in question, we shall pass these possible shortcomings and treat the case as though plaintiff itself had sent out the circular; but, even so, we cannot put upon the part of this com.munication called to our attention by defendant the construction it would have us adopt. The part to which we refer reads in full as follows: “Space for sign on roof of Federal Factories warehouse (pictured above) is available for immediate use,” and right above these words appears a cut of the building. It will be noticed that the statement just quoted is to the effect that space on the roof “is available for immediate use,” and this certainly does not amount to a warranty that the roof will hold any sort or kind of an electric sign which a lessee might desire to erect on it. There is nothing in the circular to make inapplicable the usual rule that “the tenant takes the property subject to all existing defects which can be ascertained by inspection” (Levine v. McClenathan, <a href="/pa/246/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="246 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1006249" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0374-01">246 Pa. 374</a>, 376; Levin v.

Superior Ct. 133</a>, 138, Judge Kephart (then in the Superior Court, now Mr. Justice Kephart of this court) states the principle which applies to such a situation. The Spaulding Case holds that, in an action for rent, one who has lived in a property for upwards of a year, and paid rent therefor during that period, is not in a position to allege, as a defense to the payment of further rent, fraudulent representations concerning the condition of the property when he leased it. The opinion states: “He [the defendant] cannot occupy and enjoy the possession and pay the rent for a period of time and then set up as a defense to an action for rent......that he was induced to enter into the contract by false representations......; by paying the rent he was estopped from asserting the representation...... The mere complaint to the landlord as to the condition of the premises will not avail; [the tenant] must do some positive act in disaffirmance of his contract.” This latter requirement is not met by the averment in the present supplemental affidavit of defense that “in February and March, 1926, and prior thereto,” defendant company “offered to surrender to plaintiff company the said lease,” etc.; such an averment is entirely too vague as to the time and circumstances of the <em>offer </em>to avail against plaintiff’s rule for judgment. We may add, the argument now made by defendant, that it could not surrender the lease because of outstanding contracts with its clients for display signs, is also too indefinite to be given consideration; moreover, this last-mentioned point is. not sustained by <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>the averment of any facts in either the affidavit or supplemental affidavit of defense.</p>

Arrott, <a href="/pa/109/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="109 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="542327" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0473-01">109 Pa. 473</a>, relied on by defendant, does not control the present case; it is amply distinguished in Wood v. Carson, <a href="/pa/257/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="257 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1032441" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0522-01">257 Pa. 522</a>, 527, and what is said there applies here. The other cases cited by appellant need no special mention; suffice it to say, all of them are readily distinguishable from the case before us.</p>
