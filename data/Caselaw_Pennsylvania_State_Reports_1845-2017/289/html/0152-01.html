Plaintiff learned of defendant’s use of the trade-mark soon after the lat<a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>ter began to dispose of Ms flour in Altoona but took no steps to assert an infringement until August, 1925, when a formal complaint was made to defendant followed by tMs proceeding in September of that year.</p>

In Juan F. Portuondo Cigar Mfg. Co. v. Vincente Portuondo Cigar Mfg.

Rep. 2d Series 953, the appellee used a trademark consisting of a bird with wings outstretched, just leaving a twig, the body of the bird being red and its wings and tail black. In a circle surrounding the bird, said to represent a scarlet tanager were the words “Pride of the West — Indian Linón.” The appellant adopted as Ms trade-mark a bird perched on a twig with wings outstretched, carrying in its mouth a string from which was suspended a disk bearing the word “Tupelo.” In the <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>drawing the breast of this bird, said to represent a bluebird, was lined for red while the head, back, tail and wings were lined for blue. It was held that the resemblance was such as likely to cause confusion and to create mistakes in the minds of the public notwithstanding the contention of defendant that the two birds were readily distinguishable. The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in disposing of the case said: “Appellant suggests that these two birds are easily distinguishable. They might be by ornithologists, but the purchasing public includes comparatively few persons who have particular knowledge of birds. To the average person these goods would be bird goods, and would not be known as bluebird or tanager goods.” Commenting upon that case the court below here observed: “The resemblance was not so strong as it is in the instant case. The principle object, that of a dove, in its form as well as the spread of its wings makes an unusual figure. Placing the various samples which were offered in evidence side by side, the similarity is so marked that if they were separated the public could be readily confused, especially if they kept in mind the chief feature of the trade-mark, namely, a dove in flight, against a solid background.”</p>

In view of the chancellor’s findings and our own inspection and defendant’s heretofore quoted letter, it could not be said that customers for plaintiff’s flour might not be misled by defendant’s markings to purchase his. As was said in the Portuondo Case (<a href="/pa/222/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="222 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="959474" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0116-01">222 Pa. 116</a>, 132), “The general rule is that anything done by a rival in the same business by imitation or otherwise, designed or calculated to’ mislead the public in the belief that in buying the product offered by him for sale, they were buying the product of another’s manufacture, would be in fraud of that other’s rights, and would afford just ground for equitable interference.” This is the rule of law crystallized in the Act of June 20, 1901, P. L. 582, as amended, which provides that, “Whenever [a] person......filed......for......registry any...... trade-mark......it shall be unlawful and a violation of this act for any other person......to make any use ......of......any such likeness or imitation thereof as shall be calculated or liable to deceive.” See also Shaw v.

We think it can be fairly inferred from the testimony that for several years after plaintiff became acquainted with the fact of defendant’s use, the flour of each was being largely sold in different markets and that it was only in comparatively recent times, shortly before plaintiff first notified defendant of the infringement, that the sale of his product in the <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>Altoona market became of consequence to appellee. In suits for unfair competition or infringement it is well settled that mere laches in the sense of delay to bring suit does not constitute a defense. Such laches may bar an accounting for past profits, but will not .bar an injunction against a further continuance of the wrong: Hesseltine, The Law of Trade-Marks and Unfair Trade, page 282; Juan F.

Furthermore, plaintiff on August 4, 1925, registered his trade-mark under the Act of 1901 heretofore cited and almost immediately thereafter began this proceeding. He was the only one entitled to register as he had been the longest user; after registration it was “unlawful and a violation of this act” for defendant to use such a likeness or imitation of it as he was putting forth. There is a sound public policy in the statute promoting honesty and fair dealing and its provisions should be upheld: Bergner &amp; Engel Brewing Co. v.
