Therefore, it makes no difference whether this will was signed by Mary Brehony herself with the aid of her brother, or by William Brehony at her request, as long as the signature was adopted and legal proof is present: Hughes’s Est., <a href="/pa/286/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="286 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="1096525" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0466-01">286 Pa. 466</a>, 469 et seq.</p>
    <p id="b295-4" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[128,1869,1153,368]]]'>The remaining question, as to whether there was evidence sufficient in quantity and quality to sustain the verdict, needs but little attention. The record has been examined with great care, and we are satisfied the trial judge was well within the rules laid down by this court in setting aside the verdict: Tetlow’s Est., <a href="/pa/269/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="269 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1063497" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0486-01">269 Pa. 486</a>; Lawrence’s Est., <a href="/pa/286/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="286 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="1096515" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0058-01">286 Pa. 58</a>.</p>
    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[128,2249,1153,207]]]'>The will was a natural one; the property was given to her brother, her only close relative then living. The assignments have all been considered. They are overruled and the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>
