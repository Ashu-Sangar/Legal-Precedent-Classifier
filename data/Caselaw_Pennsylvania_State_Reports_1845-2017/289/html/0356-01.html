The consideration was $3,000, of which $500 was paid in cash and the balance, for which this suit was brought, was payable on delivery of a proper deed. The agreement was subject to the approval of the orphans’ court, so far as related to the interest of any minor therein. It was necessary to sell this land for the payment of debts of Mrs. Myers’ estate; for which purpose the orphans’ court on March 3, 1924, after due notice, ordered the administrator, who was also one of the heirs, to consummate the sale and make deed to the defendant as provided in the agreement; it being a private sale of real estate for payment of debts. In May, 1924, a duly executed deed, tendered the defendant, was refused, and, in June following, this action of assumpsit was brought for the balance of the purchase-money, being in the nature of a bill for specific performance : Keily v. Saunders, <a href="/pa/236/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="236 Pa. 593" data-case-ids="986655" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0593-01">236 Pa. 593</a>. Plaintiffs’ statement was filed on the day the writ issued, but, at defendant’s request, an extension of time was granted him, and the affidavit of defense was not filed for approximately seven months. The case came on for trial in March, 1925, and resulted in a verdict for plaintiff. Defendant moved for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v. The former was granted and the refusal of the latter formed the basis of an appeal by defendant to this court, where the action of the trial court was affirmed. See Pringle et al. v. Smith, <a href="/pa/286/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="286 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="1096496" data-case-paths="/pa/286/0152-01">286 Pa. 152</a>. The reason for the new trial was plaintiffs’ failure to have a guardian appointed <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>to represent a minor granddaughter of Mrs. Myers. This omission was remedied by the appointment of a guardian ad litem, who joined in a new deed tendered defendant in October, 1925, which was also refused. The case again cgme to trial in the following November and resulted in a verdict for plaintiffs for the full amount of unpaid purchase-money and interest from the tender of the last deed. Judgment having been entered thereon, defendant brought this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b383-5" data-blocks='[["BL_383.4",383,[150,845,1150,367]]]'>None of the assignments of error can be sustained. The complaint of delay is without merit; much of it was caused by defendant’s own default. See Morgan v.

    <p id="b383-6" data-blocks='[["BL_383.5",383,[147,1224,1154,735]]]'>Negotiations for the sale were conducted on behalf of plaintiffs by the administrator of the Myers estate, who was also an heir, and defendant contends he made false statements to the effect that there was a public alley at the rear of the lot in question, but no reference thereto appears in the written agreement, and the oral evidence on that question was conflicting. The trial judge instructed the jury, that if they found such false statements were made and relied upon by defendant, to render a verdict in his favor. Hence, the verdict for plaintiffs, approved by the trial court, is conclusive of that question and the competency or sufficiency of the oral evidence to change the written agreement need not be considered.</p>

Some of the language complained of might well have been omitted; it consisted mainly of counsel’s reference to certain opposing testimony as an invention or a cock and bull story and was not such as to necessitate the withdrawal of a juror, especially when the trial court told the jury to disregard it.</p>
