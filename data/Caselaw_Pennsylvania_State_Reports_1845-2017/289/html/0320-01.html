After dark on the evening of that day, which was clear, without mist, rain or snow, the decedent approached the four-track railroad of the defendant in his automobile truck, ordinarily used in the delivery of milk. There was a slight downward grade to the crossing with which he was familiar. At ten feet from the first rail, he could observe for 583 feet in the direction from which the train approached; when 23 feet away, 474 feet, and farther back for a much longer distance, due to the rising ground. When the third track was reached, the car was struck by a work train of the defendant, coming from the south, having a caboose in front, followed by an engine with its tender attached. The deceased was carried about 300 feet, and the truck for 900 feet until the train came to a standstill. Oil from the motor car caused the rails to be slippery, and this delayed the stopping.</p>

A compulsory nonsuit was denied at the conclusion of the trial, as were binding instructions, and the questions of fact involved submitted to the jury, which rendered a verdict for the plaintiff. On motion, judgment n. o. v. was entered for the defendant on the ground that no negligence was proven, and, further, because of the contributory negligence of the decedent. From this ruling an appeal has been taken. Of course, in our consideration of the case, the competent testimony of plaintiff must be regarded as disclosing the true version of what took place. She is likewise entitled to the benefit of all proper inferences to be drawn therefrom. The burden was on the claimant to establish negligence of the defendant by proof of facts which did not in themselves show the husband guilty of contributory negligence.</p>

Unfortunately for plaintiff no evidence was produced showing this condition existed, though certain witnesses, who arrived on the scene after the accident, said they saw none. On the other hand, there was positive evidence that the glare of the electric light of the engine was observable, since it projected its rays beyond the. side of the front car (a factor to be considered: Hess v. R. R., supra), and three lighted lanterns were on the platform of the caboose. These were knocked off, two broken and one extinguished as a result of the impact <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>with the auto.

This was a crossing in the open country, and the cars passing along the tracks had the right of way over those driving on the intersecting public highway, and no inference of negligence is to be drawn from the rapid movement of the railroad train. This was held to be the proper rule where the speed shown was 30 (Rapp v. R. R., <a href="/pa/269/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="269 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1063470" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0266-01">269 Pa. 266</a>) or even 60 miles an hour: Kelly <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>v.

The positive evidence in this case fixed the rate at from 20 to 25 miles. One witness for plaintiff, Leslie, an engineer retired from service many years before, and not acquainted with the type of engine used, was called by the claimant to show a greater speed based on the fact that the train moved about 900 feet before stopping. No proper groundwork for an expert opinion was laid, which could be considered trustworthy, in view of his lack of knowledge of the conditions under which the worktrain was operated, and his estimate of speed is valueless. He stated that his judgment was predicated on the assumption that the rails were dry and clean, but the only evidence in the case shows some oil to have dripped from the auto to the track. Under such circumstances, the witness said he could express no opinion. We are convinced that no negligence of the defendant was proven in any of the matters suggested, and the judgment n. o. v. was therefore properly entered.</p>

In view of the finding that no lack of due care was established, we will make but brief reference to the second reason, though convinced that on this ground also the plaintiff cannot recover. Grimes was killed, and there arose the presumption that he used due care and caution to protect himself when he drove upon the tracks, and that he stopped at a proper place before committing himself to the crossing, and not only looked but listened. Though this presumption is rebuttable, yet it is still a question for the jury to determine this fact, though the evidence to the contrary be uncontradicted, where dependent solely on the oral testimony of witnesses, for it is essential that their credibility be passed upon: Schmidt v.
