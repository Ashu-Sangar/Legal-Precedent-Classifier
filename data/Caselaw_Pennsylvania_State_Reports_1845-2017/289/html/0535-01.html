To fill in the depression and make the street level throughout, appellants built along appellee’s lot 25 a cribbing wall sixty-five feet in length, and varying from two and one half to five and one half feet in height.

As dominant tenants they have the unrestricted right of passage, but own no part of the soil. As servient tenants they must bear the burden thus imposed, but have title to the soil covered by the way as well as to their adjoining lot;, they may protect <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>both from unlawful acts inflicted through the dominant tenancy of passage in others. The easement of passage created by dedication must be reasonably interpreted; it includes the right to do such reasonable acts as may make the way passable, and gives to the owners the privilege of leveling with the soil of a way as long as no damage is done to adjoining owners.</p>

Appellee’s land was entered, a rough wall of old ties was erected, which rises about five feet, with the surface level of the street made eight feet higher than the northern line of plaintiff’s property, the whole cutting off appellee^ access to his property. Even a municipality could not make such change of grade without compensating the lot owner. If this action is sustained under a contract arising from a mere conveyance to the center line of an unopened street, it would be a most unusual construction, and appellee would receive no compensation for the dámages. If appellants’ contention were correct, appellee could lower the grade of this street to the level <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>of Ms northern property line, leaving appellant’s property on an embankment ten to twelve feet high. Sneh right could not be sustained under any theory of making a private way reasonably passable.</p>

They had the right to make reasonable changes in the surface of the highway which did not appreciably damage an adjoining lot owner, but they do not have the right to create conditions in the highway which damage such lot owner’s property or which takes from it the right of ingress or egress.</p>
