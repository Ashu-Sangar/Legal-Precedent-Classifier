The car was to be manufactured by the company for its Pittsburgh distributing agency, that agency agreeing to deliver through Ward to appellee. The purchase price was paid by appellee to Ward, who, in turn, sent it to the distributing company in Pittsburgh and from thence to the manufacturing company. These transactions occurred in June, July and August of 1925. The car was put into a deliverable state early in September; in the latter part of August, the Pittsburgh company issued to Ward an order directing the manufacturing company to deliver the car to him. He took the order to the Finance Company, this appellant, and, with no other security, obtained a loan, at the same time executing a bill of sale to the Finance Company, and receiving in return a bailment lease of the car. Ward, who retained the order, delivered it to the company, received the car, and turned it over to appellee at the factory; the latter brought it into this State. The transaction, so far as it related to appellee, was begun and consummated in the State of Indiana. Default having been made in the bailment lease, appellant seized the ear by writ of replevin, and appellee, unable to give bond, went to trial and recovered a verdict for the value of the car.</p>

The fact that it afterwards became the bailor, as far as this appellee was concerned, was immaterial.
