In construing a will the courts should as far as possible ascertain testator’s intention as expressed by him rather than depend upon a purely technical construction; but both may be <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>considered in searching for the real intent of testator, which, when discovered, must prevail; here the results of both coincide.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[267,441,1152,451]]]'>2. Where a testator devises a farm to his wife for life, gives legacies to several of his children, then devises the farm after the death of his wife to two named sons “and to their heirs” and if both sons should die “without heirs” then the proceeds of the land over to legatees mentioned, but if either son “should die without heirs” then to the survivor “and his heirs,” and one of the two sons dies in the lifetime of testator intestate and without issue, and the survivor dies before his mother, held that a fee vested in the survivor upon the death of testator, by the intention appearing from the whole will and under the rule in Shelley’s Case.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b498-5" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[269,900,1149,174]]]'>3. In such ease, the children of the survivor cannot successfully claim that their father took only a life estate, and that, after the death'of testator’s widow, they took as purchasers or devisees by implication.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b498-6" data-blocks='[["BL_498.6",498,[268,1084,1151,352]]]'>4. A construction of a particular clause in the will which would in effect give a fee simple absolute to the grandchildren of testator, who at most are only mentioned as devisees by implication, and reduce the gift to his two favorite sons, or the survivor of them, to a life estate, will not be adopted in the face of a first expressed intent to give such sons a fee simple estate when another reasonable construction consistent with such dominant intent presents itself.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b498-7" data-blocks='[["BL_498.7",498,[269,1452,1149,121]]]'>5. The word “heirs,” when used in a will, cannot ordinarily be construed as “children” or as any other word of purchase, but must be read as a word of limitation.</p>

Where persons named to take if the first devisees should die without heirs, are themselves among the ordinary heirs of such devisees, it will be held that the heirs intended by testator are heirs of the body and not heirs generally.</p>

The clause in the present will which provides for the disposition of testator’s property upon the death of both sons without issue is not to be read into and does not control the subsequent survivorship clause.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b498-11" data-blocks='[["BL_498.11",498,[268,2094,1151,174]]]'>9. The fact that the first mentioned clause provides for the sale of the land and the division of the proceeds indicates that testator was providing in that particular clause only for what should happen after his own death.</p>

When part of a testamentary clause manifestly provides only for what is to happen after testator’s death, it must be assumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the whole <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>clause is to apply only at that time, and hence it cannot properly be construed as meaning to provide for the death of a devisee during the lifetime of testator, but this does not necessarily affect the construction of a subsequent clause containing no such internal evidence of intent.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b499-5" data-blocks='[["BL_499.4",499,[130,593,1154,396]]]'>11. In this case, held that the clause in question is to be subordinated to the survivorship clause following and that this can be done by so construing the will that the former clause, concerning the death of both sons, shall be put into effect only if both of them survive their father, and then die without issue; further, that the death of one of the sons in the lifetime of testator eliminated the applicability of the clause last mentioned, and removed it from the will, so far as its effect on other parts thereof is concerned.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b499-6" data-blocks='[["BL_499.5",499,[131,1005,1149,127]]]'>12. Even if the clause in question were to be considered as still operative in the will, the same conclusion would be reached on a proper technical construction of the instrument.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b499-7" data-blocks='[["BL_499.6",499,[129,1143,1152,404]]]'>13. Where a devisee is given only a life estate with a provision that, on his death at a definite time without children, or heirs, or issue, the property is to go to others, there is an implied remainder in any children, heirs or issue whom the life tenant may leave surviving him; but where, as in the present case, the will gives a fee in the first instance, followed by a devise over after a definite failure of children, heirs or issue, there is no implied gift whatsoever to any children, heirs or issue who survive the time fixed for the contingency to occur.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b499-8" data-blocks='[["BL_499.7",499,[128,1556,1151,262]]]'>14. Under such circumstances, the estate in the first taker is a fee simple, subject to go over by executory devise, on the happening of the designated contingency; the mention of children, heirs or issue of the first taker, is merely part of the description of the contingency, and if it does not take place, the title of the first taker is absolute and indefeasible.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b499-9" data-blocks='[["BL_499.8",499,[128,1833,1153,172]]]'>15. If an indefinitely failure of issue was contemplated, the first taker would have a fee tail, enlarged by the Act of 1855 into fee simple absolute and the gift over would be void under the rule against perpetuities.</p>

This impression would be based, first, on the use and reiterated use of the technical word “heirs,” which, under the rule in Shelley’s Case, when coupled with a grant or devise, is understood not as giving an interest to the actual heirs of the grantee or devisee, but to mark the quantity of the estate conferred on the ancestor and to denote a fee simple absolute, or, if “heirs” is read in the sense of heirs of the body, a fee tail general, which, according to the law of Pennsylvania, becomes a fee simple absolute. The impression that testator intended to give an absolute estate, rather than a mere interest for life, to his two sons or to the one of them who might survive him and take under the will, would be reénforecd by the fact that, in providing for his wife, testator said in so many words that he gave her a life estate, thus showing he knew how to mark out such an interest when he intended it, whereas in providing for those who were to take subject to his wife’s estate, he used no such language. Finally, the fact that the sustaining of ^plaintiffs’ contention would lead to a construction which would give a fee simple absolute to the grandchildren of testator, who, at most, are only mentioned as devisees by implication, and reduce the gift to his two favorite sons, or to the survivor of them, to a life estate, tells against the probability of its correctness. The impression referred to at the head of this paragraph is borne out by a scrutinizing consideration of the will, its structure, phraseology and evident purposes; in addition, the proper technical construction of the instrument demonstrates that John died possessed of a fee simple estate. All of which we shall show in due course, though we find ourselves unable either to follow precisely the reasoning of defendant or to work out the case exactly along the lines pursued by the learned court below.</p>

The strong presumption arising from the use of. technical words of limitation is not easily overcome; it may be rebutted, but it can be done by nothing short of affirmative evidence of a contrary intent, so clear as to leave no reasonable doubt.” The will continues, however, “If both John Marshall and Charles William should die without heirs” the farm is to be sold and the proceeds are to go to testator’s other children. By the expression “without heirs,” testator must have meant “heirs of the body,” for the persons named by him to take as substituted devisees in default of heirs of the two sons were (in the absence of issue of such sons) themselves among the ordinary heirs of John and Charles, so, obviously, he could not have intended that class of heirs by the expression in question: Mayer v. Walker, <a href="/pa/214/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="214 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="946027" data-case-paths="/pa/214/0440-01">214 Pa. 440</a>, 443; Church v.

If we read the word “heirs” as “heirs of the body,” or “issue,” and this course must be pursued, the will, to the point thus far considered, creates an estate tail general, which, under our law, is enlarged into a fee simple (Act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 368), unless the instrument contains internal evidence that, by the expression “die without heirs,” testator did not contemplate an indefinite failure of issue. As to this, the fact that the gift over on failure of heirs is to named persons in being, indicates that, when writing the particular part of item 9 with which we are now dealing, testator had in mind a definite, rather than an indefinite, failure of issue (Mebus’s Est., <a href="/pa/273/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="273 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1070827" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0505-01">273 Pa. 505</a>, 516-17); that is, by the par<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>ticular clause in hand, testator intended to provide, not for both sons being dead without issue at any time in the future, but for the event of both being dead without issue living at a definite or fixed time, — either at the date of testator’s death, at the devisee’s own death, or at the death of the widow of testator, to whom he had devised a life estate. But, whatever the clause providing for the event of the death of both sons without heirs, or issue, may mean, it is not the one to be applied on the facts in this case; for, though Charles died without issue, during the life of testator, John, who survived him, died after testator, leaving issue. Moreover, as shall be shown later on, the clause we have been discussing does not necessarily affect the interpretation of the subsequent clause, which governs here. The fact that, when writing the former clause, testator had in mind a definite failure of issue, does not help to show what period he intended this particular part of the will to operate in, whether before or after his own demise, or under what circumstances it was to be inoperative, or what estate he intended should pass under the clause that follows it, and which provides that, on the death of one son without heirs, the farm shall go to the survivor and his heirs. All of these points will be considered as we proceed.</p>

It seems advisable, therefore, to look further, in an effort to see whether this survivorship clause alone governs the facts in the present case, or whether, under the circumstances before us, it is affected by the other clause above-mentioned, <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>and, if so, to what extent; and, generally, to see what relation these two clauses bear to one another.</p>

In the present case, for instance, had testator meant the provisions, “If both John...... and Charles......should die without heirs, then it is my will that the......farm shall be sold and the proceeds thereof be equally divided amongst the above-mentioned legatees,” to apply in the event of only one of these sons outliving him, the natural order would have been to place this provision after, instead of before, the one which immediately follows it, viz., “If either John...... or Charles......should die without heirs then it is my will that the......farm shall be held and enjoyed by the survivor and his heirs.” This transposition of clauses would make the will read, “If John or Charles die without heirs the survivor to take, but if both die without heirs then over to third parties.” In other words, had testator intended, if only one of his two favored sons outlived him, that both of the above provisions should take effect, the first being carried over into the second, and giving the fee to the children of the survivor of his two sons (as plaintiffs would have us construe this will), if such was his intention, it seems that he would have stated his dispositions as follows: to his wife for life, at her death, to John and Charles, at the decease of either of them without heirs, to the survivor, and at the decease of such survivor without heirs, then over, — instead of leaving the last, and since it, if applicable, would carry the fee, the most important, disposition to be inferred from the prior clause concerning the dying of both sons without heirs. The fact that he did not write his will in the order suggested, but, on the contrary, put the provision concerning the death of both sons without heirs before the survivorship clause, being in a will, indicates that the first of these dispositions was intended <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>to be subordinate to tbe last of them, and that tbe former did not necessarily, under any and all circumstances, control or add anything to the latter.

Such situations are often met by the simple expedient of holding that the clause which, under the conditions confronting the court, seems to defeat a main purpose of the will, was intended to apply only in event of the devisees named therein dying before testator (Jarman on Wills (6th Eng. ed. 1910), vol. 1, p. 573; Clayton v. Lowe, 5 B. &amp; Ald. 636, 106 English Rep. 1323-4-5) ; but that course cannot be pursued in this instance, for, keeping in mind testator’s scheme of distribution, as shown by item 9 of his will, no reason suggests itself why he should desire that part of the item which provides for the devise over to third parties after the death of his two sons to have any application before his own decease. We say this because those indicated by the clause in hand to take on the death of both sons without issue, were in fact the same persons who at law would be entitled to take the farm in controversy (after the life estate therein given to the widow of testator) had he made no further mention of this property in his will, there being no residuary provision in that instrument. This indicates that the particular direction under immediate discussion was not intended to apply before the death of testator; but there is present in the will a stronger indication to that effect, because the clause in question contains a direction to sell the farm and divide the proceeds, in the event of the dying of both sons without issue; this direction, of course, could be effective only after testator’s own death, and, hence, it is reason<a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>able to conclude that the whole clause refers to that time. That is to say, when it is manifest from part of a clause, such as the one before us, that testator was providing only for what should happen after his own death, in the absence of evidence to the contrary it is to be assumed that he intended all parts of the clause to apply thus and thus only. Therefore, it may be seen that, on the state of facts which confronts us, the subordination of the clause in question cannot be accomplished by relating it to a time prior to the death of testator. A way in which this can justifiably be accomplished, however, is to construe the will so that the provision concerning the death of both sons shall be put into effect only if both of them survive their father, and then die without issue, which most likely was testator’s intention.</p>

In other words, looking at the will, for the moment, not in a technical or purely legal way, but simply from the standpoint of testator’s probable desires as expressed therein, it is hardly believable that, after in plain words first giving John and Charles a fee, and subsequently in equally plain words conferring that character of estate on the survivor of the two sons, — John,—he, nevertheless, intended to say, by a clause sandwiched in between these two provisions, that John, who appears as one of his first cares, was to get a less estate than the latter’s children, who, for all that this record shows, may have been born after the death <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>of testator and were not even known to Mm; yet such an assumption would seem to follow if the will were construed as expressing a plan of disposition whereby an estate taken by a survivor of the two sons at the death of testator, was intended to remain subject to the clause dealing with the dying of both sons without issue, even though, as a matter of fact, when the will took effect, there were no “both sons,” and the one who survived had issue. Since, as hereinbefore shown, taking the clause in question as a whole, it is plain beyond doubt that it was intended to apply only after the death of testator, it is but fair to assume that, when he therein provided for the dying of both John and Charles, he contemplated that they both would outlive him; and, hence, that the clause was to have no application unless this should come to pass. Again, since this part of the will expressly provides for both sons dying without issue and that event did not happen, the clause fails of application on that score. In short, the clause was to apply only in special circumstances that did not eventuate up to the limit of time which, on any theory, can be allowed for that purpose,- — -the death of testator’s widow, — and it has no control in determining the intent of testator as to the disposition of his property under another state of facts.</p>

The possibility of such a state of affairs disappeared, however, with the death of <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>Charles in the lifetime of his father; that event eliminated the applicability of this particular provision, and, if our premise is correct, removed the provision from the will, so far as its effect on other parts thereof is concerned.

This being a survivorship clause, the phrase “die without heirs” may be construed to cover á death in the life time of testator; for, differing from the other clause with which we have been dealing, it contains no evidence of a contrary intention; and moreover, a clause which provides for survivorship as between devisees, or legatees, is as a general rule referred to the happening of that event in the lifetime of testator: Johnson v.

Therefore, whether we look at the will from the point of testator’s intentions or only technically, when the clause in hand is read as an independent provision and the fact that Charles died without issue is considered, we find John, the survivor, holding the fee, with nothing either said or implied as to what should happen in the event of his death; so, it follows, he had an absolute estate which he could will to his wife, as contended by appellees, and not a life estate, with an implied remainder in fee to his children, as contended by appellants.</p>

The other undivided half, which had been given, first, to Charles, with a provision that it should go to “the survivor” of the two brothers if one should die without “heirs,” was also vested in John, because Charles was dead without “heirs” when the will became effective; therefore the gift to him had lapsed, and there was nothing to prevent the ulterior gift to the survivor from taking effect.

Rep. 1306, 1308 (a case in which words of devise denoting a fee were followed by a provision that, if the devisee should die leaving “no child or children or lawful issue” at the time of her death, then over to another and his heirs), said: “It has been argued in this case that it was manifestly the testator’s intention that the children and grandchildren of S. Saunders [the first taker] should be benefited; but, however that may be, the question is whether the testator intended that the children and grandchildren should be benefited by this will or by some disposition to be made by S. Saunders. If she had any children living at the time of her death, the estate being given to her in fee, she would have abundant power to provide for both children and grandchildren. Nothing, however, is given to them by this will; they are merely named in the description of the contingency on which the estate is to go over,” by way of ex-ecutory devise.</p>

This is obviously so, for, otherwise, the estate of the first taker would not be, as there stated, a fee followed by an executory devise, but a life estate followed by alternative contingent remainders, or, as is sometimes said, a contingent remainder with a double aspect, i. e., either to the surviving children, etc., or to those named to take in default of issue, etc.</p>
