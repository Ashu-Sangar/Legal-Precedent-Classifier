He made frequent trips over appellant’s railroad prior to the time of the accident, passing a coal.tipple built over the tracks which was supported by upright beams, the place where the injury occurred. His duties required him to fire the engine and at times, when not so engaged, to look for trains ahead. He was so engaged on this night in response to a signal from the engineer. He had a clear view of the track through the window in front of him. Instead of making his observation in this manner, he put his knee on the engine seat, his arm on the window, and leaned out to look ahead. He saw an object that struck him. It was one of the supports of the coal tipple used in connection with the railroad and the coal operation. While it was dark, a brilliant electric headlight immediately in front of the engine was in proper working order, lighting the way for some distance, and appellee knew where the train was prior to the happening of the accident. He denied that he knew of the presence of the tipple. The <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>train was travelling at a speed of twelve miles an hour. It approached the tipple from the south, at which point there was a clearance of eighteen inches between the upright and the cab.</p>

In that case a brakeman employed by defendants was killed by colliding with a cattle chute located near a siding. The court said: “This case presents a question, the importance of which extends far beyond the present parties and the judgment to be entered herein. It is whether the location of the permanent structure along a. line of railroad necessary to accommodate its business is to be determined by the railroad company or by a petit jury. If by the former, they may be located with reference to the convenient and economical use of the railroad and the accommodation of its traffic. If by the latter, these considerations will be lost sight of, and the proper location will be a shifting one to be settled by each successive jury <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>in accordance with its own notions and the peculiar features of the case on trial. One jury may hold a given location to be safe and proper.

The fact that the low joint may have béen there and the engine might have rocked at another time does not prove what happened to this particular engine on that occasion.
