    <blockquote id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[254,997,1151,1395]],["BL_457.1",457,[126,358,1152,305]]]'>“Defendant cites cases based upon Smith v. Pringle, <a href="/pa/100/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="100 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="498428" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0275-01">100 Pa. 275</a>, to the effect that a confession of judgment in a lease for a term certain has reference to the rent for that particular term only; and does not authorize the entry of judgment for rent accruing after the expiration of the term certain where the tenant has held over. But that authority, and those that follow it, clearly apply only to cases where the term of the lease definitely expires, and the tenant holds over, not in accordance with any provision of the lease, but under a new implied agreement resulting from such holding over. In the present case, the lease itself provides that, unless either party gives three months’ written notice, the lease is to ‘continue’ upon the same terms and conditions as therein contained for a further period of one year. In other words, the lease provides not for a definite fixed term of six years, but for a longer term, which is to continue until one of the parties takes affirmative action and determines the lease by giving the prescribed notice to that effect. The lease further provides that any attorney may appear for lessee ‘in any and all actions to be brought for any arrears of rent,’ and that in said actions any attorney is authorized to confess judgment for all arrears of rent ‘which may at any time fall due or become due under this lease.’ Thus it is seen that not only is the term of the lease a ‘continuing’ one, but that the power <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>to enter judgment is expressly given in the case of rent falling due at any time under the lease. This is quite different from the case of a lease which has ended and where it is attempted to enter judgment on a tenancy which results from a holding over and not under the lease itself.”</blockquote>
