In' 1918, defendant drove a tunnel through rock some eight hundred and fifty feet on its own land to reach another body of coal, and reaching a space of broken rock about twenty feet from plaintiff’s line. The tunnel was driven on a slightly ascending grade, while a ditch within and along the side of the tunnel was constructed on a slightly descending grade, ending lower than where it began. This caused, and was intended to cause, the surplus water from defendant’s open mine, as well as that collected along the tunnel, to flow forward and be discharged among the broken rocks. This saved defendant the expense of pumping the water to the surface, which theretofore had been, and practically could be, done. The water so discharged, however, flowed upon and into plaintiff’s mine, causing great damage and expense. To restrain this flow of water upon its premises, plaintiff, soon after the tunnel was finished, filed this bill in equity, to which a responsive answer and replication were filed and testimony taken. Because of unforeseen delays, including the death of the chancellor, and of one of defendant’s solicitors, a final decree, granting plaintiff the relief prayed for, was entered ap<a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>proximately six years after the bill was filed; therefrom defendant brought this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b519-3" data-blocks='[["BL_519.4",519,[133,455,1158,1778]]]'>The facts found, based on ample proof, support the decree and the record is free from error. About 1872, the mining operations of plaintiff’s predecessor extended over the line and into defendant’s land, leaving an open space, later filled by broken rock as the result of a cave-in, where defendant discharges the water here complained of. Appellant urges that by reason of such alleged trespass plaintiff does not come into court with clean hands and cannot maintain this bill. In Locust Mountain Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. Garrell et al., <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Phila.%20247" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="9 Phila. 247">9 Phila. 247</a>, Mr. Justice Agnew holds that such trespass by the lower owner did not justify the other’s act in turning the water into the former’s mine and enjoined him from so doing. No appeal from that decision was taken and so far as we are aware it has never been departed from. In the early history of anthracite coal mining, boundary lines were not as definitely ascertained as in more recent years and the so-called trespass in the instant case may have been unintentional and consented to or compensated for. We cannot assume it was such as to deprive plaintiff of redress for the wilful act of defendant committed fifty years later. The rule applicable to this feature of the case is well stated by the learned chancellor as follows: “It is the law that if his neighbor has trespassed upon his property by mining over the line, it is [still] the duty of defendant to conduct its own mining operations in the usual and proper manner, and not to take advantage of his neighbor’s trespass by diverting water upon the complainant which would not otherwise have flowed there.” The injury here complained of did not result from the plaintiff’s original act of taking out the coal; had it done so, it would have been damnum absque injuria.</p>
    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[133,2245,1151,145]],["BL_520.1",520,[258,352,1152,1056]]]'>The bill as first filed complained of the water being discharged in plaintiff’s mine by means of a tunnel, but made no mention of the ditch therein. After the evi<a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>dence was all taken and submitted to the chancellor, but prior to his decision, he suggested, apparently out of abundant caution, that the bill be so amended as to specifically mention the ditch. This was done in due course and upon notice to defendant, who filed an answer thereto, but, although given an opportunity, offered no additional testimony. By leave of court, granted six months after final decree, defendant took an exception nunc pro tunc to allowance of the amendment, and now urges that it was filed too late. The question of such amendment is for the reasonable discretion of the trial court (Berlin Smokeless C. <em>&amp; </em>C. Co. v. Rohm, <a href="/pa/272/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="272 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1068327" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0024-01">272 Pa. 24</a>); but whether properly exercised here we need not stop to consider, for the original bill was sufficient and the amendment made no material change. It was the same water running through the same tunnel, discharged in the same way, and describing the ditch therein was a mere matter of detail. Plaintiff was entitled to relief from the water which came into its mine through the tunnel, whether in a ditch therein or not.</p>

For this unique proposition the case of Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Sanderson, <a href="/pa/113/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="113 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="457611" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0126-01">113 Pa. 126</a>, is cited. That case, however, was as to the pollution of a stream and not changing the natural course of surface water. Moreover, it was between the rights of a coal mining company, supplying a prime necessity to the public, and a private landowner; whereas, the instant case is between coal mining companies, who stand on an equal footing, each supplying coal to the public. In the very recent case of Penna. R. R. et al. v. Sagamore Coal Co. et al., <a href="/pa/281/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="281 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="1087068" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0233-01">281 Pa. 233</a>, this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Schaffer, <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>denies the right of a mining company to pollute a stream used as a water supply by the public, or by a public service corporation.</p>
