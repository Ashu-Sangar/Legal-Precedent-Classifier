Those convictions followed from the events of April 1, 1988. On that date appellant was scheduled to work with Ms. Dorner and Ms. Killoran at SJS Archeological Services at 10 Woodmont Road in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. Anne Jensen and Glenn Sheehan (husband and wife), who resided at 3 Woodmont Road, a few doors away from their business address, owned SJS. At approximately 10:00 a.m. Ms. Jensen, who was pregnant at the time, walked into the office and encountered appellant coming down the steps from the second floor. Appellant passed her on the stairs then grabbed her from behind, held a knife to her chest and forced her up the stairs to the second floor office. Ms. Jensen observed that the office was in disarray with blood and water on the floor.</p>

Ms. Jensen warned Ms. Killoran to run away and get help because appellant had a knife. As Ms. Killoran began to run appellant stabbed Ms. Jensen in the back several times, threw her down and pursued Ms. Killoran. In need of assistance Ms. Jensen managed to exit the building whereupon she observed appellant stabbing Ms. Killoran whom was lying on the ground in a fetal position. Ms. Jensen fled in another direction. The first two people she approached fled without coming to her aid. Ms. Jensen ultimately rolled down a hill to avoid appellant and was found on the roadway. Ms. Jensen was taken to the hospital and treated; she and her fetus survived.</p>

Appellant stabbed Mr. Sheehan several times before Mr. Sheehan could break free. As Mr. Sheehan ran for help he saw appellant bend over Ms. Killoran saying, “I’ve got to get the keys”. When the police arrived the body of Ms. Dorner was found in the second floor office tied to a chair, she had been sexually assaulted and stabbed to death. Ms. Killoran died from her wounds; Mr. Sheehan survived the assault.</p>

    <p id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.4",668,[262,564,1161,1109]]]'>At the suppression hearing held on November 14, 1988 appellant moved to suppress the statements made during the New York interrogation on the basis that the Commonwealth failed to establish that appellant understood the “rights” card he allegedly read and signed prior to making the incriminating statements. At that hearing appellant asserted that there was no proof he understood his rights because of the manner in which he was advised. Appellant argued that the Commonwealth proved only that he “looked” at the card handed to him, not that he actually read the card and comprehended the information printed thereon. (N.T. 11/14/88 pp. 83-86). In response, the Commonwealth established that the detectives knew appellant was a high school graduate and that they asked him if he could read before handing him the card. After appellant reviewed both sides of the card the detective asked him if he understood the card. Appellant replied affirmatively and signed the card, acknowledging his understanding of the rights contained therein. (N.T. 11/14/88 pp. 27-34). The trial court denied suppression finding the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>were met and the statements were made voluntarily. (N.T. 11/14/88 p. 97).</p>

Sirno, </em><a href="/ad2d/151/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="151 A.D.2d 621" data-case-ids="3592522" data-case-paths="/ad2d/151/0621-01">151 A.D.2d 621</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=542%20N.Y.S.2d%20368" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="542 N.Y.S.2d 368">542 N.Y.S.2d 368</a> (1989) as support for this argument. In <em>Sirno </em>the defendant was verbally given his rights in English, and at his request, was supplied a rights card in Spanish. The issue before the court was whether the Spanish card was sufficient as it did not contain the question “do you understand?” The court found that the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>were met under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Sirno, </em><a href="/citations/?q=542%20N.Y.S.2d%20368" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="542 N.Y.S.2d 368">542 N.Y.S.2d at 370</a>. Appellant’s reliance on <em>Sirno </em>is <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>misplaced as that case does not explicitly require that <em>Miranda </em>warnings be given verbally, nor does it condemn the process of handing a “rights” card to the accused to read and sign, acknowledging thereby that the card was read and the rights contained therein understood.</p>

On direct examination Mr. Sheehan had testified that appellant acted and spoke in a normal rational way during the five months of employment preceding the events of April 1,1988. Testimony that appellant acted in a normal rational manner for several months preceding the assaults and murders would be detrimental to the defense. On cross-examination trial counsel attempted to attack Mr. Sheehan’s credibility by showing the jury that the witness had a financial motive for offering testimony that appellant acted and spoke in a normal rational manner for the months preceding the attack. Mr. Sheehan and his wife had filed a lawsuit, seeking money damages from the Salvation Army shortly after the assault by appellant. Mr. Sheehan had originally hired appellant through a program of the Salvation Army. Trial counsel attempted to elicit from the witness that the lawsuit was motivated by the Salvation Army’s failure to reveal appellant’s psychological background to Sheehan and his wife. Specifical<a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>ly, Mr. Sheehan was asked if he knew appellant was going to a psychologist when he hired him.

The Commonwealth argued that the lawsuit against the Salvation Army had nothing to do with appellant’s psychological history, but rather was prompted by the discovery that the Salvation Army knew appellant had a record for violent criminal conduct, information they withheld from Sheehan and his wife. Trial counsel argued that the questions were designed to cast suspicion on Mr. Sheehan’s credibility. (N.T. 12/2/88 pp. 117-120). The trial court ruled that the defense had opened the door regarding the motivation for the lawsuit. Thereupon, the Commonwealth enquired of Mr. Sheehan why he filed suit and Mr. Sheehan responded “[t]hey lied to me about the fact that Arthur in fact had a record of violent crime.” (N.T. 12/2/88 p. 126).</p>

We agree with the PCRA court that this claim fails as appellant cannot establish prejudice. <em>Travaglia, supra. </em>Before the jury heard this single remark referencing prior criminal conduct, they had heard excruciating details regarding the heinous nature of the multiple crimes committed by appellant on April 1, 1988. The jury had heard eyewitness testimony detailing the brutal murder of Ms. Killoran, the assaults on a pregnant Ms. Jensen and her husband, Mr. Sheehan. The jury had also heard testimony about the discovery of Ms. Dorner’s body tied to chair, the victim of a sexual assault prior to being stabbed to death. It is highly unlikely that the outcome of appellant’s trial would have been different absent the single statement of Mr. Sheehan referencing appellant’s prior criminal record.

Appellant theorizes that Dr. Cooke’s testimony permitted the jury to consider an additional aggravating circumstance, and as the jury found the aggravating factors to outweigh the mitigating factors, he was clearly prejudiced. Appellant’s argument is unpersuasive. It was necessary for Dr. Cooke to establish the criteria and methodology he utilized in reaching an opinion of appellant’s mental state before that opinion could <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>be admitted. <em>Commonwealth v.

Nor was appellant prejudiced by the admission of this information given the nature of his defense. Appellant was not denying commission of the crimes, he was arguing that he was mentally ill at the time he committed the offense. Under the circumstances, it was necessary for Dr. Cooke to reference the details of appellant’s prior criminal acts, which supported his opinion that appellant committed crimes because of his mental state. Appellant’s claim that counsel was ineffective for permitting the witness to testify to prior crimes fails.</p>
