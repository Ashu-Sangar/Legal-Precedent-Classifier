Appellees sought to enjoin the inclusion of a ballot question which would amend the confrontation clause of Article I, § 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution on the November 1995 ballot. Secretary Kane filed an answer to the application on October 30, 1995 and Appellees’ reply was filed the next day.

At the hearing, President Judge Colins considered an application by Appellee, Pennsylvania Bar Association, to intervene as a party-plaintiff, or alternatively as amicus curiae, in the quo warranto action. The application represented that the PBA would also seek to enjoin the inclusion of the disputed ballot question on the ballot.

More fundamentally, the alteration of the face-to-face provision would affect a broader segment of rights than the category connected with the confrontation of a child witness;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> therefore, the changes lacked the interdependence necessary to justify their presentation to voters within the framework of a single question. <em>See generally Clark v. State Canvassing Bd., </em><a href="/nm/119/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="119 N.M. 12" data-case-ids="1561247" data-case-paths="/nm/119/0012-01">119 N.M. 12</a>, <a href="/nm/119/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="119 N.M. 12" data-case-ids="1561247" data-case-paths="/nm/119/0012-01">888 P.2d 458</a>, 462 (1995)(striking <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>a ballot question where two proposed changes related to the same subject, gambling, but the “rational linchpin” of interdependence was missing); <em>Lee v.

It is for this reason that I conclude that the constitutional alterations should not have been bundled, but rather, should have been posed separately.</p>

The face-to-face clause of Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution confers greater protection upon a criminal defendant than does the Sixth Amendment’s confrontation clause. <em>Commonwealth v. Ludwig, </em><a href="/pa/527/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="527 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1827713" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0472-01">527 Pa. 472</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="527 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1827713" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0472-01">594 A.2d 281</a> (1991). For example, the face-to-face clause precludes the introduction at trial of deposition testimony, unless the accused was present at the deposition. <em>See <a href="/pa/527/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="527 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1827713" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0472-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/527/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="527 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1827713" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0472-01">at 479-80</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="527 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1827713" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0472-01">594 A.2d at 284-85</a>. No such restriction exists under the federal system. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mueller, </em><a href="/f3d/74/1152-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="74 F.3d 1152" data-case-ids="7637395" data-case-paths="/f3d/74/1152-01">74 F.3d 1152</a> (11th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Kelly, </em><a href="/f2d/892/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="892 F.2d 255" data-case-ids="10522791" data-case-paths="/f2d/892/0255-01">892 F.2d 255</a> (3d Cir.1989). As another example, the federal confrontation clause, unlike the face-to-face clause, allows for telephonic trial testimony of witnesses who are unavailable due to illness or pregnancy. <em>See generally United States v. Jacobs, </em><a href="/f3d/97/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="97 F.3d 275" data-case-ids="7649483" data-case-paths="/f3d/97/0275-01">97 F.3d 275</a>, 282 (8th Cir.1996)(collecting cases).</p>
