The benefits of Section 508 accrue only to developers, not to townships. For instance, pursuant to Sections 508(3), a developer’s plan will be deemed approved if the township does not “render a decision and communicate it to the [developer] within the time and in the manner required [by Sections 508(1) and (2) ]....” 53 P.S. § 10508(3).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Furthermore, there is nothing in the Code that requires a developer to take advantage of the immunity that Section 508(4) offers; it can be waived like any other right or privilege.
