It began on October 8, 1970, when the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) initiated a complaint against the School District of Philadelphia (the school district) in which the PHRC alleged that the school district was unlawful<a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>ly segregated in violation of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After investigation and hearing, the PHRC determined that the school district was unlawfully segregated by race, and ordered the school district to submit a desegregation plan. The school district appealed and Commonwealth Court affirmed the order, as modified, and remanded the matter to the PHRC for appropriate modification. On September 5, 1972, the PHRC issued an amended final order that incorporated the court-mandated modifications. All subsequent litigation has involved enforcement proceedings pertaining to the September 5,1972 order.</p>

Then, in the twenty-fifth year of the litigation, on November 3, 1995, the Commonwealth Court ordered the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Governor Ridge, the City of Philadelphia, and Mayor Rendell to be joined as additional respondents, in order to adjudicate the funding of remedies. <em>PHRC v.

Concurrently with those proceedings, the Commonwealth and the governor filed an application for preliminary relief with this court, asking it to assume plenary jurisdiction of this matter. On July 3, 1996, we did so, ordering the Commonwealth Court judge to conclude all hearings within sixty days, to focus the hearings on the issue of desegregation, “the original issue in this matter,” and to issue a final opinion within thirty days of the conclusion of the hearings then taking place. On August 20, 1996, Commonwealth Court’s opinion and a purported order were filed with this court. The Commonwealth and the governor filed a motion to vacate the order. This court, on September 10, 1996, vacated the August 20, 1996 Commonwealth Court order, and divested Commonwealth Court of jurisdiction and stayed all further proceedings <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>in that court while this court exercised plenary jurisdiction over the matter.</p>

Thus, the PHRC distinguishes between proceedings “originally commenced” in the court for purposes of appealability under 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a), and proceedings which are within the court’s “original jurisdiction,” arguing that the two are not coextensive. Some proceedings, PHRC claims, are in Com<a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>monwealth Court’s original jurisdiction though not originally commenced in that court, including enforcement proceedings, for example.</p>

Although PHRC’s argument seems to be logically sound—that “originally commenced” in 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a) for appealability purposes need not be identical to “original jurisdiction” in the Rules of Appellate Procedure for determining which rules of procedure apply—we nevertheless reject the argument. The PHRC admits that there is confusion in this area of procedure. The brief of amici curiae speaking for the General Assembly of Pennsylvania goes <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>further, arguing that <em>PHRC v. </em>Scranton, <em>supra, </em>and <em>Pennsylvania Department of Aging v.

There must be symmetry between [the Pennsylvania Supreme] Court’s allocatur and direct appeal jurisdiction and the Commonwealth Court’s appellate and original jurisdiction or confusion would reign among practitioners.” We agree that this is so. <em>PHRC v. Scranton, supra, </em>held that enforcement proceedings, in the terminology of 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a), are not originally commenced in the Commonwealth Court, but did not decide whether enforcement proceedings are within the “original jurisdiction” of Commonwealth Court in the terminology of 42 Pa.C.S. § 761. We now hold that the nature of enforcement proceedings as well as a desirable consistency warrant the conclusion that just as enforcement proceedings are not originally commenced in Commonwealth Court, they are also in the appellate, rather than the original, jurisdiction of the court.</p>

In an enforcement proceeding the inquiry is limited to whether the order itself was complied with, not whether the order was properly entered on the merits. Due to its unique nature, I would find that an enforcement proceeding falls within the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction. Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that, in this case, joinder of the Commonwealth, Governor Ridge, the City of Philadelphia, and Mayor Rendell was improper, not only because it infused a new claim into the case but, because joinder of these parties was not necessary for the Commonwealth Court to enforce the Commission’s order.</p>
