At that time, the LCB was responsible for both liquor licensing functions and enforcement of liquor laws. In 1987, however, the legislature enacted legislation that transferred liquor law enforcement to the Pennsylvania State Police, and the LCB employees were given a choice of which agency to join. Those that chose to join the State Police became liquor enforcement officers (enforcement officers), and those that chose to remain with the LCB became liquor-licensing analysts (licensing analysts).</p>

      <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>Currently, the State Police employs approximately 148 enforcement officers, whose duties include conducting undercover investigations, executing raids, and making arrests. The enforcement officers receive firearms training, are issued firearms, and are subject to the same physical and educational standards that are required of State Troopers. The LCB currently employs approximately forty-six licensing analysts, whose duties include auditing and other regulatory work. The licensing analysts do not participate in criminal investigations, raids, or other enforcement activity, they do not carry firearms, and they are not subject to State Police physical requirements. Most of the licensing analysts work from their homes.</p>

Approximately eight years later, on April 21, 1995, the FOP filed with the PLRB a Petition for Unit Clarification, alleging that the two groups of employees did not have an “identifiable community of interest” as required by Section 604 of the Public Employees Relations Act (PERA), Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, <em>as amended, </em>43 P.S. § 1101.604.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Thus, the FOP sought to split the bargaining unit into two separate units—one for enforcement officers, and one for licensing analysts.</p>

The Hearing Examiner concluded that, “[gjiven the [PLRB’s] steadfast adherence to the broad-based bargaining unit policy, the FOP’s request to create two separate units, one for each position, must be rejected. The positions are not so divergent <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>in the community of interest analysis to warrant a conclusion that no community of interest exists.” The FOP filed exceptions to the Proposed Decision and Order, and on July 24, 1996, the PLRB issued a Final Order denying the Petition for Unit Clarification, holding that factors common to both positions—including wage scales, hours and benefits, and grievance procedures, as well as bargaining history—outweighed the differences in job functions, “which ... are not so significant as to destroy the identifiable community of interest” between the two groups of employees.</p>

To determine whether employees share an identifiable community of interest, the PLRB and/or court should consider such factors as the type of work performed, educational and skills requirements, pay scales, hours and benefits, working conditions, interchange of employees, grievance procedures, and bargaining history. <em>See, e.g. School District of the Township of Millcreek, <a href="/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20673" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="440 A.2d 673">supra;</a> Warren Borough v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local No. 1124, 55 </em>Pa.Cmwlth. 570, <a href="/citations/?q=423%20A.2d%201117" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="423 A.2d 1117">423 A.2d 1117</a> (1980); <em>Western Psychiatric Institute, <a href="/citations/?q=330%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="330 A.2d 257">supra;</a> Allegheny General Hospital v. PLRB, </em>14 Pa.Cmwlth. 381, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20793" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="322 A.2d 793">322 A.2d 793</a> (1974). An identifiable community of interest does not require perfect uniformity in conditions of employment and can exist despite differences in wages, hours, working conditions, or other factors. <em>See Western Psychiatric Institute, <a href="/citations/?q=330%20A.2d%20257" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="330 A.2d 257">supra.</a> </em>Here, however, there is no substantial evidence of record to support the PLRB’s conclusion that the enforcement officers and the licensing analysts share an identifiable community of interest. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court granting the FOP’s Petition for Unit Clarification.</p>
