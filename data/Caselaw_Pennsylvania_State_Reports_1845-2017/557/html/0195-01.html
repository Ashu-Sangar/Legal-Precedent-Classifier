The first incident involved a forcible entry into an apartment where he raped a woman then stole various items after she fled. This incident was the basis for charges of burglary, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and theft. Appellee was charged with robbery in connection with the second incident, in which he entered a retail establishment and forced an employee to give him cash from a register. Finally, Appellee robbed a gas station, repeatedly shooting at an attendant, striking him in the chest and back, for which he was charged with robbery, aggravated assault and violating the Uniform Firearms Act.</p>

Before accepting the plea, the trial court conducted a colloquy during which Appellee was informed of the maximum penalty for each charge but not of the fact that those sentences could be imposed consecutively. Appellee was then ordered to undergo a psychological and psychiatric evaluation at Fairview State Hospital for purposes of sentencing. He was discharged from the hospital in July, and on September 5, 1986, appeared for sentencing.</p>

The sentences on the three informations were imposed consecutive to each other resulting in an aggregate term of thirteen and one-half to thirty-five years incarceration. After sentencing, Mr. Coles filed a motion to withdraw the <em>nolo contendere </em>plea and to withdraw as counsel, alleging his own ineffectiveness in failing to investigate possible defenses and failing to keep abreast of developments in the case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court granted Mr. Coles’ motion to withdraw and appointed John H.

The PCRA court then appointed new counsel, Elizabeth Beroes, Esq., who filed an amended petition on Appellee’s behalf. The amended petition made several specific allegations of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness, dealing with his failure to properly investigate and litigate Appellee’s competence to assist in his defense, and the <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>failure to challenge the legality of the sentence imposed.

      <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>On August 18, 1995, the Superior Court issued another order remanding the case to the PCRA court to conduct a hearing to “determine whether [Appellee] wishes to proceed <em>pro se, </em>with the assistance of a newly appointed counsel, privately retained counsel or not at all.” The order was issued in response to Appellee’s positive expression that he no longer desired to be represented by Ms. Beroes and the court’s view that the appellate brief filed by Ms. Beroes was “insufficient to facilitate substantive review of the issues before the PCRA court.” On remand, the PCRA court appointed Steven R. Tabano, Esq., who filed an appellate brief on Appellee’s behalf.</p>
    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[253,900,1153,629]]]'>In his brief to the Superior Court, Mr. Tabano raised five claims including the claim that counsel at trial and on direct appeal were ineffective in not objecting to the plea colloquy on the grounds that Appellee was not informed that the sentences on each information could be imposed consecutively. <em>See Commonwealth v. Persinger, </em><a href="/pa/532/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="532 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1835940" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0317-01">532 Pa. 317</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="532 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1835940" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0317-01">615 A.2d 1305</a> (1992). This claim was not raised in the amended PCRA petition. Nevertheless, the Superior Court concluded that this ineffectiveness claim was meritorious and that prejudice must be presumed from such an error. The Superior Court remanded the case for a new trial, whereupon the Commonwealth filed the instant appeal.</p>
    <p id="b333-6" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[255,1561,1155,787]],["BL_334.1",334,[227,299,1157,199]]]'>The Commonwealth first argues that this ineffectiveness claim was waived by virtue of Mr. Tabano’s failure to assert that PCRA counsel was ineffective for not raising this claim. “In order to preserve claims of ineffectiveness of counsel under the PCRA, the claims must be raised at the earliest stage in the proceedings at which the allegedly ineffective counsel is no longer representing the claimant.” <em>Commonwealth v. Griffin, </em><a href="/pa/537/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="537 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="775520" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0447-01">537 Pa. 447</a>, <a href="/pa/537/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="644 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="775520,7881607" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0447-01,/a2d/644/1167-01">644 A.2d 1167</a>, 1170 (1994). Instantly, this rule was not observed since Appellee had two different attorneys appointed to represent him in the PCRA court. Neither of these attorneys raised the claim under <em>Commonwealth v. Persinger, <a href="/pa/532/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="532 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1835940" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0317-01">supra,</a> </em>upon which the Superior Court granted relief. This claim of trial and direct appeal counsels’ ineffectiveness regarding the <em>Persinger </em>claim was therefore waived in the PCRA court. In his appeal to the <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>Superior Court, Appellee did not overcome this waiver by asserting PCRA counsel’s ineffectiveness in waiving the claim. <em>See Commonwealth v. Watlington, </em><a href="/pa/491/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="491 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1765637" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0241-01">491 Pa. 241</a>, <a href="/pa/491/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="491 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1765637" data-case-paths="/pa/491/0241-01">420 A.2d 431</a> (1980).</p>
    <p id="b334-5" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[224,534,1161,685]]]'>The Superior Court sidestepped this waiver with the observation that Ms. Beroes’ performance was “so clearly lacking as to not even constitute representation of appellant.” Memo Op. at 5 n. 2. This finding is conspicuously absent from the court’s August 18, 1995, Judgment Order pursuant to which Mr. Tabano was appointed. That order was clearly based upon the limited finding that Ms. Beroes’ appellate brief was deficient, as reflected by the order which envisioned the filing of a new brief in that court. Appointment of new appellate counsel is the appropriate remedy where PCRA appellate counsel’s deficient performance deprives one of the right to appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v.

An appellate court is limited to reviewing the record of the proceedings below for error. The actions of Ms. Beroes remain a part of that record, and the Superior Court’s consideration of this appeal has necessarily burdened Appellee with the task of seeking relief in the face of PCRA counsel’s deficient performance.</p>
    <p id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[243,808,1154,980]]]'>Appellee clearly attacked the legal effectiveness of Ms. Beroes’ representation in the PCRA court in his <em>pro se </em>brief to the Superior Court. Yet, the Superior Court limited its remand order to the appointment of new counsel to prosecute the appeal, without regard to Appellee’s allegations regarding the crippling effect that Ms. Beroes’ shortcomings in the court below had on his ability to proceed with his claims at the appellate stage. As indicated, if the Superior Court agreed with Appellee that he had been wholly deprived of meaningful assistance of counsel in the PCRA court it should have directed the PCRA court to appoint new counsel to assist Appellee in prosecuting his claims in the lower court in furtherance of his right to competent appointed PCRA counsel under Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1504(a).

However, the trial court failed to inform Appellee during its colloquy that the sentences for each of the charges could be imposed consecutively, as this Court now explicitly requires under <em>Commonwealth v. Persinger, </em><a href="/pa/532/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="532 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1835940" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0317-01">532 Pa. 317</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="532 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1835940" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0317-01">615 A.2d 1305</a> (1992) (plea is not tendered knowingly and intelligently if defendant is not informed that consecutive sentences could be imposed upon his multiple convictions). Following sentencing, Appellee was appointed new counsel, who, on appeal to the Superior Court, did not challenge the validity of Appellee’s plea based on an inadequate colloquy. Subsequently, Appellee filed a <em>pro se </em>petition under the PCRA and was appointed counsel. When counsel took no action in Appellee’s case in the two and one-half years after he had filed a notice of intention to file an amended petition, the PCRA court appointed new PCRA counsel, Ms. Beroes. Ms. Beroes filed an amended petition on Appellee’s behalf, which was subsequently dismissed by the PCRA court without a hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> On appeal, the Superior Court found that the petition filed by Ms. Beroes was insufficient to facilitate review of the issues presented and thus, remanded the case to the PCRA court to determine how Appellee wished to proceed. On remand, the PCRA court appointed new counsel, Mr. Tabano, who filed a supplemental appellate brief on Appellee’s behalf. In this brief, Mr. Tabano raised the issue that both trial and appellate counsel were <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>ineffective for failing, essentially, to challenge Appellee’s plea on the grounds that he had never been advised that his sentences could be imposed consecutively. The Superior Court found that the issue had not been waived and determined, after reviewing the claim on its merits, that counsels’ assistance had been ineffective under <em>Persinger.</em>

    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[262,645,1152,581]]]'>The Majority, however, finds that the Superior Court improperly reached the merits of the <em>Persinger </em>claim. Instead, the Majority concludes that this issue has been waived for purposes of the PCRA because Mr. Tabano did not raise a sufficiently serial ineffectiveness claim. In other words, Mr. Tabano failed to argue that Appellee’s prior PCRA counsel had also been ineffective for failing to raise the issue of trial and appellate counsels’ ineffectiveness with regard to their failure to raise a <em>Persinger </em>claim. Therefore, the Majority concludes that the Superior Court improperly reviewed the issue on its merits. I disagree.</p>
    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[264,1249,1153,529]]]'>Here, Appellee was appointed two PCRA counsel, who, from all indications, did not adequately represent the interests of their client.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Given this ineffectiveness, Appellee was appointed yet another attorney, Mr. Tabano, to represent him on his appeal to the Superior Court. Under these circumstances, I cannot agree that simply because Mr. Tabano recognized a meritorious issue overlooked by prior counsel yet failed to use the operative words in his brief to overcome waiver of this issue by prior counsel, Appellee’s <em>Persinger </em>claim should, in effect, never be subject to review on its merits.</p>
    <p id="b337-6" data-blocks='[["BL_337.6",337,[264,1802,1151,366]],["BL_338.1",338,[211,313,1160,785]]]'>While Appellee still has the ability to file a second PCRA petition, and raise a serial ineffectiveness claim regarding the <em>Persinger </em>issue sufficient to overcome waiver, such a scenario essentially strips Appellee of his opportunity to have this claim addressed on its merits. It is well-settled that a second or subsequent post-conviction petition for relief will not be entertained “unless a strong prima facie showing is offered to <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.” <em>Commonwealth v. Lawson, </em><a href="/pa/519/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="519 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1813563" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0504-01">519 Pa. 504</a>, 513, <a href="/pa/519/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="519 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1813563" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0504-01">549 A.2d 107</a>, 112 (1988). To make such a prima facie showing of a miscarriage of justice, a petitioner must establish either that the proceedings were so unfair that no civilized society could tolerate the verdict or that he is actually innocent of the crimes charged. <em>Commonwealth v. Szuchon, </em><a href="/pa/534/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="534 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1839695" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0483-01">534 Pa. 483</a>, 487, <a href="/pa/534/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="534 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1839695" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0483-01">633 A.2d 1098</a>, 1100 (1993). Since Appellee in the instant case pled <em>nolo contendere </em>and has alleged ineffectiveness of counsel based on <em>Persinger, </em>he would most likely not be able to satisfy the stringent threshold requirements of <em>Lawson. See Commonwealth v. Allen, </em>— Pa.—, <a href="/a2d/732/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="732 A.2d 582" data-case-ids="11549381,56873" data-case-paths="/a2d/732/0582-01,/pa/557/0135-01">732 A.2d 582</a> (1999) (petitioner’s ineffectiveness claim based on <em>Persinger, </em>raised in context of second PCRA petition, did not meet Lawson’s ‘miscarriage of justice’ standard under totality of circumstances).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[209,1123,1161,837]]]'>In my view, the PCRA is designed to protect persons from such situations as the one presented by this appeal. Here, Appellee was represented by two court-appointed PCRA counsel who, quite simply, did not effectively perform their job. Although Appellee’s third appointed counsel recognized a meritorious issue overlooked by prior counsel, he failed to appreciate the need to raise a serial ineffectiveness claim with enough layers to avoid technical waiver of the issue. Under the Majority’s holding, because of his counsels’ shortcomings, Appellee will be forced to file a second PCRA petition in order to have the merits of his <em>Persinger </em>claim become eligible for review. In all probability, however, Appellee would be unable to meet the threshold standards required for relief at that stage under <em>Lawson. See Commonwealth v. Allen, <a href="/a2d/732/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="732 A.2d 582" data-case-ids="11549381,56873" data-case-paths="/a2d/732/0582-01,/pa/557/0135-01">supra.</a> </em>Given the circumstances of this case, I cannot agree that this is the correct result and therefore, must dissent.</p>

For purposes of this dissent, <em>“Persinger </em>claim” refers to the claim that Appellee’s <em>nolo contendere </em>plea was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered since the trial court did not advise Appellee that his sentences could be imposed consecutively on multiple convictions.</p>
