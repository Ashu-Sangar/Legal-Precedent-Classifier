In order to conceal these illegal cash contributions from the authorities and the voting public, from 1985 through February of 1994, Respondent, while either the District Attorney of Lackawanna County or the Attorney General, caused false and materially misleading campaign finance reports to be filed under oath with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Bureau of Elections.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> In addition, Respondent publicly denied any wrongdoing in connection with the illegal cash contributions to his campaign committee until he admitted his guilt by way of entering a guilty plea to one count of mail fraud.</p>

Rather, it raises the question of what degree of discipline should be imposed upon an attorney who solicited and accepted illegal cash contributions to his campaign committee and then repeatedly perjured himself in an effort to conceal the illegal nature of the cash contributions from the <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>authorities and the voting public while he successfully campaigned to first retain his position as District Attorney of Lackawanna County, and then to attain the position of Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b140-4" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[232,539,1159,680]]]'>As noted by the Disciplinary Board’s six-member dissent, “the true distinguishing factor in the case at bar is that no other case involves a member of the bar who rose to the highest levels of Pennsylvania government as did [Respondent].” By successfully campaigning to become first the District Attorney of Lackawanna County, and then the Attorney General, Respondent placed himself in a unique position to serve the common good, advance the legal profession, and uphold the public’s faith in our justice system. At the same time, Respondent placed himself squarely within the public eye, and accepted the responsibility to conduct himself with only the highest degree of integrity. It is in this context that Respondent’s misconduct must be judged.</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[227,1244,1162,835]]]'>By violating the very laws that he swore to uphold, Respondent severely damaged the public’s confidence in our justice system. Likewise, Respondent’s misconduct dealt a serious blow to the public’s perception of the legal profession. In addition, although Respondent concedes that he committed his misconduct while he was a candidate for elected office, he fails to acknowledge the profound negative impact that his misconduct occasioned upon the public’s perception of the integrity of the electorate process. Only after the citizens of this Commonwealth elected Respondent to be their Attorney General did they learn that Respondent had solicited and accepted illegal cash campaign contributions from videopoker gambling machine owner-operators, and then attempted to conceal his illegal activities from both the authorities and the voting public by repeatedly perjuring himself before the Bureau of Elections.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

      <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>Respondent argues that his military service in Vietnam, his public service, his community involvement, and his remorse should be considered in mitigation of his serious misconduct. Respondent is correct that his exemplary military service, his community involvement, and his remorse should be considered in mitigation of his misconduct. However, I do not agree with Respondent’s contention, accepted by the majority of the Disciplinary Board, that his record of public service as the District Attorney of Lackawanna County and the Attorney General should be considered in mitigation of his misconduct. By his own admission, Respondent committed the misconduct that formed the basis of his eventual guilty plea to one count of mail fraud while he was the District Attorney of Lackawanna County and the Attorney General. In addition, to accept this public service in mitigation of Respondent’s misconduct would be to ignore the fact that Respondent would most likely not have retained his position as the District Attorney of Lackawanna County or attained the position of Attorney General had he not concealed his solicitation and acceptance of illegal cash contributions from the authorities and the voting public.</p>

More importantly, Respondent made a mockery of the law enforcement positions that he held—and thereby severely damaged the public’s confidence in the justice system that he swore to uphold. Given the magnitude of <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>Respondent’s breach of the public trust, I would be inclined to disbar him prospectively.
