The Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant willfully offered false testimony, and not that the testimony merely was untrue, and the offering of such testimony shows that the Defendant is not likely to respond to efforts at rehabilitation.</blockquote>

The guidelines themselves, however, permit the Court to sentence in the aggravated range.... This court is satisfied that the Defendant’s testimony before the jury clearly establishes not only a lack of remorse, but a lack of susceptibility to rehabilitation. Moreover, the Court notes that the Defendant has prior summary convictions in double figures. The Court has chosen therefore to sentence within the aggravated range.</blockquote>
