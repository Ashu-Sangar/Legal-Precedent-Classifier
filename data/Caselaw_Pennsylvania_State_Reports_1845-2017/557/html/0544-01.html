Appellant argues that the procedural requirements of the GAAAA of 1990 are sufficient to protect the interests of policyholders and creditors when an insurance company seeks approval of a plan to restructure and divide, and that the explicit terms create separate and distinct procedures from those in the AAL. Appellees, policyholders and creditors, argue that their interests are so great that the procedures of the AAL should be engrafted into the GAAAA of 1990, obligating the insurance department to conduct adversarial trial-type hearings prior to approval of the restructure and division of an insurance company.</p>

Due to vast potential liabilities in connection with asbestos and environmental hazards, a national securities rating company (A.M.Best) lowered CIGNA’s rating and that of its subsidiary, INA Financial. The downgrade was significant, for it adversely affected the marketability of CIGNA’s stock. In response, CIGNA sought to divest itself of some of its contingent liabilities. CIGNA and INA Financial planned to create a separate operating entity to be called Century Indemnity Company. The plan was for INA to provide $500,000,000 in initial capitalization of Century, together with $800,000,000 in reinsurance coverage to enable Century to meet its obligations as to the contingent asbestos and environmental liabilities it would assume.</p>

First is the rule that agencies are entitled to deference in interpreting the statutes they enforce. <em>Tool Sales &amp; Service Co. v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/536/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="536 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="1843152" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0010-01">536 Pa. 10</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="637 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="1843152,7358600" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0010-01,/a2d/637/0607-01">637 A.2d 607</a>, 613 (1993).

A third <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>rule is that the specific controls the general: “Whenever a general provision in a statute shall be in conflict with a special provision in the same or another statute, ... the special provision shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision.... ” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1933. Another rule is that “when a court of last resort has construed the language used in a statute, the General Assembly in subsequent statutes on the same subject matter intends the same construction to be placed upon such language.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(4). Finally, and most fundamental of all, is the rule that legislative intent controls: “The object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

As previously indicated, this provision of the GAA Amendments <em>creates an interest </em>in the policyholders that is <em>entitled to protection under the Administrative Agency Law. </em>Because no such interest is created by the [source statute], the case law interpreting that act is not controlling here.”</blockquote>

In <em>Drain, </em>which involved a corporate merger, the court ruled that policyholders, creditors, or shareholders retain standing to pursue tort remedies arising out of the corporate transaction even when that transaction has been approved by the insurance department. Department approval does not insulate the insurer from liability. Allegations of breach of fiduciary duty or other corporate torts are properly heard in the courts of common pleas, and department approval is no bar to claims by shareholders or policyholders. It is clear that appellees suffered no per se injury simply by operation of the statute. It is equally clear that no judicial remedies are foreclosed by the department’s approval of the plan of restructure and division. Such claims were outside the jurisdiction of the insurance department, and are not barred by department approval of restructuring plans.</p>
