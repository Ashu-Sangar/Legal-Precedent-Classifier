At a hearing before the Workers’ Compensation Judge (“WCJ”), claimant presented the medical testimony of two treating physicians who opined that his allergic reaction to chemicals at work had caused a staphyloccus bacterial infection. Employer countered with the medical testimony of two experts who disagreed that claimant had suffered any injury due to his exposure to chemicals in the workplace. Finding claimant’s experts more credible than employer’s experts, the WCJ determined that claimant was totally disabled due to an occupational injury and disease. The WCJ awarded claimant weekly wage benefits to be calculated from January 14, 1984, medical expenses for treatment and hospitalization totaling $175,546.32, and attorney’s fees on all past-due compensation, including both the weekly indemnity benefits and the unreimbursed medical expenses.</p>

However, the Board remanded the matter to the WCJ for a recalculation of counsel fees because the Board determined that it was unconscionable to award counsel fees based on the amount paid for medical bills. While the remand was still pending before the WCJ, employer tendered payment in the amount of $140,000 to compensate claimant for his medical <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>bills. However, claimant’s counsel withheld payment of this $140,000 to claimant’s medical provider, Suburban General Hospital, until the hospital agreed to accept $110,000 as payment in full of the outstanding medical bill. The remaining $30,000 was subsequently remitted to claimant. This negotiation and the subsequent return of the $30,000 to claimant occurred without the knowledge or consent of employer.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[258,698,1156,362]]]'>In September of 1989, employer filed a petition to suspend or modify claimant’s benefits. Employer also sought a subrogation credit against future benefits in the amount of the $30,000 refund which claimant had received from the Hospital settlement. In response, claimant filed a penalty petition, alleging that employer had failed to pay interest on claimant’s past-due medical bills.</p>
    <p id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[256,1083,1161,626]]]'>On December 15, 1993, the WCJ circulated a decision reaffirming the original award of compensation benefits but awarding employer a credit against future benefits to the extent of the $30,000 returned to claimant pursuant to the Hospital settlement. Additionally, the WCJ ordered claimant’s counsel to reimburse to employer the sum of $35,109.27, which it determined had been improperly awarded to counsel as fees related to the medical expenses. The WCJ also ordered employer to pay claimant 10% interest which was owed on three enumerated medical bills, as well as a 20% penalty on all past-due interest. The WCJ denied claimant counsel fees for his penalty petition.</p>

Supersedeas was granted to all parties by the Appeal Board’s Order of February 2, 1994. Subsequently, the Board affirmed the order of the WCJ, except for that portion which denied respondent counsel fees for his penalty petition. On appeal to the Commonwealth Court, an <em>en banc </em>court affirmed the award of benefits and affirmed the award of interest on the three enumerated medical bills. In all other respects, the Common<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>wealth Court reversed the Board. Employer timely sought review in this Court, and this Court granted review limited to the issue of whether the Commonwealth Court erred by reversing the Board and WCJ’s conclusion that employer was entitled to a $30,000 subrogation credit arising from the negotiated settlement between claimant and his medical services provider. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the determination of the Commonwealth Court on that issue.</p>

R.A.P.1972(4).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Claimant has conceded that the $30,000 credit is an appropriate remedy and may be applied against claimant’s future medical expenses. Therefore, claimant asserts that no controversy lingers, since there is no dispute on the issue of the credit. However, employer contends that a controversy remains for this Court’s resolution because claimant has only conceded the credit as applied to future medical expenses. Employer points out that the WCJ ordered that “[employer] shall receive a credit of $30,000 against claimant’s future <em>indemnity and </em>medical benefits” (emphasis added). A dismissal of these proceedings based on claimant’s representation could arguably still render employer liable for the payment of indemnity benefits, without a corresponding $30,000 credit. Thus, since claimant has only conceded a portion of the WCJ’s order, we agree with employer that a controversy remains. Therefore, claimant’s motion to dismiss as moot is meritless and we will address the merits of this dispute.</p>

Here, the employer believed that the full $140,000 which was tendered to claimant was necessary in order to pay claimant’s medical bills and thereby discharge employer’s duty under the worker’s compensation statute. However, in order to discharge an employer’s duty under the statute with regard to medical expenses, an employer need only pay an employee’s actual medical expenses. Here, employer tendered an amount which ultimately proved to exceed claimant’s actual medical expenses by $30,000, based on employer’s mistaken factual belief that the full sum proffered would prove to be the sum necessary for discharge of employer’s duty. Consequently, under Section Twenty of the Restatement, employer is entitled to restitution of the $30,000 excess.</p>

This maxim is far more than a mere banality. It is a self-imposed ordinance that closes the doors of a court of equity to one tainted with iniquity or bad faith relative to the matter in which he seeks relief. This doctrine is rooted in the historical concept of a court of equity as a vehicle for affirmatively enforcing the requirement of conscience and good faith.

When the Board’s decision was issued on February 26, 1996, petitions for review were filed by both parties with the Commonwealth Court, as well as renewed applications for supersedeas.

Instead, Section 319 of the Act entitles an employer to subrogation or modification where a work injury is caused by a third party or where the employer or an insurance company has paid additional benefits on the basis that the injury is not compensable under the Act. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 671. Employer avers neither scenario. I believe that we are constrained to review this matter based upon the rights to subrogation set forth in the Act. Because the Employer is not entitled to subrogation or recoupment pursuant to Section 319, I agree with the Commonwealth Court that Employer is not entitled to the future credit. The Majority’s decision to ignore Section 319 and to award Employer the $30,000.00 future credit based upon the equitable doctrine set forth in Section 20 of the Restatement of Restitution is misplaced for many reasons.</p>

I hesitate to do so here because the facts before us do not fit this Section. Section 20 provides for restitution only where a person mistakenly has paid an “excessive amount” of money because of an “erroneous belief’ that “the sum paid was necessary to discharge a duty.” Here, when Employer issued a check for $140,000.00, it did not pay an “excessive amount” of money to Claimant and did not pay an amount in excess of that necessary to discharge Employer’s statutory duty to pay medical expenses under the Act. The medical bills owed to the hospital, which Employer was required to pay, were more than $175,000.00. Claimant incurred the majority of these bills in 1984 and in 1986; however, they remained outstanding through February 1989, when Employer finally issued a check payable to Claimant and to the hospital in the amount of $140,000.00. (Employer subtracted Claimant’s attorneys’ fees from this amount).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

(Findings of Fact, 12/15/93, Nos. 10, 11). The hospital’s action against the Claimant appears to have originated because the bills were outstanding during the time in which the Employer exercised its rights to contest the employee’s claim for a work related injury. In March 1989, the hospital agreed to accept $110,000 in payment of the bill and dismissed its action against Claimant. The Claimant also released any claims against the hospital. <em><a href="/pa/535/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="535 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1841527" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0135-01">Id.</a> </em>The $30,000.00 at issue here reflects Claimant’s negotiation of a mutual release and indemnification agreement <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>with the hospital in an apparent settlement of a dispute between the hospital and the Claimant and does not act to discharge the Employer of the duty to pay the amount of medical bills under the statute. <em>See, e.g., </em>77 P.S. § 531 (statutory provisions for the payment of reasonable medical expenses).

Section 306(f.l) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 531. Unjust enrichment occurs when a person has and retains money or benefits, which in justice and equity belong to another. Blacks Law Dictionary 1535 (6th Ed 1990). The $30,000.00 may indeed have originally “belonged” to the hospital because it is the creditor who rendered the service; however, the Employer has not shown that the $30,000.00 belongs to it. While allowing Claimant to keep the $30,000.00 may serve as a windfall to him, Employer equally receives a windfall from the $30,000.00 future credit. Employer never paid the full amount of the medical bill, and never paid an amount more than the reasonably incurred medical expenses. In a situation like here, where we must necessarily grant a windfall to either the employer or the employee, I believe that the equities of the Act tip in favor of allowing the Claimant to <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>retain the $80,000.00.
