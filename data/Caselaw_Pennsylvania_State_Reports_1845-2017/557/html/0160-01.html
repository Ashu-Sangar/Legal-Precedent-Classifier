The dealer had operated the station pursuant to ARCO leases for approximately twenty years and he refused to move, alleging that the termination of his lease was unlawful. ARCO sued in assumpsit for fair rental value of the premises while the dealer remained after termination of the lease and in ejectment. The dealer answered and raised new matter and a counterclaim requesting damages for ARCO’s abrupt termination of the lease. After both parties presented evidence, the trial court granted ARCO’s motions for a directed verdict of possession and for a compulsory nonsuit of the dealer’s counterclaim. Among the issues before this court was whether it was error for the trial court to grant ARCO’s motion for a compulsory nonsuit on the dealer’s counterclaim for damages after the dealer had presented evidence in the case.

In favor of Superior Court’s interpretation is that the Razumic court considered ARCO’s claim that Razumic did not make out a case of damages, which is in essence a claim of harmless error. The argument is that whether or not the defendant presented evidence, the plaintiff cannot prevail because he has no damages. If harmless error were not a consideration in determining the appropriateness of the entry of a nonsuit, presumably the <em>Razumic </em>court would have refused to discuss the question of damages and would have said that the nonsuit was improper because Arco had offered evidence. But instead, the court discussed the merits of the claim.</p>
    <p id="b297-4" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[258,965,1154,526]]]'>On the other hand, that discussion is dicta, for it follows the court’s determination that the act and precedent “compel the conclusion that the court could not enter a nonsuit because Arco had offered evidence.” Moreover, it appears impossible to devise a definition of “harmless” error which the reviewing courts can use in determining whether nonsuit was proper. If “harmless” means that in deciding the motion for nonsuit, the court had before it some evidence offered by the defendant, but that this evidence did not contradict the plaintiffs case, then it would apply to very little indeed.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[258,1514,1154,847]],["BL_298.1",298,[221,314,1157,140]]]'>If, on the other hand, “harmless” error is that in deciding the motion for nonsuit, the court had before it defendant’s evidence which <em>did </em>contradict the plaintiffs case, but the court did not consider such evidence in entering a nonsuit, the question then becomes how the reviewing court knows what the trial court considered. There are many situations in which reviewing courts simply rely on trial courts to ignore improper evidence and accept the trial court’s statement that such evidence was not considered. Rule 230.1, however, requires that a nonsuit may be entered only “before any evidence on behalf of the defendant has been introduced.” If the rule had been intended to permit a court to consider a nonsuit even after the defendant has introduced evidence, presumably the rule could have expressed that although a nonsuit may be granted after defendant has introduced evidence, the court must consider only plaintiffs evidence as if no evidence had <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>been introduced by the defendant.
