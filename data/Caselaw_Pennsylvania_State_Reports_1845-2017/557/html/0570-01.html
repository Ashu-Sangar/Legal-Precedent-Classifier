Probable cause for the warrant was based upon surveillance, complaints from neighbors, and information from a confidential informant who had made a controlled buy from Luv at Luv’s residence the day before the warrant was issued. This informant had worked with the Wilkes-Barre police in the past and been proven reliable.</p>
    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.4",706,[234,648,1161,999]]]'>On the day the warrant to search Luv’s home was issued, Sergeant Coffay, acting on the informant’s tip that Luv would be carrying a supplemental supply of drugs, was waiting with a team of Wilkes-Barre police officers for Luv to arrive at his residence. Meanwhile, the informant contacted the police department in order to inform Coffay that Luv had changed his plans and was now at his girlfriend’s residence and would be transporting the drugs to a local nightclub for distribution. Captain Maguire contacted Coffay, who relocated to the girlfriend’s address where he observed Luv’s parked vehicle, and directed Coffay to obtain a new search warrant for Luv’s car. As Maguire arrived on the scene, and before a new warrant was obtained, Luv and his girlfriend were observed leaving her residence and departing in Luv’s car. Knowing it would take at least an hour to get a new warrant and faced with Luv’s immediate departure enroute to the nightclub to sell the drugs, the officers stopped and searched Luv and his car. The search revealed a large quantity of cocaine under the driver’s seat and Luv was arrested and charged.</p>

Following a bench trial, Luv was convicted and sentenced. In a memorandum opinion, Superior Court unanimously affirmed the trial court’s decision and we granted allocatur to decide whether this warrantless search was proper.

In that case, the police received a tip from a reliable confidential informant that two individuals were selling drugs from an abandoned garage.

Acting on this information, the police secured search warrants for the second man’s residence, vehicle, and person, as well as for White’s residence and person, but not his vehicle.

The informant had provided reliable information to police in the past leading to the arrests of other drug dealers. Additionally, the police independently corroborated the new information when they arrived at Luv’s girlfriend’s residence and discovered that Luv was present just as the informant had said. Finally, given the totality of the circumstances, the police acted not only with a reasonable belief that a crime was being committed, but also with the actual knowledge that a crime had been committed; Luv had sold drugs to a police informant just one day earlier. The informant’s participation in the <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>criminal activity is a sufficient basis to give rise to probable cause. Therefore, appellant’s claim that the record demonstrates that the informant had an insufficient basis of knowledge to give rise to probable cause lacks merit. Furthermore, although the testifying officer could not recall specifically whether the informant had spoken with Luv in person or on the phone, he stated that the informant had told him that “he had some personal contact, either phone or in person.” The police had probable cause for a search of Luv’s vehicle.</p>

In this case, the police did not learn of Luv’s plans until they were at his house waiting to execute the original warrant. While relocating to the girlfriend’s house, they decided a new warrant should be obtained to search Luv’s car. Before a new warrant could be obtained, however, Luv departed with his load of drugs en route to distribute them, according to what the informant had told police. The police had two choices: either stop the vehicle and search it without a warrant, or allow Luv to continue on his way, possibly resulting in the disappearance of the evidence, and in the introduction of a substantial amount of drugs to their community. There was no time to secure a new warrant. These are the exigent circumstances that justify the warrantless search of Luv’s vehicle.</p>

For example, unlike the police in the present case, the police in <em>O.A., supra, </em>were not involved in an ongoing investigation into O.A.’s activities, but were responding to an unsolicited tip. They also had no basis other than the unsubstantiated tip upon which to base a belief that a crime had been or was being committed. On the other hand, the police in the present case actually knew that Luv had committed a crime since their <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>informant had participated in a drug transaction the day-before Luv’s arrest. This not only gave police the requisite probable cause, but also is indicative of the informant’s reliability. Finally, the police in <em>O.A. </em>never made any attempt to secure a warrant. In the present case, the police were acting upon a warrant when they received information regarding an unforeseen change in circumstances; they discussed securing a new warrant but were forced to react before a second warrant could be obtained.</p>

Any exigent circumstances that may have arisen were a direct result of this failure. The police knew that the drugs were transported back and forth between the two residences and reasonably should have foreseen that the use of White’s vehicle was a possibility. In addition, the police in <em>White </em>were not responding to new time-critical information as were the police in the present case, and, additionally lacked probable cause to believe that a crime had been or was being committed. They were acting on a warrant that, due to their lack of foresight, was inadequate. Conversely, the police in the present case operated under the presumption that Luv conducted his drug deals primarily from his residence. Indeed, that is where their informant had made his purchase and that is the location for which they reasonably sought and obtained a search warrant. The relocation to the girlfriend’s house was unforeseen, as was the subsequent departure enroute to the nightclub for distribution of the drugs. These events were not a result of police failure to obtain a warrant. The immediacy of these events did not afford the police time to obtain a new warrant. They needed to act at once or face the fact that they would probably never again locate the drugs, which would then be distributed in their community.</p>
