Briefly stated, these asserted grounds include allegations that: the Commonwealth withheld relevant impeachment evidence in connection with the testimony of eyewitness Michael Easley; the Commonwealth presented false testimony from eyewitness Holly Boone; the trial court erroneously failed to issue a “corrupt and polluted source” jury instruction in connection with Easley’s testimony; the trial court erroneously failed to issue a jury instruction concerning second degree murder; the jury was death qualified but not life qualified; the evidence in support of the aggravating circumstance of Section 9711(d)(9), 42 Pa.C.S., was illegally obtained; the district attorney misrepresented Williams’ record of convictions in connection with <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>his argument concerning the (d)(9) aggravator; the (d)(9) aggravator is unconstitutionally vague; the district attorney made inappropriate “un-narrowing” statements to the jury concerning the (d)(9) aggravator; Williams was entitled to a “life-means-life” jury instruction; the trial court imposed an unduly and unconstitutionally heavy burden of proof for mitigating circumstances; trial counsel was ineffective in the penalty phase for failing to present a sufficient case of mitigation; trial counsel was ineffective in the guilt phase for failing to develop a diminished capacity defense; and Williams is entitled to relief by virtue of the cumulative effect of the above alleged errors and ineffectiveness. In addition, Williams asserted blanket claims that his trial and appellate counsel, Richard E. Johnson, was ineffective for failing to raise the above issues in post-trial motions and on direct appeal, and that comprehensive post-conviction review is otherwise appropriate pursuant to the relaxed waiver doctrine applied by this Court in death penalty cases. In support of the petition, Williams filed thirteen unsworn declarations, the bulk of which were directed toward establishing mitigating evidence, as well as records of Williams’ mental health treatment. Also among the declarations was a recantation from Ms. Boone of her inculpatory trial testimony.</p>

While conceding that the Commonwealth preemptively elicited testimony from Easley concerning his prior robbery conviction and open drug charges against him, Williams asserts that the district attorney purposely withheld material details concerning Easley’s criminal history and, indeed, permitted and encouraged Easley to make material misrepresentations to the jury concerning his record. Williams contends that the actual chronology of Easley’s criminal background, combined with the fact that he did not implicate Williams until over one year after the crime, establishes persuasive evidence of bias. In particular, Williams focuses upon the fact that Easley had been charged with robbery and several other offenses on January 4, 1989, two months prior to giving his statement, and that those offenses were dismissed without prejudice within several months after he gave the statement. Moreover, Williams contends that the district attorney violat<a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>ed the dictates of <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>when he failed to turn over Easley’s criminal history to trial counsel until immediately prior to Easley’s testimony, and even then supplied trial counsel with only an incomplete extract. According to Williams, trial counsel facilitated these alleged improprieties and rendered ineffective assistance by failing to undertake an independent investigation of Easley’s criminal background and by failing to adequately prepare for his cross-examination. Williams further asserts that the trial court erred when it refused to grant a request made by trial counsel for a continuance to prepare for his examination of Easley. According to Williams, his contentions in this regard are grounded in fundamental due process and the right of a criminal defendant to confront witnesses.</p>

Specifically, Williams argues that the trial court’s instructions suggested to the jury that Williams’ burden in establishing a mitigating circumstance was greater than the Commonwealth’s burden in establishing an aggravating circumstance. With emphasis upon the latter part of the statement, Williams focuses upon the following language from the trial court’s instructions:</p>
    <blockquote id="b376-6" data-blocks='[["BL_376.6",376,[261,1094,1119,256]]]'>The aggravating circumstances must be proven by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt.

Williams also points to his history of mental health treatment at Northeast Community Center for Mental Health/Mental Retardation (“NCCMH/MR”) beginning at the age of twelve; involuntary commitment to Philadelphia Psychiatric Center at the age of fourteen spanning several months; a second commitment at the age of fifteen; and a subsequent discharge from this commitment against medical advice into the custody of his mother.

It does appear, however, that substantial evidence of a history of mental illness on the part of Williams may have been available to trial counsel. Accordingly, pursuant to the reasoning of <em>Smith, </em>trial counsel would have been obliged to explore such evidence if it was brought to his attention. Whether trial counsel was made aware of Williams’ history of mental treatment is a factual issue which we cannot resolve in this appeal. Further, although we agree with the Commonwealth that substantial portions of the experts’ declarations are conclusory, we do not agree that their credibility can be adequately assessed in this case absent factfinding. Clearly, a material factual controversy exists in this regard; therefore, we hold that the PCRA court erred in dismissing Williams’ twelfth ground for relief without conducting a factual hearing. <em>See generally </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 1509(b).

I write separately only to emphasize the portion of the Majority Opinion that criticizes the PCRA court’s wholesale adoption of the Commonwealth’s brief and because I believe that review of any of the issues raised in the petition is premature under the circumstances. The PCRA court’s failure to draft an opinion addressing the claims constitutes an abdication of the trial court’s duty which cannot be condoned. While the PCRA court undoubtedly intended only to conserve its judicial energies, this manner of conservation is inappropriate. This Court’s review of certain of the issues raised in the PCRA petition should not proceed until a proper opinion is filed by the court below.</p>
    <p id="b386-4" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[237,946,1158,516]]]'>The obvious purpose of Pa.R.A.P.1925(a) is to facilitate appellate review of a particular trial court order. Additionally, however, the rule fulfills an important policy consideration by providing to disputing parties, as well as to the public at large, the legal basis for a judicial decision. The trial court’s adoption of one party’s advocacy brief, in lieu of an independent judicial opinion, deprives the parties and the public of the independent reasoning of the court. This is especially true for the public because the briefs themselves are normally not as accessible as a judicial opinion may be.</p>

Here, the PCRA court’s opinion merely recounts the procedural history of the case and then proceeds to adopt one of the <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>advocate’s briefs—in its totality—as the basis for denying the petition. This constitutes patently insufficient judicial review because the Commonwealth’s brief reflects a spirit of advocacy, whereas a judicial opinion should evidence the reasoning of an impartial decision-maker. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[252,878,1154,960]]]'>Notwithstanding the Majority’s laudable interest in judicial economy by addressing some of the issues, I believe the preferred practice of this Court requires that we remand the entire matter to the PCRA court for an opinion which addresses all the relevant issues and which states the court’s reasons for denying relief. This Court should not review any of the issues until the PCRA court complies with Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a). <em>See Commonwealth v. Wood, </em><a href="/pa-super/432/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="274" data-cite="432 Pa.

Judicial economy would have been better served had the PCRA court filed a meaningful opinion in the first instance. Had the PCRA court followed the appropriate procedure, this Court would not have had to assume the responsibility that rightfully belongs in the lower court; that is, initially reviewing and disposing of issues that appellant may have later chosen not to pursue on appeal to this Court had a trial court opinion been rendered.</p>
