Appellee conducts an annual pigeon shoot, known as the Fred Coleman Memorial Pigeon Shoot, in Hegins, Pennsylvania. Hulsizer sought to have appellee enjoined from holding the shoot, alleging that it violates the cruelty to animals statute, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5511(c), which provides:</p>

This subsection shall not apply to activity undertaken in normal agricultural operation.</blockquote>
    <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[251,1445,1162,312]]]'>Hulsizer’s action was initiated pursuant to a provision of the same statute, which, at 18 Pa.C.S. § 5511(i), provides: “An agent of any society or association for the prevention of cruelty to animals, incorporated under the laws of this Commonwealth, shall have standing to request any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any violation of this section.”</p>

There are no restrictions on who can participate, other than a requirement that shooters be at least twelve years of age. No prior shooting or hunting experience is required. <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>Between ten and thirteen thousand people pay approximately five dollars each to observe the shoot. For those whose appetites are stirred by watching the event, concession stands provide food, soft drinks, and alcoholic beverages. Spectators sit in rows of bleachers near the shooting areas. They cheer and clap when the birds are killed or wounded.</p>
    <p id="b603-4" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[257,652,1153,683]]]'>Each year, appellee supplies approximately five to six thousand pigeons for the shoot. The pigeons, which are obtained both inside and outside of Pennsylvania, are kept in a storage area until it is their turn to be shot. During the event, agents of appellee known as “trapper boys” place the birds in “traps”—small enclosures that are located on the ground approximately sixty feet in front of a shooter. The birds are then released, one by one, in the center of a large circled area—roughly thirty-five yards in diameter—that is separated from the rest of Hegins Park by fencing, and the shooter attempts to hit each bird with gunfire. A shooter receives points for hitting a pigeon if the bird falls in the circled area, regardless of whether the bird is killed or only wounded.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[254,1359,1155,1007]],["BL_604.1",604,[255,325,1157,256]]]'>During a shoot, four to six thousand pigeons become the targets of gunfire. Of these, over five hundred die immediately from their wounds. Hundreds of other pigeons, however, suffer a slow and painful death, for their wounded bodies fall outside of the circled area or outside of Hegins Park, and they are never retrieved by appellee or provided any veterinary or other care. They eventually die from their wounds or starvation. An additional two thousand or more wounded birds fall within the circled area, and they suffer pain until they are eventually killed. They are not given any sustenance, drink, or veterinary care. Instead, they lie on the ground until the shooter has completed a full round of shots, a process that often takes several minutes. Then, the trapper boys retrieve the wounded pigeons from the circled area and kill them by a variety of methods. These include tearing the birds’ heads from their bodies, throwing or smashing them against objects on the ground, crushing the birds by falling on them, and suffocating the birds by tossing them into a barrel filled with other dead and dying pigeons. All of these methods are <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>contrary to accepted veterinary methods of euthanasia and cause the birds additional pain and suffering. Wounded pigeons also fly into the crowd of spectators, who further injure and kill them. Spectators ostensibly derive great enjoyment from this chance to participate in the slaughter.</p>

Hulsizer was appointed to act as a humane society police officer of the PSPCA by the court of common pleas of the county that serves as the locus of the registered office of the PSPCA, namely, Philadelphia County. He was never separately appointed to engage in enforcement activities in Schuylkill County by a court of common pleas of that county. The trial court determined, therefore, that he lacks enforcement authority in Schuylkill County, and, hence, it dismissed his complaint for lack of standing. Superior Court affirmed in a memorandum decision.</p>

Section 501, which was enacted in 1972 and amended in 1990, predated the HSPOEA, which was enacted in 1994. The courts below <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>interpreted the latter act as imposing a requirement that individuals seeking appointment as humane society police officers must apply to the court of common pleas of each county in which they will act. Hence, the procedures set forth by Section 501 were deemed superseded by a requirement of separate applications to the courts of common pleas of the various counties.</p>

It reasoned that Section 501 must be viewed as having been amended by the HSPOEA, to the extent necessary to avoid an inconsistent result. On appeal, Superior Court implicitly confirmed the trial court’s interpretation of the interaction between Section 501 and the HSPOEA. It focused on the requirement in 3 P.S. § 456.3, supra, that a humane society police officer exercising authority within the boundaries of a county must be appointed an officer “in that county,” and, thus, it viewed that requirement as superseding the appointment process contained in Section 501. This result, it concluded, was consistent with its decision in a previous case in which Hulsizer and the PSPCA sought to obtain an injunction against the same annual pigeon shoot, and in which the court concluded, “Humane Society Police officer agents can only act in the counties where they have been granted police power by the local Court of Common Pleas.” <em>Mohler v.

Both statutes relate to the same subject, namely, the appointment of humane society police officers. Hence, they must be regarded as in pari materia and construed together, if possible, as one statute. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1932. Further, that the legislature intended the two statutes to be construed together in a consistent fashion is made clear by the fact that the HSPOEA expressly relies on and incorporates the appointment procedures of Section 501. There is no indication in the HSPOEA that the legislature intended it to function as an implied repeal of those procedures. It is a “widely recognized principle that repeals by implication are not favored and will not be permitted if there is any other reasonable construction, and that a law is not repealed by a later enactment if the two may be operative without repugnance to each other.” <em>Consumers Educ. &amp; Protective Ass’n v.

Likewise, the section of the cruelty to animals statute that gives humane society agents standing to seek injunctive relief in “any court of competent jurisdiction,” 18 Pa.C.S. § 5511(i), supra, would be undermined, as would the mission of the PSPCA. The PSPCA was created by the legislature “to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals <em>throughout the state of Pennsylvania </em>Act of April 1868, P.L. 615, § 2 (emphasis added).
