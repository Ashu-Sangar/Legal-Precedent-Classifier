He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction. On appeal, Appellee argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in refusing his request to poll the jury. In its opinion filed pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925, the trial court explained that Appellee’s request to poll the jury was denied because it was made after the verdict had been recorded. In support thereof, the trial court cited to Pa.R.Crim. P. 1120(f) which provides:</p>

The Commonwealth submits that the right to poll a jury is not of constitutional dimension, but rather is merely a procedural mechanism to ensure that due process was effectuated and that, therefore, a <em>per se </em>rule requiring reversal without a showing of prejudice would be unduly harsh.

The mere use of the terms “is recorded” in Rule 1120(f) cannot be deemed to somehow circumscribe that right.
