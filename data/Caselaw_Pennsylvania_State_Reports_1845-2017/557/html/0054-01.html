Consider the 1990 capital expenditures which were debt financed. That portion of the $840,000 loan which was spent on capital expenditures was loaned to Blue Valley by United Penn Bank for the exclusive purpose of making those same capital expenditures, which presumably serve as security for the loan. It would be untenable to argue that proceeds of a loan made to a corporation for the exclusive purpose of making capital expenditures should instead be disbursed as income to the two principal shareholders of the corporation. Yet that is precisely the implication of Wife’s argument. As for the $26,299 in 1991 capital expenditures, Husband erroneously testified that “the depreciation, again, is used to pay for these capital improvements.... ” (N.T. 4/1/93 at 19).

While the Superior Court accurately described the relationship between depreciation expense and net income, and the potential for marginal income tax savings arising therefrom, under the circumstances of this case there existed no marginal income tax savings available to Blue Valley. Blue Valley, by virtue of its Sub-chapter S Corporation status, does not actually pay federal income taxes (see <em>supra, </em>note 2) and therefore does not enjoy a marginal income tax savings as a result of the depreciation deduction. Instead, it is the shareholders of Blue Valley (i.e., Husband and his partner) who experience the income tax savings as a result of the depreciation deduction. Thus, as a result of the depreciation deduction taken by Blue Valley, Husband’s net income after taxes is greater than it would be without the deduction, thereby <em>increasing </em>the amount of Husband’s disposable income available for support.</p>

Since the evidence of record does not reveal the nature of any of the business transactions underlying Blue Valley’s pre-1990 capital expenditures, the source of the funds used to make these capital expenditures has not been identified.

Stoner, supra. </em>After noting that, “depreciation is a mere book figure which does not either reduce the actual dollar income of the defendant or involve an actual cash expenditure when taken,” but rather “represents additional cash available to the defendant by permitting substantial tax deductions,” the Court also recognized that a support obligor should not be compelled to exhaust all of his or her capital without an opportunity to preserve his or her business. The Court determined that depreciation should neither always be treated as an expense nor always characterized as a net profit. <em>Id. </em>at 353, <a href="/citations/?q=307%20A.2d%20146" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="307 A.2d 146">307 A.2d at 152</a>.

The court noted its concern that Husband was “building up equity in his business and creating a ‘good bowling center for the community’ at the expense of his children’s support.” <em>Id. </em>at 5.

The first part of the analysis was whether the expenses reflected an actual reduction in Husband’s personal income, and the second was whether the capital outlays were reasonable or merely an attempt to shelter income from support obligations.

While the Superior Court properly noted that depreciation expenses are legitimate deductions under the federal tax laws, I believe that it erred in concluding that they should be included in disposable income for support purposes only when unreasonable. In my opinion the appropriate inquiry to decide whether to include depreciation in support income is a review of all of the relevant circumstances of the particular situation presented. This is an inquiry of the trial court to be conducted in each case. In fact, in its Opinion, the trial court specifically noted that its “decision was based on the facts and circumstances in the case”. Trial Court Opinion, August 20, 1993, p. 6. Accordingly, I see no need to remand this matter for a recalculation of Husband’s support obligation.</p>
