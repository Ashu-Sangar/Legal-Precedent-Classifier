The docket reflects that a “pro se” “Petition Requesting Evidentiary Hearing on After discovered Evidence” was filed on June 2, 1995. The requested evidentiary hearing was held, in fact a portion of the testimony was heard on May 25, 1995, prior to the docketing of petitioner’s “pro se” petition. The evidentiary hearing was concluded on April 1, 1996. These hearings related to an allegation of jury tampering which is discussed more fully, later in this opinion. The discrepancy in docketing of the petition after the evidentiary hearing had already begun was due to the difficulty petitioner encountered in communicating with counsel; the court and counsel discussed this fact on September 8, 1995. (N.T. 9/8/95 p. 7). Also on September 8, 1995, counsel received leave of court to withdraw the pro se petition for evidentiary hearing and incorporate the allegations therein in a post-conviction petition. On April 17, 1996 a counseled PCRA petition was <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>filed. On July 18, 1996 current PCRA counsel entered his appearance. A hearing on the PCRA petition was held January 21st through the 28th, 1997. An opinion and order denying PCRA relief was entered on September 2,1997. This appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The victim left the father’s residence at approximately 11:15 p.m. in a 1976 Chevrolet Nova registered in the name of Rose Milano, the mother of Anthony. The deceased proceeded to the Edgely Inn, where the appellants also happened to be on that occasion. Appellants had been in the tavern for quite some time prior to the arrival of Milano. Both appellants had exhibited quarrelsome and aggressive behavior before the deceased arrived at the Inn. Chester, who possessed skills in the art of Karate, had threatened to assault one of the male guests at the establishment and Laird was loud and argumentative that evening in the premises.</blockquote>

The vehicle involved was a Chevrolet Nova. A search of the wooded area adjacent to <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>where the automobile was parked resulted in the discovery of the body of the deceased, Anthony Milano. The body was lying face up with the left eye partially open, contusions in the facial area, and multiple “slashings” on the neck and throat. A postmortem examination revealed that the victim had been assaulted about the face and had sustained lacerations about the face, throat, neck and shoulder. The pathologist concluded that the deceased had been kicked and/or punched in both the right and left temple areas and the chin. A hairline fracture at the base of the skull was attributed to a blunt instrument striking the head. The lacerations were made by a sharp instrument, consistent with a utility knife. The pathologist opined that the “slashings” were hard enough and deep enough to sever the fifth and sixth vertebrae and were too numerous to count. It was also concluded that the victim aspirated on his own blood for five to ten minutes before expiring. Officer McGuigan testified that when he arrived at the scene he first observed the vehicle ablaze and assisted in extinguishing the fire. The vehicle was identified as being the 1976 Chevrolet Nova registered in the name of Rose Milano, the mother of the deceased. Police records further established that Mrs. Milano had reported the deceased as a “missing person” when he failed to return to the family home in the early morning hours of December 15, 1987. This officer further testified that prior to the response to the car fire, at approximately 1:30 a.m. on December 15, he had responded, with two fellow officers, to a reported stolen car which was found in a parking lot of the Edgely Inn. To pursue their investigation they began interrogating the customers in the Edgely Inn. During that investigation he observed Chester, Laird, and the decedent at the bar. The time was fixed at approximately 1:30 a.m., December 15. He requested identification from each of these individuals and was satisfied that they were not involved in the car theft. At approximately 2:10 a.m., while he was still in the parking lot, he observed the deceased, Chester, and Laird leave the Inn together. This testimony was confirmed by the two officers <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>that responded with Officer McGuigan to the stolen car complaint.</blockquote>

In addition, the Commonwealth presented evidence to establish that at approximately 4:00 a.m., December 15, Chester and Laird approached on foot, the apartment of a friend of Chester’s, Richard Griscavage. Griscavage’s apartment was located less than a mile from the murder scene. Griscavage testified that both were visibly agitated and were covered with blood. Chester attempted to explain their condition by stating that they had been engaged in a fight and “the dude is dead.” Griscavage took both men to Laird’s apartment where they attempted to remove and conceal their bloody clothing. The Commonwealth also produced additional witnesses to whom appellants made incriminatory statements and actions that reflected their complicity in the murder. The Commonwealth also produced a transcription of a consensually intercepted telephone call between Chester and Laird, during which Laird suggested that Chester leave town, recommended ways Chester could pass a polygraph examination, and commented on the Commonwealth’s inability to prove a case without evidence. Both defendants testified at trial and admitted being at the scene.</blockquote>

The PCRA court reasoned that as penalty phase issues relate to the imposition of sentence, rather than the determination of guilt, penalty phase issues do not provide a basis for relief under the current PCRA. The PCRA court did permit the introduction of testimony as to penalty phase issues, and granted leave for PCRA counsel to submit additional written proffers of evidence that would be presented if penalty phase issues were cognizable so that a record would be available to the appellate court. <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>(N.T.1/23/97).

This claim is belied by the docket which clearly records the filing date of the petition as April 17, 1996. The amendments at issue became effective January 16, 1996. This argument fails and the lower court correctly applied the PCRA as amended. Section 3(1) of Act 1995 (Spec.Sess. No. 1), Nov. 17, P.L. 1118, No. 32, effective in 60 days.</p>

The PCRA court reached this conclusion by reference to the 1995 amendments to the PCRA. The lower court found that the amendments limit review of claims to only those issues that “so <em>undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place </em>” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(2)(i) and (ii).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Focusing on the highlighted language, the PCRA court held that issues regarding the penalty phase of a capital case do not affect the truth-determining process as they do not impact upon the reliability <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>of the verdict for the underlying murder. Finding that penalty phase issues relate only to the sentence, and not guilt or innocence, the lower court held that such claims are not cognizable. The PCRA court reasoned that with the deletion of former subsection (v), which had provided for relief upon “a violation of the Constitution, law or treaties of the United States which would require the granting of Federal habeas corpus relief to a State prisoner”, the PCRA now limits sentencing claims to allegations that the sentence is beyond the lawful maximum.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(2)(vii). Finding none of petitioner’s penalty phase issues to raise a question regarding the lawful maximum, the PCRA court refused to address penalty phase issues in the PCRA context.

In the alternative petitioner asks that if this court finds the PCRA precludes review of penalty phase questions then those issues should be considered as if petitioner had applied for habeas relief.

A penalty phase hearing is a “truth-determining process.” A penalty phase hearing involves the presentation of evidence, a determination of facts, and an adjudication setting forth specific findings. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(a), (b) and (f). In a penalty phase hearing the Commonwealth carries the burden of presenting evidence of aggravating circumstances, which if proven beyond a reasonable doubt, would make the defendant eligible for the sentence of death. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(iii). The defendant has the right to present evidence of mitigating circumstances which, if established by a preponderance of the evidence, must be weighed against the aggravating circumstances before a reliable adjudication can be reached. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(ii) and (iv). The judge or jury sits at penalty phase as fact finder. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(b) and (f). Without proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the particular case at issue falls squarely within the class of cases for which death can be imposed, the defendant cannot be subject to the penalty. <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, not only is a penalty phase hearing in a capital case a “truth-determining process,” but it is also a process encompassed within the concept of “guilt or innocence” for the purposes of review of penalty phase issues alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and/or constitutional error within the scope of the PCRA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

From the nature of the proposed evidence we will assume he is referring to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(3) the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired, and (e)(8) any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.</p>

      <p id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[239,1612,1154,745]]]'>. In support of his argument that the jury charge at issue violated the rule in <em>Mills, </em>petitioner relies upon a Third Circuit Court of Appeals decision in <em>Frey v. Fulcomer, </em><a href="/f3d/132/0916-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="132 F.3d 916" data-case-ids="11889446" data-case-paths="/f3d/132/0916-01">132 F.3d 916</a> (3rd Cir.1997). Petitioner's reliance on the decision in <em>Frey </em>is unavailing for several reasons. First, although we may look to decisions of the intermediate federal courts for guidance in interpreting federal case law, those decisions are not binding on this court. <em>Commonwealth v. Clark, </em><a href="/pa/551/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="551 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="507821" data-case-paths="/pa/551/0258-01">551 Pa. 258</a>, <a href="/a2d/710/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="710 A.2d 31" data-case-ids="11827068,507821" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/0031-01,/pa/551/0258-01">710 A.2d 31</a>, 39 (1998). Second, the instructions and accompanying verdict slip examined in <em>Frey, </em>are not identical to the charge and slip at issue. In fact, the instruction and verdict slip in this case mirror the words of the charge and verdict slip which the third circuit found not to violate <em>Mills, </em>in <em>Zettlemoyer v. Fulcomer, </em><a href="/f2d/923/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="923 F.2d 284" data-case-ids="10542660" data-case-paths="/f2d/923/0284-01">923 F.2d 284</a>, 306-07 (3rd Cir.1991). Third, the Third Circuit fails to follow the holding of <em>Teague v. Lane, </em><a href="/us/489/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="489 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="12032050" data-case-paths="/us/489/0288-01">489 U.S. 288</a>, <a href="/us/489/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="489 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="12032050" data-case-paths="/us/489/0288-01">109 S.Ct. 1060</a>, <a href="/us/489/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="489 U.S. 288" data-case-ids="12032050" data-case-paths="/us/489/0288-01">103 L.Ed.2d 334</a> (1988), which prohibits retroactive application of decisions declaring new constitutional principles in criminal cases to cases on collateral appeal. The Third Circuit dismisses <em>Teague </em>by noting that the government failed to raise it. However, <em>Teague </em>sets a threshold that must be established before a habeas petitioner can qualify for relief.</p>

It must be noted that a minority of this court is of the view that a <em>Simmons </em>instruction should be given, prospectively, in all capital cases regardless of whether the issue of a defendant’s future dangerousness is raised. <em>Commonwealth v.
