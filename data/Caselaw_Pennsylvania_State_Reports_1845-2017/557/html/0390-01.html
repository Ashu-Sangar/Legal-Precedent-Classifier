Vartan asserts that the analysis to be applied to the deliberative process privilege is similar to the one applied when determining whether judges are immune from suit. In <em>Forrester v. White, </em><a href="/us/484/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="484 U.S. 219" data-case-ids="600739" data-case-paths="/us/484/0219-01">484 U.S. 219</a>, <a href="/us/484/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="484 U.S. 219" data-case-ids="600739" data-case-paths="/us/484/0219-01">108 S.Ct. 538</a>, <a href="/us/484/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="484 U.S. 219" data-case-ids="600739" data-case-paths="/us/484/0219-01">98 L.Ed.2d 555</a> (1988), the United States Supreme Court reviewed a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of an Illinois state court judge who was sued by a court employee whom he had discharged.

Difficulties have arisen primarily in attempting to draw the line between truly judicial acts, for which immunity is appropriate, and acts that simply happen to have been done by judges.

Vartan asserts that like judicial immunity, the deliberative process privilege should not apply to the administrative decisions of the judiciary. We disagree based on the significant difference between the effect of the privilege and immunity at issue. When a civil action against a judicial officer is dismissed because of immunity, the plaintiff is precluded from seeking relief. However, where a party to an action successfully invokes the deliberative process privilege to protect a witness from being deposed, the effect is notably different. Rather than leaving the plaintiff without a remedy, it simply restricts the discovery the plaintiff is able to seek based on a public policy consideration that high government officials should not be required to divulge the thought processes behind their decisions.</p>
