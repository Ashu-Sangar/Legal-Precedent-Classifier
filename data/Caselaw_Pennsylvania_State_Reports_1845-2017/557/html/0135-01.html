In the sixteenth footnote of its opinion the Majority attempts to distinguish <em>Persinger </em>by suggesting that while Appellant merely alleges that his plea counsel failed to inform him of the permissible range of sentences that could be imposed against him, the defendant in <em>Persinger </em>somehow proved to the Court that his plea counsel failed to inform him of the permissible range of sentences that could be imposed against him. However, in my view, the <em>Persinger </em>decision was based on the failure of the trial court to clearly inform the defendant, on the record, of the possibility that he could receive consecutive sentences. Therefore, whether or not counsel informs a defendant, off the record, of the possibility that he could receive consecutive sentences is of no moment for purposes of a <em>Persinger </em>claim. Nevertheless, in <em>Persinger, </em>as in the instant case, there was no evidentiary hearing conducted at which the defendant’s plea counsel would have testified as to what he told or failed to tell the defendant prior to the entry of his guilty plea.

    <p id="b285-8" data-blocks='[["BL_285.8",285,[241,1733,1155,635]],["BL_286.1",286,[259,321,1162,98]]]'>I join the dissenting opinion authored by Mr. Justice Nigro. I write only to note my belief that the finality concerns underpinning the rule fashioned in <em>Commonwealth v. Lawson, </em><a href="/pa/519/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="519 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1813563" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0504-01">519 Pa. 504</a>, <a href="/pa/519/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="519 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1813563" data-case-paths="/pa/519/0504-01">549 A.2d 107</a> (1988), are adequately addressed by the one-year filing limitation now incorporated into the Post Conviction Relief Act, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545, which was upheld by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Peterkin, </em><a href="/pa/554/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="554 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="765982" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0547-01">554 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d 638</a> (1998). Thus, prospectively, it should be unnecessary, in the context of serial PCRA filings, to undertake the inherently vexing task of distinguishing between those prejudicial errors which undermine the reliability of a verdict and would require relief under the terms of the PCRA, and such <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>errors as can be said to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
