Respondent, Neil Werner Price, was therein charged with filing court documents that contained false allegations against two District Justices and an Assistant District Attorney. He was also charged with completing portions of Department of Public Welfare (DPW) forms designated to be completed by a medical provider and signing the forms as “Dr. Neil Price, J.D.” The Hearing Committee and the Disciplinary Board found that Respondent committed various disciplinary violations and recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of at least one year and one day. Upon independent review of the record, we conclude that Respondent engaged in the alleged misconduct and hold that the appropriate sanction is a five-year suspension from the practice of law.</p>

To understand the nature of the documents filed, a brief factual background is necessary. On July 24, 1990, Judge Caram Abood of the Cambria County Common Pleas Court issued an order directing that District Justice Rick Farra recuse himself from all matters involving parties represented by Respondent. The order was based on the fact that District Justice Farra was a Commonwealth witness in a then pending criminal proceeding against Respondent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On September 3, 1991, an order was entered vacating the recusal order.

In other words, the pleader in a court proceeding bears the burden of establishing a factual basis upon which his allegations are based.

He contends that the Office of Disciplinary Counsel should have to prove that his purposeful intent was to defraud the judicial officers with false statements. We reject this subjective approach as unworkable as a respondent would always be in the position of defending an allegation, no matter how scurrilous, on the ground that he <em>believed </em>it to be true. Reputation is an interest that is explicitly recognized and protected by the highest law in our Commonwealth, our Constitution. Pa. Const. Art. I, §§ 1, 11. We cannot permit it to be cavalierly tarnished by the filing of false and scandalous pleadings. While disciplinary infractions involving the conversion of funds can be remedied by restitution, the damage done to one’s reputation by the assertion of slanderous allegations is irreparable.

We begin by noting that District Justice Farra and District Justice Berkheimer as well as Assistant District Attorney Kalenish each testified unequivocally that the allegations Respondent made against them were untrue. (N.T. 10/10/96 at 11-15; N.T. 9/24/96 at 25-37; 95-105) Respondent first asserted that Farra participated in an “undercover effort” against him, “induced him to deliver contraband” or “reported an otherwise unreportable offense to curry favor with the state police and the attorney <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>general.” These allegations were made after Respondent had been charged with disclosing to Farra the transcript of an authorized wiretap interception. The assertions were included in a motion challenging the vacation of an order directing the recusal of Farra. Other than laying this factual background, and asserting that Farra ‘had had previous communications with the Attorney General’s Office, Respondent has presented no evidence establishing a factual basis to support his allegations. Respondent’s unsupported suspicions do not give rise to an objective, reasonable belief that the allegations were true. Moreover, Respondent has not suggested that he engaged in any reasonably diligent inquiry to determine whether his assertions were accurate. Instead, Respondent testified that the statements reflected his “perceptions” and “impressions.” (N.T. 2/26/97 at 32).</p>
    <p id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.4",308,[228,1126,1162,852]]]'>Respondent also alleged that Farra approved a litigant’s complaint in a landlord/tenant matter on the basis that the litigant was a former state trooper.

Respondent acknowledged that the allegations “weren’t necessarily made in the most charitable frame of mind toward [his] accusers.” (N.T. 11/13/96 at 59).

Although Respondent asserted that he had heard from others that Berkheimer had been reported for a disciplinary problem (N.T. 11/13/96 at 77), he stated that he did not know whether or not Berkheimer sought to fix any citations. <em>Id. </em>at 79. Regarding Respondent’s allegation that Berkheimer “assumed a prosecutorial bias,” he stated that he had heard conversations regarding what he considered to be “excesses” by Berkheimer. <em>Id. </em>Finally, Respondent asserted that Berkheimer “bothered several constituents with sexually harassing contacts.” Respondent explained that his friend’s girlfriend worked at a convenience store and had been harassed one evening by Berkheimer. Respondent was not present in the store when the alleged misconduct occurred and he presented no witnesses corroborating his claim. He further contended that he observed Berkheimer touch a female’s leg in his office. Respondent, however, “did not bother” to question the woman concerning the incident, <em>id. </em>at 84, and did not cross-examine Berkheimer as to any allegations of harassment.

Respondent contends that his behavior amounted to nothing more than “arrogance” as he did not intend to deceive the DPW by recovering benefits that were unwarranted.

Moreover, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel presented evidence establishing that the information Respondent included on the forms was false.

We note that even at this stage of the proceeding, Respondent denies that he engaged in any wrongdoing and submits that he should not be subject to any form of discipline. This indicates that Respondent has no understanding of the potential damage he may have caused to the victims’ reputations and to the functioning of our legal system, which is based upon good faith representations to the court. Moreover, the false allegations against District Justice Farra and District Justice Berkheimer included attacks upon their performance of official duties. Such scandalous accusations erode the public confidence in the judicial system in general and in these District Justices in particular. This misconduct is ag<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>gravated by Respondent’s callous disregard for the truth as demonstrated by his misrepresentations set forth in the DPW medical evaluation forms.
