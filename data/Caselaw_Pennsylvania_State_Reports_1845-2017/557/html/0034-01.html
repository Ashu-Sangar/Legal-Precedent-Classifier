Each victim had suffered multiple gunshot wounds. Kim Ulrich, the victims’ next-door neighbor, was awakened by a telephone call at 2:24 that morning. The call lasted about 2.5 seconds. After Mrs. Ulrich picked up the telephone and said, “hello,” the caller stated, “call an ambulance—Terry shot Greg and me.” When Mrs. Ulrich queried “Sherri?” the caller failed to respond. <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>Mrs. Ulrich could not recall hearing any background noise or voices during the 2:24 a.m. call.</p>
