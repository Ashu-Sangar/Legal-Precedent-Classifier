The principal resigned at the end of the 1990-91 school year at which time the school board posted and advertised the vacancy. The school board interviewed DeFino and one other individual, an elementary principal in a neighboring school district, to fill the principal position. Both candidates were questioned about their experience, managerial style, attitude toward evaluating teachers, salary and willingness to transfer to another school. DeFino, <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>but not the other candidate, was asked about her union activities and her ability to make the transition from union official to school administrator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> At the conclusion of the interview process, the school board appointed the other candidate to the position.</p>

A hearing examiner conducted hearings on July 6, 1992, May 19, 1993, October 21, 1993, February 13, 1994, and May 2, 1994, and dismissed the charges on April 4, 1995. DeFino and the Association filed exceptions, which the PLRB sustained, holding that appellee had violated 43 P.S. § 1101.1201(a)(1) and (a)(3) which prohibit a public employer from interfering with an employee’s rights to be involved in an organized labor organization or from discriminating against an employee based upon the exercise of those rights. Appellee appealed to the common pleas court which affirmed the PLRB’s decision. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed holding that, because DeFino applied for a management position, she was not entitled to the protections of PERA during the application process.</p>

Appellee concedes that DeFino’s union activities and appellee’s belief that union sympathies would interfere with her ability to perform as a principal were factors leading to the hiring of the other candidate. Thus, appellee counters with the theory that PERA does not protect a public employee from anti-union animus when that employee applies for a management position that is not a promotional opportunity within the scope of the collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, this Court must determine whether PERA provides protections to a public employee who is a union member when the employee seeks a non-union, management position.</p>
