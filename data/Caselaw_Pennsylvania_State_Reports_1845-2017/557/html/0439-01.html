For the following reasons, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and reinstate the judgment of the common pleas court.</p>
    <p id="b573-6" data-blocks='[["BL_573.6",573,[257,799,1153,739]]]'>On September 11, 1989, Penn Paving, a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in the construction business, entered into a construction contract with the Public Parking Authority of the City of Pittsburgh for rehabilitation of the Mellon Square Parking Garage. On May 11, 1990, Penn Paving entered into a contract with the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh for site preparation of the Penn-Liberty Cultural District Site. Both contracts required that performance and payment bonds be issued on behalf of Penn Paving as the principal, naming the Public Parking Authority and Urban Redevelopment Authority as obligees respectively. Reliance Insurance Company and Reliance Surety Company (Appellees referred to collectively as Reliance) issued the performance and payment bonds in both contracts.</p>
    <p id="b573-7" data-blocks='[["BL_573.7",573,[255,1563,1153,578]]]'>The performance bonds issued in connection with the contracts provided that if Penn Paving failed to faithfully perform the contract and failed to satisfy claims arising therefrom, Reliance would be obligated to satisfy such claims up to the penal sum of the bond. The penal sum of the bond issued on the contract with the Public Parking Authority was $3,497,-123.45; and on the contract with the Urban Redevelopment Authority was $1,792,428. On December 20, 1990, Penn Paving gave written notice of default on both contracts. Because of the default, Reliance undertook as surety to complete the projects.</p>

In its <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>complaint, Reliance asserted that Penn Paving, by its president Rocco Scigliano, and Rocco Scigliano and Anna Scigliano, individually and as husband and wife, had agreed to indemnify and save harmless Reliance against all demands, claims, loss, costs, damages, expenses and attorneys fees and any liability therefor sustained or incurred by Reliance in connection with any bonds executed on behalf of Penn Paving, pursuant to an indemnification agreement that was executed on August 7, 1984. Reliance further asserted that, as a result of Penn Paving’s December 20, 1990 default on the two contracts, Rocco Scigliano had executed a second indemnification agreement on the date of default which also contained an obligation of Penn Paving and Rocco Scigliano to reimburse Reliance for any loss, cost or expense incurred in performing as a surety under the bonds. Anna Scigliano was not a signatory to the 1990 indemnification agreement. Reliance sought to recover damages in excess of $1.5 million plus interest and attorneys fees.</p>

It was asserted also that Reliance knew that Mrs. Scigliano had no involvement in the contracts which were the subject of Penn Paving’s default since she did not sign the bonds issued in connection therewith. Furthermore, it was asserted that Mrs. Scigliano was no longer an employee, officer or shareholder of Penn Paving.</p>

The issues of liability and damages were bifurcated.

    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[259,440,1152,365]]]'>Reliance rested its case on liability after introducing the documents into evidence. Appellants’ counsel stipulated that, if Reliance were able to establish damages, Penn Paving and Rocco Scigliano were liable for those damages. As to Mrs. Scigliano, however, counsel made a motion for the entry of a non-suit in her favor. The motion for non-suit was taken under advisement, but eventually was denied.</p>

Gusic. From 1973 to 1993, Gusic was employed by Edward F. Haldeman <em>&amp; </em>Associates, Inc. The Haldeman agency was the broker of record for the bonding requirements of Penn Paving.</p>

Mr. Scigliano testified that the amount of the bonding line procured from Reliance in 1984 was approximately $150,000 to $200,000. At that time, Anna Scigliano acted as the corporate secretary for Penn Paving.</p>
    <p id="b575-7" data-blocks='[["BL_575.7",575,[256,1627,1153,367]],["BL_576.1",576,[264,316,1155,95]]]'>The Sciglianos became estranged in 1986. Mr. Scigliano testified that he contacted Anthony Gusic to inform him during the divorce proceedings that Anna had demanded that she be removed from obligations to bonding and banking companies and that he secure new financing under his own name. Mr. Scigliano requested that a meeting with Reliance be scheduled to discuss the change. A meeting was later <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>arranged with Randy Leiminger, the bond manager for Reliance’s Pittsburgh office.</p>

Mr. Scigliano testified that when he met with Gusic and Leiminger, he informed them that Mrs. Scigliano was no longer obligated on the bonding line and that they had to see about bonding to be done on the basis of his own financial statements. Mr. Scigliano further testified that they indicated that he could get bonded because he was strong enough to get bonded without Mrs. Scigliano, and that from that day forward all financial statements were done in his name only. He stated that before 1986, the largest bonding line that Penn Paving had was for $500,000. In 1989 or 1990, Penn Paving had a bonding line for $3.5 million, followed eight months later by an additional bonding line of $1.9 million.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[260,1243,1161,786]]]'>Anthony Gusic testified that Reliance was the sole source of bonding for Penn Paving in the 1980s and through 1990, with the Haldeman agency as broker of record. Gusic was the primary individual who dealt with Reliance for Penn Paving. Gusic testified that he brought the fact of the Sciglianos’ estrangement to Reliance’s attention, that the purpose of the meeting with Leiminger was to discuss the divorce and Mr. Scigliano’s ability to handle bonds without Mrs. Scigliano, and that he felt it was clear at the meeting that Mrs. Scigliano was not involved with Penn Paving. Gusic also testified that after the meeting, Reliance did not make any requests for financial information relating to Mrs. Scigliano, although financial information relating to Mr. Scigliano and Penn Paving was requested. Reliance reviewed Mr. Scigliano’s financial statements on a fairly regular basis.</p>
    <p id="b576-6" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[260,2053,1158,307]],["BL_577.1",577,[262,309,1155,300]]]'>After the defense rested as to liability, Reliance called Randy Leiminger to testify. Leiminger, a Reliance bond manager from September 1986 to March 1993, was responsible for the production and underwriting of surety and fidelity bonds. Leiminger testified that Haldeman Associates was the broker of record for the Penn Paving account. As broker of <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>record, Haldeman was responsible for the ongoing servicing of the account. Haldeman administered the account on behalf of Reliance and would obtain the necessary financial information for Reliance. Leiminger testified that Haldeman would be speaking on behalf of Reliance in its dealings with the accounts.</p>
    <p id="b577-4" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[259,643,1155,512]]]'>Leiminger testified that he met Mr. Scigliano for the first time at the meeting with Gusic. Leiminger could not recall whether the pending divorce was discussed at that meeting, although he thought that the subject came up later in telephone conversations with Gusic. Leiminger’s recollection of the meeting was that they discussed the latest financial information that was in the file and that he asked Mr. Scigliano general questions about the progress of certain jobs. He described the meeting as a “general overall physical update on the account.”</p>

The trial judge found that the increase in the bonding line from approximately $150,000 to $200,000 when the 1984 Agreement was executed to an amount in excess of $5 million in 1990 was a material modification of Mrs. Scigliano’s risk under the 1984 Agreement.

Where, without the surety’s consent, there has been a material modification in the creditor-debtor relationship, a gratuitous (uncompensated) surety is completely discharged. A compensated surety is discharged only if, without the surety’s consent, there has been a material modification in the creditor-debtor relationship and said modification has substantially increased the surety’s risk.</blockquote>

Unlike the suretyship agreement in <em>Continental Bank, </em>which contained specific language that the sureties were obligated for the liabilities of any successor entity and waived notice of “any other fact which might materially increase their risk”, the 1984 Agreement signed by Mrs. Scigliano did not contain a waiver of any material modification of her risk of liability.</p>
