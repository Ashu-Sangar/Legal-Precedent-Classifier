This same argument, including citation to Nathaniel Hawthorne’s <em>The Scarlet Letter </em>(Random House 1950) (1850), was advanced before the <em>Artway </em>court and rejected.

We evaluate only registration, and that provision bears little resemblance to the Scarlet Letter. Registration simply requires Artway to provide a package of information to local law enforcement; registration does not involve public notification. Without this public element, Artway’s analogy fails. The Scarlet Letter and other punishments of “shame” and “ignominy” rely on the disgrace of an individual before his community. The act of registering with a discrete government entity, which is not authorized to release that information to the community at large (except in emergencies), cannot be compared to public humiliation. The officers who constitute local law enforcement, even if they are from Artway’s area, would constitute only a de minimis portion of that communi<a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>ty.

This information is given solely to the chief law enforcement officer of the police department having primary jurisdiction of the municipality in which the registrant resides. 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9793(c), 9799.1(4).

His address is given only to state and local, law enforcement personnel, who already have access to the information through Appellant’s criminal record. This information is to be verified annually and is not disseminated to the public. Notwithstanding the minor inconvenience Appellant may experience in verifying his address over a ten year period, it is difficult to fathom how the effects of this requirement could be characterized as “so harsh” as constituting punishment for purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and we do not view them as such.</p>
