To cure the concrete, Madison applied a compound known as Euco Floor Coat or Eucocure. While this was being done, the construction area was enclosed in an “envelope” of polyethylene sheeting. According to his subsequently filed complaint, Nicholas Ezzi, a Boeing employee, was summoned to the construction area to investigate a strong odor.

Although the absolute version of the pollution exclusion clause, unlike its predecessor, did not include language specifying a discharge of pollutants “into or upon land, the atmosphere or any water course or body of water ...,” the court was convinced by its review of the exclusion’s history that the omission was of no moment. Thus, the court reasoned “that any ‘discharge, dispersal, release, or escape’ of a pollutant must be into the environment in order to trigger the pollution exclusion clause <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>and deny coverage to the insured” and that the discharge at issue, “confined to a cooler within a chicken processing plant,” did not qualify. <em>Id. </em>at 325, <a href="/citations/?q=409%20S.E.2d%20692" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="409 S.E.2d 692">409 S.E.2d at 700</a>. Persuaded by the North Carolina court’s analysis, the trial court in the present case concluded that since the alleged pollutant, Euco Floor Coat, had been contained within the polyethylene envelope at all times, there had been no discharge of the substance into the environment and therefore no event to which the pollution exclusion clause applied.</p>

In <em>Haver, </em>a pharmacist obtained an insurance policy which expressly excluded coverage for bodily injuries which are a consequence of "knowing endangerment” by the pharmacist. The pharmacist was later sued by a husband and wife who sought to recover for injuries that they allegedly sustained because the pharmacist improperly dispensed various prescription drugs to the wife without any prescriptions. The pharmacist's insurance carrier refused to defend against the lawsuit, contending that the pharmacist’s actions triggered the "knowing endangerment” exclusion contained within his insurance policy. The lower courts disagreed, and found that the insurance carrier had a duty to defend the pharmacist, because the claims raised by the plaintiffs in their complaint did not allege "knowing endangerment” by the pharmacist, but only negligence on his part. This Court reversed, finding that despite the fact that the plaintiffs’ complaint was based on negligence theory, the factual allegations contained within the complaint constituted "knowing endangerment” as a matter of law. Underlying the Court's decision in <em>Haver </em>was its concern that a contrary result would encourage plaintiffs to frame their requests for redress in order to avoid exclusions in liability insurance policies despite the fact that the harms that they allege fall clearly within those same policy exclusions. Conversely, the claims leveled by Ezzi against Madison are in complete accord with the facts that he <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>alleges in his complaint.
