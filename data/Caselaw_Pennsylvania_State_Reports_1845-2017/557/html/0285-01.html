Subsection (1) of Section 9793(b) lists applicable predicate offenses where the victim is a minor.

Under the statute, intent was not an element of the crime, but had bearing only on the appropriate punishment category. As a result, “Maine could impose a life sentence for any felonious homicide—even one that traditionally might be considered involuntary manslaughter—unless the defendant was able to prove that his act was neither intentional nor criminally reckless.” <em>Mullaney, </em><a href="/us/421/0684-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="421 U.S. 684" data-case-ids="541415" data-case-paths="/us/421/0684-01">421 U.S. at 699</a>, <a href="/us/421/0684-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="421 U.S. 684" data-case-ids="541415" data-case-paths="/us/421/0684-01">95 S.Ct. 1881</a> (emphasis <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>in original) (footnote omitted).

In the present case the situation is quite different.... Section 9712 neither alters the maximum penalty for the crime committed nor creates a separate offense calling for a separate penalty; it operates solely to limit the sentencing court’s discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it without the specified finding of visible possession of a firearm. Section 9712 “ups the ante” for the defendant only by raising to five years the minimum sentence which may be imposed within the statutory plan. The statute gives no impression of having been tailored to permit the visible possession finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense. Petitioner’s claim that visible possession under the Pennsylvania statute is “really” an element of the offenses for which they are being punished—that Pennsylvania has in effect defined a new set of upgraded felonies—-would have at least more superficial appeal if a finding of visible possession exposed them to greater or additional punishment.. .but it does not.</blockquote>

Specifically, the court is faced with factually determining whether the convicted offender is a person who “due to a mental abnormality or personality disorder ... [is] likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9792. The Act defines mental abnormality as “[a] congenital or acquired condition of a person that affects the emotional or volitional capacity of the person in a manner that predisposes that person to the commission of criminal sexual acts to a degree that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of other persons.” <em><a href="/us/477/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="477 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="6203837" data-case-paths="/us/477/0079-01">Id.</a></em>

Moreover, a subsequent conviction subjects the offender to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9799.4(c).

While there are many differences between New Jersey’s registration and notification provisions and the Act established by our Legislature, many relevant similarities exist between the two statutes. For example, similar to our Act, under the statutory scheme set forth by New Jersey’s Legislature, all persons convicted of a designated predicate crime involving sexual assault are subjected to certain registration requirements.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Pursuant to New Jersey’s scheme, this information provides a basis for further community notification. The prosecutor of the county where the registrant intends to reside and the prosecutor from the county of conviction then use the registration information to assess the risk of re-offense by a registrant. Three tiers regarding a registrant’s likelihood of re-<a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>offending are established, tier 1 representing a low risk of re-offense and tier 3 representing a high risk.</p>

Tier 2 and 3 require more extensive public notification to schools, community organizations, day care centers and other organizations. Unlike our Act, New Jersey’s Act does not provide for an increase in the mandatory maximum sentence for those found to be at a moderate (tier 2) or high (tier 3) risk for re-offending.</p>

Here, the Act affords an offender every single protection which the United States Supreme Court mentioned in <em>Specht. </em>Under the Act, an offender is provided notice and is entitled to be present, to have counsel, either private or court-appointed, to be heard, to confront the witnesses against him, to cross-examine, and to present his own evidence including expert testimony.

The majority concludes that, because an offender is already presumed to be a sexually violent predator upon being convicted of a predicate offense, he is afforded no due process regarding this finding.
