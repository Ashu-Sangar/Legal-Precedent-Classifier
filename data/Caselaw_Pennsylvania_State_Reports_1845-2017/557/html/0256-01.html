For the reasons stated herein, we determine that the prosecutor’s questions were permissible. Accordingly, we determine that the Superior Court erred in reversing appellee’s convictions.</p>

In the early months of 1989, the co-conspirators robbed several banks and stores in Philadelphia. All four were eventually arrested and each gave statements to police implicating appellee as the ring-leader in all of the robberies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Specifically, on February 10, 1989, Robert Reynolds and James Scott committed an armed robbery of Germantown Savings Bank at Front and Olney Streets in Philadelphia. Mason Reynolds waited outside the bank in the escape vehicle, <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>which was appellee’s track.
