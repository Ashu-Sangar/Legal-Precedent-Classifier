    <p id="b232-16" data-blocks='[["BL_232.15",232,[240,1611,1159,528]]]'>On April 16, 1992 the Philadelphia Department of Human Services (DHS), acting on behalf of T.R., who was ten months old at the time, sought a restraining order, alleging that the child had been admitted to the hospital on two occasions in April of 1992 for eye injuries. The parents were unable to explain the injuries. Another child in the home had previous suffered similar eye injuries, resulting in his being blinded in one eye. The court issued a restraining order and continued the temporary commitment for the child, who remained in foster care. The parents then separated.</p>
    <p id="b232-17" data-blocks='[["BL_232.16",232,[240,2165,1159,206]],["BL_233.1",233,[244,302,1151,628]]]'>On May 17, 1993, the court adjudicated T.R. dependent, discharged the temporary commitment, and placed the child in his mother’s custody with DHS supervision. Social workers were assigned to work with the mother in an attempt to <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>improve her ability to be a parent. At a dependency review hearing on April 19, 1994, evidence was introduced that in March of 1994 T.R. suffered a fractured rib. An examination also revealed three previously fractured ribs. Additionally, the child required hospital treatment in 1994 for back bruises. Four children were in the home, and the mother claimed that the two older boys had broken T.R.’s ribs and inflicted his back injuries. As a result of information received at this hearing the trial court ordered the mother to undergo a psychological evaluation to determine whether she was able to care for the children. The mother objected to this examination, but submitted to the evaluation in spite of her objection.</p>
    <p id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[244,955,1153,953]]]'>At a hearing on May 12, 1994, DHS requested a restraining order for all four children, alleging that they were at risk of harm while in the mother’s care. Prior to adjudicating the request for the restraining order, the court ordered that the psychologist’s report be sealed pending the receipt of memoranda of law on the question of whether the court had the power to order the psychological examination. As the hearing continued, a social worker testified that he was concerned for all four of the children in the mother’s care, one of whom besides T.R. had suffered a fracture and another of whom suffered an eye injury resulting in blindness in one eye. Another social worker testified that the mother told her that she suffered from migraine headaches. The mother had black eyes from when she blacked out and hit her head. The mother also indicated to the social worker that she was under a lot of stress. At the close of the hearing, the court issued a restraining order temporarily placing all four children in the custody of DHS pending a detention hearing.</p>
    <p id="b233-6" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[243,1933,1153,408]],["BL_234.1",234,[239,297,1158,519]]]'>On May 13, 1994 a detention hearing was conducted. At this hearing, a social worker testified that two children told him that the mother beat the nine year old and the five year old boys with belts, hair combs, brushes and a plunger, but that T.R., the youngest, was not beaten. Another social worker testified that she had seen black and blue marks on T.R.’s back. The mother told her T.R. had fallen. The social worker also testified that the mother would at times use “time <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>out” as discipline for whole days. In summarizing the evidence, the court stated that the older children had beaten T.R., who had four fractures; that two of the children indicated that the mother beat them with various implements; that the mother had blackouts; that T.R. had eye injuries and that one of his siblings was blind in one eye from injuries; that T.R. had bruises to the lower back; and that the mother did not attend parenting classes. Accordingly, the court temporarily committed the children to DHS pending an adjudicatory hearing.</p>

On July 27, 1994, the court adjudicated the other three children dependent, discharged the temporary commitment, and committed them to the custody of DHS.</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[237,1117,1159,361]]]'>On September 29, 1994, the trial court ruled that it had the power to compel a psychological examination of the mother and to release the results of the examination to the parties in order to effect the proper placement of the child and to keep families together. However, at the request of counsel, the court stayed its order for thirty days to allow the mother to appeal the order of a psychological examination.</p>

Superior Court held that courts must interpret the Juvenile Act broadly to provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of children, and to preserve the family unit where possible. It then determined that the lower court properly exercised its broad discretionary powers in ordering the psychological examination of the mother. Further, Superior Court held that “the psychological evaluation was the least restrictive means to obtain information about appellant’s care-taking ability because the other methods of obtaining such information were either limited or failed to provide the necessary information.” 665 A.2d at 1267. It also held that “there was no alternative reasonable method of lesser intrusion than the release of appellant’s evaluation to the parties because the information obtained from the parenting and disciplinary strategy sessions was inadequate.” 665 <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>A.2d at 1268. The Superior Court concluded that there was no violation of Article 1 § 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution “because the state’s compelling interest of protecting T.R.’s future well-being and familial reunification outweighed appellant’s privacy intrusion.” 665 A.2d at 1268. Thus, Superior Court concluded that the results of the psychological examination were to be released to the parties and that this did not violate the mother’s constitutional right to privacy because the information was necessary to carry out the purposes of the act.</p>

The mother’s psychiatrist refused to release the mother’s medical records in the absence of her consent and the lower court held the psychiatrist in contempt. We reversed, holding that the mother’s right of privacy precluded the release of psychiatric records in this context. This court specifically recognized “that our holding may, in some cases, make it more difficult for the court to obtain all the information it might desire regarding members of the juvenile’s family, or about the juvenile’s friends, neighbors, and associates.

Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/538/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="538 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="475497" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0052-01">538 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/pa/538/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="645 A.2d 836" data-case-ids="475497,7867150" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0052-01,/a2d/645/0836-01">645 A.2d 836</a> (1994)(the standard in custody proceedings is best interests of the child); <em>Oeler v.

This universal legal axiom, the best interests of the child, is implicit in the statement of purpose of the Juvenile Act and informs our interpretation of it. Hence, the statutory interpretation that “will encourage, rather than discourage, action related to the best interests and protection of the child, is preferred.” <em>In re Lowry, </em><a href="/pa/506/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="506 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1790981" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0121-01">506 Pa. 121</a>, 130-31, <a href="/pa/506/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="506 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1790981" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0121-01">484 A.2d 383</a>, 388 (1984).

The limitations in Section 6307 promote the Commonwealth’s goal of making the most informed placement decision, but are narrowly tailored to prevent any significant violation of a parent’s privacy. I believe that there is no less intrusive method to achieve the Commonwealth’s compelling interest. The psychological evaluation is only permitted in situations where the trial court concludes that routine observation and assessment methods fail to describe accurately the parent’s psychological problems, and the children continue to suffer physical injury. The psychological evaluation is then reviewed <em>in camera </em>to enable the trial judge to make the educated determination of its relevance and its ability to change untenable situations. The psychological evaluation will then only be distributed to those parties that the General Assembly, pursuant to Section 6307, deemed appropriate to review the evaluation.</p>
