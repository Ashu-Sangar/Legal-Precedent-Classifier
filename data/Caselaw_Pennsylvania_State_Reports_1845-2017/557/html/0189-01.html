(Deposition of Dr. Scott Celin, dated April 10, 1996.) In his deposition, Dr. Celin stated that Appellant had sustained serious injuries in the accident, including penetration by a blunt object which entered his face to the left of his mouth, through the nasal cavity and into the rear of the right eye socket. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The object penetrated Appellant’s head a distance of six inches and caused multiple fractures. <em>Id. </em>at 10. These injuries were so severe that Dr. Celin likened them to a gunshot wound. <em>Id. </em>Also, Dr. Celin noted Appellant was probably rendered unconscious by the injuries, and that he suffered from amnesia after the accident. Finally, Dr. Celin opined that within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, it was his opinion that Appellant would not have been able to comprehend questions presented to him immediately after the accident, the time period when the arresting officer asked Appellant to submit to testing. <em>Id. </em>at 13. On cross examination, Dr. Celin did state that when he examined Appellant six or seven hours after the accident, part of Appellant’s cognitive impairment was due to the ingestion of alcohol. <em>Id. </em>at 17. On re-direct, however, Dr. Celin testified that in his experience, patients who have sustained facial trauma “are just in a foggy state of mind whether or not they’ve been intoxicated.” <em>Id. </em>at 21.

In order to meet its burden, “the Commonwealth must establish that the driver involved: (1) was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol; (2) was asked to submit to chemical testing; (3) refused to do so; and (4) was specifically warned that a refusal would result in the revocation of his driver’s license.” <em>Commonwealth, Dept. of Transportation v.

The only issue presented is whether Appellant had established that he had been unable to make a knowing and conscious refusal to take the test. The Commonwealth Court has held that where the Commonwealth has established the four <em>Ingram </em>factors that a licensee may prevent his license from being suspended only if he can establish by “competent medical evidence” that a medical condition, unrelated to the consumption of alcohol, rendered his refusal unknowing. <em>See Commonwealth, Dept. of Transportation v. Peck, </em>132 Pa.Cmwlth. 509, <a href="/pa-commw/132/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="573 A.2d 645" data-case-ids="1401176" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/132/0509-01">573 A.2d 645</a>, 647 (1990). Over the years, the Commonwealth Court has refined its interpretation of what constitutes “competent medical evidence” in this arena so that it now <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>requires that the expert medical testimony must be certain and essentially without doubt in order for it to be sufficient to establish that the licensee’s refusal was unconscious and unknowing. <em>See, e.g., Plotts v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Transportation, </em><a href="/a2d/660/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="660 A.2d 133" data-case-ids="7866234" data-case-paths="/a2d/660/0133-01">660 A.2d 133</a> (Pa.Commw.Ct.1995) and <em>Commonwealth, Dept. of Transportation v.

    </p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.4",326,[247,775,1161,851]]]'>We find that this standard is a deviation from the norm. Traditionally, for medical evidence to be deemed competent, a litigant’s expert witness need only tender an opinion with a <em>reasonable degree </em>of medical certainty. <em>See Mitzelfelt v. Kamrin, </em><a href="/pa/526/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="526 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1825965" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0054-01">526 Pa. 54</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="526 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1825965" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0054-01">584 A.2d 888</a> (1990). We find that this standard is far better adapted to the realities of the practice of medicine than is the standard developed by <em>Plotts </em>and <em>Mon-say. </em>Medicine is an art, the practice of which is dependent upon computing probabilities rather than ascertaining absolute certainties. Requiring a physician to deliver an absolute opinion on a medical question ignores the nature of medicine. Thus, we find that the “reasonable degree of medical certainty” standard is applicable in the license revocation arena, and therefore determine that the Commonwealth Court erred as a matter of law when it imposed the more onerous standard as developed by <em>Plotts </em>and <em>Monsay.</em>
