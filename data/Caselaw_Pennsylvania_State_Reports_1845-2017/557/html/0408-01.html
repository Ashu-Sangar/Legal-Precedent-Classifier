    <p id="b545-4" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[270,1547,1154,417]]]'>This case has a somewhat complicated procedural history. On July 1, 1988, a jury convicted Gary Heidnik of two counts of murder in the first degree, six counts of kidnapping, five counts of rape, four counts of aggravated assault and two counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Following a sentencing hearing, the jury returned two verdicts of death against Heidnik. On March 2, 1989, the trial court formally imposed the sentences of death.</p>

However, during the pendency of his direct appeal, Heidnik expressed a desire to have his execution carried out as quickly as possible, and instructed his attorney to abandon his appeal. Despite Heidnik’s wishes to completely abandon his appeal, this Court retained jurisdiction over the matter, and conducted a statute<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>rily mandated review of the sufficiency of the evidence and the proportionality of Heidnik’s death sentences. Concluding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdicts against Heidnik, and that his death sentences were neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, this Court sustained Heidnik’s convictions for first degree murder and affirmed his sentences of death. <em>Commonwealth v.

On April 16, 1997, this Court entered a per curiam order staying Heidnik’s execution until further order of this Court. Meanwhile, federal district court judge Franklin S. Van Antwerpen granted a temporary stay of execution, and conducted an emergency evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not Heidnik was competent to litigate his own cause. Following the hearing, the district court issued an order denying relief, but continuing its stay of execution pending an appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. On appeal, the Third Circuit reversed the district court’s decision, holding that Heidnik was incompetent to litigate his own cause, and that Appellant should be granted next friend status to appeal on his behalf. The Commonwealth appealed the Third Circuit’s decision to the United States Supreme Court, which issued an order vacating the order staying Heidnik’s execution on April 19, 1997.</p>

In addressing the question. of Appellant’s standing as Heidnik’s next friend, the PCRA court apparently assumed that Appellant, as Heidnik’s daughter, had a significant relationship with Heidnik and was truly dedicated to his best interests. Therefore, the PCRA court turned its attention to the question of whether or not Appellant could establish that Heidnik was incompetent to litigate his own cause and waive his appellate rights. In order to assist it in determining whether or not Heidnik was competent to litigate his own cause and waive his appeals, the PCRA court appointed court psychiatrist Dr. O’Brien to conduct a psychiatric evaluation of Heidnik. The PCRA court also permitted both the Commonwealth and Appellant to have their own mental health experts attend and participate in the psychiatric evaluation of Heidnik.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Following the joint psychiatric evaluation of Heidnik, each of the mental health experts issued a report and testified before the PCRA court concerning their respective findings and opinions. In addition, the PCRA court heard some testimony from Heidnik himself. Thereafter, on April 27, 1999, the PCRA court issued an oral ruling in which it concluded that Heidnik was competent to litigate his own cause and waive his appellate rights, and therefore, that Appellant lacked standing to bring a PCRA petition on Heidnik’s behalf as his next friend.

First, Appellant presents several challenges to the validity of the PCRA court’s determination that Appellant did not have standing to file a PCRA petition on Heidnik’s behalf as his next friend because Heidnik was competent to litigate his own cause and forego seeking appellate relief. In addition, Appellant raises seventeen substantive PCRA issues concerning Heidnik’s trial. Each of Appellant’s claims challenging the validity of the proceedings in the PCRA court are considered below. However, as we find that the PCRA court properly determined that Appellant lacks standing to file a PCRA petition on Heidnik’s behalf, we do not reach the seventeen substantive PCRA issues raised by Appellant.</p>

In the above-<a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>cited portion of the record, Judge Poserina explicitly states that he came to an independent judgment regarding Heidnik’s competency to litigate his own cause and waive his appellate rights based on the record before him. In addition, we believe that Judge Poserina’s comment regarding his conversations with his daughter and other doctors makes clear that those conversations took place prior to the commencement of the instant case, and were completely unrelated to the matter at hand.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In short, Judge Poserina’s above-cited comment indicates that his understanding of the competency issue before him was aided “a little bit” by the prior unrelated conversations, but that he came to an independent judgment regarding Heidnik’s competency based solely on the record before him.</p>

In addition, this Court is not inclined to countenance a rule that the judges of this Commonwealth must ignore the general knowledge that they bring to the bench with them. Accordingly, Appellant is not entitled to relief based on this claim.</p>

After Appellant filed the instant PCRA petition on Heidnik’s behalf, Judge Poserina again appointed Dr. O’Brien as a court expert, and directed him to conduct another psychiatric evaluation of Heidnik. However, this time Judge Poserina used Dr. O’Brien’s evaluation of Heidnik to assist him in determining whether Heidnik was competent to litigate his own cause and waive his appellate rights.

The Commonwealth counters Appellant’s assertion that Dr. O’Brien was a witness for the Commonwealth during the federal district court proceedings by pointing out that he was directed to appear and testify at those proceedings by Judge Van Antwerpen.

We do not find that Dr. O’Brien’s conduct during the federal district court proceedings, in and of itself, would disqualify the PCRA court from considering appointing Dr. O’Brien to conduct a psychiatric evaluation of Heidnik. Furthermore, a review of the record reveals that several legitimate reasons support Judge Poserina’s decision to appoint Dr. O’Brien as a court expert in the instant case. First, Judge Poserina noted that Dr. O’Brien provided an initial psychiatric evaluation of Heidnik during the 1997 litigation initiated by CLEADA, and was therefore in a unique position to identify and ascertain the gravity of any subsequent changes in his mental condition. N.T., 12/14/98, at 23-4. In addition, Judge Poserina recognized that Dr. O’Brien’s dual background as a medical doctor and an attorney, his years of experience in the criminal system as a court psychiatrist, and the fact that he had been retained in the past as both an expert witness for the Commonwealth and for criminal defendants, made him exceptionally qualified to provide expert assistance to the judge in determining whether Heidnik was competent to litigate his own cause and waive his appellate rights.

Finally, Appellant argues that Judge Poserina’s conduct during the course of the proceedings below establish his fixed bias against capital defendants seeking PCRA review.</p>
    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[266,925,1153,851]]]'>Having reviewed Appellant’s allegations of bias, we are unpersuaded that Judge Poserina abused his discretion by denying the motion for recusal. Although in the past Judge Poserina may have voiced his displeasure with what he perceived to be eleventh-hour PCRA petitions designed solely to delay execution, we are not convinced that his comments evidence a fixed bias against all capital defendants seeking PCRA review. Rather, Judge Poserina’s comments cited by Appellant concern specific PCRA petitions that the judge found lacked merit. In addition, our review of the record below reveals that Judge Poserina presided over the proceedings in a fair and impartial manner, and gave Appellant every reasonable opportunity to establish her entitlement to standing to file a PCRA petition on Heidnik’s behalf as his next friend. Accordingly, we conclude that Judge Poserina did not abuse his discretion by denying Appellant’s recusal motion.</p>
    <p id="b559-6" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[265,1826,1154,257]]]'>Next, Appellant claims that the PCRA court denied her meaningful access to the courts by refusing to provide her with a complimentary copy of the notes of testimony for purposes of preparing her post-hearing memorandum of law because she is indigent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> We disagree.</p>

      <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>It is well-settled that “[i]n order to assure that a [criminal] defendant’s right to appeal will not be an empty, illusory right, we require that he or she be furnished a full transcript or other equivalent picture of the trial proceedings.” <em>Commonwealth v. Shields, </em><a href="/pa/477/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="477 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1738318" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0105-01">477 Pa. 105</a>, 108, <a href="/pa/477/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="477 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1738318" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0105-01">383 A.2d 844</a>, 846 (1978). However, Appellant is not an indigent criminal defendant appealing from his or her own conviction. Rather, Appellant is a third party who unsuccessfully sought standing to file a PCRA petition on behalf of Heidnik as his next friend. Appellant presents no persuasive argument or case law in support of her novel position that indigent third parties who unsuccessfully seek standing to file a PCRA petition on behalf of a criminal defendant as his or her next friend are somehow entitled to free notes of testimony to facilitate their appeals. Accordingly, we find that Appellant is not entitled to relief based on this claim.</p>
    <p id="b560-5" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[225,1187,1157,358]]]'>Appellant’s final challenge to the validity of the competency proceedings below is that the PCRA court denied Gary Heidnik the assistance of counsel by refusing to disqualify his attorney, A. Charles Peruto, Jr., from participating in the proceedings as Heidnik’s counsel. However, as Appellant lacks standing to challenge Peruto’s representation of Heidnik, she is not entitled to relief based on this claim.</p>
    <p id="b560-6" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[220,1578,1161,581]]]'>Appellant’s instant claim is predicated on her contention that A. Charles Peruto, Jr.’s representation of Heidnik is tainted by an ongoing and egregious conflict of interest. We need not consider the merits of Appellant’s contention, however, as she is in no position to challenge the validity of Heidnik’s choice of attorneys. As the PCRA court properly determined that Appellant lacks standing to file a PCRA petition on Heidnik’s behalf as his next friend, Appellant cannot have standing on appeal to this Court to contest the PCRA court’s refusal to override Heidnik’s decision to continue to be represented by Mr. Peruto.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
