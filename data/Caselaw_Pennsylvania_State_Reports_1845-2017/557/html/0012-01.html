Ms. Craig’s automobile was found along a roadway in Chichester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on the night of her disappearance, and her severely beaten body was found the next day in a nearby church parking lot. The Commonwealth supported its case against Appellant with scientific evidence based on body fluids, testimony regarding Appellant’s suspicious behavior toward Ms. Craig in the week preceding the crime, and incriminating statements made by Appellant to various persons, including a fellow inmate. After finding one aggravating circumstance (namely, that Appellant had committed the killing while perpetrating a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6)) which outweighed any mitigating circumstances, the jury returned a verdict of death. Appellant filed post-verdict motions, which were denied, and the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (“the trial court”) formally imposed the sentence of death.</p>

This Court granted the petition and remanded the case to the trial court on March 15, 1984. After several delays caused by the inability of the court-appointed psychiatrist to examine Appellant, the trial court scheduled the evidentiary hearing for February 20, 1985. However, while Appellant was being transported from the State Correctional Institution in Huntingdon to Delaware County for the hearing, he escaped. Upon petition of the Commonwealth, and because the hearing could not be held in Appellant’s absence, the trial court returned the record to this Court so that consideration of Appellant’s direct appeal could proceed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

This motion was not entered on the trial court docket, however, and neither the trial judge nor the District Attorney had any record of having received such a motion. Appellant subsequently filed with this Court a <em>pro se </em>petition for review asking that the trial court be compelled to act on the allegedly outstanding motion for a new trial.

As it had before, the district court dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust state remedies. Appellant appealed the dismissal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. On October 12, 1993, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the matter to the district court to determine whether there had been an unreasonable delay in the consideration of Appellant’s claims by the trial court.</p>

The court also directed Appellant to file, within 10 days, a written statement specifying any other issues that he believed to be outstanding or that he desired to raise before the court, and to be prepared on April 6 “to proceed on every such issue.”</p>

The trial court denied the request, noting that Appellant and his counsel had been given almost two months to prepare for the hearing and that the Commonwealth was prepared to call the witnesses requested by Appellant. The court also stated that the motion for a new trial should properly be considered a petition for relief pursuant to the PCRA.
