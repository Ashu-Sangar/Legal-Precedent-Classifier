In <em>Keystone Savings, </em>as in <em>Klebach </em>and <em>Fidelity Bank, </em>the holding of the court that the property was held <em>in custodia legis </em>was premised on the fact that Keystone made its loan and attempted to execute on its judgment while the divorce proceedings were pending and before there was equitable distribution of the marital property. Here, as noted <em><a href="/pa-super/335/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="335 Pa.

In fact, Mid-State had no relationship with Johnson nor any interest in the Property until more than seven years after Blesh conveyed the Property to Johnson pursuant to the Equitable Distribution Order. Thus, Blesh advocates not only “expanding] the doctrine [of <em>custodia legis </em>] to unprecedented proportions so that it encompasses all of a couple’s property <em>prior to </em>equitable distribution proceedings,” she would have the doctrine apply for years <em>after </em>the marital property has been equitably distributed.

In this case, however, holding the Property <em>in custodia legis </em>for fifteen years or more would encumber the Property for an inordinate length of time. Such a result is inconsistent with both the history and purpose of the doctrine of <em>custodia legis </em>and the public policy of this Commonwealth. Accordingly, we hold that the Property was not <em>in custodia legis </em>when Mid-State recorded its mortgage lien and subsequently confessed judgment against Johnson.</p>

The deed noted that Johnson acquired the Property pursuant to an order of equitable distribution, but there was no mention of a lien and no reference “giving the court, the date, and the number and term” of the Equitable Distribution Order as required by 21 P.S. § 402. Blesh attempted to establish record notice of her interest in the Property by recording the Equitable Distribution Order, but she was too late to put Mid-State on notice because Mid-State recorded its mortgage lien on August 24,1994, and Blesh did not record the Equitable Distribution Order until September 14, 1994.</p>

Thus, under Blesh’s rule, a title searcher who discovered any mention of a divorce or equitable distribution anywhere in a chain of title would then have a duty to seek unrecorded court records, some of which may be sealed, destroyed, or otherwise unavailable, to determine whether some unknown person may have an interest in the property.
