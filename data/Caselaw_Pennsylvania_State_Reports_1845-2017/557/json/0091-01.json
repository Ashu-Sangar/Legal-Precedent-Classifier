        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of Commonwealth Court which affirmed a decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County holding that the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center (HMC) is immune from real estate tax on the basis that its owner, the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth. Challenging PSU\u2019s status as an agent of the Commonwealth, the County of Dauphin and the Derry Township School District, appellants, contest HMC\u2019s tax-free status.\nPSU is the owner and operator of HMC, which is located in Derry Township, Dauphin County. HMC encompasses PSU\u2019s medical school, its dormitories, various related research facilities and two hospitals.\nThis case arose when taxing authorities of the county and school district notified PSU that, as of January 1, 1993, the property of HMC would be placed on the tax rolls. Real estate tax bills were later issued for the years 1993, 1994, and 1995.\nIt is well established that real estate owned by the Commonwealth cannot be subjected to taxation by political subdivisions absent express statutory authority. Appeal of Board of School Directors of Owen J. Roberts School District, 500 Pa. 465, 467-68, 457 A.2d 1264, 1265 (1983). The immunity from tax extends to property owned by agencies of the Commonwealth. Id.\nIn Pennsylvania State University v. County of Centre, 532 Pa. 142, 615 A.2d 303 (1992), we discussed, but did not decide, whether PSU is an agency of the Commonwealth. The issue in that appeal was simply whether the doctrine of issue preclusion prevented the trial court from determining PSU\u2019s status as an agent, since, many years before, in 1939, there had been a determination of the same question by a trial court of the same judicial district. Nevertheless, we noted that significant changes have taken place in the university over the past fifty or more years, and that:\nTo begin with, University students now pay tuition, unlike their counterparts in 1939, and state appropriations have decreased as a percentage of total University revenues, resulting in the fact that the University\u2019s principal means of support are no longer state and federal funds but private and federal funds. In addition, the composition of the Board of Directors is no longer public\u2014much less governmental\u2014in nature, and therefore, authority to dispose of University property is not within the purview of the Commonwealth. Appellate courts in this Commonwealth have found these and similar factors to be characteristics of a nonprofit corporation chartered for educational purposes\u2014 not an agency of the Commonwealth.\nThe University ... is no longer the same institution that it was in 1939. In view of the wholly changed circumstances and the significant passage of time, the first decision [of the trial court holding that PSU is an agency of the Commonwealth] is marginal at best.\n532 Pa. at 149-50, 615 A.2d at 306-07 (footnotes omitted). These factors lead us now to conclude that PSU is not an agency of the Commonwealth.\nIn contrast to the fourteen universities that are owned and operated by the Commonwealth as the State System of Higher Education, the latter being a public corporation that has been statutorily designated a government instrumentality, 24 P.S. \u00a7 20-2002-A(a), the relationship of PSU to the Commonwealth is far more autonomous.\nPSU is a state-related institution of higher education that traces its roots to a legislative enactment that created and designated it, in 1855, the Farmers\u2019 High School of Pennsylvania, for the education of youth in science, agriculture, and other fields of learning. 24 P.S. \u00a7 2531. The intent was to prepare youths to pursue occupations in farming. 24 P.S. \u00a7 2542. In 1862, the institution was renamed the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania. That same year, the federal government, pursuant to the Morrill Land Grant Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-308, made available to each state land to be sold to support at least one college providing instruction in both agriculture and mechanical arts. In 1863, the Commonwealth received property under this act and directed that funds derived therefrom be paid to the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania. The college was renamed the Pennsylvania State College in 1874, and, in 1953, the name was changed to PSU. Ever since 1863, the Commonwealth has made annual appropriations of funds to support the institution. For example, in the fiscal years 1994-1995 and 1995-1996 respectively, appropriations totaled approximately $256.8 million and $275 million. In addition, the Commonwealth has constructed many of the educational facilities at PSU, these being buildings valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. A further benefit has been provided via an exemption from tax within the Commonwealth for bonds issued by land grant institutions of learning. 24 P.S. \u00a7 2575.1. These benefits have allowed PSU to provide lower tuition and fees for students who are residents of Pennsylvania.\nThe mere funding of an institution does not, however, make it an agency or instrumentality of the state. Mooney v. Temple Univ. Bd. of Trustees, 448 Pa. 424, 429-30, 292 A.2d 395, 398-99 (1972). The Commonwealth funds countless programs and institutions, but few of these are so closely aligned with the government as to be agencies thereof. The difficulty in determining the status of PSU arises from the fact that it is not merely funded by the Commonwealth, but in certain very limited respects it has governmental characteristics, while in other regards it is plainly non-governmental. This dichotomy is illustrated by, for example, the fact that PSU employees are included within the definition of \u201cstate employees\u201d under the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Code, 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5102, but, for purposes of what is commonly referred to as the Right to Know Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 66.1-66.4, which provides that public records of state agencies shall be open to examination by citizens of Pennsylvania, PSU has been held not to be a state agency. See Roy v. Pennsylvania State University, 180 Pa.Cmwlth. 468, 568 A.2d 751 (1990). The courts below thoroughly described this as well as other aspects of the divergent manner in which PSU has, for various purposes, been classified as an agency or non-agency of the Commonwealth. Other than to illustrate the dichotomy, however, such an approach is not helpful to the analysis. This is because an entity\u2019s status as an agency or instrumentality varies, depending on the issue for which the determination is being made.\nWith regard to immunity from real estate taxes, we view the pivotal factor to be whether the institution\u2019s real property is so thoroughly under the control of the Commonwealth, that, effectively, the institution\u2019s property functions as Commonwealth property. PSU\u2019s property does not meet this test. The reason lies in the composition of the institution\u2019s board of trustees. When determining whether an institution is an agency or instrumentality of the government, we must consider whether the Commonwealth has majority control of the board. Mooney, 448 Pa. at 431, 292 A.2d at 399.\nThe board of trustees of PSU is not governmental in nature. It is composed of thirty-two members, only ten of whom are public officials. The latter consist of six members appointed by the governor, and, as ex officio members, the governor, the secretary of education, the secretary of agriculture, and the secretary of environmental resources. Thus, governmental representation on the board constitutes only a minority interest. Majority control rests in the hands of the twenty-two members that include the president of the university, nine members elected by alumni, and twelve members elected by various agricultural and industrial societies. In contrast, universities that are part of the State System of Higher Education, supra, are subject to the system\u2019s board of governors, all of whom are governmental appointees, 24 P.S. \u00a7 20-2004-A(a), and all members of the council of trustees of each of the institutions are appointed by the governor, 24 P.S. \u00a7 20-2008-A (a), (b). Given the composition of the board of trustees of PSU, it is clear that the authority to control and dispose of PSU property is not within the purview of the Commonwealth. See 24 P.S. \u00a7 2533 (power to acquire and dispose of real property rests with the PSU board of trustees); PSU Corporate Charter (powers of trustees enumerated under the heading \u201cIncorporation\u201d). It cannot be said, therefore, that the real property of PSU is so controlled by the Commonwealth as to fall within the latter\u2019s immunity from local real estate taxation.\nThe decision of Commonwealth Court to the contrary must, therefore, be reversed. Inasmuch as HMC does not qualify for tax-free status as property owned by an agency of the Commonwealth, a remand to the court of common pleas is necessary for a determination of whether HMC qualifies for exemption on an alternate basis. This is due to the fact that the court of common pleas decided this case on the basis of the immunity claim, leaving unresolved HMC\u2019s alternate claim for exemption as an institution of purely public charity under the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-204(a)(3).\nOrder reversed, and case remanded.\nJustice NIGRO concurs in the result.\nDue to the 1ax years in question, this case is not affected by the enactment in 1997 of the Institutions of Purely Public Charity Act, 10 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 371-385, which addresses exemptions from real estate tax for state-related universities.",
