In expressing this view, we believe that the Superior Court was mistaken. The provision specifically provides that the Legislature is to act “within two years following the adoption of this article.” Consistent with that provision, §14 of Article IX provides that the effective date of the article is two years after the date of approval of the Constitutional provision, if that date occurred before the effective date of the legislation enacted by the Legislature. Consequently, there being no such legislative enactment, the amendment became effective two years after April 23, 1968, the date of its approval.</p>

It thus assigns a project of great magnitude and complexity to a body traditionally vested with wide disere<a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>tion as to its agenda. Thorough, study and reflection, delicate compromises of contending viewpoints, and arduous assembly of political support may all be required. The possible press of more urgent legislative business may have been foreseen as an obstacle to prompt enactment. The passage of legislation is frequently tortuous, unpredictable, and slow. In short, both the magnitude of the project and the vagaries of the legislative process, the first obvious and the second well-known, reveal the folly of mandating the Legislature to act within the specified time period. I will not attribute that folly to the constitutional draftsmen. Instead I conclude that section 8 is one of those “provisions in nearly every constitution which from the very nature of things must be construed to be directory, for example, sections commanding the Legislature to pass laws of a particular character .... Such provisions are binding only on the conscience of the legislative body.” T. White, Commentaries on the Constitution of Pennsylvania § 14, at 24-25 (1907).</p>

Specifically, the section created a ministerial duty in the Secretary of the Commonwealth to publish proposed amendments three months before the next general election. This Court stated in dictum that the failure to literally perform aborted the amendment process. Underlying that statement is a firm belief that strict compliance with the prescribed process was essential to the achievement of the goal. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Woods v. Davis, </em><a href="/pa/299/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="299 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1122312" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0276-01">299 Pa. 276</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.%20176" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="149 A. 176">149 A. 176</a> (1930), held that a provision requiring that all officers “shall be removed [from office] on conviction of misbehavior in office or of any infamous crime” was self-executing.</p>

Nor does it prescribe a process for accomplishing some goal the achievement of which requires literal compliance with every step.
