Henderson, appealed from an order of the Superior Court affirming by an equally-divided court the action of the Court of Common Pleas, Family Court Division directing him to deposit security for payment of costs in a pending divorce action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The parties filed an agreed statement of the case setting forth that the appellee, Barbara Ann Henderson, had instituted an action in divorce A.V.M. to which the appellant responded by filing an answer. The appellee thereupon filed a petition and rule for alimony pendente lite, counsel fees and costs. The rule for counsel fees was made absolute in the sum of $200 by agreement, and the balance of the rule was continued until further <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>notice. After two Masters’ Hearings and in accordance with Philadelphia Local Rule 1133(a)*(2) (b),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the Master filed a rule upon the appellant to show cause why a reasonable sum should not be deposited with the Prothonotary as security for payment of additional Masters’ fees. Simultaneously, a rule was filed on behalf of the stenographer also requesting that a suitable sum be set aside for future stenographic costs. The court below, after directing both parties to the action to submit statements of income and assets, entered an order directing appellant to deposit $500.00 as security for additional Masters’ fees and $100 as security for additional stenographic charges. From this order the appellant appealed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Morgan, </em><a href="/pa-super/182/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="182 Pa. Super. 182" data-case-ids="734155" data-case-paths="/pa-super/182/0182-01">182 Pa.

As noted by the opinion in the Superior Court for reversal : “If the purpose of the Act . . ., is to insure that lack of financial ability will not prevent an action or defense by a wife in a divorce case, then this intent may only be implemented by legislation which would also preserve a husband’s similar rights to bring or defend a divorce action where he lacked the financial ability and his wife has sufficient ability to pay.” The thrust of the Equal Rights Amendment is to insure equality of rights under the law and to eliminate sex as a basis for distinction. The sex of citizens of this Commonwealth is no longer a permissible factor in the determination of their legal rights and legal responsibilities. The law will not impose different benefits or different burdens upon the members of a society based on the fact that they may be man or woman. Thus, as it is appropriate for the law where necessary to force the man to provide for the needs of a dependent wife, it must also provide a remedy for the man where circumstances justify an entry of support against the wife. In short, the right of support depends not upon the sex of the petitioner but rather upon need in view of the relative financial circumstances of the parties.</p>
