The court may act upon the petition of the county board of elections or upon the report and recommendations of the county board of elections as to the petition of twenty registered electors. The standard to be applied by the court in its decision is the promotion of “the convenience of electors and the public interest.” The additional proviso contained in Section 504 limiting the power of the court to realign election districts, and particularly apposite to the issue before this Court, reads as follows: “Provided, however, That the court shall not make any final order for the division, redivision, alteration, formation or consolidation of election districts until at least ten days after notice shall have been posted in at least five public and conspicuous places in the district or districts to be affected thereby, one of which notices shall be posted on or in the immediate vicinity of the polling place in each such district. <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>Such notice shall state in brief form the division, redivision, alteration, formation or consolidation of election districts recommended by the county board, and the date upon which the same will be considered by the court, and shall contain a warning that any person objecting thereto must file his objections with the clerk of the court prior to such date. Upon the making of any such final order by the court, a copy thereof shall be certified by the clerk to the county board of elections.” Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1333, §504, 25 P.S. §2704.</p>
    <p id="b653-4" data-blocks='[["BL_653.4",653,[136,859,1152,1411]]]'>Our review of the records in the instant appeals reveals the following chronology of events: notices of the proposed consolidations were posted on February 27, 1974, the petitions were filed on March 4, a hearing was begun on March 8, and the final orders consolidating the election districts were entered on March 11, 1974. The petition of the County Board of Elections is the foundation of all the subsequent proceedings. <em>In re Division of the Fifth Ward of the City of Bethlehem, </em>31 North. 314 (Pa. C. P. 1948). Prior to the filing of such petition the court is without power to set a hearing date or to entertain objections to any consolidation proposal. In the present appeals the court considered the petitions for consolidation only four days after filing and final orders were entered only seven days after filing. This action was clearly in contravention of Section 504 of the Election Code. Our review of the transcript of the lower court hearing indicates that appellant, appellees, and the court were of the mistaken belief that February 27, the date notices were first posted, was the determinative date. This concordance is not constrictive of our power of review, however, since the limitations on the court’s power created by Section 504 are <em>jurisdictional </em>requirements and cannot be waived. Full compliance must appear of record. <em>In re Division of the Fifth Ward of the City of Bethlehem, supra.</em>
