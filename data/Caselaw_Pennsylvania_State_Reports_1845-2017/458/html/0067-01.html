After reviewing the evidence, Mr. Justice Stewart, speaking for a unanimous Court, concluded: “In sum, the appellants demonstrated a substantial disparity between the percentages of Negro residents in the county as a whole and of Negroes on the newly constituted jury list. They further demonstrated that the disparity originated, at least in part, at the one point in the selection process where the jury commissioners invoked their subjective judgment rather than objective criteria. The appellants thereby made out a prima facie case of jury discrimination, and the burden fell on the appellees to overcome it.” <a href="/us/396/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="396 U.S. 346" data-case-ids="11334148" data-case-paths="/us/396/0346-01">Id. at 360</a>, <a href="/us/396/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="396 U.S. 346" data-case-ids="11334148" data-case-paths="/us/396/0346-01">90 S.

First, the court found that the housing authority faithfully adhered to HUD tenant selection procedures. Second, the authority had officially declared that it would disperse future housing projects outside of areas exclusively populated by minority groups. Neither factor appears instantly. The Commonwealth Court concluded (and the Authority is bound by this conclusion because it took no appeal, see note 12 supra) that the Authority had not in fact complied with HUD regulations.
