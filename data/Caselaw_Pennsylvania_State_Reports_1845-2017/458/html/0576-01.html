Appellant, Richard L. Mohn, sought recovery on two medical insurance policies for expenses incurred as the result of his son’s hospitalization. Appellant filed a complaint in assumpsit on the two insurance contracts seeking reimbursement pursuant to the policies terms for the hospital expenses incurred. Appellee, American Casualty Co., responded by filing an answer and new matter. A stipulation was entered in the lower court to the effect that on May 26, 1969, appellant’s son, one of the dependents insured under the policies, was fatally wounded by a police officer’s bullet while he was attempting to flee from the scene of a burglary he was in the process of committing. Both appellant and appellee filed motions for summary judgment in accordance with Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1035. The Court of Common Pleas of Berks County entered summary judgment in favor of the appellee and was affirmed by the Superior Court with three judges dissenting. We granted allocatur and now reverse.</p>

There the insured voluntarily submitted to an admittedly criminal abortion which resulted in her death. The Court reasoned: “In the Hatch case the Supreme Court of Massachusetts decided that there could be no recovery in such circumstances on the ground of public policy, saying: ‘We are of opinion that no recovery can be had in this case, because the act on the part of the assured causing death was of such a character that public policy would preclude the defendant from insuring her against its consequences; for we can have no question that a contract to insure a woman against the risk of her dying under or in consequence of an illegal operation for abortion would be contrary to public policy, and could not be enforced in the courts of this commonwealth.’ We see no reason to question the soundness of this proposition, and it has our approval. As we have a criminal statute imposing severe punishment for the perpetration of the crime of abortion, it follows that our own public policy corresponds with that pronounced by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts.” <a href="/pa/191/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="191 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="907057" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0207-01">191 Pa. at 214</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.%20126" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="43 A. 126">43 A. at 127</a>. It is, however, questionable whether this decision can properly be cited as providing that the public policy against the misconduct of the insured justifies the denial of recovery under the policy in the absence of a “violation of law” provision because in this case the policy did provide that it would be void if the insured died in consequence of any violation or attempt to violate any law.</p>

As has been indicated the modern legal trend is to abandon the former “reasonably forseeable” rule and treat the occurrence as accidental even though it resulted from the insured’s criminal conduct. This Court noted its adherence to the modern view in our decision in <em>Beckham v. Travelers’ Insur. </em>Co., <a href="/pa/424/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="424 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1905013" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0107-01">424 Pa. 107</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=225%20A.2d%20532" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="225 A.2d 532">225 A.2d 532</a> (1967). There we stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[152,1017,1151,812]]]'>“It has been suggested, however, that we limit our holding to those cases which do not involve an unreasonable risk of harm to the insured and that we therefore affirm the Superior Cofirt’s decision. This argument, of course, assumes that the insured’s action in the instant case did amount to an unreasonable risk of harm. While this assumption might be valid vis-a-vis his general health and well being, there is no basis in the record for concluding that the insured was unduly exposing himself to the risk of death by his action. Moreover, no jurisdiction which has interpreted accidental means and accidental results to be legally synonymous has denied recovery on the basis of the above suggested distinction. Indeed some jurisdictions maintaining the distinction have permitted recovery in similar situations.</blockquote>

    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[196,423,1158,1136]]]'>A contract of insurance like any other contract requires that the intention of the parties be determined from the words of the instrument. Furthermore, where the contract is one of insurance any ambiguity in the language of the document is to be read in a light most strongly supporting the insured. <em>Burne v. Franklin Life Insur. Co., </em><a href="/pa/451/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="451 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1948618" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0218-01">451 Pa. 218</a>, 226, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20799" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="301 A.2d 799">301 A.2d 799</a> (1973); <em>Weissman v. Prashker, </em><a href="/pa/405/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="405 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1303575" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0226-01">405 Pa. 226</a>, 233, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%2063" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="175 A.2d 63">175 A.2d 63</a>, 67 (1961). Under the language of the policies presently under consideration it is clear that no provision was made that conduct should be excluded from coverage because it posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the deceased. To accept the narrow and restricted meaning of the term “accidental bodily injury” and to deny recovery to this beneficiary where the language of the policies clearly do not support such a construction would be violative of the fundamental tenets of insurance law and totally without justification in logic. We therefore hold that the injuries were sustained as a result of accidental bodily injury within the terms of the policy and that the beneficiary was entitled to recovery.</p>
