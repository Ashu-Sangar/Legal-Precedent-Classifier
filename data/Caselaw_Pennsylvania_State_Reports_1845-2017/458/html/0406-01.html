We agree. In view of our disposition of this issue we need not consider the remaining contentions offered by appellant.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[198,496,1153,157]]]'>In his closing remarks the prosecutor made the following statements to the jury to which defense counsel interposed a timely objection:</p>
    <blockquote id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[198,661,1153,256]]]'>“Now, you have heard all of the evidence. You have heard all of the facts. There is no question that the Commonwealth has made out a prima facie case and a full case beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of this defendant.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b450-6" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[199,936,1152,364]]]'>“. . . I say to you now don’t be fooled. Don’t let this defendant come into this courtroom and fool you into acquitting him and letting him walk out on this street again where he can rob and beat others. You are the community. You are to judge this defendant based upon what you have heard about him, based upon the facts of this case.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b450-7" data-blocks='[["BL_450.7",450,[200,1321,1152,756]]]'>“It’s awfully hard to walk the streets today. People don’t want to go out at night. They want to hurry from work and get in before it gets dark. They’re afraid to walk to their mailbox to drop a letter in the mail to a child, a mother or a father. Men are afraid to walk the streets themselves, afraid to walk their dogs out; afraid to run out to the car for something for fear that they won’t come back home because individuals like this defendant are out preying along the streets, beating people, robbing people, taking things which don’t belong to them. Now, you can sit back and allow him to do that again if you want to. You can send [him] back out there. You can. But it might be one of you next time. It might be one of you.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b450-8" data-blocks='[["BL_450.8",450,[202,2089,1150,266]],["BL_451.1",451,[182,345,1149,1296]]]'>“. . . And you know at a time like this in a trial, whether it be homicide or just a robbery or burglary or whatever it is, everyone thinks about the defendant. What can we do for the defendant? He’s seventeen. Well, I say to you when a seventeen-year-old person <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>goes out and beats aud robs and kills another human being, he’s a man and he must assume the responsibility of a man and everything that goes with it. Age doesn’t mean anything. If he wants to go out and act like that, he doesn’t need to walk the streets. I say, who thinks of the decedent, the victim? Whoever thinks of him? Who? I believe that if Mr. Holley were able to come back here and sit in this chair and talk with you, I believe he would say, ‘I didn’t want to die. I didn’t want to die. I don’t know why Harvell chose to play God and say at what moment of time I should die. I still had some life ahead of me. I was breathing this good air. I wasn’t on welfare taking advantage of people. I was working for Mr. Robinson for the meager amount of money that I needed to live on. I didn’t want to die.’ And if you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, allow this defendant, based upon this evidence, to leave City Hall and walk the streets again, how many more Thomas Holleys will have to say ‘I didn’t want to die’? And the only way you cannot find this defendant guilty of murder of the first degree is for Thomas Holley to come walking through that door, but we won’t. Thomas Holley is dead because of this defendant.”</blockquote>
