Tariff convened and charged a grand jury, upon the petition of the District Attorney, to investigate various aspects of official corruption in the City of Philadelphia. The convening of that grand jury was upheld by this Court in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Camelot Detective Agency, Inc. v.

In addition, the June 1972 grand jury issued a final report in January of 1974 wherein it recommended that a new investigating grand jury be convened “very promptly” to inquire further into the distribution of narcotics and related payoffs to policemen, and kickbacks required of architects, engineers, milk company executives and other businessmen in exchange for procuring public contracts.</p>

Although the new District Attorney who took office in the beginning of January 1974 had taken no action in response to the recommendations of the June 1972 grand jury, two citizens’ groups had petitioned Judge Tariff requesting such an investigation. These petitions which were filed by the Committee of Seventy and Americans for Democratic Action were rendered moot on January 31, 1974, however, when Judge Tariff charged the grand jury on his own motion to conduct an investigation into nine specified areas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In order to effectuate this charge, the term <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>of the grand jury was extended indefinitely and the grand jury was directed to reconvene, following completion of business, on February 11, 1974. Additionally, Judge Tariff requested the District Attorney to assign members of his staff to handle the investigation being conducted by the grand jury. The District Attorney, however, declined to comply with Judge Tariff’s request and subsequent order to assign members of his staff to conduct these investigations.</p>

L. 177, art. IX, § 907, 71 P.S. § 297, to assign a special attorney or attorneys to represent the Commonwealth, attend the January 1974 grand jury and perform all the duties and responsibilities in connection therewith. The Attorney General responded to President Judge Jamieson’s request with the suggestion that there first be a request for a determination by this Court to resolve the question of the validity of the grand jury. Subsequently, the Attorney General filed a petition for declaratory judgment to determine the validity or invalidity of the grand jury and a second petition requesting that this Court assume original jurisdiction of the petition seeking declaratory relief. The merits of these petitions were the subject of oral argument before this Court on April 29, 1974. On July 1, 1974, this Court entered an opinion and order denying declaratory relief because the petitions were an effort to obtain an advisory opinion which is not contemplated under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, and because the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act does not authorize the entry of judgments in criminal matters. <em>Packel v.

On June 19, 1974, a petition for supersedeas was filed and following a conference with the parties in the chambers of Mr. Justice Nix and upon consideration of the petitions, the matters were directed to be argued before the full Court on June 26, 1974, and proceedings with regard to petitioners were stayed pending the decision of this Court.

Petitioners seek to distinguish the present case from that of <em>Shenker v. Harr, </em><a href="/pa/332/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="332 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1186561" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0382-01">332 Pa. 382</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20298" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="2 A.2d 298">2 A.2d 298</a> (1938), which dealt with the power of the court to hold a regular grand jury over beyond its term to permit it to complete business already <em>begun </em>during its regular term. Petitioners have neglected to consider the effect of Rule 204 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure which was adopted subsequent to <em>Shenker v. Harr, supra, </em>and is dispositive of this issue. Rule 204 provides: “A. grand jury may be retained from time to time and term to term in order to complete business which was <em>presented </em>during the period for which it was originally summoned.” (Emphasis added) Judge Tariff charged the jury to conduct the investigation during the period for which it was originally summoned, albeit the last day. Consequently, the holding over of the grand jury comports with Rule 204 and was within Judge Tariff's power.</p>

The January 1974 grand jury, having been convened for only nine months, cannot at this stage be said to have reached its permissible limit. Thus, the admonition in <em>Shenker v. Harr </em>against anything approaching permanency in a grand jury is not presently applicable. Petitioners raise a related point which has not heretofore been addressed by this Court, <em>i.e., </em>whether successive investigations by different grand juries of similar areas of corruption give rise to the same evils found to be repugnant in <em>Shenker v. Harr. </em>We resolve this question in the negative because each time a new grand jury is convened there is a judicial reevaluation of the prerequisites for maintaining a grand jury investigation. The fact that a previous grand jury has investigated the same area is not a factor which must be considered if <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>an analysis of the situation indicates that a grand jury investigation is warranted in light of the narrow set of circumstances set forth in <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

In <em>McNair’s Petition </em>this Court set forth seven criteria which must be met to justify a grand jury investigation: (1) such an investigation must have a definite purpose to uncover criminal acts which seriously affect or injure the public generally; (2) the investigation may not be aimed at individuals nor at the commission of ordinary crimes, but should be matters of a criminal nature wherein public officers or the interests of the general public are involved; (3) the ordinary processes of the law must be inadequate to cope with or discover such offenses; (4) the acts must be part of a criminal conspiracy, systematic, or of a widespread nature; (5) at least one or more cognate offenses must exist upon which to base the general investigation; (6) the criminal acts being investigated must require immediate attention; and (7) the court must have reasonable cause from direct knowledge or knowledge gained from trustworthy information to believe that an investigation will disclose some criminal conduct which is within the competence of the grand jury to investigate and within the jurisdiction of the court to punish. <a href="/pa/324/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="324 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1171378" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0048-01">324 Pa. at 61-62</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.%20498" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="187 A. 498">187 A. at 504-05</a>.

In doing so, we conclude that the minimum requisites required by <em>Camelot, McCloskey </em>and <em>McNair’s Petition </em>have been met and that Judge Tariff properly directed a grand jury investigation. The investigation of the nine general areas listed in footnote 1, <em>supra, </em>clearly indicates that the investigation is aimed at systems of crimes involving conditions affecting the community as a whole. That the ordinary processes of the law are inadequate to cope with the problems is clear, as further evidenced by the experience of the June 1972 grand jury. Finally, there can be no question that the information as to the crimes forming the basis of the investigation was direct and from trustworthy sources. The information came from Judge Tariff's own knowledge as supervising judge of the June 1972 grand jury, the presentments and recommendations of the June 1972 grand jury, and the testimony of witnesses who appeared before the June 1972 grand jury.</p>
