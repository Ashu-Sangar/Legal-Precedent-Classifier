    <p id="b483-6" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[150,866,1154,1142]]]'>Initially, appellant contends that the proper standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings is the “reasonable doubt” standard. We disagree. Disciplinary proceedings are not criminal in nature; hence, the reasonable doubt standard need not apply. Moreover, the sanctions arising from such proceedings — censure, suspension, or disbarment — are not primarily designed for their punitive effects, but for their positive effect of protecting the public and the integrity of the courts from unfit lawyers. <em>See Moyerman’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/312/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="312 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1150662" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0555-01">312 Pa. 555</a>, 563, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.%20579" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="167 A. 579">167 A. 579</a> (1933). While we recognize the severe impact that such sanctions may have on an individual’s career, we are also mindful of our duty to uphold the quality and integrity of the Bar. Accordingly, we shall not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but shall retain the standard which this Court has consistently utilized in disciplinary cases through the years: “that a preponderance of evidence is necessary to establish an attorney’s unprofessional conduct and the proof of such conduct must be <em>clear </em>and <em>satisfactory ” Krehel </em>Appeal, <a href="/pa/419/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="419 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1896886" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0086-01">419 Pa. 86</a>, 89, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20375" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="213 A.2d 375">213 A.2d 375</a>, 377 (1965).</p>

      <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>We now address appellant’s questions relating to the type of evidence necessary to sustain certain charges herein. Generally, appellant contends that the absence of direct evidence of his involvement in certain offenses charged preclude a finding of guilt in those matters. For instance, appellant refers to a number of cases in which an associate under his employ was the person who actually prepared some of the false contingent fee agreements for which the court below held appellant responsible. Appellant’s attempt to shield his guilt in this manner is unavailing. The fact that an attorney may not have dirtied his hands with the manual task of filling in forms does not necessarily relieve him of culpability any more than would the use of “runners” to avoid direct involvement in solicitation. If under the circumstances it is reasonable to infer that the action was taken at the party’s direction or with his approval, the fact finder may draw such inferences to support a finding of guilt. Appellant’s position is very close to the untenable proposition that a charge of professional misconduct may not rest exclusively on circumstantial evidence. This Court has upheld even the sanction of disbarment on charges proven solely by circumstantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Lemisch’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/321/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="321 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1165902" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0110-01">321 Pa. 110</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%2072" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="184 A. 72">184 A. 72</a> (1936); <em>Salus’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/321/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="321 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1165888" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0106-01">321 Pa. 106</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%2070" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="184 A. 70">184 A. 70</a> (1936). Thus, appellant cannot rely on this argument for overturning any of the findings of guilt below as a matter of law.</p>
    <p id="b484-5" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[218,1845,1154,481]],["BL_485.1",485,[170,303,1149,756]]]'>In a related argument, appellant asserts that the charge of solicitation by runners cannot be sustained where there is no direct evidence of his payment of compensation to such runners. Again, we disagree. While the court below inferred “that the solicitors did receive something of value for their time, efforts and expense on [appellant’s] behalf,” this inference was unnecessary to sustain a finding of guilt. The Code of Professional Responsibility condemns such conduct <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>without any requirement of compensation. DR 1-102 provides: “(A) A lawyer shall not: . . .(2) Circumvent a Disciplinary Rule through actions of another.” This section, read in light of the proscription against self-recommendation in DR 2-103, not only condemns the hiring of solicitors by attorneys but also forbids any arrangement between an attorney and solicitor for solicitation purposes or even the acquiescence of the attorney who has knowledge of a solicitor’s activities in his behalf. We do not mean to suggest that the casual recommendation of an attorney by a friend or acquaintance is improper. Rather we seek to eliminate the active recruitment of clients and stirring up of litigation by or on behalf of attorneys.</p>
    <p id="b485-4" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[166,1071,1151,1031]]]'>Moreover, the fact that some of the solicitation for which appellant was adjudged guilty occurred prior to the effective date of the present Code of Professional Responsibility is of no consequence. This Court has never required proof of compensation in these circumstances. <em>Klensin v. Board of Governance, </em><a href="/pa/312/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="312 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1150673" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0564-01">312 Pa. 564</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=168%20A.%20474" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="168 A. 474">168 A. 474</a> (1933), clearly indicates that proof that the accused paid “runners” is not essential to a finding of guilty of solicitation through runners. The Court there quoted with approval from the report of the hearing masters: “ ‘The first charge of unethical soliciation [sic] of business is amply sustained by the evidence. It is true that respondent did not employ ‘runners’ at a compensation. The work of solicitation was confined to his father, who may not have received any cash consideration for the work. . . .”’ 312 Pa. at 571, <a href="/citations/?q=168%20A.%20474" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="168 A. 474">168 A. at 476-77</a>. Thus, proof of compensation is not required for a finding of guilt with regard to any of the charges of indirect solicitation.</p>

Appellant con<a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>tends that this constituted reversible error under the doctrine of <em>Spevack v.

We are entrusted with this duty of de novo review by the Act of May 19, 1879, P. L. 66, §1, 17 P.S. §1663 which provides: “In all cases of any proceedings in any court of this commonwealth against amy attorney of said court for unprofessional conduct as an officer of such court, said attorney shall be entitled to a writ of error from the supreme court of this commonwealth, <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>as in civil cases, to said court, from any judgment, order or decree of said court, against Mm as such, officer, which writ of error shall remove the record and all the proceedings therein to the supreme court of this commonwealth; and <em>it shall be the duty of said supreme court to review the same de novo; </em>and the complainant shall have the right to offer new testimony by deposition or otherwise as said supreme court may direct, and upon hearing said court may modify, reverse or affirm said judgment, order or decree of the court below, as the justice and equity of the case shall require, and such cases shall be placed if desired at the head of the list of the next sessions of said court in any district where it may sit, to be determined after all homicide cases have been disposed of; said writ of error shall be issued as of course witMn two years from the judgment, order or decree as aforesaid.” (Emphasis added.)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Since our review is de novo, we are not bound by the findings of the court below, but are free to evaluate the evidence presented in the record as we see fit. <em>Krehel Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/419/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="419 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1896886" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0086-01">419 Pa. 86</a>, 89, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20375" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="213 A.2d 375">213 A.2d 375</a>, 377 (1965). However, we do recognize the advantage which the trial court has in evaluating the credibility of witnesses before it. This factor has frequently made this Court reluctant to disturb the findings of the lower court where such findings were supported by competent evidence. <em>See, e.g., Smith Disbarment Case, </em><a href="/pa/376/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="376 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1246163" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0255-01">376 Pa. 255</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20710" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="101 A.2d 710">101 A.2d 710</a> (1954); <em>Kraus’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/322/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="322 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1167883" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0362-01">322 Pa. 362</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20737" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="185 A. 737">185 A. 737</a> (1936). However, where the disciplinary court has imposed a sanction based on evidence which, although legally “sufficient” to sustain the charge, appears manifestly unreliable to us, we will not hesitate to overturn the determination below. <em>See Krehel Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/419/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="419 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1896886" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0086-01">419 Pa. 86</a>, 91, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20375" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="213 A.2d 375">213 A.2d 375</a>, 377 (1965). Having established the <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>ground rules for our review, we now turn to the evidence in this case.</p>
    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[187,438,1154,1086]]]'>The charges confronting appellant stem from two separate petitions: (1) that of the Committee of Censors involving the alleged solicitation of two of appellant’s personal injury cases as well as a related charge of subornation of perjury; and (2) that of the Special Judicial Investigation involving the remaining charges which arise from some fifteen of appellant’s personal injury cases. As noted above, appellant was adjudged guilty of some thirty-five different charges, not including his failure to file some one hundred ten contingent fee agreements and twenty-one statements of distribution as required by Court Rule 202 of Philadelphia County. We have carefully reviewed the entire record of the proceedings below. Because of the large number of cases and charges involved in this proceeding, we shall not recount the evidence case by case or charge by charge.

His arguments in justification of these violations are unpersuasive and accordingly, we shall not disturb the lower court’s determination on these points,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> but shall move on to the more serious charges presented in this case.</p>

The charges of solicitation arise from events which occurred in 1963, some nine years prior to the hearing in this case. Likewise, the alleged perjury, to which the subornation charges refer, relates to these same events. The Committee’s evidence rested heavily on the testimony of the two former clients. We find the testimony of these two witnesses to be confused, uncertain, and unworthy of belief. Although the witnesses’ confusion is somewhat explainable by the lapse of time, this does not make their uncertain testimony any more reliable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> While we do not necessarily find appellant’s evidence contrastingly more credible, <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>we feel it would be inappropriate to base a sanction of suspension on such uncertain evidence.</p>

The fact that the witness admitted lying to the defendant’s doctor regarding the number of visits because she "figured if [she] told him that that [she] Avould probably get more money out of the accident” raises a strong possibility that she may also have lied to appellant for the same reason when he was preparing her claim. Therefore, we are unwilling to accept this charge as a basis for the sanction imposed.</p>
    <p id="b490-5" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[206,1174,1155,533]]]'>With respect to the case of Pearl McNeil, we are not convinced of appellant’s guilt as to the charge of solicitation. The client’s testimony indicates that Mr. Batt, appellant’s associate, visited Mrs. McNeil in her capacity as a possible witness in the case of her sister’s estate. At the close of that conversation, Mrs. McNeil asked Mr. Batt to represent her since he was already representing her brother-in-law in his capacity as administrator of his wife’s estate. We are not convinced that a finding of solicitation is merited on these facts.</p>
    <p id="b490-6" data-blocks='[["BL_490.6",490,[204,1719,1156,635]]]'>Our doubts, however, do not extend to the related charge of filing a false retainer agreement listing Mrs. McNeil’s brother-in-law, Lenwood Butler, as the referring party. Although there may not have been any devious motive for listing Mr. Butler as the referring party, there is no question that this information was inaccurate since Mrs. McNeil had not spoken to Butler about retaining any larvyer prior to Mr. Batt’s visit. Thus, we affirm the filing false retainer agreement charge although the significance of this charge is reduced by our inability to find the accompanying solicitation in this case.</p>

While the witness initially indicated that the number of visits to the physician on the submitted bill, fifty-five, was erroneous and that the actual number was closer to twelve, her testimony on this point was severely impeached on cross-examination. By the end of her testimony, she conceded not only that she couldn’t remember the precise number of visits but also that she wasn’t even sure whether the number could have been fifty-five. For this reason, we cannot sustain the finding of guilt on the false medical bill charge.</p>

Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Rule 202(f), which requires every attorney entering into a contingent fee agreement to file a copy thereof Avith the Prothonotary, also requires a signed statement by the client listing the name and address of the person who recommended the attorney. In each of these cases, the client testified that the referral information was false. In several cases, the referral statements were in appellant’s own handwriting. In other cases, they were filled out by appellant’s associate. With respect to these latter instances, appellant strenuously objects to any finding of culpability, arguing that he had no knowledge of these actions. Nevertheless, as noted above, the drawing of reasonable inferences in disciplinary cases is quite appropriate and we agree with the disciplinary court’s inference of knowledge on appellant’s part with regard to these charges. We are particularly persuaded in this regard by the following argument found in the brief of the Special Judicial Investigation: “This was Berlant’s office, it was his practice, the profits were all his, all the retainers were in his name, he participated in all phases of the cases involved, and was exclusively <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>responsible for some phases. Berlant had no partner who could have been responsible for the day-to-day operations in his office and who could have acted without his knowledge.” Thus, we concur in the findings of guilt on these ten charges.</p>

However, the state’s infringement on First Amendment association rights must be narrowly drawn.
