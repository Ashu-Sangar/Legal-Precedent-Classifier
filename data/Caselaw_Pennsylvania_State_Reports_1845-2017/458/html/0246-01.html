The Comment to Section 226 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency, the section noted in <em>McConnell, </em>says: [a] single act may be done to effect the purposes of two independent employers.

A person, however, may cause both employers to be responsible for an act which is a breach of duty to one or both of them. <em>He may be the servant of two masters, not joint employers as to the same act, if the act is within the scope of his employment for both; </em>he cannot be a servant of two masters in doing an act as to which an intent to serve one necessarily excludes an intent to serve the other.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

      <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>The negligence charged to the Hospital in the plaintiffs’ complaint was of three sorts: the employment of unqualified, untrained and careless personnel for work in the operating room; the failure to set up adequate safeguards and precautions to prevent the leaving of clamps in a patient’s body; and the failure of the hospital employees in attendance to inspect the situs of the operation and malee certain that no clamps or other foreign objects were left in the patient’s body. No evidence was introduced to show the Hospital’s neglect in these areas, except that it had in force no rule or policy as to clamp counts, and that its intern and two <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>nurses in attendance did not in fact make a clamp count; but there was no evidence to indicate that the Hospital had any right to control either the application or the removal of the clamps while the doctor was performing the operation, or that its employees were in any way under the control or direction of the Hospital during the operating procedure. On the facts proved, therefore, the only issue of negligence of the hospital was whether it should have had in force a practice, policy or procedure which would require one or more of its employees to make a count of all surgical instruments used in the operation. The Court’s opinion overlooks the fact that this issue was discussed at length and was put to the jury by the trial judge several times in his charge:</p>

The result of this limitation, if liability is found as to the hospital, is to foist upon it the dollar <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>amount of the verdict which another jury found in favor of the plaintiffs against another defendant. It is true, of course, as the Court states, that the plaintiffs “should not be denied their verdict [against Dr. Wagner] because a new trial is granted as to the other alleged tortfeasor”. The verdict against Dr. Wagner, who has not appealed, remains intact, and our eases have uniformly so held. See, e.g., <em>Soltan v. Shahboz, </em><a href="/pa/383/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="383 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="1261949" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0485-01">383 Pa. 485</a>, 493, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.2d%20242" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="119 A.2d 242">119 A.2d 242</a> (1956). Cf. <em>Frank v. W. S. Losier &amp; Co. Inc., </em><a href="/pa/361/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="361 Pa. 272" data-case-ids="476414" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0272-01">361 Pa. 272</a>, 278, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.2d%20829" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="64 A.2d 829">64 A.2d 829</a> (1949). But it is quite another thing to say that a defendant who has been <em>exonerated </em>by one jury in an earlier trial must, if found liable on a new trial, be “stuck” with a verdict that jury has returned against another defendant. My limited research has disclosed only one case in which our Court has sanctioned such a procedure. <em>Ratcliff v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/382/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="382 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1259934" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0196-01">382 Pa. 196</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.2d%20558" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="113 A.2d 558">113 A.2d 558</a> (1955). In that case Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Charles Alvin Jones, joined by Mr. Justice Chidsey, dissented, asserting that this procedure was a deprivation of property without due process of law with respect to the defendant faced with the new trial. <a href="/pa/382/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="382 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1259934" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0196-01">382 Pa. at 206</a>. If the verdict in the present case against the doctor had been deemed by the plaintiffs to have been on the low side, they would be the first to assert that a new trial as to a co-defendant should be plenary. (It is to be noted that prior to trial the claim against Dr. Wagner had been settled for $14,000, and a joint tortfeasor release taken; the aggregate verdict was $37,500.) As it was, appellants’ proposal for a restricted new trial was presented in a “by the way” fashion in the “conclusion” portion of their brief, and was not responded to by appellees. I therefore do not pursue the matter further in this dissent</p>
