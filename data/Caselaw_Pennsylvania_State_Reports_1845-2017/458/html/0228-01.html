S. Route 13, near Painter, Virginia. Mrs. Bork was blinded as a result of the accident. On December 31, 1970, Mr. and Mrs. Bork filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia against Mills and against the administrator of Mr. Crawford’s estate. Counsel for both defendants raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction and venue. The objections of both defendants were sustained on the question of jurisdiction, and the Superior Court affirmed the decision. We granted allocatur solely to consider whether it was proper to <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>sustain the preliminary objections of Robert Henry Mills, a resident of Maryland.</p>

Rule 1019(a) requires a pleading to allege “the material facts” on which the cause of action is based. In our opinion, the sufficiency of an out-of-state resident’s contacts with Pennsylvania is a “material fact” when suit is brought on an unrelated cause of action. Consequently, the court committed no error in sustaining Mills’ preliminary objections and dismissing appellants’ complaint.</p>

Our “long-arm statute” provides that a nonresident who avails himself of the privilege of “doing business” in this Commonwealth may be subject to the in personam jurisdiction of our state courts. The sole condition imposed by section 8304 is that the nonresident must have been “doing business” in Pennsylvania “at the time the cause of action accrued or the harm or financial loss occurred.” The majority, however, imposes the additional condition that where the cause of action does not arise out of the nonresident’s business activities in this State, jurisdiction does not attach unless the nonresident is <em>continuously and substantially </em>“doing business” in Pennsylvania. I disagree. The statute simply does not provide such a requirement. Furthermore, the creation of such a standard ignores <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>the recent legislative and judicial trend toward the adoption of the federal “minimum contacts” approach to the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction. <em>Image Ten, Inc. v.

Such an allegation meets all of the necessary requirements of our “long-arm statute.” I would therefore, reverse the order of the trial court and reinstate the appellants’ complaint.</p>
