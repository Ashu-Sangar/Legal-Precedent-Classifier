Three days after the occurrence, Broaddus surrendered voluntarily to the police and, during the questioning, admitted being involved in the shooting, but said the victim was shot by his own gun during a tussle between the two. He said Murray Dickerson was with him at the time. A preliminary hearing was held, and Broaddus was ordered committed to the county prison to await grand jury action. Within a few hours after his commitment, the police requested a judge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery and Quarter Sessions in Philadelphia to sign a “bring-up” order, i.e., authority to transfer Broaddus temporarily from the prison to the district attorney’s office in City Hall for further questioning. The order was executed and Broaddus was transferred and questioned as indicated. During this questioning, Broaddus again admitted his involvement in the shooting, and also stated he stole the victim’s watch and wallet after the shooting.

Consequently, we do not now decide if a “bring-up” order proceeding is a critical stage under <em>Coleman. </em>In <em>Coleman, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States ruled the determination of whether a judicial proceeding is a critical stage depends upon an examination of “whether potential substantial prejudice to defendant’s rights inheres in the * * '* confrontation and the ability of counsel to help avoid prejudice.” This formula, however, is not applicable to the 1958 “bring-up” order proceeding under consideration, since the Supreme Court has expressly ruled the <em>Coleman </em>decision is not to be given retroactive effect. See <em>Adams v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/405/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="405 U.S. 278" data-case-ids="11722188" data-case-paths="/us/405/0278-01">405 U.S. 278</a>, <a href="/us/405/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="405 U.S. 278" data-case-ids="11722188" data-case-paths="/us/405/0278-01">92 S.

Likewise, in <em>Hamilton, </em>there was prejudice because if the accused failed to assert a defense at the preliminary hearing, the defense could be lost forever. Thus, the lack of the assistance of an attorney gave rise to prejudice <em>during the proceeding, </em>which affected the accused’s rights at trial.

Prior to the preliminary hearing, the prisoner could have been moved from one police lockup to another stationhouse or to detective headquarters without the necessity of any court order. Such movement, in and of itself, would not create a situation in which there would be a right to counsel.

    <p id="b311-3" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[151,529,1154,1203]]]'>In Sanders, this Court recognized the necessity for a contemporaneous objection stating: “Appellant-petitioner does not contend, nor does the record indicate, that his plea of guilty was anything other than voluntarily and intelligently entered. On this record, the plea having been accepted by the court, the court’s sole inquiry was to determine the degree of guilt and the penalty. Petitioner’s ‘plea constituted an admission of guilt and of all the facts averred in the indictment; it constituted a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects and defenses.’ Commonwealth ex rel. Walls v. Rundle, <a href="/pa/414/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="414 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1890342" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0053-01">414 Pa. 53</a>, 55, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.2d%20528" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="198 A.2d 528">198 A.2d 528</a>, 529 (1964). Of course, this does not mean that a defendant who has pleaded guilty to murder waives the right to object to the admission of improper evidence which will bear on the degree of guilt and the punishment to be imposed. In the instant case, however, there was no attack on the involuntariness of petitioner’s confession. There was no challenge to the voluntariness based either upon the absence of counsel at any stage of the proceedings or upon any other premise. Petitioner at no time, for any reason, contended that his confession was involuntary.</p>
