They are: (1) that the trial judge invaded the jury’s province; (2) that the judge prejudiced appellant when reviewing the testimony and (3) that the charge as to murder in the second degree was erroneous. Although appellant admits that he failed to raise these objections before the jury retired to deliberate in accordance with Rule 1119b of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, he nevertheless claims that these errors are reviewable by this Court because they are basic and fundamental errors which justify reversal absent an objection or exception.

The majority now — contrary to the whole course of modern trial procedure — encourages defense counsel to sit by silently without calling errors to the trial court’s attention until <em>after </em>the guilty verdict is returned.

    <p id="b463-3" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[169,481,1152,704]]]'>In our judgment the basic and fundamental error doctrine has created greater problems than it has alleviated. First it is difficult to determine what is a basic and fundamental error. Compare Common<em>wealth v. Scoleri, </em><a href="/pa/432/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="432 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1919675" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0571-01">432 Pa. 571</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%20295" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="248 A.2d 295">248 A.2d 295</a> (1968) with <em>Commonwealth v.

Secondly, the doctrine has created the anomalous situation whereby all reversible error is not basic and fundamental error yet there is no readily perceptible substantive difference between the two. Thus, the test is merely a vehicle whereby the Court can arbitrarily reverse on an otherwise unpreserved issue.</p>
    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[169,1198,1153,1143]],["BL_464.1",464,[196,317,1155,373]]]'>Most recently this Court has expressly abrogated the doctrine of basic and fundamental error in civil cases, <em>Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Company, </em><a href="/pa/457/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="457 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="477868" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0255-01">457 Pa. 255</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="322 A.2d 114">322 A.2d 114</a> (1974). There the Court reasoned that the doctrine (1) “removes the professional necessity for [diligent preparation]”, (2) penalizes the opposing party, (3) denies the trial court an opportunity to correct the error, (4) erodes the finality of trial court holdings, (5) encourages unnecessary appeals and (6) needlessly discourages alert professional representation. The requirement of a timely specific objection on the other hand insures that: “First, appellate courts will not be required to expend time and energy receiving points on which no trial ruling has been made. Second, the trial court may promptly correct the asserted error. With the issue properly presented, the trial court is more likely to reach a satisfactory result thus obviating the need for appellate review on this issue. Or if a new trial is necessary, it may be granted by the trial court without subjecting both the litigants and the courts to the expense and delay inherent in appellate review. Third, ap<a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>péllate courts will be free to more expeditiously dispose of the issues properly preserved for appeal. Finally, the exception requirement will .remove the' advantage formerly enjoyed by the unprepared trial lawyer who looked, to the appellate court to compensate for his trial omissions.” <a href="/pa/457/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="457 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="477868" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0255-01">457 Pa. at 259</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=322%20A.2d%20114" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="322 A.2d 114">322 A.2d at 116-17</a>.

Moreover, there is no reason to distinguish between civil and criminal cases in this regard in view of the fact that there are comparable rules requiring specific objection in both sets of procedural rules. Compare Rule 227b of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure with Rule 1119b of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure. Indeed, abrogating the doctrine in the criminal area may be even more compelling since any error that deprives a defendant of due process can more properly be remedied by a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v</em>. <em>Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967).

We need not express any opinion on the merits of this claim for here too no objection was made to this testimony nor was any motion made to have it stricken.

The Court today extends its ban on that doctrine to criminal cases, and not only to erroneous jury instructions but also to errors in the presentation of evidence. This extension comes as no surprise, and indeed was anticipated in the <em>Dilliplaine </em>dissent. Nothing in today’s opinion changes the belief I expressed in <em>Dilliplaine </em>that the discarding of the rule was both “unnecessary and unwise.”</p>

This seems a slender thread to tie these decisions together. While, of course, it is never proper to think of our advocacy system merely as a game to be won or lost according to how well the players know the rules, there is less room for such <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>thinking in the criminal area than anywhere else in the law. In the stress of trial, what lawyer has not erred? But the doctrine of basic and fundamental error in criminal cases was not designed to reward the unprepared and incautious attorney; rather, it was to insure a basically fair trial to every defendant, many of whom, of course, have no choice in the selection of their lawyers.</p>

Thus today’s decision virtually invites more post-conviction hearings, to be followed inevitably by more appeals. As the dissenters in <em>Dilliplaine </em>stated: “A truly egregious criminal trial error which we decline to consider on appeal because not preserved below is almost certain to resurface in a post-conviction proceeding in the form of a charge of ineffectiveness of counsel. Considerations of judicial economy argue in favor of dealing with errors of this sort on direct appeal from the judgment of sentence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v.
