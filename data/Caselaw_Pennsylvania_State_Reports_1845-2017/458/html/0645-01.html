Welsh filed a nomination paper in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth for the office of State Senator for the Sixth (6th) Senatorial District in the election to be held on November 4, 1974. Two electors of the Sixth (6th) Senatorial District filed a petition in the Commonwealth Court raising certain objections to the nomination paper and requesting that it be set aside. After a hearing, the Court entered an Order granting the motion. Welsh filed this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b688-7" data-blocks='[["BL_688.9",688,[184,1300,1156,207]]]'>Two reasons were assigned by the Court for setting aside the nomination paper: (1) untimely filing; and (2) signatures included therein bore a date later than that permitted by the Election Code.</p>

However, during argument sur the motion to set aside, counsel for Welsh informed the Court that his client had been informed by the Office of the Board of Elections in Harrisburg, that nomination papers such as here could properly be filed at any time up to and including August 14.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

        <em> </em>At the hearing in the Commonwealth Court, Robert E. Grant, Administrative Assistant to the Commissioner of Elections, testified the nomination paper of Welsh had been accepted because the date for filing such papers in the Election Code had been “extended by a Federal Court Order to August 14, 1974.” Mr. Grant was undoubtedly referring to the Order of the Court in <em>Consumer Party, et al. v. Tucker, Secretary of the Commonwealth, et al., </em><a href="/f-supp/364/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="364 F.
