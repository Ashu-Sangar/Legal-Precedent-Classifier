      <em>Kirby </em>does not establish an all inclusive rule; rather, the line to be drawn depends upon the procedure employed by each state. We are therefore faced with the issue of whether this lineup preceded the “initiation of adversary judicial proceedings” as defined in Pennsylvania. While the plurality in <em>Kirby </em>attaches some significance to the indictment, they specifically mention several benchmarks: “formal charges, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.” <a href="/us/406/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="406 U.S. 682" data-case-ids="6173132" data-case-paths="/us/406/0682-01">406 U.S. at 689</a>.

This being true, Wade required counsel at the show-up”. In Pennsylvania, magisterial approval of a complaint occurs either at the issuance of an arrest warrant, or, for warrantless arrests, at the preliminary arraignment. See, Pa. R. Crim. P. 130.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The reasoning of <em>Robinson </em>would clearly apply to both situations.</blockquote>

After the arraignment, a lineup could have been conducted without encroaching on the principles of Rule 130 or the right to counsel enunciated in <em>Wade. </em>To draw a distinction between arrests with and without warrants would encourage police to ignore the mandate of Rule 130 and would not aid any legitimate police interest in facilitating the investigation of crime. We therefore do not feel that either the “committed to prosecution” standard or the “balance” mentioned in <em>Kirby </em>justify such a distinction.

The plurality explicitly refused to expand the <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>line to pre-indictment (pre-adversary proceeding) lineups.

Although the dissenters could not agree, nor can I, with the plurality’s artificial line between post-charge (decision to prosecute) and pre-charge lineups, they clearly express the point that the plurality did not extend the <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>line to the time of arrest. Mr. Justice Brennan pertinently stated: “In view of Wade, it is plain, and the plurality today does not attempt to dispute it, that there inhere in a confrontation for identification conducted after arrest the identical hazards to a fair trial that inhere in such a confrontation conducted ‘after the onset of formal prosecutorial proceedings.’ <em>Id., </em>at 1883. The plurality apparently considers an ar<a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>rest, which, for present purposes we must assume to be based upon probable cause, to be nothing more than part of ‘a routine police investigation,’ <em>ibid., </em>and thus not ‘the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice,’ <em>id., </em>at 1882. An arrest, according to the plurality, does not face the accused ‘with the prosecutorial forces of organized society,’ nor immerse him ‘in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.’ Those consequences ensue, says the plurality, only with ‘[t]he initiation of judicial criminal proceedings’ ‘[f]or it is only then that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified.’ <em>Ibid.” </em>[Footnotes omitted.] <em>Id. </em>at 697-98, <a href="/us/406/0682-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="406 U.S. 682" data-case-ids="6173132" data-case-paths="/us/406/0682-01">92 S.

The artificial distinction drawn by the plurality in <em>Kirby, </em>between post-charge <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>and pre-charge lineups is unwise and infringes upon the protections society should grant an accused. To force an accused to stand alone against the full force and investigative powers of organized society, until he is actually charged with the commission of the crime, is an outrageous injustice. The accused’s liberty is equally jeopardized by a pre-charge lineup, as it is by a post-charge lineup. Thus, I consider the line as laid down in <em>Kirby </em>to be arbitrary and unfounded. To follow the constitutional mandate of <em>Kirby </em>would be to encourage the law-enforcement personnel of this Commonwealth to hastily conduct all lineups prior to the institution of the “adversary judicial criminal proceedings,” (see footnote 2, supra). Thus, it is my strong feeling that the superior procedure is to grant the right to counsel at all lineups subsequent to arrest, with the exception of immediate on-the-scene identifications.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a> Moreover, this opinion, although not in accord with <em>Kirby, </em>is consistent with that opinion, in that: at the arrest the accused is, in actuality, informed for the first time of the charges for which he is being investigated and is the initial point in our “accusatory” criminal process. Hence, it is a meaningless distinction to postpone the granting of the right to counsel at lineups until the “official” initiation of the judicial criminal process.</p>

R. Crim. P. 119, marks the commencement of such proceedings. The preliminary arraignment precedes the preliminary hearing by three to seven days. While the district attorney is not present, and no decision whether or not to prosecute is then made, the accused is, of course, then in custody of the police before a magistrate, is furnished with a copy of the complaint against him, and is informed of his rights to counsel, to a preliminary hearing, and to bail.</p>

If, however, we are to formulate a state right to counsel at pre-trial line-ups which is broader than the federal requirement as set forth in <em>Kirby </em>(and I can see merit in so doing), I would not do so as a matter of state constitutional law. Our Court has a well-founded reluctance to decide issues of constitutional law when disposition can be had on some other adequate ground.
