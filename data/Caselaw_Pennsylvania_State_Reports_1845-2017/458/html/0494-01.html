From September 29, 1956 until June 30, 1959, all of the company’s authorized and issued stock was owned by Frank Bearoff, now deceased, who was the father of the instant appellant and of the individual appellee. In June of 1959, the deceased executed share Certificate No. 5 for 2,450 shares of stock of Bearoff Brothers, Inc. in the name of appellant. A certificate for the same number of shares was at that time also executed in favor of Charles Bearoff, and both certificates were left by the father in the Share Certificate Book in the safe in the company office to which all three had access.</p>

In January of 1962, the father filed a complaint in equity in Montgomery County as of No. 62-170 seeking the return of the certificate which the complaint alleged was improperly taken by appellant. During the course of that action an Answer, New Matter, and a Reply to New Matter was filed raising the issue of the ownership of the shares and the <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>allegation of a gift. On or about August 13,1964, appellant returned the certificate in question to his father without an endorsement.

The fundamental principle upon which the doctrine is based is that a court judgment should be conclusive as between the parties and their privies in respect to every fact which could properly have been considered in reaching the determination and in respect to all points of law relating directly to the cause of action and affecting the subject matter before the court. We <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>are satisfied that the instant factual situation presents an identity of parties, subject matter and cause of action as required by the doctrine. However, the troublesome issue presented is whether the fact that a party in a prior litigation elected not to pursue his position to final judgment but rather chose, in absence of an agreement, to abandon his position, is thereby foreclosed from again asserting that position. While the general rule for either collateral estoppel or res judicata to apply is that a final and valid judgment must have been entered, <em>Philadelphia Marine Trade Association v.

In our judgment their reliance was misplaced. In <em>Sustrik, </em>after several days of trial the matter was settled and discontinued by agreement of the parties and approval of the court, conditioned upon the payment of a stipulated sum of money from the defendant to the plaintiff. This Court held that a subsequent action brought to relitigate the same issues was barred as between the parties and that the settlement and discontinuance had the same effect as the entry of judgment for the defendant in the proceedings. The obvious distinction between the facts of the <em>Sustrik </em>case, <em>supra, </em>and the case at bar is that in the former there was court approval where as here the court did not participate in any way in the discontinuance of the earlier proceeding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The doctrine of res judicata <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>has been designed to preserve the conclusiveness of final court action. Thus we have said: “Although a consent decree is not a legal determination by the court of the matters in controversy ... it binds the parties with the same force and effect as if a final decree has been rendered after a full hearing upon the merits. . . .

We have often stated that where a court makes a correct ruling, order, decision, judgment or decree, but assigns an erroneous reason for its action, an Appellate Court will affirm the action of the court below and assign the proper reason therefor. <em>Taylor v.

This approach, however, is only appropriate where the correct basis for the ruling, order, decision, judgment or decree is clear upon the record. However, where disputed facts must be resolved appellate courts should refrain from assuming the role of a fact-finder in an attempt to sustain the action of the court below. Here, although the issue of laches was raised in the pleading, the Chancellor failed to malee any findings of fact necessary to a determination of the issue.
