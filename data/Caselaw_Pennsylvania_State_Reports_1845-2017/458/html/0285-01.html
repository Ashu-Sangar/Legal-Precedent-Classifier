    <p id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[182,506,1153,376]]]'>On September 26, 1971, about 1:00 a.m., several members of a street gang in Philadelphia ambushed and attacked two members of a rival street gang as they departed from a dance conducted in the auditorium of the Philadelphia Community College. Larry Coles, one of the victims of the attack, was repeatedly stabbed with a weapon, suffering wounds which caused his death.</p>

Wilson, age fourteen years and eight months, was one of those apprehended and taken to police headquarters.</p>
    <p id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.7",329,[179,1223,1151,1140]]]'>After Ms arrival at police headquarters about 1:50 a.m., Wilson was immediately advised of his constitutional rights as mandated by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.

On each such occasion, he denied any knowledge of the Coles’ attack. About 9:00 a.m., Wilson was questioned for the fourth time and this questioning extended for about fifty minutes. During this questioning he admitted being at the scene of the attack, but denied being involved. About 12:45 p.m., Wilson’s mother arrived at police headquarters, and, after discussing her son’s problem with one of the investigating officers, she followed the officer’s suggestion and urged her son to submit to a polygraph test and to tell the truth. Such a test ensued between 1:20 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., and it was during tMs time period that Wilson admitted being one of those who participated in the Coles’ attack. Evidence of this incrimination was admitted at trial over objection.</p>

      <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>In <em>Commonwealth v. Futch, </em>supra, this Court held that all evidence obtained during an unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment must be excluded at trial except that evidence which has no reasonable relationship to the delay. The Commonwealth argues the delay in this case was necessary in order to permit the police an opportunity to check out Wilson’s initial exculpatory statements. This same position was specifically rejected in <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>supra, and what was said in <em>Williams </em>in reference to this argument applies with equal force here.</p>
    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[201,941,1153,374]]]'>Finally, the Commonwealth urges Wilson’s incrimination was the product of the advice of his mother, rather than the delay in arraignment. While it is undoubtedly true that his mother played an important role in Wilson incriminating himself, it is equally clear that the incrimination was reasonably related to the delay in arraignment.</p>
