The School Board and the Federation entered into a collective bargaining agreement for a two-year period ending on August 31, 1972. Following an oral extension of this agreement to September 5, 1972, the Federation called a strike. The strike lasted until September 27th, when the parties entered into a “Memorandum of Understanding” reinstating the expired agreement until December 31, 1972. The Memorandum stipulated that the terms and provisions of any new collective bargaining agreement would be retroactive to September 1, 1972. Upon its expiration at year-end, the Memorandum of Understanding was orally extended until January 8, 1973. On that date, the parties having failed to agree on a new contract, the Federation again called a strike. <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>On or about March 1, 1973, the Federation and the School Board signed a collective bargaining agreement for the period from September 1, 1972 to August 31, 1976.

The court concluded that any teacher who retained Federation membership after August 31, 1972, the date of expiration of the antecedent agreement, was bound by the maintenance of membership provision of the March 1, 1973, agreement. This reasoning is specious, however, for it overlooks the cardinal fact that the employees who submitted their resignations prior to March 1st were not parties to the agreement which was entered into on that date, and, thus, that the provisions of that agreement cannot affect the exercise of statutorily protected rights by such employees. The Federation and the School Board were, of course, free to choose any date they pleased as the effective date of their new contract, but the law will limit the adverse effect of their choice on third parties. <em>NLRB v. Mechanical &amp; Allied Production Workers Local 444, </em><a href="/f2d/427/0883-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="427 F.2d 883" data-case-ids="2243603" data-case-paths="/f2d/427/0883-01">427 F.2d 883</a> (1st Cir. 1970). It could not seriously be argued that, had the retroactive application of the March 1, 1973 agreement reached to August 16, 1972, it would nullify a resignation during the statutorily guaranteed escape period of the last fifteen days of the prior agreement, which expired by its terms on August 31, 1972. An employee’s right to resign from his union at a time when no contract whatever is in force can be no less inviolate than the right to resign during the escape <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>period of a previous contract. To hold otherwise would be to place an impermissible burden on the liberty of employees to choose their own bargaining representatives. See <em>Colonie Fibre Co. v.

In that case, a collective bargaining agreement expired on May 31, 1955. A new contract, containing a dues deduction provision applicable to all union members, was signed on October 27,1955, to be effective as of October 1st. The court held that the October 27th agreement did not bind employees who had resigned from the union and revoked their dues deduction authorizations between May 31st and October 27th, including those who had resigned after October 1st. We see no basis for reaching a different conclusion in the present case with respect to the retroactive effect of the March 1, 1973, contract. We hold that under Act 195, the retroactive application of a collective bargaining agreement containing maintenance of membership and dues deduction provisions cannot nullify otherwise valid resignations of employees from the union which occur before the agreement is executed. It follows that, to the extent that the Federation claim depends on the retroactive application of the March 1st agreement to employees who submitted such resignations and revoked their dues deduction authorizations prior to March 1, 1973, the preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer should have been sustained.</p>

    <p id="b392-15" data-blocks='[["BL_392.16",392,[198,1985,1156,312]]]'>From the very start of negotiations, the Federation and the Board intended that any agreement they reached be applied retroactively. This purpose was expressed in the September 27, 1&amp;72, Memorandum of Understanding and achieved by the terms of the contract,</p>

      <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>A retroactive contract, entered following the termination of a previous agreement, conceptually and practically eliminates any gap between the expiration of the old compact and the signing of the new. It provides for continuity of the contractual relation regardless of any period during which, in fact, there was no contract.</p>
    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[191,693,1150,864]]]'>Under the terms of the contract and section 301 (18) of Act 195, the Board was obligated to the Federation to withhold the dues of members who failed to revoke their authorization between August 17, 1972 and August 31, 1972, the period provided under the contract and the Act. Because of the bargained-for retroactivity clause, the Board’s duties under the checkoff provision must be considered to be unaffected by the hiatus between September 1, 1972, and March 1, 1973. The Board’s obligation continued just as if the contract had been signed on August 31, and had become effective on September 1. Any revocation of authorization tendered after the contractual and statutory withdrawal dates cannot alter the Federation’s and the Board’s rights and obligations under the contracts.</p>
