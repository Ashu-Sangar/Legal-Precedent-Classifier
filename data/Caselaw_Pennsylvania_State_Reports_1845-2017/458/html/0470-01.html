One of those called to testify before the grand jury was one L. E. Wilson, <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>a builder and developer, who was president and sole shareholder of L. E.

There, the corporation attempted to attack the validity of a section of the New York Public Authorities Law which disqualified the corporation from obtaining any public contracts because of the refusal of its president to answer questions before a grand jury by asserting his privilege against self-incrimination. It was claimed that this was an unconstitutional penalty. In rejecting this argument, the Court said: “It has long been settled in federal jurisprudence that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is ‘essentially a personal one, applying only to natural individuals.’ It ‘cannot be utilized by or on behalf of any organization, such as a corporation.’ [citations omitted]. If a corporation cannot avail itself of the privilege against self-incrimination, it cannot take advantage of the claimed invalidity of a penalty imposed for refusal of an individual, its president, to waive the privilege. Since the privilege is not available to it, appellant, a corporation, cannot invoke the privilege to challenge the constitutionality of §2601 of the Public Authorities Law.” <a href="/us/392/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="392 U.S. 286" data-case-ids="6169428" data-case-paths="/us/392/0286-01">392 U.S. at 288-89</a>, <a href="/us/392/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="392 U.S. 286" data-case-ids="6169428" data-case-paths="/us/392/0286-01">20 L.Ed.2d at 1097</a>. Similar considerations obtain in the case at bar. The corporation cannot avail itself of the fact that its president was not properly warned of his constitutional rights before testifying before the grand jury and in consequence gave incriminating testimony which was later used in the prosecution of both.</p>
