More-wood is a Delaware Corporation whose principal place of business is in New York. It is registered to do business in Pennsylvania. It owns two buildings in Pittsburgh and each is rented to unrelated tenants and managed by a local rental agent. The Corporation also owns a sand and gravel business in New York from which it receives royalties and rental income from the rental of machinery used thereon. In addition, the company owns and manages a portfolio of securities in New York. Director’s meetings are held at the New York office where the President makes routine decisions. All the Corporation’s properties except the two Pittsburgh buildings are located in New York. More-wood has never had any employees working in Pennsylvania. One director and vice president resides in Pennsylvania but he also serves on boards of other companies. This officer travels to New York once a month to vote at meetings and does not supervise the Pennsylvania properties. Morewood carries separate insurance <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>policies on its Pittsburgh property. The net income from the Pittsburgh properties in 1966 amounted to $1,-657. The buildings were purchased in 1965 in a cash transaction and none of the out-of-state assets were used either to secure the Pennsylvania purchase money or to act as reserve for costs on any Pittsburgh property.</p>
    <p id="b249-3" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[143,685,1150,1029]]]'>When Morewood first submitted its tax return for 1966 it included its New York assets and receipts. Using the formula in the Franchise Tax Act and a value of $24,155,130 for its capital stock its franchise tax equalled $4,563.63. The Department of Revenue increased the valuation of the capital stock to $35,000,000. Morewood petitioned for resettlement alleging that it had erroneously included the New York assets and receipts and that the revaluation by the Department was incorrect. The Department refused the petition and the Board of Finance and Review sustained the Department’s position. Morewood appealed to the Court of Common Pleas which transferred the matter to the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth. Court reversed the decision of the Board and found that the tax due for the year 1966 should be confined to the value of the land and buildings situated in Pennsylvania which that court determined to be the stipulated book value of those properties.</p>

In <em>Emhart </em>we held that the sale of certain stock was related to the corporate enterprise and therefore was to be included in income allocable to Pennsylvania for purposes of computing the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax. That case is distinguishable in that (1) the business was admittedly unitary and (2) it was not an unrelated asset because the sale of the stock was used to reduce a corporate debt as specifically required by a prior loan agreement.

They contend that “other values such as local assessed value for tax purposes, replacement value, insurance on the property, income generated by the property, and appraised value should be considered.” In view of the fact that the purpose of the franchise tax is the privilege of doing business in the state and not a property tax, see <em>Commonwealth v.

Where, as here, however, the Commonwealth made no attempt to offer specific evidence of these “other values”, the book value absent such other evidence is an appropriate measure of the value of the franchise.
