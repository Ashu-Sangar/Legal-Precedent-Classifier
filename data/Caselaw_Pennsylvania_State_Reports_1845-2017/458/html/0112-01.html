At 6:15 a.m., Diane telephoned her mother in East Stroudsburg, saying that Coleman would not let her leave the apartment, that he would hang up the phone and that he was going to kill her. At approximately 6:25 a.m., the telephone connection was broken in Allentown, and the mother, Marilyn McCarthy, called the police as Diane had implored her to do. Five minutes later, Coleman, blood-spattered and cut about the face and hands, hailed a patrol car on a nearby street and said that he had hurt his girlfriend. The police found Diane in her apartment dead of multiple stab wounds at 6:35 a.m.</p>

He maintains that admission of this testimony under the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule was improper in that the decedent voiced only opinions without factual support at the time given. He argues that the effect of the judge’s ruling was to preclude a successful plea of self-defense and to deter the jury from a verdict of voluntary manslaughter by evidencing the existence of malice. Appellant testified at trial that he had stabbed the decedent, but claimed that she had precipitated his action by an unprovoked attack upon him with a letter opener. He submits now, in essence, that the decedent’s statements to her mother over the telephone are inadmissible as both hearsay and pure opinion. There is, however, no contention that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.</p>

This Court must determine whether a declaration rendered in conclusory terms over a telephone conveying the substance of one’s observation of another’s apparently threatening behavior is properly admissible as evidence under any exception to the hearsay rule.</p>

He concludes and we agree that within the scope of res gestae there exist four distinct exceptions to the hearsay rule, all possessing different indicia of reliability: (1) declarations of present bodily condition; (2) declarations of present mental state and emotion; (3) excited utterances; and (4) declarations of present sense impression. The practice in many courts, including those of this Commonwealth, has been to refer to the particular exception by the generic designation. Res gestae statements as defined by this <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>Court in <em>Allen v. Mack </em>partake of the characteristics of excited utterances. The exception for excited utterances is not applicable to the present circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b159-3" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[121,494,1151,1474]]]'>We note that the decedent’s statements to her mother resemble more a verbalization of her perception of appellant’s attitude and behavior than a declaration of emotion engendered by a prior physical occurrence. In a well-reasoned essay on the subject of res gestae, Professor Morgan asserted that there should be an exception to the hearsay rule for present sense impressions, <em>i.e., </em>declarations concerning conditions or non-exciting events which the declarant is observing at the time of his declaration. Morgan, <em>Res Gestae, </em><a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wash.%20L.%20Rev.%2091" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="12 Wash. L. Rev. 91">12 Wash. L. Rev. 91</a>, 96 (1937). The indicium of reliability for such a declaration is in his view its contemporaneousness with the observation of the occurrence or condition. Relative immediacy of the declaration insures that there will have been little opportunity for reflection or calculated misstatement. There is no necessity for the presence of a startling occurrence or accident to serve as a source of reliability, for: “The declaration is ‘instinctive, rather than deliberative — in short, the reflex product of immediate sensual impressions, unaided by retrospective mental action. These are the indicia of verity which the law accepts as a substitute for the usual requirements of an oath and opportunity for cross-examination.’ ” Morgan, <em>Res Gestae, </em>12 Wash. L.

Therein, the defendant in an automobile collision case offered through a witness the declaration of one Mrs. Cooper that when the plaintiff’s car passed her at a point some four miles prior to that of the eventual accident, she had said: “[T]hey must have been drunk, that we would find them somewhere on the road wrecked if they keep that rate of speed up.” Objection to the admissibility of this testimony was sustained at trial, but the Supreme Court reversed. It found that the evidential value of the remark was more than merely cumulative and that the comment possessed exceptional reliability in that it was contemporaneous in time with the observation, was safe from any defect in memory or opportunity for calculated misstatement, and had been made to the testifying witness who had an equal opportunity to observe and hence to check a misstatement. <em>See also Hastings v.

    <p id="b161-3" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[139,667,1150,1358]]]'>Thorough consideration of the decedent’s statements to her mother over the telephone in light of the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule leads us to agree with the decision of the Court of Common Pleas that they are properly admissible as evidence. The decedent told her mother that appellant would not let her leave the apartment, that he would hang up the phone and that as soon as the phone had been hung up, he would kill her. The mother testified that appellant could be heard shouting in the background, and appellant himself testified that he and the decedent had engaged in a loud argument immediately prior to the telephone call. Contemporaneity of the declarations with the observation seems clear. There existed a sufficient confluence of time and events to vest special reliability in the statements. Moreover, we do not consider the inability of the mother to have observed the situation in the apartment to be sufficiently persuasive in effect to disallow application of the exception. Verification has never been deemed an absolute prerequisite to admissibility of testimony under this Court’s previous treatment of res gestae exceptions to the hearsay rule. In view of the facts and corroborative testimony of the appellant, we can see no reason to alter that practice in this case.</p>

Pittsburgh Rys., </em><a href="/pa/226/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="226 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="967831" data-case-paths="/pa/226/0537-01">226 Pa. at 538</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.%20730" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="75 A. 730">75 A. at 731</a>. The rationale underlying this Court’s decision in <em>ShadowsM </em>is not persuasive; indeed, it runs contrary to a reasoned consideration of reliability as the groundstone for admissibility of evidence.

By definition, however, our holding that the decedent’s statements are admissible under the exception for present sense impressions to the hearsay rule disposes of appellant’s contention. An impression of contemporaneous events or conditions is not at all similar to an opinion rendered on evidence presented at trial.

The victim’s mother testified that her daughter, Diane McCarthy, telephoned her on the morning she died and told her mother that she had just been awakened by the defendant punching her seven times in the face. The mother further testified that throughout the call she could hear Coleman yelling loudly and angrily in the background. Certainly this episode in which Diane was caught up may be truly characterized as “sufficiently startling to render normal reflective thought processes . . . inoperative.” McCormick, op. cit. <em>supra. </em>In <em>Commonwealth v.

In the present case, Diane’s declaration immediately followed defendant’s first assault upon her and preceded only by moments the further threatened attack. Again, such an attack and such a threat surely qualify as “startling” (McCormick) or as “shocking” <em>(Allen v. Mack, supra).</em>

The victim’s mother testified that when she suggested to Diane that she would hang up and call the police, her daughter begged her not to do so “‘[because as soon as the phone is hung up,’ he was going to kill her.” The conclusion is irresistible that this declaration was the victim’s spontaneous reaction to the attack upon her only minutes before. There was no evidence that the statement was premeditated or in any way the product of design on the declarant’s part. The fact that her fear was indeed justified was tragically borne out by the fact that only minutes after her frantic telephone call to her mother, Diane McCarthy was found dying of 102 stab wounds.</p>
