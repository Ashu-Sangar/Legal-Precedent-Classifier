When appellee refused to answer these interrogatories, several demands for such answers were made by the Commission which were rejected by appellee. Finally, on March 21, 1973, PHRC filed a complaint in equity with the Commonwealth Court requesting that court to compel appellee’s compliance with appellant’s demand for answers to its interrogatories. Appellee then responded with preliminary objections, alleging: (1) that the complaint was defective in that (a) it was not made, signed and filed by a member of the Commission as required by Section 9 of the Act (43 P.S. §959), (b) it did not set forth the particulars of the unlawful practice as required by Section 9, and (c) it was issued without probable cause; and (2) that appellant had not exhausted its statutory remedies and, therefore, that equity did not lie.</p>

The averment in paragraph 4 of the PHRC’s complaint tells appellee little more than that it is charged with a violation of Section 5 of the Act. To say that such a statement “clearly delineates the perimeters of the area of concern” is misleading, if not erroneous. When the “perimeters” become as expansive as those involved here, their delineation is of little significance or aid to the party attempting to frame responsive pleadings. In addition, appellant’s <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>assertion ignores the fact that Section 9 of the Act does not speak of the complaint merely “delineating] the perimeters of the area of concern” hut requires that the complaint “set forth the particulars” of the unlawful discriminatory practice complained of.” Whether or not Section 9 requires the allegation of such specific instance of discrimination, there can be no question that this section requires more particularity than that contained in appellant’s averment. To construe Section 9 to accommodate appellant’s position would render the relevant statutory language in question virtually meaningless. We will not adopt such a construction.</p>
    <p id="b606-4" data-blocks='[["BL_606.4",606,[194,974,1157,415]]]'>Appellant has relied heavily on a number of federal precedents to support its position.

In <em>Local 101}, </em>the charge was limited to the discriminatory restriction on union membership of minority group members because of race or national origin. <em>Spartan </em>involved a series of separate charges, one of which was that the employer had restricted certain occupational categories to exclude Negroes, Spanish-speaking Americans, and Indians. While these charges may not be models of specificity, they clearly <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>give the employer significantly better notice of the nature of the unlawful practice he had allegedly committed than do the charges presently before us. In addition, both the <em>Local 104, </em>and the <em>Spartan </em>courts emphasized the notice pleading system of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and thus felt restrained from requiring more particularity in pleading before federal administrative agencies than that which would suffice in the federal courts. <a href="/f2d/439/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="439 F.2d 237" data-case-ids="755183" data-case-paths="/f2d/439/0237-01">439 F.2d at 243</a>; <a href="/f2d/461/1055-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="461 F.2d 1055" data-case-ids="1330110" data-case-paths="/f2d/461/1055-01">461 F.2d at 1059</a>.

We find this theory equally untenable. Initially, because PHRC has chosen to proceed via complaint in this matter, the scope of its pure investigatory power is not properly in issue. Even beyond that problem, however, we have serious doubts regarding the appellant’s power to com<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>pel answers to interrogatories in the absence of a proceeding initiated by a proper complaint. There is no question that the PHRC has the general authority and the duty under Section 9 to conduct investigations even in the absence of a properly-filed, legally-adequate complaint, provided there is “reason to believe” that an fin-lawful discriminatory practice has occurred prior to the commencement of such investigation. However, except in the case of investigatory hearings relating to racial problems under Section 8.1 (43 P.S. §458.1),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the appellant’s arsenal of formal evidence-gathering powers, found in Section 7(g) (43 P.S. §957(g)), is usable only “where a complaint has been properly filed before the Commission.” We construe the requirement that the complaint be “properly filed” to implicitly require that the complaint be free of substantial defect. Thus, in view of our earlier conclusion that the instant charges are defective, the powers delineated in Section 7(g) do not apply here. Even if Section 7(g) were applicable in the present context, there is the further problem that the power to compel answers to interrogatories is not included among those enumerated in that section. However, we express no opinion at this time as to the PHRC’s interrogatory power, or lack thereof, in a proceeding initiated by a complaint conforming to the requirements of Section 9.</p>

It has a power of inquisition, if one chooses to call it that, which is not derived from the judicial function. It is more analogous to the Grand Jury, which does not depend on a case or controversy for power to get evidence but can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not.
