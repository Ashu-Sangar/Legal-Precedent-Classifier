On the state of the record before us, we find meaningful appellate review impos<a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>sible, and thus remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b70-4" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[217,428,1158,480]]]'>The record before us contains almost no information concerning the history of this case. The briefs submitted to us indicate the following facts. The appellant was indicted on December 9, 1971, for the crime of murder. He was subsequently arrested on October 11, 1972, in New York and returned to Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on December 22, 1972. On January 19, 1973, appellant filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Relief was denied and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b70-7" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[212,920,1160,636]]]'>The docket entries contained in the record before us show only that on January 19, 1973, the appellant, James Whitest, filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus. There are no other docket entries as to any other proceedings in the trial court. <em>See </em>Pa. R. S. Ct. 60. The docket entries do not show whether an answer was filed, or a hearing held, or an official transcript of any hearing filed, or a final order entered, or an opinion filed. Moreover, the record submitted to this Court does not contain an answer, a transcript of a hearing, a copy of any final order, or any opinion by the trial court. <em>See </em>Pa. R. S. Ct. 56.</p>

Appellant’s counsel states in the brief submitted to this Court that this appeal “was taken by the appellant on his own behalf and it was subsequent to his appeal that the instant counsel was appointed.”</p>
