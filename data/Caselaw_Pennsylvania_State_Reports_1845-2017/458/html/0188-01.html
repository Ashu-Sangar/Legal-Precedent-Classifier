Results of an analysis of blood taken from appellant Steckel shortly after his arrest, showing a blood-alcohol percentage of 0.21 by weight, were introduced at his trial. Breathalyzer test results were introduced at the trials of appellants DiFrancesco, Douts, and Buckwalter, showing blood-alcohol percentages of 0.16, 0.19 and 0.21, respectively. The court’s instructions to the jury concerning these test results were substantially identical. In each case, the trial judge recited the pertinent portions of section 624.1. Exceptions were taken to these instructions on the basis that the statute infringed upon the constitutional rights of the defendants.

Although the terms “inference” and “presumption” are often used interchangeably, this Court has adhered to the prevailing view among legal commentators, and drawn a distinction between these two concepts.

Turner, </em><a href="/pa/456/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="456 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="584444" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0116-01">456 Pa. 116</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20298" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="317 A.2d 298">317 A.2d 298</a> (1974); <em>Commonwealth v.

(2d ed. E. Cleary 1972) ; 9 J. Wigmore, Treatise on Evidence §2490 ff. (3d ed. 1940). According to this view, an inference is merely a logical tool which permits the trier of fact to proceed from one fact to another. A presumption, on the other hand, is a procedural device which not only permits an inference of the “presumed” fact, but also shifts to the opposing party the burden of producing evidence to disprove the presumed fact. Failure to meet this burden of production will normally result in binding instructions on the issue of the presumed fact’s existence in favor of the party invoking the presumption. But the notion of a directed verdict against a criminal defendant is contrary to accepted tenets of criminal justice. Placing the burden of production on a defendant under the threat of such a sanction would run afoul of the presumption of innocence, see <em>Commonwealth v. Bonomo, </em><a href="/pa/396/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="396 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1284928" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0222-01">396 Pa. 222</a>, 229-230, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.2d%20441" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="151 A.2d 441">151 A.2d 441</a>, 445-46 (1959), as well as the defendant’s privilege of declining to testify. Thus, where the presumed fact comprises an element of the crime charged, the inference authorized by a presumption can never be compelled by the court. See generally <em>Commonwealth v. Turner, </em><a href="/pa/456/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="456 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="584444" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0116-01">456 Pa. 116</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20298" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="317 A.2d 298">317 A.2d 298</a> (1974).</p>

In this sense, the evidence forming the basis of a statutory inference functions no differently from the other evidence in the prosecution’s case: the stronger the evidence against a defendant, the greater will be the pressure on him to come forward with evidence in his own defense.
