The events preceding Smith’s death were as follows. Smith, following a disagreement with his girlfriend, purchased a fifth of gin and visited the appellant and the appellant’s wife on the evening of February 6, 1971. Several relatives of the appellant’s wife were also present. During the visit, which lasted about two and one-half to three hours, Smith drank several glasses of gin. Around midnight, the appellant and Smith went out. Smith wanted to get some heroin and agreed to pay for it since the appellant had no money. The appellant said he knew where a purchase could be made. Both Smith and the appellant were drug users and had previously taken narcotics together. Two “nickel bags” of heroin were purchased and the two men went to a friend’s home, known as a “shooting gallery,” where visitors could take heroin. After their arrival, Smith began to drink again, even though the <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>appellant told Mm he should stop drinking. Smith wrapped a belt around his arm and attempted to insert into his vein a needle attached to a syringe contaimng heroin. When Smith had trouble hitting his vein, the appellant, at Smith’s request, inserted the needle into Smith’s vein. Smith then took over again and injected the heroin into his body. There is no evidence that the amount of heroin was other than Smith’s normal dose. A short wMle later, Smith began moaning and slid to the floor. The appellant and other men present in the room went to the aid of Smith and attempted to revive him. When these efforts failed, the appellant wrapped Smith in a bedspread and took him to the hospital. The appellant then notified Smith’s family by telephone that Smith was at the hospital in serious condition. Shortly thereafter, the appellant was told that Smith was dead.</p>

In <em>Bowden, </em>there was no evidence that the deceased had been drinking, whereas in. this case the appellant knew that Smith had been drinking and testified, that heroin and alcohol “don’t mix” and could be “deadly.” The prosecution, however, presented no evidence that death generally occurs when heroin is taken following the consumption of alcohol. 'Without such evidence, we cannot accept the validity of the premise suggested. The truth of the matter may well be to the contrary since the combined use of alcohol and heroin is not uncommon in our society. Moreover, significant doubt was expressed by the prosecution’s expert as to whether the <em>interrelationship </em>of alcohol and heroin or the heroin by itself was the cause of death. The Deputy Medical Examiner, after testifying that “death occurred as a result of narcotic drug and ethanolism” added the following in response to the prosecutor’s questions: “Q. When you say the cause of death was the adverse effect of narcotic drugs and ethanolism, is the presence of one or the other significant in terms of bringing about death? A. The significance here is that they both were significantly present. <em>Their interrelationship is not sufficiently clear so as to say that one is dependent upon the other, </em>so as to say, from my examination and the circumstances surrounding ibis death, and the toxicologic findings; there is the presence of ethanolism, this is a depressant drug, and there is the presence of a narcotic drug. This is also a de<a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>pressant drag. The two together are significant by virtue of their presence. The death could well have been considered as simply an adverse effect of narcotic drug with the ethanolism as a significant contributing circumstance or factor. In this instance the choice of the term adverse effect of narcotic drug and ethanolism was only by virtue of their significant presence, meaning the narcotic and the level of alcohol. Q. <em>Do I understand you to say, Doctor, that the presence of the drug, the narcotic in this particular case, was the cause of death by itself ? </em>A. <em>It could have been in my opinion, yes. </em>Q. <em>Alright. Now, the presence of ethanolism, teas that a necessary prerequisite to death, in your opinion? </em>A. <em>No, not necessary.” </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="b429-3" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[188,1102,1150,1195]]]'>In <em>Bowden, </em>we recognized that the proportion of deaths to the number of times narcotics are used is not nearly great enough to justify an assumption that one taking heroin is running a substantial and unjustified risk that death will result. <em>People v. Pinckney, </em><a href="/ad2d/38/0217-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="38 A.D.2d 217" data-case-ids="5592876" data-case-paths="/ad2d/38/0217-01">38 App. Div. 2d 217</a>, 219, <a href="/citations/?q=328%20N.Y.2d%20550" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="328 N.Y.2d 550">328 N.Y.2d 550</a>, 556-557 (1972); see <em>also Beckham v.

Similarly, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we cannot assume that one who takes heroin after drinking runs a substantial and unjustified risk that death will result. We must therefore conclude that the appellant’s act of assisting his friend with the insertion of a needle in this ease, like the appellant’s act in <em>Bowden, </em>was not an act from which we can infer that appellant must have known that death was likely to result. The prosecution also argues that by assisting Smith, appellant committed a felony and that malice should be implied from the commission of that felony.
