    <p id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.6",645,[168,370,1149,374]]]'>The Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has filed a petition in this Court “For Supersedeas and Writ of Prohibition” naming as respondent, the Honorable Charles P. Mirarchi, Jr., a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The facts giving rise to the filing of this petition may be summarized thusly.</p>
    <p id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.7",645,[169,754,1150,973]]]'>Beginning in July 1972, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission [Commission], an administrative commission within the Department of Justice of the Commonwealth, began an extensive investigation into police corruption and the quality of law enforcement in the City of Philadelphia. Following the completion of its investigation, the Commission filed a report on March 11, 1974, stating, inter alia, it has found “that police corruption in Philadelphia is ongoing, widespread, systematic and occurring at all levels of the police department.” The Commission’s report also suggested that “a local district attorney cannot properly investigate the very police on whom he must rely for the day-to-day conduct of his job,” and for this reason the Attorney General should “appoint a Special Deputy Attorney General as an independent prosecutor with jurisdiction over police corruption investigations and prosecutions in Philadelphia.”</p>
    <p id="b645-6" data-blocks='[["BL_645.8",645,[168,1739,1150,423]],["BL_646.1",646,[192,321,1157,1781]]]'>On March 18, 1974, the Honorable F. Emmett Fitzpatrick, Jr., the District Attorney of Philadelphia, filed a petition with Judge Mirarchi, the respondent, requesting that the Grand Jury for the March Session of the Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division of Philadelphia, be specifically charged “to investigate alleged criminal conduct on the part of individuals within the Philadelphia Police Department and to make present<a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>ments to the Court as the ends of justice may require.” A hearing on this petition was held before Judge Mirarchi on March 27th, at which time the Attorney General objected to empanelling the March Session Grand Jury for the purpose of investigating the matter requested by the District Attorney. At the same time, the Attorney General notified Judge Mirarchi in writing that he was superseding Mr. Fitzpatrick, the District Attorney, in this matter and was appointing a Deputy Attorney General in lieu of the District Attorney to investigate and prosecute police corruption cases in Philadelphia. At the same time, the Attorney General also notified Judge Mirarchi that he was then withdrawing the District Attorney’s petition requesting that the March Session Grand Jury be empaneled and directed to investigate police corruption in Philadelphia. Judge Mirarchi refused to give effect to the Attorney General’s notice of supersession of the District Attorney and of the Attorney General’s withdrawal of the District Attorney’s petition to empanel the Grand Jury for the purpose requested. Judge Mirarchi then proceeded to empanel and charge the Grand Jury in accordance with the District Attorney’s petition. The Attorney General then filed the instant petition requesting a supersedeas and the issuance of a writ prohibiting the March Session Grand Jury from proceeding with an investigation into corruption in the Police Department of Philadelphia and prohibiting Judge Mirarchi from continuing to exercise jurisdiction in such an investigation. Judge Mirarchi and Mr. Fitzpatrick, the District Attorney, filed answers to the petition objecting to the issuance of the writ.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> We heard oral argument on April 29, 1974.</p>

See 7 C.J.S. Attorney General § 5 (1937).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> However, over strong dissent, this Court has ruled that the Attorney General of Pennsylvania has the power to supersede a district attorney if his action is not arbitrary, and if his decision to so act is “ <em>‘reasonably based upon the attendant pertinent circumstances from which its exercise </em>arises.’ ” <em>Margiotti Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/365/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="365 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="1225552" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0330-01">365 Pa. 330</a>, 333, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.2d%20465" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="75 A.2d 465">75 A.2d 465</a>, 466 (1950) (quoting from <em>Dauphin County Grand Jury Investigation Proceedings (No. 3), </em><a href="/pa/332/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="332 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1186569" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0358-01">332 Pa. 358</a>, 364, 365, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20809" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 A.2d 809">2 A.2d 809</a>, 812 (1938)).

This ruling was based not on the assumption such power was given statutorily, but rather on the premise that such power “enveloped” attorney generals at common law and the Attorney General of Pennsylvania was “clothed” with the same power. This reasoning has been severely criticized.
