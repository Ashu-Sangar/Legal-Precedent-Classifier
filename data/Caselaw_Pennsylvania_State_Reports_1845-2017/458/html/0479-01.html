It is generally agreed that the non-delegation principle does not require that all details of administration be precisely or separately enumerated in the statute. ‘While the legislature cannot delegate power to make a law, it may, where necessary, confer authority and discretion in connection with the execution of the law; it may establish primary standards and impose upon others the duty to carry out the declared legislative policy in accordance with the general provisions of the act.’ . . .

While the standard of action in the public interest is not explicitly set forth in the statute, the directive to fund only those projects most beneficial to the public interest is so implicit in the tenor of the statutory provisions of Section 16(e) that it would strain this Court’s interpretative powers to construe otherwise. The legislative designation “agricultural research projects” is a sufficiently adequate standard to guide and restrain the exercise of this particular committee’s delegated administrative function — implementation of the legislative policy determination that a fixed amount of excess proceeds from harness racing should support agricultural research— in approving and overseeing the expenditure of public funds. The General Assembly has not, in my estimation, delegated legislative power to the Committee. Indeed, in imposing upon the seventeen individuals the duty to carry out the declared legislative policy, the General Assembly has chosen administrators broadly representative of agricultural interests within the Commonwealth whose expertise could well be expected.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>
