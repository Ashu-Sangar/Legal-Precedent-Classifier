At approximately 6:15 p.m. on May 7,1970, shortly after Ms arrest for burglary, appellant was warned of Ms constitutional rights. Although appel<a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>lant’s original statement to the police denied participation in the homicide, appellant volunteered to “tell what happened” and after approximately forty minutes of questioning agreed to submit to a polygraph test. After approximately a half hour, and upon discovering that all polygraph machines were in use, the police questioned appellant for another forty minutes. Less than an hour after this second round of questioning appellant was taken for his polygraph test. Prior to the test appellant signed a written waiver form indicating that he was taking the examination voluntarily. The test lasted an hour and a half during part of which time appellant was fed. At the conclusion of the test and shortly before 10:30 p.m., appellant admitted his participation in the Selez murder. During the interview which immediately ensued, appellant further explained the circumstances surrounding the homicide and by approximately 1:15 a.m., on the morning of May 8, 1970, the essential details of appellant’s criminal activity were reduced to writing.</p>

Public interest requires that interrogation, and that at a police station, not completely be forbidden, so long as it is conducted fairly, reasonably, within proper limits and with full regard to the rights of those being questioned.’ ” <em>Culombe v.

Here we have a situation where the initial interrogation of appellant fully complied with this standard.

The fact that all but the initial constitutional questioning of appellant occurred after learning that polygraph machines were inaccessible and that appellant was agreeable to waiting for such examination supports this contention. As was recently repeated in <em>Futch, </em><a href="/pa/447/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="447 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1942994" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0389-01">447 Pa. at 392</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%20417" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="290 A.2d 417">290 A.2d at </a>418: “Necessary delay can reasonably relate to time to administratively process an accused with booking, fingerprinting and other steps and sometimes even to make same [sic] limited preliminary investigation into his connection with the crime for which he was arrested, especially when it is directed to possible exculpation of the one arrested. Adams v. United States, <a href="/f2d/399/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="399 F.2d 574" data-case-ids="2140731" data-case-paths="/f2d/399/0574-01">399 F. 2d 574</a>, 579 (D. C. Cir. 1968) (concurring opinion).” Since the accused offei’ed to take the polygraph test within an hour of arrest in order to exculpate himself from the alleged homicide charge, the limited delay due to the administering of such test is the type of permissible preliminary investigation envisioned in <em>Fwtch. </em>Consequently, the time lapse preceding and insulting from the polygraph examination cannot be said to constitute an unnecessary delay. Furthermore, since it was at the conclusion of this examination that appellant admitted his involvement in the alleged crime and <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>since during the interview which immediately followed appellant willingly substantiated and clarified his earlier admission, the subsequent “period of explanation” is likewise not objectionable on <em>Futch </em>grounds. <em>See Commonwealth v. Terry, </em><a href="/pa/457/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="457 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="478229" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0185-01">457 Pa. 185</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=321%20A.2d%20654" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="321 A.2d 654">321 A. 2d 654</a> (1974).</p>
    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[146,656,1150,583]]]'>Appellant further asks the Court to consider as part of the relevant delay the time which elapsed between oral and formal statements. However, since appellant’s formal statement was merely a repetition of his earlier incriminating confessions and since both oral and written statements had been admitted in the trial below, even if we were to find the delay following appellant’s oral statement unnecessary, at best it would be harmless error. <em>Chapman v. California, </em><a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. 18</a> (1967).
