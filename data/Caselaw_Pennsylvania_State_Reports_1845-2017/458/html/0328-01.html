The appellant lived on a farm in Annville, Lebanon County, with his brother, Ronald Light. On the night of October 2, 1972, at approximately nine o’clock, while the appellant was walking outside his home, a car drove up containing three persons, Rebecca Rudy, Dennis Morgan and Richard Garrison. Although he was not acquainted with the Rudy girl, Light knew both Morgan and Garrison. Garrison had gone to school with Light’s brother and Morgan had worked with Light at <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>a shoe factory in Lebanon County. The three had been driving around town and drinking beer before they arrived at Light’s place. They asked Light if his brother was home. Upon being told that he was not, they asked permission for the girl to use the bathroom inside. Light agreed.</p>
    <p id="b373-3" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[179,645,1149,485]]]'>Once inside, the group, including Light, sat around the kitchen drinking beer, while Morgan made five or six crank telephone calls. The Eudy girl and Garrison then went into the living room and the defendant left to get more beer, apparently at the request of Morgan. During Light’s absence, Morgan went upstairs and several minutes later called Garrison to join him. While upstairs, according to Garrison, Morgan asked him “what kind of girl” Eebecca Eudy was.</p>
    <p id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[180,1140,1151,920]]]'>Appellant testified that when he arrived back at his home with the beer, he noticed that there were lights on in an upstairs bedroom, where, according to him, there hadn’t been any when he had left. He proceeded to take the gun which he kept on the floor of the car and went inside. He went through the kitchen and into the living room. At this same time, Morgan and Garrison were running down the stairs, with Garrison in the lead. When Garrison reached the landing at the foot of the stairs, Light pointed the gun at him and fired twice, wounding him in the chest. The defendant then fired seven shots at Morgan, killing him. Immediately afterwards, Light went into the kitchen, put down his gun, and with the aid of Miss Eudy, called the police. The Eudy girl, while present throughout, apparently was napping in the living room and did not awaken until she heard gunfire.</p>

He alleges that, as a result of the judge’s charge, the jury had no choice but to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter. We need not pass on the merits of this argument. Following the conclusion of the charge, defense counsel took only a general exception to the charge. Failure to take a specific exception to the language complained of forecloses review by this Court. <em>Vanic v.

Although it is urged that the alleged error in the charge was “basic and fundamental”, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant contends that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of a psychiatrist as to whether the. defendant believed that he was acting in self-defense when he shot <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>the two victims. Defense counsel first indicated his intention to call the psychiatrist, Dr. Muhlfelder, at a pre-trial conference. Counsel then stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that the testimony was being offered in support of the defense of self-defense since the psychiatrist would testify that the defendant was operating “under a <em>bona fide </em>and reasonable belief” that a felony was being committed by the victims. The judge rejected the offer of proof because it did not come within the M’Naghten Hule. At trial, the defendant twice renewed the offer, again pointing out that the psychiatrist would testify that “Light assumed he was acting in self-defense”. Both times the offer was rejected by the trial judge. We have concluded that the exclusion of the psychiatrist’s testimony insofar as it pertained to appellant’s subjective belief was error, but, because of the unique circumstances of this case, not such error as demands reversal.</p>

    <p id="b376-5" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[200,1423,1157,702]],["BL_377.1",377,[163,333,1151,582]]]'>Our holding in <em>Jones </em>was that psychiatric testimony concerning a defendant’s mental capacity and condition at the time he purportedly made a confession is admissible on the question of his ability to give such a statement. Following the principles approved in <em>MeCusher, </em>we stated that “[t]he state of mind of a defendant at the time of giving a confession can plainly be brought into question at trial and <em>the defendant should be able to introduce &lt;my evidence </em>— lay <em>or psychiatric </em>— which <em>is relevant to that issue” </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <a href="/citations/?q=459%20Pa.%2067" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="459 Pa. 67">459 Pa. 67</a>.

In <em>McCusker, </em>we held psychiatric evidence to he admissible on the question whether a defendant was acting in the heat of passion at the time he committed a killing. Affirmative testimony in this respect, if believed by the factfinder, would probably serve to reduce the degree of the defendant’s culpability from murder to voluntary manslaughter. In the instant case, the psychiatric evidence would be relevant to the question of whether a homicide, otherwise unjustified, can be said to have been justifiable because of the defendant’s fear for his life.</p>

The psychiatrist was permitted to testify “that at the time of the shooting the defendant suffered from an intense fear psychosis, which made it possible for him to do something irrational and not to be aware of what he was doing”. <a href="/pa/407/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="407 Pa. 575" data-case-ids="1307388" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0575-01">407 Pa. at 581</a>. While the propriety of this testimony was not directly questioned, nowhere in this Court’s opinion did we intimate that such testimony should have been excluded. Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth v.

Our opinion merely observed that such testimony was “ entitled to very little weight”; we did not say that it should have been excluded. Long ago, this Court spoke of “the legal and <em>psychological </em>distinctions between justifiable homicide and voluntary manslaughter”, <em>Commonwealth v.

As indicated above, the question of whether a defendant claiming the defense of self-defense entertained a reasonable belief of an imminent serious danger to himself involves two aspects, one objective and the other subjective. While the psychiatric evidence here tendered was admissible on the question whether the appellant subjectively entertained the belief, it would be of no help in determining whether that belief was reasonable in light of all the circumstances. After a careful review of the record, we have concluded that the appellant’s belief, real to him though it may have been, was not reasonable.</p>

While this incident might tend to indicate that Light had something to fear from Morgan, its probative value is weakened because the incident took place in 1968, four years before the shooting. Light also testified to another fighting incident in which Morgan’s brother was peripherally involved.

The question is, considering this evidence, whether a reasonable man would have entertained a belief that he was in danger of imminent death, great bodily harm, or a felony, and that there was a necessity for him to kill when confronted by two acquaintances whom he had invited into his home, coming down the stairway of his home, each apparently unarmed. The jury was manifestly justified in concluding, as it did, that a reasonable man would not have had such a belief. Appellant’s own testimony tended to discredit his contention that his actions were reasonable: he testified that the only things of value that he had upstairs on the night of the shooting were a silver dollar, a set of Corning ware and two place settings of silverware. It is not reasonable to suppose that the defense of such property requires a killing. The admission of psychiatric evidence as to the defendant’s state of mind, as to what his belief was at the time, could not have supplied the missing element of reasonableness.</p>

Mr. Justice Pomeeoy-’s opinion then labels the first part of the test as “entirely subjective,” and the second part as “clearly objective.” Having labeled the second part of the test as “clearly objective,” it is easy to conclude that any testimony to be given by a psychiatrist would be irrelevant (and therefore harmless error if excluded) as to the objective question of whether defendant’s belief was reasonable.

It is easy to imagine situations where two different people could, because of differences in their subjective states of mind, “reasonably” react in totally different ways to the same stimulus.
