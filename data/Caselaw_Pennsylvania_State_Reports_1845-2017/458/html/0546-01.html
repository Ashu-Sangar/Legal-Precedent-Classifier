We have found no precedent nor can we perceive of any reason why such a distinction should be drawn. Where parties of equal bargaining positions mutually agree that their future disputes, if they arise, be determined by arbitration, they should be bound by that proAdsion when the dispute in fact arises and not be permitted to avoid the consequences of such action by specious challenges which allegedly questions the validity of <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>the contract itself.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Here, there is no question that there was a mutual agreement to arbitrate future disputes. Equally as clear is that there is no challenge to the capacity of the Authority to enter into an agreement providing for arbitration. Furthermore, the parties operated under this agreement for a period of three and one-half years. In this posture the lower court properly refused to reach the merits of appellant’s claim of lack of capacity. It having been determined that the parties had agreed to arbitration the only issue left for the courts to consider was whether the dispute in question fell within the purview of the submission. <em>Women’s SPCA v.

It is not now within the province of the company to determine whether the dispute should or should not be arbitrated. There is no limitation in the contract as to the nature of the dispute which shall be cognizable by arbitration. The person who offers carte blanche to another to enter the temple of arbitration may not later on impose restrictions as to the type of clothing the other person shall wear when he presents himself at the doors of the temple.” Here the controversy centers around appellee’s claims for pay due him under the contract upon termination of his employment. It cannot be seriously questioned that a dispute of this nature was intended to fall within the provisions of paragraph 17 nor will we permit this obvious expression of the parties’ intention to be frustrated by appellant’s belated attack upon the validity of the principal contract.</p>
