On June 22, 1964, appellant, represented by court appointed counsel, entered a plea of guilty to murder generally. Immediately thereafter, a degree of guilt hearing was held wherein appellant was found guilty of first degree murder. No post-trial motions were then filed nor appeal taken. A sentence of life imprisonment was imposed.</p>
    <p id="b411-4" data-blocks='[["BL_411.7",411,[161,862,1154,976]]]'>On April 3, 1969, appellant, pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (PCHA), filed a petition alleging <em>inter alia, </em>that he had not intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. The hearing court found he had been denied this right and ordered that appellant be permitted to file an appeal as though timely filed. However, that court went on to discuss the remaining issues raised in the petition. Specifically, the PCHA hearing court found appellant’s contention that his guilty plea was not knowingly and intelligently entered because it was induced by a coerced confession to be without merit and denied relief upon that ground. An appeal was then taken to this Court, wherein we remanded the case to permit appellant an opportunity to file post-trial motions <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>with leave that appellant, should such motions be denied, be permitted to file an appeal from the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

They arranged a meeting that night at 10:00 p.m. at which time Jenkins would pick Bricker up in his automobile at a designated location. To that meeting the appellant carried a loaded .45 calibre automatic revolver. Prior to this rendezvous appellant had discussed on several occasions the possibility of robbing Jenkins with one Michael Ayers. There was also testimony to suggest that appellant had reason to believe that the deceased would have a substantial sum of money with him at the time of the meeting. Upon meeting, the two men drove off in the automobile of the deceased. After a short time appellant inquired of the deceased as to the status of the prospective employment. Jenkins is alleged to have responded, “You are not doing nothing for me, why should I get you a job.” Thereupon appellant removed an automatic revolver from his person, fired two shots at the deceased from a distance of approximately two feet. One shot struck the deceased in the chest and the bullet after entering the body entered the top portion of the heart. The second bullet passed through the arm of the deceased, entered the chest and proceeded downward striking the liver. Appellant then pushed the deceased out of the <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>vehicle and drove from the scene and in so doing unknowingly dragged the deceased for approximately two hundred feet before the body of the deceased became dislodged from the vehicle.

We do not find any evidence offered during the degree of guilt hearing that would suggest a contrary intent.

    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[176,743,1160,703]]]'>We do, however, have some difficulty in accepting the court <em>en bane’s </em>alternative theory in support of the first degree murder conviction. Conceding the existence of evidence that on prior occasions the appellant had discussed with one of his companions the possibility of robbing the deceased, there is no evidence to be found in this record suggesting that robbery was his intention on the night in question. The robbery theory is also weakened by the fact that no effort was made by the appellant to remove the money and a watch that the deceased had in his possession nor is there an indication of an occurrence that may explain why he was interrupted in carrying out a design to rob.</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[173,1456,1159,428]]]'>Nevertheless, in view of our conclusion that there is a basis for finding wilfull, deliberate and premeditated murder and the court below did in fact make such a finding, this would justify an adjudication of murder in the first degree even though the alternative reason offered may not have been supported by the testimony. We therefore conclude that the appellant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is without merit.</p>

The post-conviction court, after reviewing all of the testimony, had ample basis for rejecting the belated claim of coercion and finding a voluntary and wilfull confession.</p>
