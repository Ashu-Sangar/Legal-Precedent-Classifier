After completing the intended robbery, the appellant and Johnson returned to the vehicle that had brought them to the scene and began their escape. They encountered an unmarked police vehicle containing the victim and his partner. After ordering the vehicle in which appellant was a passenger to stop, as Officer Stuckey left his vehicle and approached the vehicle of the appellant, he was shot and killed by appellant.
