The trust was created by Fannie E. Emmons who died January 2,1934, domiciled in New York, where her will dated February 17, 1931, was probated November 2, 1934. The beneficiary is the decedent’s niece, Venice Margaret Cronin, who, since May 1, 1924, has been an inmate in a hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, maintained in part at the expense of the Commonwealth. At the adjudication of the account of the executrix, letters of trusteeship were granted to the appellant trustee by the Surrogate of Broome County, New York. The trust property was awarded pursuant to the following provision of the will:</p>

The trustee communicated the demand to the remainderman and was warned not to make payment.

The award was, however, not absolute; it was conditioned, as required by the New York Law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> by the decree of the Surrogate’s Court on the entry of a bond that the trustee “shall faithfully discharge the trust reposed in it as Trustee under the last Will and Testament of Fannie E. Emmons, late of the Town of Conklin in the County of Broome, N. Y., deceased, and also obey all lawful decrees and orders of the Surrogate’s Court of the County of Broome touching the administration of the estate committed to it, . . .” In addition, the trustee also executed, as required, a certificate appointing the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York its attorney to receive service of process against the trustee in any proceeding “affecting or relating to the Estate represented or held by it as such Trustee, or the acts or defaults of such corporation in reference to such Estate” etc. We think, therefore, that the New York court retained jurisdiction over the continued administration of the trust.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Against this view, it is contended by the Commonwealth (and it was so held by the learned court below) that the case is within section 298 of the Restatement, Conflict of Laws, that “A testamentary trust of movables is administered by the trustee according to the law of the state of the testator’s domicil at the time of his death unless the will shows an intention that the trust should be administered in another state,” as affected by comment (c) which <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>states that “If the testator appoints as trustee a trust company of another state, presumptively his intention is that the trust should be administered in the latter state; the trust will, therefore, be administered according to the law of the latter state.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The facts here rebut the presumption of intention suggested in the comment. The words used in the will to express her intention must be taken in the light of the statutory requirement that the trustee account to the New York court for its administration of the trust, the testatrix not having provided otherwise. In such circumstances it is immaterial that the trust property was brought into this Commonwealth, because it remained subject to distribution by the New York court. That court retained control of the trustee and of the administration of the trust; the trustee must there account for the remainder of the trust property not consumed.</p>
