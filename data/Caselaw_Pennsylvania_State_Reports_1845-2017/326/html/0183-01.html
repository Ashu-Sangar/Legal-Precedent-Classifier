    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.6",216,[262,411,1153,966]]]'>The appellant is Celia Bobbins, formerly Celia Babinovitz. She complains that her petition to strike off a judgment was refused. The judgment Avas entered against her, under the name of Celia Babinovitz in her capacity of executrix of the estate of her deceased husband, Mark L. Babinovitz, for want of an affidavit of defense. The suit Avas in assumpsit to recover a debt to the plaintiff contracted by Babinovitz in his lifetime. He died May 8, 1929. The suit against the executrix Avas brought February 8,1930. On motion made in open court April 17, 1930, judgment Avas granted against the executrix for Avant of an affidavit of defense. It thus appears that suit was brought Avithin one year from the decease of the debtor and was duly prosecuted to judgment. It continued the lien ' of the decedent’s debt against his real estate “longer than one year after the decease of such debtor” as permitted by the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P. L. 447, 20 PS section 521, as amended.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>On May 7,1935, a scire facias to revive was issued and on March 19, 1936, judgment ivas entered for want of an affidavit of defense. Appellant now contends that the judgment of April 17, 1930, for want of an affidavit of defense was entered without legislative authority and should therefore he stricken from the record, carrying with it the subsequent proceedings to revive. This contention is based on the proposition that the Practice Act of 1915, P. L. 183, 12 PS section 382 et seq. does not require that an action of assumpsit brought against an executor to recover a debt contracted by decedent shall be put at issue by an affidavit of defense. The argument is based on a misapprehension of the scope of the statute. Prior to the Practice Act no affidavit of defense was required of an executor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It was not a pleading; its office was to prevent summary judgment by default<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>: <em>Muir v.

By the Practice Act the affidavit of defense has become a pleading to raise and make certain the issues to be tried. In changing the purpose of the affidavit in actions of assumpsit from a paper designed to prevent summary judgment to a pleading establishing the issues for trial, the legislature made a material change in the policy of the law governing procedure in such actions.</p>

Pleas were abolished and it was provided that defenses theretofore raised by recognized pleas “shall be made in the affidavit of defense”: section 3. An affidavit of defense was required within a given time but it was provided “that counties, cities, boroughs, townships, school districts, and other municipalities shall not be <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>required to file affidavits of defense”: section 12, as amended May 3, 1917, P. L. 149. For trespass, the requirement and scope of the affidavit were specifically limited: section 13. Not only does the Act require that the issues theretofore made by pleas shall thereafter be made by affidavit of defense, with specified limitations in actions of trespass, and with an exception<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> relieving municipalities altogether, but there is express recognition that an executor should file an affidavit of defense in section 7 which provides that “When the affidavit of defense, or plaintiff’s reply, is made by an executor, administrator, guardian, committee, or other person acting in a representative capacity, he need only state the facts he admits to be true, and that he believes there is a just and legal defense to the remainder, and the facts upon Avhich he bases his belief.” The authority to enter judgment for want of an affidavit is contained in section 17. As the executrix failed to comply with the statute, judgment for default was authorized.</p>

His administrator was substituted and thereafter a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense Avas made absolute. On the application of the administrator the judgment was opened on the ground that the court had no authority to enter the judgment against the dead man. What was said in the opinion about not requiring an affidavit of defense from a personal representative' related to the law prior to the Practice Act; the entire transaction occurred before the Act became effective, section 1 providing January 1, 1916, as the effective date.
