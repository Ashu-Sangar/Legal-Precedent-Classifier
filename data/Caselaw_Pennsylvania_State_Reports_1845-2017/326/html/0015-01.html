Appellant, however, says that as the general contract has been incorporated by reference, the covenant in the bond guaranteeing performance must be construed not only as the assumption of an obligation by the defendant to do everything that the sub-contractor was obligated to do for the general contractor, but, in addition, as assurance to materialmen that the subcontractor’s promises, if any, to them, would be performed.</p>

Article XVIII provided, as appears above, for a bond in “form . . . satisfactory to the Turner Construction Company,” the general contractor, in the sum of $150,000 for the performance by the sub-contractor of his contract with the general contractor. The terms of the bond, considered in the light of the contract, show that it was obviously given pursuant to that provision. A bond for a different purpose, “satisfactory to the Government,” might have been required by another provision, appearing in Sheet A. This is an addition to the contract and deals with details of the work required to be performed. It contains certain Labor Clauses, inserted pursuant to the requirements of the federal Public Works Administration (paragraph 1) ; provisions concerning materials (paragraph 2); records and reports (paragraph 3); restrictions as to contractors (paragraph 4). Paragraph 5 is entitled Miscellaneous. The pertinent parts of this paragraph are as follows: “(A) Construction contracts shall be supported by ade<a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>quate surety or other bonds or security satisfactory to the Government for the protection of labor and materialmen employed on the Project, or any part thereof, except in such cases as this requirement may be waived in writing by the Housing Division of the Public Works Administration. (B) There shall be provided all necessary services and all materials, tools, implements and appliances required to perform and complete entirely and in a workmanlike manner the work provided for in this contract. Except as otherwise approved in writing by the Supervisor, such services shall be paid for in full at least once a month, and such materials, tools, implements and appliances shall be paid for at least once a month to the extent of 90% of the cost thereof to the contractor, and the remaining 10% shall be paid thirty days after the completion of the part of the work in or on which such materials, tools, implements or appliances are incorporated or used.

Conceivably, one bond might have been drawn which could contain the assurances required by Article XVIII and paragraph 5 of Sheet A, but that was not done. As the contract provided that two bonds might be required, each for a different purpose, the normal assumption would be that when the bond in suit was applied for and obtained, it was the bond required by Article XVIII because it conformed in every respect with that Article and no other, and that another bond equally specific in its application under paragraph 5 of Miscellaneous Provisions was, or would be, given unless waived by the government. It does not appear in the plaintiff’s statement of claim that a bond to protect materialmen was not given under paragraph 5. If the sub-contractor had given a bond in terms <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>showing an intention at the same time to comply with the requirements of Article XVIII (a performance bond) and of paragraph 5 of Sheet A (a payment bond), the case would probably be ruled by <em>Com. v.

Article X provided that the gross amount payable by the contractor to the sub-contractor was $150,000, subject, of course, to additions or deductions incidental to changes in construction; the bond in suit was accordingly given in that amount. Two provisions dealt with cancellation, one for breach and one for another contingency. Article VI dealt with cancellation for breach of contract, and provided what should be done if the sub-contractor defaulted. Article VII provided that the Turner Construction Company should have the right at any time to cancel the contract and to require the sub-contractor to cease work, provision being made for determining the amount then payable to the sub-contractor. In the event of cancellation under either Article, the contract imposed no liability for the sub-contractor’s obligations to materialmen, nor authorized deduction of such obligations from the amount due the sub-contractor. The general contractor was not authorized to pay the material-men with whom the sub-contractor dealt and to deduct such payments from the amounts payable to the subcontractor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Liability is imposed on the contractor to <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>discharge sub-contractor’s obligations to materialmen only in case of cancellation where the contractor stands in the sub-contractor’s place and accepts delivery of material ordered by the sub-contractor before cancellation.</p>

It is entitled “TERMINATION FOR BREACH’’ and provides as follows: “In the event that any of the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs 1 to 6 inclusive, are violated by the Contractor or by any Sub-contractor, the Owner may, and upon request of the Government shall, terminate the contract of such Contractor or Subcontractor by serving written notice upon such Contractor or Subcontractor, as the case may be, of its intention to terminate such contract, and, unless within ten days after the serving of such notice, such violation shall cease, such contract shall, upon the expiration of said <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>ten days, cease and terminate.

Paragraph 7 shows that the parties did not intend the bond to be so construed because they specified what should happen for the breach. They provided for termination of the contract for the violation, among others, of paragraph 5 and agreed that the owner could take over and complete the work at the expense of the contractor or sub-contractor and that the surety should be liable for the excess cost to the owner. This conclusion is also supported by provisions in the General Conditions, Exhibit C to the statement of claim, e. g. Article XXII.</p>

Frescoln, </em><a href="/pa/203/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="203 Pa. 640" data-case-ids="994745" data-case-paths="/pa/203/0640-01">203 Pa. 640</a>, at 644, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.%20508" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="53 A. 508">53 A. 508</a>, where a payment bond was authorized by ordinance, but not given and suit by a materialman was brought on the performance bond, it is said: “If the plaintiffs’ theory of this case is correct and this bond could be used, as is claimed by them, what might have been the effect upon the city’s rights? Suppose that, by reason of a failure of the contractor, the damages sustained by the city itself equalled, or almost equalled, the amount of the bond, and that, the contrac<a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>tor having also failed to pay his labor and materials, the aggregate amount of hoth claims more than equalled the amount of the bond. Could it be claimed, for a moment, that laborers and materialmen could recover on the bond to the detriment of the city itself ? Or, in case such laborers and materialmen, as their claims became due, sued on the bond for their own benefit, could they thus have exhausted it, to the peril of the city, in ease of default by the contractor in fulfilling the terms of his contract? Under no circumstances could the surety be called upon for more than the amount of his bond, and, under such conditions, who would be entitled to reap the benefit of it? It is not a sufficient answer to these questions to say that this state of affairs is never likely to arise. No one, as to the future, can make absolute prophecy, and we but illustrate what could happen — it being the unexpected — if the use-plaintiffs’ theory of this case be the true one. We are not dealing here with probabilities nor improbabilities, but simply with the legal- rights of the parties claiming on a bond given, under its strict terms, for the city’s benefit, and that alone. It is obvious that the purpose of the city, both in spirit and letter, was only to protect its own rights.” Though this was said prior to <em>Com. v. Great American Indemnity Co., </em><a href="/pa/312/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="312 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1150700" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0183-01">312 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.%20793" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="167 A. 793">167 A. 793</a>, the same reasoning is applicable in ascertaining the intention of the parties to the bond; see also <em>Fosmire v.
