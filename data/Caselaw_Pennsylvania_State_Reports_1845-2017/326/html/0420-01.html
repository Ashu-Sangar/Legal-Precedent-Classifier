A pay station telephone of the defendant <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>telephone company was installed in the store where the plaintiff was employed. In her testimony plaintiff described the occurrence on September 28, 1933, which gave rise to this action, as follows: “I picked up the Keystone telephone receiver to call the supervisor and there was a loud explosion came through the receiver and the room lit up in a blue flash and I was knocked to the floor and received a severe shock and pains in my ear. I wasn’t able to hear anything at all for some time and it just felt as though the top of my head was being blown off.” The plaintiff was taken to the hospital by her sister, who was also employed at the bakery shop. After spending two hours at the hospital for purposes of examination and treatment, she returned to the shop to arrange about matters for which she was responsible, then went home to bed and summoned her family physician.</p>

The evidence shows that the wires and cables of the defendant and the additional defendants were all strung on poles owned by the Philadelphia Electric Company.

In falling this wire crossed and contacted both the high tension wire of the electric company, two feet below, and the cable of the telephone company, twelve feet below, thereby circuiting the high voltage along the telephone lines into the bakery shop.</p>

It has been pointed out that electricity is potentially the most dangerous of the utilities in common use to-day. Leaking gas normally can be detected by its odor, and probably most gas leaks are discovered and repaired before serious injury results. Water escaping from confinement frequently announces itself to sight or hearing before it does substantial harm. Electricity, however, is a most subtle and dangerous agency. It lurks unsuspected in the simple and harmless wire, and gives no warning of its dangerous presence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As it was said in <em>Fitzgerald v. Edison Elec.

    <p id="b457-3" data-blocks='[["BL_457.4",457,[126,683,1153,359]]]'>The degree of care required of a telephone company is of like character. While the current it uses is a harmless one, it cannot be unaware that its wires can become the conductor of a dangerous one, and it must do all that human care, skill and vigilance can devise to protect its patrons from injury caused by an electric current.</p>
    <p id="b457-4" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[125,1063,1154,1238]]]'>If such an injury does occur, there is a presumption that the telephone company failed to use due care. That principle was settled, particularly with respect to the transmission of a current of high voltage over the wires of a telephone company, in <em>Delahunt v. United Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em><a href="/pa/215/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="215 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="948417" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0241-01">215 Pa. 241</a>, and the language used there may well be considered in connection with the facts of the present case. It was said (p. 247) : “In this case it may be still further conceded that the current, with which the deceased came in contact did not come from the exchange of the appellant; but at the same time it cannot be questioned that it came over one of its wires leading to the telephone of one of its patrons. ... It was, therefore, as much the duty of the company to see that no such current should thus pass over its wires as it was to send only a harmless one from its own exchange. Its duty to its patrons was to exercise at all times the highest degree of care and vigilance to protect them from a dangerous electric current over its wires from any source. . . . When they do become conductors of it, there is reasonable evidence that there has been a neglect of duty, and the burden is cast upon the telephone company of showing that it had not been negligent.”</p>

The defendant’s experts also testified that the practice of stringing telephone cables on poles under an electric light or high power line had the approval of the Public Service Commission of this state.</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[258,1337,1150,855]]]'>The plaintiff sought to show specific negligence on the part of the telephone company; that it was not exercising due care when it placed a telephone cable (insulated only against 700 volts) close to a dangerous 2300 volt high tension wire, along with other wires, all liable to breakage from corrosion or negligent handling, and to trust to an “arrestor” which was admittedly inspected but once a year, or when a complaint was made, to insulate and safeguard its cable from transmitting a high voltage current; that the “arrestor” was inadequate as shown by the fact that the accident <em>did </em>happen, and plaintiff <em>was </em>injured; that the safety device may have saved plaintiff’s life, but it failed to save her from serious injury.
