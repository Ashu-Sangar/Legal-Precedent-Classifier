It is conceded tbat be capably and satisfactorily performed tbe duties of bis position during the time be was employed by tbe city. It is also conceded that tbe position of plumber is in a classification regarded as competitive, and tbat appointments to the position should be made only as provided by Section 14 of tbe act, — tbat is, from tbe list of three persons certified by tbe commission to tbe department.

    <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.6",478,[295,1490,1153,689]]]'>The fundamental purpose of the Civil Service Acts was to regulate and improve civil service in the cities of the Commonwealth by establishing a system whereby municipal employees would be selected on the basis of their qualifications. To achieve this end, the acts required that all appointments and promotions in the civil service (except for two exempt classes with which we are not here concerned) were to be made according to fitness, ascertained as far as practicable by competitive examinations: <em>Com. v. Black, </em><a href="/pa/201/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="201 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="925673" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0433-01">201 Pa. 433</a>; <em>Truitt v.

So that purpose may be realized, the statutory provisions regulating appointments call for strict compliance with the terms of the acts.</p>
    <p id="b478-7" data-blocks='[["BL_478.7",478,[295,2192,1153,209]],["BL_479.1",479,[132,353,1156,917]]]'>The position of plumber is in a class conceded to be competitive. An appointment to a competitive position is regulated by Section 14 of the act, which prescribes that the appointment can be made only from a list of <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>eligibles, consisting of “. . . three persons . . . who received the highest average at examinations . . held by the Civil Service Commission. Plaintiff was not appointed in compliance with the requirements of this section of the act. His appointment was an emergency or provisional one made possible under the provisions of Section 15. This Section empowers the city to appoint to a competitive position without a competitive examination, whenever the reasons for the appointment are urgent, and no “list of persons eligible for appointment” is in existence at the time the appointment is made. The purpose of the exception to the general rule requiring competitive examinations is apparent. By it the city is enabled to cope with emergency situations, often of short duration, requiring the immediate employment of persons by the city in positions classified as competitive.</p>
    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[132,1280,1155,1077]],["BL_480.1",480,[280,353,1148,97]]]'>While plaintiff was validly appointed as a provisional appointee under the authority of Section 15, a consideration of the language of this section clearly shows the legislative intendment that no provisional appointment made thereunder can endure “for a longer period than three months.” In our opinion this provision of the section is mandatory. Therefore plaintiff was appointed for a period not to exceed three months, so that, within that time, a selection and appointment could be made from eligibles certified as the result of a competitive examination. Plaintiff’s position as a city plumber automatically terminated at the expiration of three months from the date of his appointment. If we were to hold otherwise the act would fail of its purpose. In view of the prohibition in Section 15 of the act, plaintiff’s rights cannot rise any higher because the Civil Service Commission failed to perform its duty to hold an examination, nor does his name on the city payroll for fourteen additional months strengthen plaintiff’s case. He was appointed provisionally and neither negligence nor con<a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>nivance can cause a provisional appointment to ripen into a permanent one.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[280,462,1152,845]]]'>The contention of plaintiff that Section 8 controls his status may be briefly dismissed. Provisional and probationary appointments under the act are of an entirely different standing. . Provisional appointments are provided so that when there is no list of eligibles temporary appointments can be made to meet emergencies until the Civil Service Commission has sufficient time to prepare, advertise and hold competitive examinations for the position to be filled. The purpose of probationary appointments is to afford an opportunity to observe the fitness of the probationer while at work, and to ascertain whether it is probable that he will become a proper and efficient municipal employee. Save for the fact that both periods of appointment are for three months, provisional and probationary appointments have nothing in common.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[280,1329,1149,477]]]'>There is nothing in the act to indicate that the legislature intended Section 15 to be read in conjunction with Section 8. The two sections are separate and distinct in their entirety and are intended to serve different purposes. . The express terms of Section 15 are a denial of plaintiff’s right to hold the position he claims, and there is nothing contained in Section 8, or in any other section of the act, that can justify a provisional appointment continuing longer than three months.</p>
