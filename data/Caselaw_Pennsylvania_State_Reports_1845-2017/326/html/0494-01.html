The vote was a tie. At the next regular meeting, March 1st, three members of council were present at the proper meeting place with the chief burgess. Without any vote being taken, the latter proceeded to cast his vote for appellant to break the tie resulting from the previous meeting, and appellant was declared elected. However, on March 11th a special meeting of the council was held, attended by five of the regularly elected members, appellant and the chief burgess. Before any vote was taken, the burgess again proceeded to cast his vote for appellant. Council then adopted a resolution declaring appellant elected, the vote being three to two, appellant not participating.</p>

Garvey, </em><a href="/pa/217/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="217 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="953664" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0425-01">217 Pa. 425</a>; Chrostwaite, Pennsylvania Borough Law, (1936) page 396. We need not consider the effect of three members deliberately absenting themselves so that a quorum could not be had, nor the power of the burgess under such circumstance. See Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519, Article X, Section 1003; <em>Zane v. Rosenberry, </em><a href="/pa/153/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="153 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="840337" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0038-01">153 Pa. 38</a>.</p>

The <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>court below sustained that view and held the exclusive power had passed to the court of quarter sessions of the county.</p>
    <p id="b529-3" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[101,501,1156,1625]]]'>This construction does not carry out the real purpose of the act; the purpose of this Section is to provide a means whereby prompt, orderly and proper conduct of business might be secured where vacancies exist in borough offices. The prime purpose was to fill a vacancy within a reasonable time. The persons to act were not so important as the act itself. The statute does not impose an arbitrary time limit on council’s action. After 30 days, application may be made to the quarter sessions court, but of its own motion it has no power of appointment. It acts only upon the petition of the parties designated. This is the general rule adopted by the county courts. See <em>Miners Mills Borough, </em><a href="/citations/?q=23%20Pa.%20D.%20834" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="23 Pa. D. 834">23 Dist. Rep. 834</a>; <em>Williamstown Borough Auditor, </em><a href="/citations/?q=4%20Pa.%20D.%20125" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Pa. D. 125">4 Dist. Rep. 125</a>; <em>Commonwealth v. Chicalla, </em>22 Luzerne Reg. 338. If, after the expiration of the 30-day period, a petition had been presented to the court of quarter sessions before council has acted, the jurisdiction of the court would have been exclusive, and council would have had no further power. But before any such petition was presented council acted, and the court had no further authority to appoint. The provisions of a statute requiring public officers to act within a specified time are generally regarded as directory, unless time is of the essence of the thing to be done, or the statute indicates that the provision is to be regarded as mandatory.
