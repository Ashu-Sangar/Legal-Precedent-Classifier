    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[267,1058,1150,693]]]'>John E. Lloyd assigned his interest in the estate to certain banking institutions as collateral security for loans' made to him. After the death of the life tenant, at the audit of the father’s estate, these banking institutions made claim to one-half of the net estate on the ground that John had a vested interest under his father’s will. The son, William, claimed that, as a result of the death of John before the death of his mother, the entire estate vested in him, William. The orphans’ court awarded one-half of the fund for distribution to the banking institutions, sustaining their position that John’s share was vested. From this determination William M. Lloyd, Jr., appeals.</p>

To sustain this contention appellant relies largely upon what is said in Smith on Executory Interests Sec. 314: “Where there is no gift .but in a direction to pay or transfer or divide among several persons, at a future period; though the future period is annexed to the payment, possession, or enjoyment, yet it is also annexed to the devise or bequest itself. For, in this <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>case, the direction to pay or transfer or divide constitutes the devise or bequest itself; and, therefore, the vesting in interest is postponed, and not merely the vesting in possession or enjoyment.” Appellant cited in support of the rule <em>Rosengarten v.

The above remark of Mr. Smith does not seem to be intended as a general canon of construction. And why should it be? What substantial difference is there between a devise after life estate to the testator’s children (which is clearly vested) and a direction that the estate should be divided among them.” As long ago as <em>McClure’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/72/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="72 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="434740" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0414-01">72 Pa. 414</a>, we pointed out (p. 418) : “Though there be no other gift than in the direction to pay or distribute in futuro, yet if such gift or distribution appears to be postponed for the convenience of the fund or property, or where the gift is only postponed to let in some other interest, the vesting will not be deferred till the period in question.” Here there can be no question that the gift was postponed to enable the widow to enjoy the income from the estate during her life. It should be noted that there is no provision in the will for the disposition of John’s interest in the event he died without issue during the life of his mother. This was pointed out in <em>Carstensen’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/196/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="196 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="916820" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0325-01">196 Pa. 325</a>, <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>335, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.%20495" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="46 A. 495">46 A. 495</a>, where we said: “There is no provision made in the will for the disposition of the interest of any brother or sister who might die prior to the death of the life tenant without leaving a child or children. In such an event, there is no divestiture of the title acquired by the general bequest.”</p>

      <em>Jennings’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/266/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="266 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1056047" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0060-01">266 Pa. 60</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20544" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="109 A. 544">109 A. 544</a>, is almost the counterpart of the one in hand. There the testator devised his residuary estate to his wife for life “and at her death I direct that the same be divided between my three children share and share alike, and in the event of the death of any of said children leaving a child or children, such child or children to take the share of their parent.” The testator’s wife and three children survived him. One child, Catharine, died in the lifetime of the mother intestate, unmarried and without issue. On the widow’s death, the orphans’ court awarded the deceased daughter’s share to her personal representative. On appeal we said (p. 62) : “The daughter, Catharine, was in esse at her father’s, death; he fixed her mother’s death as the time when she was to come into possession of her share in his estate; the bequest was not qualified, but absolute; no precedent condition was attached to it, and the time fixed for the enjoyment of it was not expressly or by implication annexed to the gift. The interest clearly vested at testator’s death.” What was said in <em>Edelman’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/276/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="276 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="1077661" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0503-01">276 Pa. 503</a>, 507, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20A.%20457" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="120 A. 457">120 A. 457</a>, can be very appropriately said of the will before us: “Here, it seems clear that it was not the intention of <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>tlie testatrix that her son, daughter, or grand-children should have shares of the estate only if they survived the husband. If she so intended there would have been a direction that the residuary estate should be divided among them if they survived the husband, otherwise to substitutionaries.”</p>
