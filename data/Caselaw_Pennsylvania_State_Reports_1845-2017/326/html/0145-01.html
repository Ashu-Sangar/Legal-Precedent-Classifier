Damages are sought for injuries sustained- by her as a result of the collapse of a cellar stairway. Named as defendants are the Lewistown Trust Company, individually and as trustee, and the beneficial owners. A verdict was directed against the husband because of his contributory negligence. Judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>wras entered against the wife. She alone has appealed.</p>

This is so even though the undertaking was gratuitous since the root of the liability imposed is not the undertaking or promise but the making of the repairs in such a way as to create an unreasonable risk of harm to those in plaintiff’s position.

But since the action was trespass and recovery was allowed on the ground of negligence, it was in accordance with the established law and does not sustain appellant’s contention.</p>

In each case the tenant was fully aware of the dangerous condition. There was no promise to repair in that case, but existence of such a promise is of no consequence in tort actions as we have already pointed out. There can be no doubt that in the <em>Deutsch </em>case, under circumstances in which the tenant could not have recovered, his employee was nonetheless permitted to recover against the owner.

It is to be noted also that the language used referred only to the right of “third persons.” It is clear this principle was not applicable in the <em>Deutsch </em>case, nor is it applicable here.

Liability was imposed upon the lessor on the ground that the lease required the tenants to use the premises for public entertainment, that the lessor in effect participated in inviting the public to the park, and thus owed the spectators a duty to see they were not unreasonably endangered by a condition existing when the tenant took possession. Such a situation is obviously not comparable to the case confronting us of defective premises demised for the tenant’s private use. In both <em>Carson v. Codley, </em>supra, and <em>Cowen v.
