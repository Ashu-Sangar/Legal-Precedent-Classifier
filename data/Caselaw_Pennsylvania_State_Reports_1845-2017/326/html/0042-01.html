The Rockwell lands, containing about 332 acres, were held and operated under mine leases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Differences between lessor and lessee led to litigation in the Supreme Court of New York and resulted in judgment for appellant’s predecessor. Other differences arose subsequently. The Surrender Agreement appears to have been intended to settle all these differences including discontinuance of the action in which judgment had been obtained. It provided for surrender, by appellee’s to appellant’s predecessor, of the Rockwell lands and leases under which they had been operated; to them appellant has succeeded. Each party contemplated thereafter mining its own coal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The maintenance of the pumps and drainage system required that a body of coal, referred to as the shaft pillar coal, be left in place to protect and support them. When the Rockwell lands were surrendered to appellant’s predecessor, it was necessary to provide for the future drainage of the mines on the Rockwell lands and on the remaining lands of appellee’s predecessor. They now differ concerning the interpretation of the Article dealing with this subject and have joined in this proceeding to resolve their differences. Article IV is as follows (we have numbered the paragraphs for convenient reference) : “FOURTH: (1) The parties of the first part undertake to pump continuously and adequately the water accumulating upon and draining into the premises hereby released; the expense of such pumping of water, including renewals, additions, betterments and repairs to the machinery and all operating costs, to be borne in equal moieties by the two parties hereto.</p>

Each granted to the other certain rights in the mines thereafter separately to be operated and each assumed certain obligations, some absolute and some contingent. They did not agree that each must mine until all the coal was removed. It was perhaps assumed, though we do not imply it, that as long as coal could be mined profitably, neither would wish to discontinue, but that cessation of mining or permanent abandonment would inevitably result from inability to mine at a profit. An important question was what should occur if and when one of them wished to discontinue mining before the other. It was an important fact in the problem that pumping equipment of sufficient capacity to drain the Rockwell mines and also part of appellee’s mines, was in existence on the Rockwell land.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> By agreeing that this existing drainage system should be operated by appellant (on whose lands it was) at the joint expense of both, because it drained for both, the appellee was saved the expense of building a new pump<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>ing plant on its lands and appellant was relieved of operating a plant of greater capacity than was needed for its mines alone; both were benefited. To provide summary relief if appellant should default, a right of entry on the Rockwell lands, with the right to operate the pumping equipment as specified, was vested in appellee (par. 3). They provided what should be done if either wished to give up mining, or, in the words of the contract, in case of “the permanent abandonment of operations” (par. 2) or “when the [appellant] shall have so far exhausted the coal on the Rockwell Lands that they desire to abandon mining therein” (par. 6).</p>
    <p id="b83-3" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[141,1016,1157,1407]],["BL_84.1",84,[272,349,1152,1454]]]'>In ascertaining the meaning of “permanent abandonment of operations,” we are aided by other phrases in Article IY. Paragraph 2 has “such <em>termination </em>of mining.” The words cannot have meant abandonment forever because appellant is given the right “to <em>resume </em>mining” (par. 3) on paying appellee specified expenditures made <em>“during </em>such abandonment”; but this provision to resume, considered with the others, does not support a right to abandon at will from time to time, as appellant seems to suggest; if mere temporary suspension from time to time had been contemplated the parties could have used the words clearly importing that meaning instead of the words “permanent abandonment” which are opposed to mere suspension. Paragraph 5 deals with the shaft pillar coal and creates what in argument was called a reserved area “necessary to be left in place upon the <em>exhaustion </em>of the coal from the Rockwell Lands.” Paragraph 6 imposes on appellee, if it elects to take over the pumps after appellant’s permanent abandonment, the obligation to pay for the pillar coal when appellant “shall have so far <em>exhausted the coal </em>on the Rockwell Lands that they desire to abandon mining therein.” Paragraph 7 refers to appellee’s obligation to operate pumps then on its lands “so long as it continues mining on its own lands.” The order in which these paragraphs state the contract does not limit the <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>effect of the words in each, the meaning must he obtained by reading all together. It is not until paragraph 6 that the pillar coal necessary to support the pumping equipment is dealt with, and there it is provided that if appellee elects to continue using the facilities, it must buy the pillar coal. The notices given by appellant in March, 1933, had relation to this paragraph. The words “permanent abandonment' of operations” (par. 2) and “such termination of mining” conditioning appellee’s right to take the pumps, and the words that appellant “shall have so far exhausted the coal that they desire to abandon mining” (par. 6) refer to the same contingency, that is, what appellee must do to exercise its option to take the pumps when appellant abandons permanently. They agreed that appellee must then do three things: pay one-half the reasonable salvage value; maintain and operate the pumps; and purchase the pillar coal. They were providing for all future contingencies; were dealing as producers of a commodity presumably to be mined and marketed as long as commercially profitable. They considered that the mines of one party might be commercially exhausted before the mines of the other and provided what should be done in that event. Such a construction gives a unified effect to the whole of the fourth article and a consistent meaning to the various phrases used in providing for the discharge of their obligations.</p>
    <p id="b84-4" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[274,1816,1153,586]],["BL_85.1",85,[123,358,1151,151]]]'>If, therefore, appellant had “so far exhausted the coal on the Rockwell Lands that they desire to abandon mining therein” and, to effectuate that desire, gave the required notice of permanent abandonment, it acted within its rights created by the contract for that contingency. Having so given the notice, appellee was put to its election. Confronted with the notice, it made no protest that the contingency calling for election had not been presented; so far as its action indicated anything, it recognized appellant’s claim of right to call on appellee to exercise its option and acted accordingly. It elected <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>not to take over the pumping equipment and the pillar coal, and, in doing so, exhausted its rights under that option.</p>

We therefore consider that a fact in the case and deal with it accordingly. In argument appellee complains that while appellant said it had permanently abandoned, it did not mean what it said and did not intend to abandon. Appellant’s intention is immaterial if it had the right to abandon; the contract clearly provides for that. The argument that there was no intention to abandon within the meaning of the contract is based on appellant’s statement in the petition of what it desires to do in the future if the court shall now declare that it had the right then to do it. It appears that appellant desires to do two things, if lawful; it desires to mine the shaft pillar coal which could not be mined as long as it was required to support the pumping equipment; and it also desires to mine other coal not within the area reserved for the shaft pillar. The contract does not state specifically what shall be done with the pillar coal in that contingency but there can be no doubt about the implication. It is appellant’s property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The appellee had the option of purchasing it on specified conditions but declined. It rejected the benefit of the pumps and thereafter had no interest in keeping in place the pillar coal which supported the pumps. The pumps are not now required to drain appellee’s mines; in fact, some of them have been removed by appellant. As pillars are usually mined <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>last, the pillar coal cannot have been intended to be included within the words “exhausted the coal” (par. 6) or within the words “resume mining” (par. 3) because both necessarily dealt with the pillar coal as unmined for, unless it remained in place, there would have been no support for the shaft containing the pumps. Appellant’s ownership of the pillar coal is now unrestricted and therefore includes the right to mine it. Until appellee elected not to buy it (par. 6) it was subject to an option which prevented appellant from mining it; once free of the option, there was nothing in the contract to prevent appellant from mining it.</p>
    <p id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[260,1005,1153,806]]]'>But appellant also desires to mine other coal<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> outside of the shaft pillar area if permitted by the contract; this coal, as the petition avers, could not be mined economically or profitably so long as appellant was under the expense of operating the pumps in part for the benefit of appellee’s mines. Appellant has shown no right to mine this coal which therefore remains subject to the terms of the contract. It cannot have been the intention of the parties that, at any time or from time to time, appellant, by stopping long enough to give thirty days’ notice, could put appellee to an election to take over the pumps and, if appellee declined the offer, at any time, appellant could then cease pumping and nevertheless mine all the coal. We can find in the contract no support for the present right to mine this coal.</p>

Up to the present time appellee has not suffered any damage for which the appellant is made responsible by the contract even though loss resulted from lack of drainage.
