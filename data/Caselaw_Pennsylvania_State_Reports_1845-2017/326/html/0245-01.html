    <p id="b278-9" data-blocks='[["BL_278.11",278,[274,1282,1150,524]]]'>This is an appeal from a real estate assessment in the City of Pittsburgh. The property is an eight story office building. The Board of Revision fixed the assessment at $410,250. On appeal to the Common Pleas, after hearing, the court reduced the figure to $345,250, a reduction of $65,000. From this reduced figure the property owner appeals to us, the principal ground of complaint being that the valuation as finally made was not the price the property would bring at public sale after due notice.</p>
