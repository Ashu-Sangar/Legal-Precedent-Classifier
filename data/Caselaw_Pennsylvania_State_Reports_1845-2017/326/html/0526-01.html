It is a mandamus proceeding instituted by John B.

No amendment to this article has been submitted to the people since 1909, and the subject matter of the suggested constitutional revision has never been submitted as an amendment. Counsel for the Secretary of the Commonwealth moved the court below to quash the writ that had been issued on the petition for mandamus. The district attorney, recorder of deeds, sheriff, clerk of the court of Quarter Sessions, and two of the three County Commissioners of that county were granted leave by this court to intervene as parties defendant, and they also moved to quash the writ.</p>

      <em>Armstrong v. </em>King, <a href="/pa/281/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="281 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="1086984" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0207-01">281 Pa. 207</a>, is relied upon as holding that Article XVIII is a “time-lock” on the Constitution, which, it is said, provides that at least five years must intervene between amendments, and no amendment may be voted on in that interval. That case considered a proposed amendment dealing with the same article and section of the Constitution as one adopted the previous year. Both amendments related to the same subject matter, and, in a measure at least, they conflicted, in that the first changed the existing language so as to increase the debt limit for highway purposes from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000, while the second proposed to make the section read as it had before the first amendment, and to add thereto language permitting the borrowing of an additional $35,000,000 for bonus purposes. The court below held that the “time-lock” provision did not prevent the submission of the second amendment. In the appeal to this Court, counsel did not contend that this provision of the Constitution goes so far as to prevent the submission of <em>any </em>amendment or amendments oftener than once in five years, or that all amendments must be submitted in series of five-year intervals; nor did they contend that the same section of the Constitution could not be amended oftener than once in five years. They did contend, however, that a fair and logical interpretation of the language used is that the same subject matter should not be dealt with by amendment until a lapse of five years. In considering the prohibitory provision this Court stated that amendments could not be submitted oftener than once in five years.</p>

While the Constitution is the basic law of our social and legal existence as a State, and, as such, is entitled to the highest respect and fullest obedience by a free people, nevertheless, as the instrument is the people’s law, made by them, they should be given free opportunity to modify it as they may see fit within the rules fixed by the Constitution, given a reasonable construction. Even if the ruling in the <em>Armstrong </em>case was justified on the facts, we cannot consider it in the line of cases which fix rights of property, or determine issues involving the status of individuals or persons, requiring the application of <em>stare decisis. </em>No better authority need be quoted on this than the words of the Justice who wrote the <em>Armstrong </em>opinion: “Moreover, <em>stare decisis </em>has no real place in constitutional law when the validity of another statute is under consideration”: <em>Heisler v.

We are by no <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>means unmindful of the salutary tendency of the rule <em>stare decisis, </em>but at the same time we cannot be unmindful of the lessons furnished by our own consciousness, as well as by judicial history, of the liability to error and the advantages of review.” This old and well-established rule has been recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in the recent case of <em>West Coast Hotel Co. v.

We do not hesitate to reconsider the meaning of Article XVIII, as it was clearly not the intent and purpose of the framers of the Constitution to place a complete barrier to its amendment oftener than once every five years; nor does the restrictive clause justify the rigid contention placed on it some ten years ago. To continue to uphold this unwarranted conclusion would paralyze the machinery of government and make impossible much needed changes. It would be harsh to impute to the people an intent by their own act to erect an instrument preventive of meritorious revisions in their fundamental law until the mischief that could be remedied has completed its destroying work.</p>

A proviso is to be strictly construed <em>(U. S. v.

See 5 Debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1873, pp. 9-14. Such statements must be understood to be merely the personal opinion of individual members of the Convention. What the Convention adopted, and what the electors of the Commonwealth accepted, is the Constitution as it is written, and its clear meaning cannot be distorted to fit the views of those particular delegates. It must be assumed that the people who voted upon the Constitution gave to the words employed their common and ordinary significance. Justice Paxson in <em>Commonwealth v. Balph, </em><a href="/pa/111/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="111 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="545298" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0365-01">111 Pa. 365</a>, pointed this out forcefully at p. 380: “In the consideration and discussion of this section of the Constitution I throw out of view the copious citations which have been furnished us from the debates in the convention. They are of value as showing the views of individual members, and as indicating the reasons for their votes. But they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk; much less of the mass of our fellow citizens whose votes at the polls gave that instrument the force of fundamental law. We think it safe to construe the Constitution from what appears upon its face.” See also Cooley, op. cit. supra, p. 143; <em>Busser v.

It first sets forth the procedure for submission of amendments to the people. It provides that any amendment or amendments may be proposed, and if agreed to by' the legislature and recorded as required, it or they shall be advertised for three (3) months, and if the next assembly agrees to such proposed amendment or amendments, they shall be published, and, as proposed, shall be voted for by the people; if such amend<a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>ment or amendments be approved, it or they shall become part of the Constitution, but no amendment or amendments shall be submitted oftener than once in five (5) years. The proviso does not pertain to any possible unrelated amendments that might be offered at a future time to other Articles. It is limited to an amendment that has been submitted to the people and voted on. Evidencing this thought, the proviso begins with “but” and is separated from the rest of the sentence only by a semicolon. It is not a new sentence, but is part of what precedes it and is linked with it in meaning, the entire sentence carrying through a single thought. Thus understood it means that after a particular amendment, or amendments, has been once submitted another like amendment, or one similar in substance, to the same article cannot be proposed or submitted within five years. The word “oftener” substantiates this conclusion. It is sometimes defined as “more frequently,” and implies repetition, i. e., repetition of the same amendment or subject matter. The words “than once” following “oftener” show that the only reference intended by the proviso is to an amendment, the substance of which has already been submitted “once.” It prohibits the “submission” of such an amendment “oftener” than once in five years. The only logical explanation of this manner of drafting Article XVIII is that the electors intended to permit the submission of amendments as frequently as they properly passed through the prescribed steps with the sole prohibition that after an amendment had been once submitted, it or one substantially related could not again be submitted until a period of five years has elapsed.</p>

If it be so considered, it is obvious that the interpretation placed upon it by the legislature for a long period of time, unobjected to, should have a persuasive influence on this court. Cooley, op. cit. supra, p. 147, states: “. . .a construction of the Constitution adopted by the legislative department, and long accepted by the various agencies of government and the people, is, where the meaning of the language construed is capable of two interpretations, entitled to great weight.” We said in <em>Duane v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/322/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="322 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1167893" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0033-01">322 Pa. 33</a>, 40, that legislative interpretations, though not conclusive, “are to be heeded and given judicial consideration,” following <em>Moers v.

The meaning which had previously been placed upon this provision by the legislature was that it did not prohibit amendment of the Constitution more than once in five years, and for fifty years the people of the State so understood it. The Constitution of 1874 was amended in 1901, 1909, 1911, 1913, 1915, 1918, 1920, 1922 and 1923, and the validity of these amendments was never challenged.</p>
