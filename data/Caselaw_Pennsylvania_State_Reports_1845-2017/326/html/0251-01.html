    <p id="b284-7" data-blocks='[["BL_284.9",284,[251,947,1151,584]]]'>The question here involved is whether the securities, given by Henry C. Frick in his will to Princeton University, and now in the hands of the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh, are liable to the four mills tax, payable to Allegheny County, because Princeton University turned them over to the Trust Company for control and management, under a trust agreement; the income therefrom being payable to the University and, of course, ultimately the corpus going back to it. The orphans’ court determined the tax not payable and the County of Allegheny appeals.</p>

We think the legislation brought to our attention by the county’s advocate, who argued from it the existence of tax liability, does not require us to make such a wide departure from established principle, and that the legislature, if such is to be brought about, must clearly indicate its purpose. It is stipulated of record that Princeton University is a charity and that its property is held for charitable purposes. “The Trustees of Princeton University, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of New Jersey, now is and at all times since its foundation has been, an institution of purely public charity. It is an institution of <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>learning founded, endowed and maintained by public or private charity. The entire revenue derived by it is applied to the support and to increase the efficiency and facilities thereof, the repair and the necessary increase of grounds and buildings thereof, and for no other purpose.”</p>
    <p id="b285-3" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[133,680,1160,1501]]]'>The county bases its right to tax on the Act of June 17, 1913, P. L. 507, No. 335, Sec. 1, 72 P. S. Sec. 4821, as amended.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Eliding words not applicable to the present situation, it reads: “That all personal property of the classes hereinafter enumerated . . . held or possessed by any . . . bank or corporation . . . whether such personal property be . . . held or possessed by such . . . bank or corporation in . . . its own right, or as active trustee, for the use, benefit, or advantage of any other . . . corporation, — is hereby made taxable annually for county purposes” at the rate of four mills. The position which the county takes is thus stated in its brief: “The Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh is holding the personal property as an active trustee under a deed of trust executed by The Trustees of Princeton University, a corporation, for its (Princeton’s) use, benefit and advantage. The act requires a. holder of the designated securities to return and pay the tax, as well as the owner of such securities.” This is a too narrow ■view of the act. The act says, “held for the benefit of any other corporation.” It cannot be said, without disregarding Avholly the purpose of Mr. Prick’s benefaction, that the securities are held for the benefit of Princeton University as a corporation, — they are held to help effectuate and carry out the charitable purpose for which “The Trustees of Princeton University” is a name as it were; for the benefit of the realities which are behind the name.</p>

      <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>In <em>General Assembly v.

Now, is any of the property ... so owned or possessed by the plaintiffs? Clearly, according to the bill, they do not own a dollar of it in their own right or for their own use, and it is equally plain that they do not hold it as trustee . . . for the use of any other . . . corporation in any proper or legal sense . . . but for certain charitable and religious objects. . . . Now, if the legislature had intended by this act to depart from the usage and practice settled and steadily adhered to for a great number of years, — I might, perhaps, say from the foundation of the Commonwealth,— of abstaining from taxing the personal property of charitable and religious associations; if it had intended to introduce so great a change in the public policy of the state as the defendants’ counsel contend has been effected by this act, it is reasonable to suppose that they would have used no uncertain language to accomplish it. . . . But it is not, in our judgment, reasonable to suppose that members of the legislature who voted for a bill taxing the personal property of persons and corporations, whether held in their own right or in trust for other persons, either knew or supposed that they were voting for a bill which taxed property held in trust, not for any other person or persons, but for the maintenance of re<a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>ligion and public charity; that they were voting for a bill which overthrew all the previous policy of the state upon this subject, and which would authorize the tax gatherer to thrust his hand into the treasure chest of every charity and religious society in the state.”</p>
    <p id="b287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[140,623,1154,903]]]'>The principle of <em>General Assembly v. Gratz </em>was re-announced in <em>Mattern v.

Gratz </em>and that it was approved almost five months after the rule in that case was announced, the opinion goes on to say: “It is therefore reasonable to presume the legislature intended the rule in that case to be the settled policy of the state in reference to the exemption of actual places of religious worship and institutions of purely public charity from taxation.”</p>

L. 420, which was construed in <em>General Assembly v. Gratz, </em><a href="/pa/139/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="139 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="11252198" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0497-01">139 Pa. 497</a>, and section 1 of the Act of June 8, 1891, P.

This being so, the general rule applies that where in a later act the legislature uses the same language as in a prior cognate statute, which had been construed by us, the presumption is that the language thus repeated is to be interpreted in the same way <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>it previously had been when considering the earlier statute : <em>Spangler’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/281/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="281 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1087046" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0118-01">281 Pa. 118</a>; <em>Bell v.

It will be noticed that the decisions in <em>General Assembly v. Gratz, </em>supra, and <em>Mattern v. Canevin, </em>supra, are not based on an exempting clause in any statute, but on the legal conclusion that the true interpretation of the Acts of 1889 and 1891, is that the legislature did not intend to abandon its long established policy of refusing to tax securities devoted to purely public uses.”</p>
    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[274,841,1149,366]]]'>It is suggested that there is a distinction between charities located in other states and those within our own. Under the law as it exists, there is no difference so far as taxation is concerned. In <em>General Assembly v. Gratz, </em>one of the charitable objects was Princeton Theological Seminary at Princeton, New Jersey. If any distinction is to be made, it must be by the legislature.</p>
    <p id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[274,1218,1150,1014]]]'>It is argued in effect by appellant that in order to be free from taxation, an exemption must be found in the Act of May 22, 1933, P. L. 853, Sec. 204, 72 P. S. Sec. 5020-204, which provides for the exemption of “All hospitals, universities, colleges, seminaries, academies, associations and institutions of learning, benevolence, or charity, with the grounds thereto annexed and necessary for the occupancy and enjoyment of the same, founded, endowed, and maintained by public or private charity: Provided, That the entire revenue derived by the same shall be applied to the support and to increase the efficiency and facilities thereof, the repair and the necessary increase of grounds and buildings thereof, and for no other purpose.” The argument is that this only exempts real property. We think this act has nothing to do with the pending controversy. It applies in cases where the act would otherwise levy the tax. Here our conclusion is that the Act of 1913, as amended, does not levy the tax.</p>
