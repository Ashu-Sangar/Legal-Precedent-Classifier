The court below determined that such a judgment could not be entered. This determination was made before our recent decision in Myers v. Rabinovitz, 326 Pa. 183, was handed down. We there decided that such a judgment is authorized.\nThe orders of the court are reversed, with directions to reinstate the judgments entered for plaintiffs against defendants for want of an affidavit of defense unless cause to the contrary be shown.",
