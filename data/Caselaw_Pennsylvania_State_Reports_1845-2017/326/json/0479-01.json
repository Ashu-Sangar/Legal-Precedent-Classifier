Whether under any circumstances we would sanction the entry of a judgment for want of an appearance in an action of this kind against a municipality is to say the least doubtful.\nUnder the circumstances here shown, we are satisfied that the court below acted with entire propriety in striking the judgment off.\nThe order of the court below in so doing is affirmed.",
