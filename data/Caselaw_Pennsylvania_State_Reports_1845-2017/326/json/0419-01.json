The proofs failed to establish a joint tenancy and the case is ruled by Zellner\u2019s Est., 816 Pa. 202, 172 A. 715.\nThe assignments of error relating to the court\u2019s exclusion of certain testimony offered by plaintiff are \u2022without merit and are accordingly dismissed.\nJudgment affirmed.",
