Judicial records have been defined as those associated with the progress of litigated cases. Various other definitions have been given (see 15 Corpus Juris 971; 23 Ruling Case Law, 156; Words and Phrases, volume 3, page 335), but in substance all agree that it relates to litigation present or prospective. In this State we have distinguished between a judicial record and a record made pursuant to a statute in the office of the recorder of deeds for the purpose of giving constructive notice. In Brown v. Henry, <a href="/pa/106/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="106 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="455576" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0262-01">106 Pa. 262</a>, 267, it was said: “But his record in such case, though called a record, lacks the element of verity which exists where a record is made up by an officer of the court and under the eye of the court, after hearing the <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>parties.” In Fleming v.

    <p id="b369-3" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[160,719,1152,372]]]'>Since the purpose of filing the contract was to give constructive notice of the reservation of title to subsequent purchasers (see section 2 of the act; 55 Corpus Juris 1263), it is argued that the paper, when filed, would be subject to the doctrines applicable to deeds, mortgages, etc., recorded in the recorder’s office. There are many reasons why this analogy is not correct.</p>
    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[159,1102,1153,536]]]'>Under the provisions of the statute, it is directed that the instrument be filed, not recorded, and the word “filed” is customarily used in connection with judicial documents. It is to be filed in the- office of the prothonotary. Prothonotaries are public officers upon whom many duties may be imposed by the legislature, and they may have control of documents similar to those filed with the recorder of deeds. But when a paper is directed to be filed in the prothonotary’s office, the act may give the record a quasi judicial character.</p>
    <p id="b369-5" data-blocks='[["BL_369.6",369,[158,1647,1152,425]]]'>Section 23 of the Act of April 14, 1834, P.

Subsequent sections of the same act define the powers and authority of the prothonotary and clerks, none of which indicate that they perform other than judicial duties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>The Act of 1925, P. L. 722, further provides that an abstract of the contract shall be entered in a “conditional sales docket” and “shall be indexed in said docket by placing the name of the buyer in a column for defendants and the name of the seller in a column for plaintiffs,” thus indicating that it was the intention of the legislature to simulate the filing of the contract to the entry of a suit in the prothonotary’s office, otherwise the designation of the “plaintiff” and “defendant” would be meaningless. Section 4 of the act requires that the fees for filing, indexing and other services shall be the same “as for like services in connection with mechanics’ liens,” which are judicial proceedings. It would follow that the provisions of the Act of 1925 would confer on a filed conditional sales contract a character different from that of an agreement or deed filed in the recorder’s office, and it would have the characteristics of a judicial record in the office of the prothonotary.</p>
    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[288,1315,1152,906]]]'>It is unnecessary to discuss tbe question that every court has absolute control over its own records and may amend, correct, expunge or otherwise control them, and the question remains as to whether a rule to show cause is the proper procedure to correct the wrong done. The question has been made more difficult by the quotation from former Chief Justice Mitchell’s book on “Motions and Rules at Common Law,” where it is stated: “A rule is not properly original process in any case but is auxiliary and for the facilitating of jurisdiction already acquired.” No authority is cited to support that statement, which is reprinted in Woodward on “Motions and Rules” [1934 edition]. The Superior Court in Short v. School District, 108 Pa. Superior Court 503, made use of the statement, but the matter at issue was clearly not a court record, it involved a question of exemption from the payment of certain taxes.</p>

It was early held that remedy by rules had supplanted the ancient audita querela and writ of error coram nobis, and the constant tendency of modern practice has been to enlarge rather than to restrict their operation. No serious disadvantages have as yet been perceived and the convenience is such that the legislature has in some cases, . . . carried rules beyond their natural and legitimate province and clothed them with the office of original process.”</p>
    <p id="b371-3" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[155,1098,1157,1300]],["BL_372.1",372,[286,333,1152,684]]]'>There are cases in Pennsylvania where rules have been used as original process. In Seigler v. Ripple, 16 Lancaster Law Review 236, a rule to show cause was used, without objection, for the purpose of striking off a mistaken entry of satisfaction of a mortgage. In In re Meloy Mortgage, 8 Dist. Reports 364, a rule to show cause was taken to strike off a release of a mortgage. A case almost in point, and one which would seem to be authority for the present proceeding, is Macoluso’s Naturalization, <a href="/pa/237/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="237 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="988995" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0132-01">237 Pa. 132</a>. The proceeding was started by a petition and rule for the cancellation of a certificate of naturalization. The court there stated: “ ‘No judgment or decree of this court was ever made naturalizing the said Calogero Macoluso, who is now dead; nor was any certificate ever issued by this court or under its authority certifying such naturalization, but the said certificate in the possession of the said John Macoluso is a forged and fraudulent certificate bearing the. seal of this court without its authority.’ Under these facts, the court had the power, and it was its duty to adjudge the certificate to be void and compel its surrender for cancellation. The certificate was not sustained by any record or entry of the court, and is therefore a nullity.” While we did say that this was not an original proceeding, <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>it is difficult to see why it was not an original proceeding for the purpose of cancelling a forged document. There was no record of any kind on the dockets or records of the court, and the petition and rule were issued to show cause why the certificate in the hands of an individual should not be surrendered for cancellation. We there stated: “It is clear, therefore, that the court had the authority to prevent the continued fraudulent use of its seal by requiring the surrender of the certificate of naturalization which was a forgery and not authorized by a judgment or decree of the court.” There are no restrictions on the procedure by which the courts may correct their records.</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[286,1038,1154,905]]]'>We approach the question from the position of the court, and not entirely from that of the litigants. A paper is filed in the office of the prothonotary which strikes directly at the common law right relating to fixtures to real estate. It gives the vendor in that contract a very strong position. It invades the common law. Conditional sales contracts are being used exclusively in the State, and requires purchasers of real estate to go to the prothonotary’s office and ascertain if such contracts are filed and if there is a reservation of title in part of the land, viz., the chattel affixed to the real estate. It is more than an encumbrance which may be divested by sale. It follows the land. It is absolutely imperative then that, before such contracts can be filed, rigid compliance with the law and a speedy and effective remedy should be given purchasers and creditors who are in ignorance of the existence of such contracts.</p>

Where one puts in motion the process of a court, or seeks to use the procedure of the court for the purpose of obtaining a benefit for himself, jurisdiction is conferred over him so far as the defendant in the proceeding or the court is concerned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

He argues that a rule to show cause will not lie, and cites the lower court’s opinion to show that a bill in equity to remove a cloud on the title would not lie.
