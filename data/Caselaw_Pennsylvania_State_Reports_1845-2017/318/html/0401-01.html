    <p id="b430-10" data-blocks='[["BL_430.12",430,[277,1414,1158,751]]]'>These appeals are from judgments of the Superior Court reversing the judgments entered in the Common Pleas of Lackawanna County in contempt proceedings. The appeals were allowed for consideration of the contention, made and sustained in the common pleas, that the Act of June 23,1931, P. L. 925, was unconstitutional in that it conferred the right to a jury trial on one charged with indirect criminal contempt of a restraining order. It appears that, on the application of appellant, the Penn Anthracite Mining Co.,- an injunction was granted January 26,1934, restraining Anthracite Miners of Pennsylvania and members thereof from interfering with the operation of appellant’s mines and collieries and from intimidating its employees.</p>

When <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>the rule came on for hearing, appellees objected to the proceedings on the ground that by the Act of 1931, supra, they were entitled to be admitted to bail, to be notified of the accusations against them, to be given a reasonable time to make defense and to be granted a jury trial as in the act provided. The court declined to accept that view. Testimony was taken, from which the court made findings of fact establishing that, on January 31, 1934, while appellant’s employees were on their way to work at Raymond Colliery in the Borough of Archbald, a large crowd, including appellees, gathered about the automobiles containing the employees and threw stones at them, breaking the windows of the cars and striking and injuring some of the occupants. These acts were intended to, and did, intimidate many of appellant’s employees, and prevented them and others from returning to work at the colliery. The appellees were adjudged guilty of contempt and fined $50 each, to be collected by the sheriff, the parties to “stand committed in his [the sheriff’s] custody until the order is complied with.” The court was of opinion that the power to find the fact of violation of its injunction and to inflict punishment therefor was inherent in the court— a court created by the Constitution — and, therefore, beyond the power of the legislature. The convicted parties appealed to the Superior Court and there contended that the constitutional provision for chancery powers, in the exercise of which the injunction was granted, conferred legislative authority to enact the statute. The Superior Court sustained the contention in an opinion reported in <a href="/pa-super/114/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="114 Pa. Super. 7" data-case-ids="975922" data-case-paths="/pa-super/114/0007-01">114 Pa. Superior Ct. 7</a>. The appeal to this court limited consideration to that constitutional question.</p>

That in all cases where a person shall be charged with indirect criminal contempt for violation of a restraining order or injunction issued by a court or judge or judges thereof, the accused shall enjoy — (a) The rights as to admission to bail that are accorded to persons accused of crime; (b)' The right to be notified of the accusation and a reasonable <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>time to make a defense, provided the alleged contempt is not committed in the immediate view or presence of the court; (e) Upon demand, the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the judicial district wherein the contempt shall have been committed, provided that this requirement shall not be construed to apply to contempts committed in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to interfere directly with the administration of justice, or to apply to the misbehavior, misconduct, or disobedience of any officer of the court in respect to the writs, orders, or process of the court; and (d) The right to file with the court a demand for the retirement of the judge sitting in the proceeding, if the contempt arises from an attack upon the character or conduct of such judge, and if the attack occurred otherwise than in open court. Upon the filing of any such demand, the judge shall thereupon proceed no further but another judge shall be designated by the presiding judge of said court. The demand shall be filed prior to the hearing in the contempt proceeding. Section 2. Punishment for a contempt specified in section one may be by fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days in the jail of the county where the court is sitting, or both, in the discretion of the court. Where a person is committed to jail for the nonpayment of such a fine, he must be discharged at the expiration of fifteen days, but where he is also committed for a definite time, the fifteen days must be computed from the expiration of the definite time.”</p>

Equity has always been part of the law of Pennsylvania (Jordan v. Cooper, 3 S. &amp; R. *564, *578), but it was found that the common law courts could not do justice in particular cases, because they lacked the powers of a court of chancery; that is, they lacked the power to administer the equitable remedies afforded by the English Court of Chancery: Nailer v. Stanley, 10 S. &amp; R. *450, *454; Gratz v. Bayard, 11 S. &amp; R. *41, *48. In the Constitution of 1776, the courts were given “the powers of a court of chancery, so far as relates to the perpetuating of testimony, obtaining evidence from places not within this State, and the care of the persons and estates of those who are <em>non compos mentis, </em>and such other powers as may be found necessary by future general assemblies, not inconsistent with this constitution.” Additional chancery powers were conferred from time to time, among them, by the Act of March 28,1786, 2 Sm. L. 375, to supply defects in title occasioned by lost deeds; by the Act of September 28, 1789, 2 Sm. L. 502, to issue interrogatories to <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>garnishees. The Constitution of 1790 provided: “And the legislature shall vest in the said courts such other powers to grant relief in equity as shall be found necessary ; and may, from time to time, enlarge or diminish those powers.” An Act of March 31, 1792, 3 Sm. L. 66, provided for specific performance by personal representatives of deceased vendors of real estate. By the Act of January 19,1793, 3 Sm. L. 87, the Act of 1789 was made perpetual and extended to the common pleas. An Act of 1798, 3 Sm. L. 303, conferred power to compel the production of books and papers; the Act of February 17,1814, 6 Sm. L. 104, gave the “power, on the application of the committee, ... to sell the estate of such lunatic”; the Act of March 22, 1825, 8 Sm. L. 405, gave “the Supreme Court . . . power to grant relief in equity, in all cases of trusts so far as regards the appointment of trustees.” Gradually, a long-standing and deep-seated objection<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> to the granting of chancery powers was overcome, and the Act of June 16,1836, P. L. 784, was pa'ssed, though, even then, some of the powers were granted only to the courts of Philadelphia County. This statute, referred to later, <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>provided that “The Supreme Court, and the several courts of common pleas, shall have the jurisdiction and powers of a court of chancery, so far as relates to . . . [a number of heads of equity jurisdiction].” It is, perhaps, the first time in a general statute relating to chancery powers, that the word “jurisdiction” was associated with the word “powers.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Constitution of 1838 repeated the provision of the Constitution of 1790. Additions followed, until by the Act of February 14, 1857, P. L. 39, the jurisdiction and powers conferred by the Act of 1836 were extended all over the State. Between 1836 and 1927, more than a score of acts were passed conferring additional equity powers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In the light of the history of the development and use of the term “chancery powers,” the term therefore comprehends (in the words of Mitchell, C.

In dealing with the restriction imposed by the Act of July 12,1842, P. L. 339, abolishing imprisonment for debt, it was said, in Ex rel. Scott v. The Jailer, <a href="/grant/1/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Grant 237" data-case-ids="225834" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0237-01">1 Grant 237</a> (1855) : “The acts of assembly conferring chancery powers, carry with them, as a necessary incident to the jurisdiction, the authority to enforce decrees by the ordinary process of attachment, sequestration, etc., <em>unless that authority be excluded by legislative enactment.” </em>(Italics ours.) Legislative control was again recognized in Butler Co. v. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/298/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="298 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1120320" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0347-01">298 Pa. 347</a>, 350, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20A.%20504" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="148 A. 504">148 A. 504</a>, where we said: “The powers of equity to enforce a decree, <em>unless circumscribed by statute or Equity Buies </em>— rest largely in the discretion of the court, and being clothed with inherent power to control its own process, the court will see that no abuse will be perpetrated.” (Italics ours.)

Mitchell, C. J., said (pages 84-5) : “Stress was laid in the argument on section 20 of the judiciary article that ‘the several courts of common pleas, besides the powers herein conferred, shall have and exercise within their respective districts, subject to such changes as may be made by law, such chancery powers as are now vested by law in the several courts of common pleas of this Commonwealth, or as may hereafter be conferred upon them by law.’ But it is not apparent how the act contravenes this section. It takes away no jurisdiction from the common pleas, nor vests any in the orphans’ court, and if it did either or both, it would be within the proviso ‘subject to such changes as may be made by law.’ Indeed, the act may be wholly justified and sustained upon the equity feature of it. Subject to the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury, the <em>jurisdiction, powers, practice and procedure in equity are inherently matters of legislative control, and are expressly recognized as such in the section quoted of the judiciary article. </em>It is conceded that the legislature might confer a general jurisdiction in equity, concurrent with the common pleas, upon the orphans’ courts.” (Italics ours.)</p>

When, for example, the legislature conferred power to grant an injunction, such as the record shows was granted in the case out of which this proceeding grew, the legislature at the same time could have regulated the procedure and practice with relation to the injunction and might then have enacted the provisions of the Act of 1931 concerning indirect criminal contempts. The power to punish such criminal violation of the decree is part of the chancery <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>powers; it is not like an ordinary contempt, as we recognized in Com. ex rel.

U. S., <a href="/us/266/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="266 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6136660" data-case-paths="/us/266/0042-01">266 U. S. 42</a>). A part of the opinion in that case, written by Mr. Justice Sutherland, is pertinent to our discussion: “But it is contended that the statute materially interferes with the inherent power of the courts and is therefore invalid. That the power to punish for contempts is inherent in all courts, has been many times decided and may be regarded as settled law. It is essential to the administration of justice. The courts of the United States, when called into existence and vested with jurisdiction over any subject, at once become possessed of the power. So far as the inferior federal courts are concerned, however, it is not beyond the authority of Congress (Ex parte Robinson, <a href="/us/86/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="19 Wall. 505" data-case-ids="3433193" data-case-paths="/us/86/0505-01">19 Wall. 505</a>, 510-11; Bessett v.

S. 324</a>, 326); but the attributes which inhere in that power and are inseparable from it can neither be abrogated nor rendered practically inoperative. That it may be regulated within limits not precisely defined may not be doubted. The statute now under review is of the latter character. It is of narrow scope, dealing with the single class where <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>the act or thing constituting the contempt is also a crime in the ordinary sense. It does not interfere with the power to deal summarily with contempts committed in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, and is in express terms carefully limited to the eases of contempt specifically defined. Neither do we think it purports to reach cases of failure or refusal to comply affirmatively with a decree— that is to do something which a decree commands — which may be enforced by coercive means or remedied by purely compensatory relief. If the reach of the statute had extended to the cases which are excluded a different and more serious question would arise.

While the legislature may not abolish the common pleas, it may abolish or change any or all chancery powers conferred on those courts. In short, it may deal with chancery powers to any extent consistent with maintaining the integrity of the courts of common pleas. They do not lose their character as constitutional courts by also exercising the chancery powers granted, or by being limited in the exercise of such powers; they remain courts of common pleas. This Act of 1931 (as Mr. Justice Sutherland said of the Clayton Act, under consideration in the Michaelson case) “does not interfere with the power to deal summarily with contempts committed in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, and is in express terms carefully limited to the cases of contempt specifically defined.” When legislation touching judicial power not affected by the statute is enacted, a very different question from that now before us will be presented.

As to this, it need only now be said, that the political events of the past years had impressed upon most of the members of the convention ‘a bitter animosity to everything that savored of unusual power/ and the efforts of the lawyers of that body in favor of chancery powers, or of a separate chancery court, failed to succeed. The utmost that was done was that, in place of the concluding clause in the Constitution of 1776 to which I have referred, were inserted the words, ‘and the legislature shall vest 'in the said courts such other powers to grant relief in equity as shall be found necessary, and may, from time to time, enlarge or diminish those powers, <em>or vest them in other </em>courts, as they shall judge proper for the administration of justice.’ But the power to establish a separate court of chancery thus given to the legislature was not exercised, nor, for nearly half a century afterwards, was any equitable jurisdiction given to the courts then in existence, save in the most parsimonious manner.” William Henry Bawle: Equity in Pennsylvania, page 60.</p>

Appellant makes the novel argument that “the power to punish for contempt ... is not a ‘chancery power/ neither is it a common law power” and it “is not derived from statute.” If it is none of these (which run the gamut of judicial powers except, of course, a power <em>expressly conferred by the Constitution), </em>it must be something akin to the divine right of kings, of which Blackstone aptly said (volume IV, 436 [Lewis’s ed., page 1792]) : “The claim [in the reign of James I] of a more absolute power inherent in the kingly office than had ever been carried into practice, soon awakened the sleeping lion [the people]. . . . They examined into the divinity of this claim, and found it weakly and fallaciously supported; and common reason assured them that, if it were of human origin, no Constitution could establish, it without power of revocation, no precedent could sanctify, no length of time could confirm it. The leaders felt the pulse of the nation, and found they had ability as well as inclination to resist it. . . . ” The claim of “inherent power” is always invoked by every governmental agency <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>which is reaching out for more power, as did King James and Charles the First, and unless the dynamism of this doctrine is restrained, it leads to absolutism.

Within the present century it has been demonstrated that the power of English courts of chancery to deal summarily with constructive contempts of court, has not existed <em>immemorially, </em>as the advocates of inherency claim, but is the offspring of the oppressive Star Chamber courts, of which courts Blackstone in volume IY, 267 (Lewis’s ed., page 1660), says, quoting from Lord Clarendon, that when they were in existence and functioning, “any disrespect to any acts of state or to the persons of statesmen was in no time more penal, and the foundations of right [were] never more in danger to be destroyed.” Sir John Charles Fox, late Senior Master of the Supreme Court, English Chancery Division, offers proof in his “History of Contempt of Court,” page 4, that “in early times criminal contempt committed by a stranger out of court was proceeded against like any other trespass in the common law courts, with the assistance of a jury, unless the contempt was confessed.” Felix Frankfurter and James M. Landis in an article on “The Power to Regulate Contempts,” contained in 37 Harvard Law Review 1010,1046, say: “Until 1720 there is no instance in the common law precedents of punishment otherwise <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>than after trial in the ordinary course and not by summary process.”</p>

It might as well be argued that because, as Blackstone says (volume I, 246 [Lewis’s ed., page 221]), “The king can do no wrong” and “in him is no folly or weakness,” the same is true of the successive governors of this Commonwealth. We should not in this time and country accept all claimed judicial power as “inherent” simply because some judges think they <em>inherit </em>all the power exercised by the 17th and 18th Centuries English judges, many of whom were animated in their official actions by the same spirit that characterized the arrogant and odious Judge Jeffreys. The only <em>“inherent </em>judicial power” that is entitled to recognition here is that power which is inherent in the sense of being nee<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>essarily implied in an express grant of power. Measured by this reasonable standard, tbe power to adjudge a person guilty of an act of contempt committed away from tbe cburt is <em>not </em>an implied power necessary to tbe complete exercise of the judicial power expressly granted. This bas been decided by tbe highest court in tbe land, for tbe decision in Michaelson v. United States, supra, supports tbe proposition that while tbe power to punish for contempts is “essential to tbe administration of justice,” an act of Congress (the Clayton Act) requiring tbe court <em>before proceeding to punish for contempt to submit the question of whether or not a contempt has been committed to the determination of a jury, does not so interfere with the judicial functions of a court as to make the act unconstitutional. </em>In tbe light of this opinion tbe difference between constitutional courts and courts created by statute <em>is of no materiality in a question of the kmd now before us, </em>for when Congress “ordains and establishes a court” (as tbe Constitution says Congress may do), it must be a complete court, not one impotent to discharge judicial functions. Appellant claims there is a distinction between courts created by tbe Constitution and those created by statute. This distinction does not affect in tbe slightest tbe validity of tbe reasoning that <em>the only kind </em>of courts tbe Constitution of tbe United States authorizes Congress to create are courts capable of adequately discharging judicial functions, and that since tbe United States Supreme Court bas decided that for Congress to pass a law taking away from tbe statutory federal courts tbe. power to punish for criminal contempt is constitutional, it'follows that tbe highest court in tbe land does <em>not </em>look upon such a law as emasculatory <em>of any judicial power vital to the discharge of the. important duties of the circuit and district courts of the United States.</em>

In the Michaelson case, the Supreme Court used these words: “The only substantial difference between such a proceeding as we have here, and a criminal prosecution by indictment or information is that in the latter the act complained of is the violation of a law and in the former the violation of a decree. In the case of the latter, the accused has a constitutional right of trial by jury; while in the former he has not. The statutory extension of this constitutional right to a class of contempts which are properly described as ‘criminal offenses’, does not, in our opinion, invade the powers of the courts as intended by the Constitution to violate that instrument in any other way.” It will be noticed that when Mr. Justice Sutherland used the phrase, “the powers of the courts,” he did not say “inferior, or subordinate, or statutory courts.”</p>

Though imperfect, like all other human institutions, it has stood the test of time.

The Encyclopedia Britannica, 14th ed., volume 14, page 632, says of Magna Carta: “The famous clause promising that no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or outlawed or exiled . . . without the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land, was a guarantee of security against arbitrary rule to all men, whether barons or simple free men.” This clause is in substance reiterated in section 9 of Pennsylvania’s “Declaration of Rights.” Blackstone, volume IY, 268, says in regard to certain offenses tried before a court of admiralty without a jury: “As this court proceeded without jury, in a method much conformed to the civil law, the exercise of a criminal jurisdiction there was contrary to the genius of the law of England, inasmuch as a man might be there deprived of his life by the opinion of a single judge, without the judgment of his peers.

The most eminent statesmen, lawyers, and jurists of America have paid tribute to the jury system. Joseph H. Choate in his address before the American Bar Association on August 18, 1898, said: “It is the best method yet devised for the determination of disputed questions of fact in the administration of justice.” In his argument before the United States Supreme Court in Ex parte Milligan, <a href="/us/71/0002-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="4 Wall. 2" data-case-ids="6136169,6136640" data-case-paths="/us/71/0002-01,/us/71/0002-02">4 Wall. 2</a>, Jeremiah S. Black said: “It is the best protection for innocence and the surest mode of punishing guilt that has yet been discovered.” The Supreme Court of the United States in its decision in that case said: “Milligan was denied a great guarantee of freedom when he was denied a trial by jury. . . . The illustrious men who framed the Constitution were full of wisdom, and they knew that a trial by an established court, assisted by an impartial jury, was the only sure way of protecting the citizen against oppression and wrong.” Alexander Hamilton, in the Federalist, No. 58, (Lodge ed.) 521, said: “Arbitrary impeachments, arbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses, and arbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions, have ever appeared to me to be the great engines of judicial despotism.”</p>

What is taken away is only the right of the <em>judge </em>whose order the respondent is accused of disobeying, <em>to determine unaided by a jury </em>the fact of disobedience. Appellant might as well say that because a state cannot execute a murderer until a jury pronounces the alleged murderer guilty, the state is deprived of the power to punish murderers. The word “court” and the word “judge” are not synonymous, and to require a judge to share with a jury the administration of justice does not take away power from “a court.” Originally the court was the king and when that court spoke, it <em>was </em>the sovereign speaking. In this country no single official is sovereign and he can speak <em>for </em>the sovereign only so far as the sovereign people have authorized him so to do. In a homicide case, the trial judge <em>and </em>the jury constitute the court. “A court is a tribunal organized according to law, . . . not an individual holding a judicial office”: People v.

No one challengés the right of the court to issue process, but what is now challenged is the right of the court after respondents are brought in on its process, to adjudge them <em>guilty of the contempt charged, without a trial by jury. </em>For a judge to have the right (1) to grant an injunction, (2) to issue process against those accused of violating it outside the court room,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> and (3) then to determine the guilt of the accused, <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>makes for speed but speed often makes for injustice. If juries cannot be trusted to render verdicts in cases of criminal contempts, why trust them to render verdicts in the thousands of important criminal and civil cases tried daily in the United States? Alleged disobeyers of a judge’s orders are as much entitled to the constitutional right of trial by jury as the alleged violators of state and federal laws.</p>

Unless we have a jury trial in these contempt cases, <em>one individual </em>acts as lawyer, judge, <em>and </em>jury. The judge issues the injunction, i. e., “makes the law” for a given situation, then tries him who is accused of its disobedience. What security has a citizen against a judge armed with this unrestrained power to condemn and who perhaps has a prejudice against the man he thinks has been contemptuous toward his command? What respect is the public likely to have for a penalty imposed by a judge on a verdict of guilty rendered by himself as sole juror?* *<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> In such a case the people instead of <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>upholding the judge usually sympathize with the man sentenced. It is a deep seated human instinct to rebel against arbitrary power. The reign of law depends on public respect for judicial decrees and judgments. Punishment called for by the verdict of an impartial jury, i. e., a tribunal close to the life of the people, commands respect and silences any suggestion that injustice has been done. The influence of the procedure prescribed in the Act of 1931 is a salutary one. Citizens called for jury service in such a case will feel it a duty and an honor to cooperate with the judges of the courts in protecting property, curbing violence, and maintaining the supremacy of the law.</p>

Speaking for the Supreme Court in Gompers v. U. S., <a href="/us/233/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="233 U.S. 604" data-case-ids="3673177" data-case-paths="/us/233/0604-01">233 U. S. 604</a>, 612, Mr. Justice Holmes pointed out: “The English courts seem to think it wise, even when there is much seeming reason for the exercise of summary power, to leave the punishment of this class of contempts to the regular and formal criminal process.” The best security against the tyranny of arbitrary power is a jury, “technically known as the ‘country’ ” and which is aptly characterized by Sir Henry S. Maine in “Popular Government” (page 90) as “the old adjudicating democracy, limited, modified, and improved, in accordance with the principles suggested by the experience of centuries.” Concentration of governmental power is incompatible with a people’s freedom. In “The Federalist, No. 47,” James Madison said: “The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.”</p>
