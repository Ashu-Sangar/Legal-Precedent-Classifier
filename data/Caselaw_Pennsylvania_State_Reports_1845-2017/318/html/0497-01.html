On January 30,1934, there was offered for probate a will executed by her on July 23, 1931. It had been drawn by her son, who, as an individual and as testamen<a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>tary trustee and guardian, filed these appeals. It was admitted to probate, but before letters were actually issued, the Fidelity Trust Company of Pittsburgh, appellee herein, offered for probate a later will dated January 13,1934. A caveat having been filed thereto by those interested under the prior will, the register of wills refused to receive the later will for probate, whereupon the trust company appealed to the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County, which took the testimony of the subscribing witnesses thereto, and opened the probate of the former will. Thereupon, the register, as authorized by section 19 of the Register of Wills Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 415, 424, certified the entire record to the orphans’ court, “for the determination by said court of such disputable and difficult matter,” as had arisen or might arise in the course of the proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b527-4" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[164,1217,1154,479]]]'>In the orphans’ court the Fidelity Trust Company filed a petition setting up the facts, praying that the will of January 13,1934, be decreed to be the last will and testament of testatrix and admitted to probate, and that the caveators be required to answer the petition. A citation was awarded, issued and served, and answers were filed, praying that an issue devisavit vel non be directed to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to have the following questions tried :</p>

    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[271,884,1154,1131]]]'>The trial in the orphans’ court was heard by one of its judges, appointed by the court to hear the evidence produced and report his conclusions thereon to the court in banc. This he did, and, after argument, reported that, in his opinion “the record should be returned to the register and that the will dated January 13,1934, be admitted to probate as the last will and testament of Mary E. Lowe, deceased, and that letters [testamentary] be issued to the party entitled thereto.” To this 86 exceptions were filed; the court in banc, after argument thereon, “ordered, adjudged and decreed that the exceptions be dismissed.” The present appeal was thereupon taken, and the 86 exceptions, and the final order of the court below, were embodied in the 87 assignments of error. This, of course, was “love’s labor lost.” Four assignments would have sufficed: (1) Alleging error in refusing to grant an issue on the question of forgery; (2) in refusing to grant it on the question of lack of testamentary capacity; (3) in refusing to grant it on the question of undue influence; and (4) in entering the final decree. Along these lines we will consider the appeal.</p>

[Moreover] The opinion evidence <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>against the validity of the writing is of no weight when met by the testmony of five credible and disinterested persons who actually saw [decedent] write her name, and we find as a fact that the signature to the paper of January 13,1934, is in decedent’s handwriting.” We would have no difficulty in sustaining these conclusions, even if the subject-matter had never heretofore been considered by us; but, in view of our prior decisions in Eddey’s App., <a href="/pa/109/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="109 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="542235" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0406-01">109 Pa. 406</a>, Masson’s Est., <a href="/pa/198/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="198 Pa. 636" data-case-ids="920260" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0636-01">198 Pa. 636</a>, Fuller’s Est., <a href="/pa/222/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="222 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="959462" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0182-01">222 Pa. 182</a>, McWilliams’s Est., <a href="/pa/259/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="259 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="1038315" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0526-01">259 Pa. 526</a>, and Guarantee Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Co. v.

There were differences of opinion between decedent and appellant, but there is nothing even to suggest the possibility that this was due to decedent’s incapacity, or to the influence, undue or otherwise, of any third party. Testatrix was between sixty and seventy years of age, was of a nervous temperament and was ill most of the time covered by the testimony. A few years before, she had a gall bladder removed, and continuously had an infection of the kidneys, for which she had been frequently operated on either at her doctor’s office or in a hospital. This greatly weakened her and made her peculiarly susceptible to noises and other annoyances. Apparently appellant, her son, could not understand this, but her condition became such that finally she felt she could not live in the same house <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>with Mm and Ms family, and went to reside with some unmarried relatives, where there were no children to upset her in her weakened condition. The necessity for this, appellant did not appreciate, and so he kept importuning her, personally and through others, to come home again, though she repeatedly told him she could not do so. This persistence annoyed and hurt her greatly, and to a degree alienated the affection she for so many years had had for him and his family, until finally she made a new will, and, under her doctor’s advice, went to the hospital, was again operated upon and died there. The story is a pitiful one, but there is nothing whatever in it to cause us to question the exercise of her legal right to dispose of her property as to her seemed best.</p>
