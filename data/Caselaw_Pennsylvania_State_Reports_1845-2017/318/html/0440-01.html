    <p id="A1z" data-blocks='[["BL_469.15",469,[175,1207,1155,1194]]]'>An automobile owned by Miss Leslie Wenzel needed some adjustments about the body to remove squeaks and rattles. Arthur Brower, a professional chauffeur and mechanic who did repair work at his home, took the car from Miss Wenzel, at her request, for the purpose of making these adjustments. While the car was undergoing-repair, Brower, accompanied by his father and a young lady to whom he was engaged, drove it to Bloomsburg, some sixty miles from where he lived. On their return the car met with an accident. Brower, Sr., and his son’s intended bride were injured. She died some ten days later as the result of that injury. The accident occurred January 8th, and was reported to the insurance company January 28th. In the action instituted by the father against the son a judgment was entered against the latter. It not being paid the present suit was instituted on a policy of indemnity insurance carried by the,appellee on Miss Wenzel’s car. The carrier denied liability. The jury at the trial were unable to agree and were discharged. Whereupon, appellee moved for a judgment on the entire record. The court below entered such judgment, and Brower takes this appeal.</p>

It does not matter under what circumstances that liability might arise. The insured may even be protected against acts of the driver or his own acts that may involve a criminal statute; generally accidents are due to the violation of some law legislatively declared as of criminal aspect, as, for illustration, fast or reckless driving, but insurance policies have always been treated as effective and valid under those circumstances. This was the intended purpose of the policies when issued: Messersmith v.

It was for the mutual benefit of both parties: Zell v. Dunkle, <a href="/pa/156/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="156 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="844953" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0353-01">156 Pa. 353</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20A.%2038" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="27 A. 38">27 Atl. 38</a>; Gamber v.

One class takes the position that an indemnity or liability insurance policy is intended to protect any person injured by the legitimate operation of the car regardless of how or where the accident took place and regardless of whether the operator of the car was, at the time of the accident, using it for the restricted purpose for which it had been delivered to him in the first instance. In view of these authorities a deviation, material or otherwise, from the terms of the bailment does not place the operator beyond the protection of the policy; “permission” is construed as applying solely to the bailee’s right to the possession of the car in the first instance and is not limited by any restrictions or conditions the owner may impose on the use of the car: Dickinson v.

These statutes are enacted as a protection to the public using the streets and highways as a matter of public policy. The aim of the legislation is to protect those injured by automobiles, no matter who may be driving the car or where it is driven, provided the owner has voluntarily entrusted possession of the car to the driver for some purpose, and regardless of whether the person in possession of the car observes or breaks the contract of bailment.

    <p id="b474-4" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[297,551,1156,795]]]'>This court has not definitely laid down any rule on the subject, but it must be said that there is much force in the argument that as indemnity insurance on automobiles has become quite general, some attention should be given to the fact that the accident occurs while one has possession of the ear under color of authority. The owner puts the car in the control of the user and in his power to do the act complained of. Such adherence would bring all indemnity insurance within the lines adopted by the legislatures of the several states. It would seem that the very purpose these insurance policies are taken or required to be taken out is to give any person whose injuries are deemed by law to have been caused solely by the operation of an automobile some safe place for redress.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[294,1368,1153,587]]]'>• The word “permission” has a negative rather than an affirmative implication; that is, a permitted act may be one not specifically prohibited as contrasted to an act affirmatively and specifically authorized. That it appears in automobile policies would indicate that anyone having permission or color of authority is included within the clause. The insured is interested in protecting those who may be injured by his car, and when he lends it to another, he has sufficient confidence in the other that he will not wilfully destroy or injure any member of the public.</p>

    <p id="b475-3" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[137,725,1170,1461]]]'>The “permission” permeates the entire clause; it is intended to apply equally to “any person . . . operating any of the automobiles” as to any person legally responsible for the operation of such automobiles. If this were not so, an unauthorized use of the car by one engaged in doing an act under the direction and for the benefit of a third party who would be responsible for his action under the doctrine of respondeat superior, would be covered by the policy, while the third party, his principal, would not be covered. “Permission” of some sort by the named assured is necessary to bring either part of the clause into operation. They were intended to be broad and sweeping. That they were intended to be so is found not only by what has been discussed but in the concluding or excepting part of the omnibus clause, the third part which reads, “except that the protection granted by this policy shall not be available to a public automobile garage, automobile repair shop . . . and the agents or employees thereof.” Under the maxim expressio unius exclusio alterius it would seem that every other person, firm or corporation operating the car with color of authority than those within the specified class-who are excluded are impliedly under the coverage of the policy. If, however, the operator finds himself within the specified class, he and those whom he injures are outside the omnibus clause and the insurance company is not responsible for any loss under the policy.</p>

Conceding then that the delivery of the car to this mechanic was an authority or permission to use the car within the scope of the bailment, there was nevertheless a deviation from the specified purpose, that is, there was no necessity to go to Bloomsburg; it placed the operation of the car clearly outside of any permissive use. It is unnecessary to decide at what point this unauthorized use took place. The extent of the deviation took it outside the zone of doubt.

    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.8",477,[174,879,1152,590]]]'>The omnibus clause of the policy in suit extends protection to certain parties other than the named assured who may use the car, “provided such use or operation is with the permission of the named assured.” While it is true that permission to remove the rattles conferred the right to drive the car within reasonable limits to accomplish this purpose, it is equally clear that it did not extend to the operation of the car upon a round trip of over 120 miles in the darkness of the night. The evidence shows unquestionably that the trip was for the driver’s own purposes.</p>

The “use or operation . . . with the permission of the named assured” refers to the time of the casualty and not to the time of granting consent: Johnson v. Am. Automobile Ins. Co., <a href="/me/131/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="131 Me. 288" data-case-ids="617204" data-case-paths="/me/131/0288-01">131 Me. 288</a>; Johnston v. New Amsterdam Cas.

    <p id="b478-4" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[279,539,1153,1028]]]'>The basis for the majority’s last conclusion is unsound. To say that one regularly employed as a chauffeur who during his spare time undertakes to repair the car of a third person is, without more, an “automobile repair shop” or an agent or employee thereof, within the meaning of the policy, is to strain the construction of plain language. In view of the broad interpretation of “permission” suggested by the majority opinion, the effect of which would be to enlarge the insurer’s liability, such an all-inclusive interpretation of the exceptions in favor of the insurer is remarkable. It is to be noted that this ground, upon which the majority rests its decision, was not presented or suggested in the briefs nor argued at the bar. I think the case should be decided, as it was in the court below, solely on the ground of use and operation without the permission of the assured, which was a clear violation of the terms of the policy. In my opinion that is the only ground upon which the judgment of the court below can properly be affirmed.</p>
