Said supplementary agreement provided, however, “It is expressly agreed by the parties hereto that neither the existing breach of the covenant to pay taxes, nor any other existing breach of the obligation of the [tenant] to the [landlord] has been waived by the [latter] (other than the immediate-payment of the sums, whose payment is postponed by the third clause of this agreement) and that no breach is waived by the execution of this instrument or by the execution of the amendment to the said lease of even date herein referred to, or by the execution, delivery and acceptance of the [collateral security for the arrearages] . . . and that the [landlord] has and shall continue to have the rights which-such breaches give it under the lease.”</p>

      <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>Unfortunately, the hoped-for improvement in the coal industry did not materialize. The arrearages which temporarily were provided for in the last-named agreement, in large part remained unpaid, and there were still further arrearages, whereupon the landlord, on November 10, 1933, determined to exercise the power of forfeiture given by the lease, and notified the tenant to that effect. When, however, the landlord undertook to take possession of the leased premises, it found that the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County — in which county the tenant had been incorporated — had, on April 25, 1933, appointed receivers for the tenant, and that the receivers were in possession and operating the mines. Correctly apprehending that if it interfered with them suo motu in the work which they were doing under the authority and direction of that court, its officials might speedily find that it was in contempt thereof, it wisely prepared and filed therein, on March 1, 1934, a petition praying leave, inter alia, “to proceed on its lease to recover possession of its property in the courts of Sullivan County.” A rule to show cause was granted, answers were filed and testimony taken, resulting ultimately in an order dismissing the petition. Therefrom the present appeal is taken. The order must be reversed.</p>

This contract is protected by article I, section 17 of the Constitution of the State, as well against adverse legislative and judicial action, as against impairment by the other contracting party. Consequently, while appellant could not, without the consent of the court below, proceed against property in the hands of its receivers, that tribunal was bound, under the existing facts and upon due application, to give leave to the lessors to at<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>tempt to enforce their alleged contractual right, not by an amicable action and judgment in ejectment, however, in such tribunal as had the jurisdiction to enforce it,— in this case in the Court of Common Pleas of Sullivan County, in which county the lands were situated: Galey v. Guffey, <a href="/pa/248/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="248 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1011432" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0523-01">248 Pa. 523</a>; Odell v. H.

    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[279,716,1155,1183]]]'>In the first of these cases, the court below had appointed a receiver of a property, whereon there was a mortgage which provided that, in the event of a default, a scire facias might issue for the collection of the principal, interest, fees, costs and expenses. The mortgagee applied for leave to proceed to recover the amount due him from the mortgaged estate in the hands of the receiver. This was refused and the mortgagee appealed. We reversed and decided that “it is not within the power of courts of equity to restrain secured creditors of an individual, whose estate has been placed in the hands of a receiver, from adopting and applying such legal remedies as are allowed them by the terms of their contract and at such time ab that contract by its terms permits.” This case is cited with approval in Hogsett v. Thompson, <a href="/pa/258/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="258 Pa. 85" data-case-ids="1035101" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0085-01">258 Pa. 85</a>, 95. So in Spayd v.

Feay, 5 S. &amp; R. 323; Remington v. Irwin, <a href="/pa/14/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="14 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="405874" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0143-01">14 Pa. 143</a>,145. (b) “Though delay [in retaking possession for breach of the terms of a contract which authorizes this to be done] is immaterial, nevertheless if the lessor elects not to reenter, his decision is final, and this will be inferred from the receipt of rent accruing after the breach, or from any other recognition of the continuance of the term” (Model Dairy Co. v. Foltis-Fischer, 67 Fed. (2d) 704,706-7. (c) That an ejectment, in cases like the present, is, in effect, an equitable ejectment, and if, in an appropriate proceeding, delay in payment is the only basis of the lessor’s complaint, the verdict may be entered for plaintiff “to be released on payment of the unpaid installments within such [reasonable] time as, in equity, the contract and circumstances require”: Jones v. Scott, <a href="/pa/209/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="209 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="936238" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0177-01">209 Pa. 177</a>, 181.</p>
