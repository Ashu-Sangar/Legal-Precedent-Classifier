To the interrogatories, the garnishee, after stating the accounts summarized above, answered that, “in the exercise of its right of set-off,” it <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>had credited the checking account on defendant’s note, leaving a balance due the garnishee of $6,033.45. It also pleaded nulla bona. The case came on for trial, when, after the facts stated were shown, the learned trial judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff attaching creditor for $4,966.55, the amount in the checking account when the attachment was served. Subsequently a motion for judgment n. o. v. was made and refused. The garnishee appeals. The judgment cannot be sustained: the bank was entitled to the set-off.</p>

If, for the moment, we disregard the fact that the net result of the accounts showed a balance due to the bank, and assume that defendant had a credit in the deposit, because permitted by the bank to draw against it, this debt, or right conditionally to draw on the account, was a chose in action: Gartner v.

Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 755, sections 35 and 38. At common law, a chose in action could not be taken in execution: Heath v. Knapp, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.%20405" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="10 W. 405">10 W. 405</a>; Rhoads v.

A statute was required to enable a judgment creditor to proceed against such property. The right was granted by the Act of June 16, 1836, supra, section 22, 12 P. S., section 2113, providing: “The stock owned by any defendant in any body corporate, also, deposits of money in any bank, or with any person or body, corporate or politic, belonging to him, and debts due to him, shall be liable to execution, like other goods or chattels, subject nevertheless, to all lawful claims thereupon, of such body corporate, or person.” See also sections 35 and 38, 12 P. S., sections 2265 and 2268. Soon afterward, in Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank v. Little, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 207" data-case-ids="483277" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0207-01">8 W. &amp; S. 207</a>, 219, it was said that “the garnishee of a debt may plead anything against the plaintiff in the <em>sdre facias </em>that he could plead against his own original creditor, except that the debt is <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>not presently demandable; and even that may be pleaded by bim in stay of execution. In no other respect does the attaching creditor stand on other ground than that of the creditor for whom he has been substituted by the attachment as a statute assignment or execution.” Cf. Restatement, Contracts, section 167.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[277,655,1153,858]]]'>The question, then, becomes this: Did the bank, as between it and the customer, have the right to plead, against a suit for the amount in the drawing account, the note due it from defendant? — or, what amounts to the same thing, credit it on the note? The answer must be in the affirmative. The statute did not increase the liabilities of the bank (Knight v. Red Ball Transit Co., <a href="/pa/306/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="306 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="1136910" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0371-01">306 Pa. 371</a>, 373-4, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.%20715" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="159 A. 715">159 A. 715</a>) ; it merely required the garnishee to respond to the process of one standing in the depositor’s place. Plaintiff must conform to the statute conferring the right. When he demands his judgment out of “deposits of money in any bank,” or of “debts due to him” by the bank, he must show that there is a debt “belonging to” defendant; the right to execution on debts, or deposits of money, is expressly limited to be “subject nevertheless, to all lawful claims thereupon, of” the bank.</p>
    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[273,1525,1152,865]],["BL_145.1",145,[155,365,1150,205]]]'>On August 19,1932, when the writ was served, it could only attach the deposit or debt, subject to the bank’s claim, and, as that claim extinguished defendant depositor’s right to draw on the deposit, leaving nothing “belonging to” defendant, plaintiff took nothing by its writ; the larger debt to the bank had extinguished the smaller deposit credit by operation of law. The bank was not required first to make book entries charging one account and crediting the other before asserting its right to priority : Goldstein v. Jefferson Title &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/pa-super/95/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="95 Pa. Super. 167" data-case-ids="682126" data-case-paths="/pa-super/95/0167-01">95 Pa. Superior Ct. 167</a>. If subsequently challenged, as here, the bank was only required to show that it had a “lawful claim” when the writ was served; unless allowed to show and rest on that, it would be deprived of the benefit of the statute and the plaintiff would get more than the statute granted. The garnishee is not limited to showing that it <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>once had a claim which, before the writ was served, was collected by a bookkeeping entry. To adopt plaintiff’s interpretation, would render the “subject” clause nugatory.</p>
    <p id="b145-3" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[151,583,1152,701]]]'>It is at this point that the learned court below erred. “The bank,” said the court (apparently treating the deposit as something tangible), “could not make the appropriation after service of the writ of attachment,” and relied for that conclusion on Valiant v. Pleasonton et al., <a href="/pa-super/108/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="108 Pa. Super. 197" data-case-ids="706430" data-case-paths="/pa-super/108/0197-01">108 Pa.

By appropriation, we assume, the learned court meant the making of book entries or similar records. We must disapprove the position taken as contrary to the decisions of this court and to the Act of 1836 (which, by the way, was not referred to in the briefs filed in the Valiant case in either court).</p>
