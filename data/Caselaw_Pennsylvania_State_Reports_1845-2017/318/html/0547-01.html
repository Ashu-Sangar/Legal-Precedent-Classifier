The purchase was made by the manager of defendants’ office at Atlantic City, N. J., who was authorized to act for them throughout, and all the other matters hereinafter detailed, down to the time of bringing suit, were had with him person<a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>ally, and not with defendants or any of them, save as he was their alter ego. Defendants offered no evidence at the trial, but contented themselves With presenting a point for binding instructions in their favor, and in this court limit themselves in the same way. The action of the court below in refusing that point was clearly right, and the judgment must accordingly be affirmed.</p>

Plaintiff put the stock away, and did not see it again for nearly two years, when he needed some money and took the certificate to bank to get a loan on it. Then, for the first <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>time, he learned that the certificate was not for Class A stock which he had purchased and paid for, but for common (nonvoting) stock which was worth less than one-half the amount he had paid. He at once went to defendants’ place of business, tendered back the certificate to the manager and demanded a return of the money he had paid. All his attempts to induce defendants to pay him having failed, he brought the present suit.</p>
    <p id="Azh" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[289,769,1151,426]]]'>In their argument on this appeal, defendants rely entirely upon two points, neither of which have any applicability to the situation here existing: (1) Was not plaintiff bound by the fact that, if he had carefully examined the certificate when it was presented to him, he might have learned he was not getting Class A stock? and (2) Was not plaintiff bound because he neglected to repudiate the transaction within a reasonable time?</p>
    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.5",578,[287,1206,1153,1192]]]'>Defendants do not deny that plaintiff thought he was getting what he had employed their manager to purchase for him, what he had paid in full for, and what their manager said, both orally and in the receipts which he gave to plaintiff, that they delivered to him. They do not deny that they and their manager knew the difference between common stock which was delivered and Class A stock for which plaintiff had paid. They do not deny that they received the full price for the Class A stock which plaintiff was to receive, and that that sum was over twice the value of the common stock, which he in fact received. They do not deny that he was ignorant on the subject and relied on their manager, and suffered the loss which he claims because he did so rely. They do no deny but that if they can defeat plaintiff’s claim in this suit, they will, through their manager, have obtained at their client’s expense, by means of a deception, and still retain, the difference in market value between the two kinds of stock, viz., in the neighborhood of f2,000. So far as the record of this trial disclosed there is not even an excuse for their attempt to retain the fruit of the wrong perpetrated by their manager on plaintiff as their customer.</p>

This court has already once told them that their relation to their customers “is in the nature of a trust to be executed for their principal”: Vollmer v.

Where, as here, the parties dealt on a basis of trust and confidence, the rule is to hold the party making a representation bound by it: Edelman v.

In 26 Corpus Juris, page 1137, it is said that if fiduciary “relations obtain, nothing short of actual knowledge will prevent recovery for misrepresentations.” The jury have decided they did obtain here, and that plaintiff did not have such actual knowledge. Indeed they could not well have concluded otherwise. In the instant case plaintiff testified, and no one contradicted him, that he did not know anything about the stock, would not have known the difference between Class A stock and common stock if he had read the certificate, and that because of his “implicit reliance in Mr. Morales,” defendants’ manager, he took the certificate which the latter handed him. This the jury believed. Hence, when plaintiff contracted and paid for a given kind of stock, and was told by defendants’ manager that they were delivering it to him, in law they warranted the stock to be as stated, and he had the right to implicitly rely thereon. Indeed, “Where there is a contract to sell or a sale of goods by description, there is an implied warranty that the goods shall correspond with the description”: Section 14, Act of May 19, 1915, P. L. <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>543, 546. And section 12 of the same statute says that “Any affirmation of fact ... by the seller relating to the goods is an express warranty if the natural tendency of such affirmation . . . is to induce the buyer to purchase the goods, and if the buyer purchases the goods relying thereon,” as was the case here. It is true that the Act of 1915, supra, covered only sales of goods, which this stock was not, but the act was amended by that of April 27,1925, P. L. 310, to include sales of choses in action, which the present sale was. Indeed, in this class of cases, the law was the same before the passage of either statute.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[284,997,1151,318]]]'>Under such circumstances, plaintiff had the right to rely on the manager’s statement without inspecting that which was delivered to him, and this would be so even if plaintiff, by inspection, would have known he was not getting what he had bought, which was not the case here: Flatbush Corp. v. Hatoff, <a href="/citations/?q=214%20N.Y.S.%20138" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="214 N.Y.S. 138">214 N. Y. S. 138</a>.</p>
