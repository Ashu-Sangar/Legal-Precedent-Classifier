        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Drew,\nPlaintiff recovered judgment for damages for personal injuries sustained by her while a passenger on one of defendant\u2019s street cars. Defendant appealed, assigning as error the refusal of its motion for judgment n. o. v.\nTestifying in her own behalf, plaintiff stated that she boarded defendant\u2019s trolley car, carrying an umbrella and a small bag containing groceries; that there were no empty seats; that after the car started another passenger offered her a place at the front end of the \u201clong bench that [ran] lengthwise of the car\u201d on the right-hand side; that she \u201ctook hold of the iron bar\u201d in front of the seat and \u201csat down right away, and the car gave a terrible, terrific jolt\u201d and stopped \u201cvery suddenly,\u201d and she fell to the platform, suffering the injuries for which she sought recovery. She testified further that as she fell she saw men in front of her \u201ctwirling around on the straps,\u201d and \u201cpeople on the seats pushing forward against the others.\u201d Another witness stated that there was a \u201csudden and violent stop,\u201d a \u201cjerk, sudden, very sudden,\u201d that the passengers who were seated \u201cjostled up against each other,\u201d and that he \u201cwhirled around\u201d on the strap to which he was holding. This was the whole of plaintiff\u2019s case. For the defendant, the motorman and conductor and four of the passengers testified that there was nothing unusual about the operation of the car.\nAccepting as true plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to how the accident happened, we are required to determine whether it is sufficient to show that the car was operated in a negligent manner, In a long line of decisions, recently reviewed by us in Smith v. Pgh. Rys. Co., 314 Pa. 541, this court and the Superior Court have held that statements that a street car \u201cstarted violently,\u201d \u201cstarted with a violent jerk,\u201d \u201cstarted with a sudden, unusual, extraordinary jerk,\u201d \u201cstopped with a jerk,\u201d \u201ccame to a hard stop,\u201d \u201cstarted up all of a sudden, with an awful jerk, and stopped all of a sudden,\u201d and the like, are not of themselves sufficient to show negligent operation of the car, but that there must be evidence inherently establishing that the occurrence was of an unusual and extraordinary character, or evidence of its effect on other passengers sufficient to show this. Is there such evidence here?\nPlaintiff\u2019s testimony shows clearly that just as she sat down a stopping of the car caused her to topple over and fall upon her right side on the floor. Under the circumstances, it would not require much force to cause her to slip off the seat, because she was seated at the extreme end of the bench, and there was no arm or guard there to keep her in place. Even the \u201cjostling\u201d of other passengers against her could have done this. In Tilton v. P. R. T. Co., 231 Pa. 63, relied on by plaintiff, the passenger was sitting in a seat which faced forward, and was thrown violently against the seat in front-of him. In the instant case plaintiff was at the front end of one of the side seats, facing across the car, with her right side, upon which she fell, toward the front of the car. In her situation an ordinary jolt or jerk, such as is incident to the usual operation of a street car, would be sufficient to topple her out of her seat, whereas the occurrence in the Tilton case could have been caused only by an extraordinary jolt or jerk. The fact that several passengers who were standing \u201cwhirled around\u201d or \u201ctwirled around\u201d on the straps cannot be said to be sufficient to show an extraordinary jolt or jerk of the car. A happening of this kind is such a commonplace that it seldom attracts attention. Likewise, the testimony that the passengers on the side seats (and it is clear .that those are the ones referred to) \u201cpushed forward\u201d or \u201cjostled up\u201d against each other does not show that the stop was of an unusual or extraordinary nature. As we said in Harkins v. P. R. T. Co., 286 Pa. 465, \u201cTrolley cars often stop with a jerk under ordinary circumstances.\u201d In Smith v. Pgh. Rys. Co., supra, plaintiff testified that a passenger sitting across from her was \u201cjolted about\u201d in his seat, and in McClusky v. Shenango Val, Traction Co., 105 Pa. Superior Ct. 275, plaintiff stated that \u201ceverybody in the car lurched.\u201d In both instances it was held that such evidence was insufficient to establish negligence on the part of the motorman, and the testimony in the instant case goes no further.\nThe judgment of the court below is reversed, and judgment is here entered for defendant.\nMr. Justice Simpson dissented.",
