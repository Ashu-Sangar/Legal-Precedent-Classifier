The principal assignments of error relate to the court\u2019s charge. We have considered them all but find no reversible error. The charge, taken as a whole, was impartial and accurate and left to the jury determination of all facts material to the issue. The verdict favored the defendant and we are concluded by it.\nJudgment affirmed.",
