    <p id="b244-11" data-blocks='[["BL_244.11",244,[231,1225,1148,364]]]'>In June, 1975, appellant Diana L. Long was suspended from her position as a tenured English teacher in the Eastern York School District. Following a hearing, the School Board upheld the suspension. On appeal, the Court of Common Pleas of York County ordered Long reinstated without loss of pay and the Commonwealth Court affirmed. We granted the District’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b244-12" data-blocks='[["BL_244.12",244,[229,1612,1149,417]]]'>Long was suspended after the District, on its own initiative, eliminated a number of elective courses in the English department and abolished certain supervisory positions pursuant to requirements of the Department of Education regarding certification of department heads who performed supervisory duties. This reorganization resulted in a surplus of teachers and Long was suspended on the basis of seniority-</p>
    <p id="b244-13" data-blocks='[["BL_244.13",244,[229,2052,1149,300]]]'>The causes for which tenured professional employees may be suspended are enumerated in § 1124 of the Public School Code, Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as amended, 24 P.S. § 11-1124. In this case the District maintains that Long was suspended pursuant to subsection (2) of § 1124 which states as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b245-3" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[283,300,1108,366]]]'>
      <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>“(2) Curtailment or alteration of the educational program on recommendation of the superintendent, concurred in by the board of school directors, approved by the Department of Public Instruction, as a result of substantial decline in class or course enrollments or to conform with standards of organization or educational activities required by law or recommended by the Department of Public Instruction.”</blockquote>
    <p id="APr" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[239,688,1150,417]]]'>Significantly, when the Department of Public Instruction was notified of the District’s reorganization, it informed the District by letter that its reorganization was not a “curtailment or alteration” of an educational program. Moreover, at the time of the reorganization, enrollment in the District was actually increasing. In light of these facts, I am persuaded by Long’s contention that she was suspended as part of an economy move by the District.</p>

Additionally, I would like to add that the reason the legislature limited suspensions of teachers to the four enumerated situations was for the purpose of maintaining the quality of education. The legislature has wisely recognized that quality education of children is a priority service that must be provided to them both for their benefit and the benefit of our society. <em>See Walker v.
