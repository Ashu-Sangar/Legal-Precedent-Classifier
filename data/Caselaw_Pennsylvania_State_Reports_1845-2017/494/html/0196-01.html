    <p id="b336-6" data-blocks='[["BL_336.7",336,[243,647,1148,255]]]'>After a jury trial, appellant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the stabbing death of one Herbert Lowery. Post-verdict motions were denied, appellant was sentenced to a term of fifteen months to five years in a work-release program, and this direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b336-7" data-blocks='[["BL_336.8",336,[240,954,1151,898]]]'>Appellant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. To evaluate the sufficiency of evidence, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, accept as true all the evidence and reasonable inferences upon which, if believed, the jury could properly have based its verdict, and determine whether such evidence and inferences are sufficient in law to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Coccioletti, </em><a href="/pa/493/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="493 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="8731623" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0103-01">493 Pa. 103</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="493 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="8731623" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0103-01">425 A.2d 387</a> (1981). The record in this case discloses that on the evening of March 15,1978, appellant and his girlfriend were having a violent argument in their apartment. (Police testified that the girlfriend’s face and left eye were bruised, swollen, and red.) The decedent, a resident of the same apartment building, heard the girlfriend screaming, went to appellant’s apartment and warned appellant that “If you don’t stop beating this girl, I’ll stop you.”</p>
    <p id="b336-8" data-blocks='[["BL_336.9",336,[239,1882,1149,472]]]'>Another resident of the apartment building testified that the decedent then returned to his own apartment. Appellant and another male were heard going to decedent’s apartment. The resident then heard appellant say, “You cut me. You shouldn’t be interfering in I and my wife’s business”. Appellant’s warning was followed by the sound of someone falling over in the decedent’s apartment. Appellant told the police that the decedent was stabbed in the chest while they were engaged in a struggle.</p>

The medical examiner testified that death resulted from a stab wound to the chest, that the wound was consistent with being inflicted by scissors found in appellant’s apartment, and that blood on the scissors matched the decedent’s blood type. The medical examiner further testified that the wound was inflicted in the immediate vicinity of where the body was found in the decedent’s apartment. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that appellant, during an altercation, fatally stabbed decedent with the scissors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The evidence in this case is more than sufficient to support the verdict of voluntary manslaughter.</p>

Moreover, the girlfriend’s statement, made during a tense and emotional moment — when the jury was deliberating her boyfriend’s fate — was repudiated immediately afterward in the contemplative atmosphere of the police station. The statement was not credible and would not compel a different verdict. <em>See Commonwealth v.
