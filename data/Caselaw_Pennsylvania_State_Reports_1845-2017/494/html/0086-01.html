Appellee, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, intervened as a party-respondent and presented testimony to establish that the state-operated facility known as Western Center would not be an appropriate facility as required by the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). Act of October 20, 1966, Special Sess. No. 3, P.L. 96, § 406, 50 P.S. § 4406. The trial court concluded that respondent was a mentally retarded individual requiring a closely supervised structured residential program.</p>

The trial court further ordered that during the six-month period, but no longer, respondent was to be temporarily committed to the state-operated institution known as Western Center, even though that institution was not an appropriate facility for respondent. The court en banc expressed the hope that, “If Joseph receives an appropriate placement that meets his needs, .. . the time might come when placement at Western Center will in fact be appropriate.” This appeal by the county followed.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.4",228,[260,1114,1151,1004]]]'>Respondent is an adult male who at the age of eight was placed by the Court of Common Pleas, upon the petition of respondent’s family, in a privately operated residential school for mentally retarded children. Respondent resided and received treatment for the following fourteen years at this school which was under contract with the county to provide such care. He is able to walk, although he frequently moves around on his hands and knees. He can use a scoop dish to feed himself but still requires much assistance. He is unable to discriminate between edible and inedible objects and, although not toilet trained, he is toilet regulated. The school found that as respondent grew into a husky, muscular young man, it was unable to channel his physical energy and curiosity and was unable to provide the constant supervision respondent required. The county attempted unsuccessfully to find other suitable placement for respondent. It was at this point, after fourteen years of assuming the responsibility, that appellant county petitioned for respondent’s commitment to an appropriate state facility.</p>

Testimony at the hearing established that in order for respondent to receive the training he needs to reduce dependency, respondent must be in a setting with a 1:3 staff-patient ratio. Respondent was, however, temporarily committed to Western Center, since there was no alternative placement available to the trial court.</p>

The actual controversy between the county and the state is which of them is legally obligated to assume the responsibility for providing the proper care for respondent. The county argues that the trial court should have placed upon the state the responsibility of providing appropriate care. The state, on the other hand, argues that the trial court’s order should be affirmed because it is the county’s responsibility to provide the proper care for respondent.</p>

It was more than a mere grant of power to be used at the county’s option. The power of the department to issue the regulations in question and to require the counties to assume the responsibilities set forth therein was clearly within the purview of section 201 of the Act, 50 P.S. § 4201, which charges the department to create a comprehensive and coordinate program in conjunction with the county governments. Moreover, any question as to the legislative recognition of the concept of normalization and the adoption of the doctrine of least restrictive alternatives in matters relating to the mentally retarded has been removed by the enactment of the Mental Health Procedures Act, Act of 1976, July 9, P.L. 817, No. 143, § 101; 50 P.S. § 7101.</p>

In this case the need for institutionalization can neither be prevented or minimized. Joseph Schmidt will unquestionably require long term residential placement. There is no less restrictive alternative available for the county to provide. To the contrary, the available state facility is inadequate because it does not provide a sufficiently structured environment for Joseph. The concept of normalization is not a consideration in the placement of Joseph.</p>
