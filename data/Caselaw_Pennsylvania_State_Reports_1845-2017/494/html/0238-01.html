We reverse and remand with instructions.</p>
    <p id="b378-11" data-blocks='[["BL_378.12",378,[247,1496,1152,362]]]'>On June 4, 1971 appellant filed a medical malpractice suit against appellees, Elmo J. Lilli and Ramon B. Molina, his attending physicians, and the General Hospital of Monroe County (hospital) whose facilities were used in the treatment of appellant. The following facts can be gleaned from depositions of the doctors and appellant’s answer to interrogatories.</p>

On September 28, 1969 appellant was admitted to the hospital and was diagnosed by Dr. Lilli as having arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary insufficiency) and angina. At his deposition, Dr. Lilli stated that tests seemed to indicate that no damage to the heart had oc<a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>curred. During this hospitalization, which lasted until October 8, 1969, appellant was treated with numerous medications for his various ailments. He continued to take some of them upon discharge. Appellant saw Dr. Lilli several weeks after his discharge and once early in each of the following months of November, December, and January. Basically no change in treatment occurred. On January 21, 1970 appellant again saw Dr. Lilli and complained of chest pain radiating to his arms which Dr. Lilli diagnosed as angina again. He was given various tests and continued on the same medications he had been taking.</p>
    <p id="b379-4" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[189,904,1151,616]]]'>Appellant was hospitalized again on January 25, 1970 and was found to have suffered a myocardial infarction (heart attack). During this hospitalization, in addition to appellant’s continued medication for his coronary insufficiency, he was, for the first time, given a drug known as Coumadin, a blood-thinning drug. He continued taking this drug along with other medication prescribed for him until March 17, 1970 when he was admitted to the hospital complaining of severe chest pain and the loss of feeling and movement in his lower extremities. Examination by Dr. Lilli revealed paralysis as a result of what was diagnosed as a spinal cord lesion.</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.6",379,[188,1550,1150,246]]]'>Appellant alleged in his complaint that he was permanently paralyzed as a result of his treatment by appellees which he claimed was performed negligently and without his informed consent. Paragraph thirteen of the complaint states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b379-6" data-blocks='[["BL_379.7",379,[231,1822,1107,308]]]'>On or about September 28, 1969, and while plaintiff was under the care of defendant Elmo J. Lilli and defendant Ramon B. Molina, and while plaintiff was being treated in the facility of General Hospital of Monroe County, plaintiff suffered severe injuries and damage as will be hereinafter more fully set forth.</blockquote>

Paragraph seventeen contains six acts of negligence attributed to appelleehospital. The greatest number of alleged acts of negligence <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>refer to the failure to take reasonable care in seeing that appellant did not suffer adverse effects from prescribed medication. The appellee-hospital filed an answer on January 28,1972. On October 2,1972 appellant answered ninety-two written interrogatories filed on behalf of Drs. Lilli and Molina. Depositions of Drs. Lilli and Molina were completed on September 9, 1976. During the course of the Lilli deposition the doctor was directed by his counsel not to answer questions relating to the period subsequent to the September 28, 1969 hospitalization. After appellant petitioned the court for an order compelling the doctors to answer such questions, an order to do so was entered expressly reserving judgment as to the admissibility of such testimony until the time of trial.</p>
    <p id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[247,1056,1154,1131]]]'>The case was reached for trial on January 18, 1977 and a jury impanelled. Before any evidence was presented, counsel for the parties, without objection, recessed to the trial court’s chambers to confer on the ensuing trial. Appellant offered to prove he was injured as a result of various negligent acts committed by appellees between September 28, 1969 and March 17, 1970. After a long discussion the judge ruled that the complaint only alleged negligence on or about September 28, 1969 and that evidence of subsequent negligence would not be admitted. A request to amend the complaint so as to specifically list the dates of the alleged acts of negligence was denied. The amended complaint would have alleged continuing negligence until March 17, 1970. The judge held that to allow the amendment would be to allow allegation of a new cause of action, which would be impermissible because of the statute of limitations. Appellant’s attorney stated that he could not establish liability without presenting evidence of negligence after September 28, 1969. Upon motion by appellees the court entered a compulsory nonsuit against appellant and later, after a hearing, refused to lift it. The Superior Court affirmed at <a href="/pa-super/259/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="259 Pa.

He argues that if the amendment had been allowed evidence could have been presented on a claim entitling him to relief. Therefore, the entry of the nonsuit was in error.</p>
