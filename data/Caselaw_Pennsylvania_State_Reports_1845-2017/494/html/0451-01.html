    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.6",591,[188,452,1149,355]]]'>Appellant Lynn Edward Jumper was tried before a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County and convicted of murder of the third degree on May 10, 1978. He appeared in court with his attorney to waive post-verdict motions and thereafter was sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment of ten to twenty years. No direct appeal was taken from the conviction or the sentence.</p>

In the PCHA petition, appellant alleged that his pre-trial motions and the right to appeal were not knowingly and intelligently waived and that the representation of trial counsel was ineffective in several regards.</p>
    <p id="b591-7" data-blocks='[["BL_591.8",591,[189,1324,1151,366]]]'>After an evidentiary hearing, at which both appellant and his trial counsel testified, the PCHA court concluded that appellant’s allegations were without merit. From this denial appellant appeals to us, raising five alleged examples of ineffectiveness of trial counsel and raising the issue of the voluntariness of his waiver of post-trial motions and of his right to appeal.</p>

Appellant was adequately informed of his post-verdict rights and of the necessity of filing post-trial motions to preserve issues for appeal.</p>
    <p id="b594-9" data-blocks='[["BL_594.9",594,[235,1358,1152,845]]]'>The trial court further informed him that in the event he pursued his right to appeal he could not be convicted of anything higher than murder of the third degree. He was made aware that Mr. Fowler, who had been appointed for appellant by the Commonwealth, would continue to represent him. The trial court questioned appellant on the voluntary and knowing character of his waiver, and appellant explicitly indicated that he had discussed the matter with his trial counsel and that he had no questions as to his legal rights. In light of the foregoing, we are convinced that appellant was well aware of his right to file post-trial motions and of the consequences which would result from a failure to do so. His waiver was knowingly and intelligently given, with a full consideration of the consequences, and there is no basis in this regard for affording the relief requested.</p>

The instant complaints relate to (1) failure of trial counsel to seek resentence because the trial court did not adequately state its reasons for the sentence imposed; (2) failure of trial counsel to request a jury charge on the voluntariness of statements appellant made at the time of his arrest; (3) failure of trial counsel to request that the trial court specifically instruct the jury on the jury’s power to return a verdict of manslaughter; (4) failure of trial counsel to object to the trial court’s use of the “but for” test of causation and (5) failure of trial counsel to preserve suppression issue following an adverse ruling by the suppression court.</p>
    <p id="b595-5" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[195,1107,1150,404]]]'>After review, we are satisfied that these complaints are without merit. Thus there is nothing on the record to contradict trial counsel’s statement to appellant that he did not believe there were any trial errors that would have warranted the grant of a new trial. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the record shows an effective waiver of the appellate rights and further review at this point will not be entertained.</p>
