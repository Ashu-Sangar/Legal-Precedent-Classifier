Counsel ineffectiveness in failing to investigate or pursue an intoxication defense is clearly related to the entry of a guilty plea. The decision making process leading to a knowing guilty plea involves exploring any viable defenses, and entry of the plea is made only after all possible defenses have been discussed. The client cannot be expected to understand the significance of facts which may constitute a defense. Consequently, whenever facts which indicate a possible intoxication defense are brought to counsel’s attention, failure to discuss the significance of these facts may cause the client to enter an unknowing plea. Therefore, in conjunction with a guilty plea, if it is alleged that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue an intoxication defense, the issue must be addressed on the merits.</p>
    <p id="b734-5" data-blocks='[["BL_734.5",734,[270,1561,1152,794]]]'>The PCHA court considered the merits of the appellant’s claim. Both appellant and his witness, Patricia Lee Hickman, testified that he was drinking heavily before the incident and that the trial counsel was so informed and given names of witnesses to substantiate the intoxication. Counsel testified that he had no recollection of being informed of intoxication in preparing the defense and that he had no notes of intoxication or names of witnesses. Counsel also testified that appellant’s confession and lucid recall of the incident did not indicate anything but sobriety. Again, the PCHA court resolved the issue of credibility against the appellant and this will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waddy, <a href="/pa/463/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="463 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="1708102" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0426-01">supra.</a> </em>The transcript of the colloquy also demonstrates that appellant was satisfied with the advocacy of the trial counsel.</p>

While counsel did not make an independent investigation of the circumstances prior to the incident, a reasonable basis for counsel’s course of conduct was appellant’s failure to disclose any facts which would indicate intoxication.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Furthermore, appellant’s confession and lucid recall of the events belie such a defense. <em>See: Commonwealth ex rel.

The trial court at the sentencing hearing informed appellant that the public defender was now his counsel (the trial counsel having been excused), and the court informed the appellant of his right to appeal. It is not necessary to decide whether under these circumstances appellate counsel has been ineffective because voluntariness of the plea and counsel effectiveness were considered by the PCHA court: even if counsel has been ineffective in not raising issues on direct appeal, this cannot be prejudicial to the appellant where the same issues not only <em>could have been </em>considered on the merits in the collateral PCHA hearing <em>(Commonwealth v.

The decision to appeal, like the decision to plead guilty, to waive the right to counsel, to waive the right to trial by jury, or to testify on one’s own behalf, is personal to the accused. <em>Fay v. Noia, </em><a href="/us/372/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="372 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="1765582" data-case-paths="/us/372/0391-01">372 U.S. 391</a>, <a href="/us/372/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="372 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="1765582" data-case-paths="/us/372/0391-01">83 S.Ct. 822</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20237" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="9 L.

Moreover, for the waiver of appellate rights to be effective, it must affirmatively appear that there has been an “intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.” <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em><a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">304 U.S. 458</a>, 464, <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">58 S.Ct. 1019</a>, 1023, <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">82 L.Ed. 1461</a> (1938).</p>
    <p id="b737-5" data-blocks='[["BL_737.5",737,[171,1464,1152,372]]]'>Viewed from this perspective, the record is clear that there has been no such waiver. At all relevant times appellant sought to exercise his appellate rights. Post-sentencing counsel did nothing to preserve appellant’s appeal. The PCHA court, therefore, should have granted appellant an appeal as if timely filed. <em>See Commonwealth ex rel. Robinson v. Myers, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b737-6" data-blocks='[["BL_737.6",737,[169,1875,1152,483]]]'>Here, however, the PCHA court resolved the contentions appellant would have raised on a direct appeal against appellant. It did so by applying the proper legal standards. Thus, treating the present proceedings as a timely appeal from judgment of sentence, <em>see Commonwealth v. Alston, </em><a href="/pa/473/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="473 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1730271" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0040-01">473 Pa. 40</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="473 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1730271" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0040-01">373 A.2d 741</a> (1977), there is no basis to disturb the judgment of sentence. As in <em>Alston, </em>here the “failure to allow appeal as though timely filed was not prejudicial.” <a href="/pa/473/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="473 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1730271" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0040-01">473 Pa. at 47</a>, <a href="/pa/473/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="473 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1730271" data-case-paths="/pa/473/0040-01">373 A.2d at 744</a>.</p>
