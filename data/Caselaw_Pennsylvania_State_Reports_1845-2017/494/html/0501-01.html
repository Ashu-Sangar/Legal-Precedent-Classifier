It is usual in that the insured seeks to recover that sum he had expected the insurer to pay for repairs to his property under the parties’ contract of insurance. However, it is unusual in that the insured also seeks damages for “emotional distress” and punitive damages because of the insurer’s alleged “bad faith” conduct in denying the insured’s claim.

Draft No. 14, March 1, 1979), one which is unnecessary in view of the present legislatively-created regulatory scheme.
