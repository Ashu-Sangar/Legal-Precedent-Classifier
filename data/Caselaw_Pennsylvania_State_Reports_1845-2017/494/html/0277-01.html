    <p id="b419-5" data-blocks='[["BL_419.5",419,[173,852,1150,1268]]]'>We will first address the issue of the trial court’s inadvertent misstatement of the evidence. There is no question that the trial court incorrectly summarized two witnesses’ testimony; the Commonwealth concedes this in its brief. One misstatement occurred when the trial court said that a prosecution witness, a Hugh McGowan, testified to the following: “. . . that he had seen him [the appellant] at the victim’s house previous to the killing.” McGowan actually testified that he had seen the appellant before in a green Cadillac in the neighborhood where the crime was committed. He also testified that he had seen three people on the night of the crime in a green Cadillac yelling at and “teasing an old man, Mr. Thompson [the victim].” He also testified that Mr. Thompson made hand motions to the green Cadillac motioning the car to get away from him. Secondly, the trial court, in summarizing a Leona Mahler’s testimony said: “And she said, T had seen the defendant before at the’ — the defendant in court here — ‘before at “Winnie’s” house’, that is, at the victim’s house.” Actually Leona Mahler said that she had seen the victim waving on a green Cadillac when it was moving slowly down the street next to him. She also testified to seeing the green Cadillac in the area of the scene of the crime. In addition, she said she had seen the appellant in the area of the scene of the crime in the past.</p>

The evidentiary point being made by the Commonwealth through the use of these two witnesses was the connection of the appellant to a green Cadillac seen in the area of the victim’s residence and also seen following the victim. The Commonwealth was attempting to establish the appellant’s presence at or near the scene of the crime at the relevant time. Viewed as part of the whole charge and as part of the entire trial, the judge’s misstatements do not assume critical importance here because these witnesses’ statements were not crucial to establishing defendant’s presence in the area. Several other witnesses, including an accomplice, testified to appellant’s whereabouts and actions on the day of the crime. Appellant, himself, in conversations with third parties and in a taped confession admitted at trial, provided more precise evidence of his activities that evening. In view of other evidence clearly outlining appellant’s actions, the judge’s misstatement of McGowan’s and Mahler’s testimony is inconsequential and does not rise to the level of prejudicial error.</p>
