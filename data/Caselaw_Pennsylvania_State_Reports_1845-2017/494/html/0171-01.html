Appellant petitioned the Orphans’ Court alleging that the father “failed, neglected and refused to perform parental duties toward said child since September [sic] 1973 [sic] and his conduct toward said child evidences a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to said child.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A hearing was held on the petition on January 4, 1978. On January 23, 1979, the Orphans’ Court denied the petition on the grounds that appellant “failed by the fair preponderance of the credible testimony to establish conduct on the part of [appellee] sufficient to terminate his parental rights.” Appellant now argues that the findings of the Orphans’ Court are not supported by evidence in the record, the testimony of appellee was not believable and appellee’s attempts to maintain contact with his child do not evidence a firm refusal to yield to obstacles imposed by appellant. We disagree and affirm the Orphans’ Court decree.</p>

Appellee, the natural father, was serving in the United States Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia. The child’s parents married April 29, 1973, and appellant continued to reside with her husband’s parents until the end of May, 1973. During that time <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>appellee was able to come home every week or every other week.</p>

She had returned home at 4:00 a.m., in the company of another man (her present husband) after journeying to New York State “to drink.” She was not permitted to take the child at that time because of the late hour. Appellee, notified of the incident, came home at his earliest opportunity on emergency leave. Shortly after appellee returned to the Marine base, appellant filed a petition for habeas corpus to regain custody of B.D.S. Prior to the hearing, however, appellant went to appellee’s parents’ home and removed the child from the premises. That evening appellant moved in with her present husband and his parents. Again, notified of what had occurred, appellee returned home on leave.</p>
    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[238,1231,1151,831]]]'>The record discloses that at the hearing on the petition appellant’s testimony was fraught with inconsistencies. She claimed on direct examination that neither appellee nor his family contacted her about B.D.S. after August, 1973. However, on cross-examination, she admitted, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellee visited her on or near Thanksgiving, 1973, requesting to see B.D.S. and further admitted that an Easter basket for B.D.S. was left on the porch of their trailer the day after Easter, 1974. She testified the basket contained a note signed by appellee which was actually, she claimed, from appellee’s mother (she recognized the handwriting). Appellant admitted throwing the Easter basket in the trash. Not only is this testimony contrary to her prior testimony that appellee and his family sent no gifts, it is also directly contrary to her testimony on rebuttal that she did not bother to read the note.</p>

During the first year following the parties’ separation appellee was serving in the Marine Corps. Appellant and the child lived with R.M.L. and his family for about eight months of that year. Appellee testified that he was permitted two visits with B.D.S. during this time, both occurring when he was home on leave. Also during that time he began monthly payments to appellant for B.D.S.’ support pursuant to court order. The support action apparently was initiated by the Department of Public Welfare in the first months following the parties’ separation. Appellee testified that after making two to four support payments appellant refused to accept them. At that time she also told appellee she would not permit him to see the child. Thereafter, whenever appellee was home on leave and telephoned appellant to arrange a visit with B.D.S., her father-in-law refused to allow him to speak to her; at times he simply hung up on appellee.</p>

Appellee remained in the Marine Corps for six months of that year. Appellant, who did not have a listed telephone number also did not inform appellee or his family of her change of residence. Nevertheless, appellee discovered their location and attempted to visit B.D.S. while home on leave for Easter. Upon finding no one home, appellee, in the company of his sister, left an Easter basket with a note attached on the porch. When he returned the next day, again no one was home; the Easter basket lay discarded and destroyed in the trash.</p>

Shortly thereafter appellant moved into her husband’s parents’ home again. Appellee testified that he was <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>not permitted to speak to appellant when he telephoned her there and his cards and letters went unanswered. Testimony also indicated that appellant’s in-laws and appellee’s parents had been involved in an altercation which resulted in an action being filed before a district magistrate. Appellee testified that as a result of this incident appellant’s father-in-law told him never to set forth on their property. Appellee also testified that he went to Legal Aid but did not meet their income guidelines.</p>

    <p id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.6",314,[258,1050,1152,630]]]'>Appellee’s sister testified that she was permitted to visit with B.D.S. but appellant told her that no one else in the family, including appellee, was permitted to see the child. Appellee’s parents testified to substantially similar impediments imposed by appellant, her husband and his family. At the hearing appellee’s mother described various gifts that appellee and his family had purchased for B.D.S. over the years but were never permitted to deliver to the child. At appellant’s counsel’s request, appellee’s mother displayed each gift, named who bought it (some were purchased by appellee and some by his parents) and described the occasion for which each had been purchased.</p>

    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[189,955,1150,353]]]'>The essence of appellant’s argument is that she did, contrary to the Orphans’ Court finding, sustain her burden of proof, and that appellee’s testimony was not believable. This contention is totally without merit. The trier of fact is the sole judge of credibility. <em>In re Green, </em><a href="/pa/486/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="486 Pa. 613" data-case-ids="1757555" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0613-01">486 Pa. 613</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="486 Pa. 613" data-case-ids="1757555" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0613-01">406 A.2d 1370</a> (1979), and we will not usurp this function of the hearing court.</p>

In that case the natural mother sought to terminate the parental rights of the natural father. Following a hearing the Orphans’ Court denied the petition on the grounds that the father affirmatively performed his parental responsibilities as best he could. The testimony indicated that after the parties’ separation in <em>Adoption of S. H. </em>the father was unable to locate his ex-wife and child, and his former mother-in-law refused to disclose their location. When the father finally located the child, his ex-wife refused to permit visitations. Shortly thereafter he was incarcerated. He testified that he sent letters and cards, all of which were unacknowledged and unanswered. When he was released from prison, the father tried calling his ex-wife but he claimed she would hang up on him. Two months later he was incarcerated again. During his confinement he sought the assistance of the American Red Cross in contacting his son. Through the organization’s efforts the father discovered that his former wife was seeking to involuntarily terminate his parental rights.</p>

As here, the record in <em>In re D.J. Y. </em>contained conflicting testimony. The paternal grandparents testified that for a three year period prior to the hearing the natural mother never contacted, met or contributed to the support of her child. The natural mother, conversely, described the continuing steps she took to contact her child. She claimed that all attempts to contact D.J.Y. were impeded by her husband and his parents. They threatened to call the police if she ventured onto their property and the gifts the mother sent were never given to the child. On the basis of the testimony the Orphans’ Court concluded that the activities of the former spouse and in-laws prevented the mother from maintaining a parental relationship with her son.

It is clear to us that appellant, her husband and his family evidenced a pattern of keeping B.D.S.’ new life separate and distinct from any involvement with his natural father.
