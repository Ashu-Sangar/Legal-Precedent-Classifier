On March 23, 1979, at approximately 2:00 a. m., Clark Harris (“Harris”) was stabbed and killed in an all night restaurant. Baez was arrested and charged with first degree murder. At trial, the Commonwealth’s case in chief was supported by the testimony of several eyewitnesses to the incident, all of whom <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>testified that Baez had stabbed Harris.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Their testimony varied, however, with respect to what, if anything, had occurred inside the restaurant between Harris and Baez immediately prior to the stabbing. Some witnesses testified that before the stabbing Harris had called Baez a “hippie”; others testified that no words had been exchanged between the two. One witness testified that Harris had first grabbed Baez by the shirt, while others testified that there was no physical contact prior to the stabbing.</p>
    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[185,830,1151,1024]]]'>Baez argued that he acted in self-defense, or, in the alternative, that Harris had provoked the incident by harassing, grabbing, and threatening him. He testified that on the night in question, two of his friends, Reinaldo Castillo (“Castillo”) and Angel Rivera (“Rivera”), drove him to the restaurant, parked across the street, dropped him off, and then drove away. He contended that the events leading up to the stabbing began <em>outside </em>the restaurant, alleging that as he approached the restaurant, two “guys” who were bigger than he and whom he had never seen before, pushed him and called him names, and that one of them, Harris, threatened to kill him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> He further testified that once inside the restaurant, he walked over to the two men and told them he did not “want any trouble”; that Harris then grabbed him by the shirt, lifted him in the air, and again threatened to kill him; that as a result, he “lost [his] mind,” took the knife out, and after that his mind went “blank”; and finally, that he remembered leaving the restaurant and going home, but did not remember stabbing Harris.</p>

It thus contradicted Baez’ testimony with respect to the name calling, pushing and threats, which he contended had occurred on the sidewalk. Moreover, Baez had testified that after Castillo and Rivera dropped him off near the restaurant, they immediately drove away. Castillo’s statement, however, asserted that he and Rivera did not immediately drive away, but rather remained in front of the restaurant. It further recounted that “two white guys” came over to the car, one of whom shook hands with Rivera before entering the restaurant, and that Castillo and Rivera later looked through the window of the restaurant for Baez before getting back into the car and driving away.</p>

It’s cross-examination. There’s nothing wrong with it if Mr. Runstedler took the statement.” (N.T. 299). Recognizing the hearsay nature of the statement, however, he instructed the jury that it was not to be considered as substantive evidence, but was to be considered <em>only </em>for the purpose of impeaching Baez’ credibility.

The Commonwealth further asserts that use of the statement, if erroneous, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in view of the other “overwhelming” evidence in the case. We disagree.</p>

There is no contention that Baez at any time adopted the contents of Castillo’s statement. The second method could be applicable only to the extent that competent testimony at variance with that of the witness always raises the possibility of defective memory or perception. Here, however, Castillo’s alleged statement, which was wholly incompatible with Baez’ testimony, could not have differed merely on the basis of memory or perception, but could only have been used to impeach pursuant to the third method, as “contradictory testimony.” It is further axiomatic, however, that if contradictory testimony is not competent to be introduced as substantive evidence, then it equally cannot be used for impeachment purposes. <em>See Commonwealth v.

By incorporating Castillo’s alleged statement into his questions on cross-examination, the prosecutor, argues the Commonwealth, only presented the jury with the fact that Castillo <em>made </em>the statement, not with the content of the statement <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>as substantive evidence. In our view, however, this argument either reflects a hopelessly shallow understanding of the function of the hearsay rule, or, worse, disingenuously seeks to defend a subterfuge to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence under the guise of impeachment. The statement was offered, in fact, for no reason <em>but </em>the truth of Castillo’s assertions, for impeachment by contradiction, by its very nature, is founded upon the truth of the contradictory evidence offered. In his treatise on the law of evidence, Professor Wigmore explains the principle as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b533-5" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[235,833,1113,311]]]'>[The] contradiction in itself does nothing probatively, not unless the contradicting witness or witnesses are believed in preference to the first one, i. e., unless his error is established. <em>It is not the contradiction, but the truth of the contradicting assertion as opposed to the first one, that constitutes the probative end.</em>

It is precisely this proposition which gives rise to the axiom that a statement incompetent as direct evidence is equally incompetent for the purpose of impeachment. The statement here in question, obviously incompetent hearsay if offered as direct evidence, gained no competency by virtue of the fact that it was brought out on cross-examination in an effort to establish that Baez’ recitation of the facts was untrue. Moreover, the notion that the jury, if cautioned, would not use Castillo’s statement for its substance is an obvious fiction, for the content of the statement undermined the very basis of Baez’ claim of provocation. Its impact could not have been more substantive had it been read directly into the record.</p>

We disagree. The statement was a classic example of double hearsay, for at best it is merely Detective Runstedler’s written account of what Castillo told him. Although the Commonwealth called Detective Runstedler as a witness, it failed to question him with respect to the statement. Other than the Assistant District Attorney’s assertion that “Detective Runstedler, who’s seated right here, took the statement from [Castillo] and he can testify as such,” (N.T. 298-99), the Commonwealth made no attempt to render the statement competent. Instead, verbatim excerpts were introduced through Baez under the guise of cross-examination. Even if a rule permitting admission of hearsay bearing indicia of reliability were settled law in Pennsylvania, this form of <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>questioning would have been clearly improper, as neither the authenticity nor reliability of the statement had ever been established.</p>

We do not believe that the error here could be considered conclusively harmless under any standard, much less that established by <em>Story. </em>The crux of Baez’ defense was that he lacked the requisite mental state to commit first degree murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> First, he argued that he had acted in self defense. Alternatively, he argued that he had acted out of rage and anger in response to provocation by Harris. Baez’ defense relied heavily on his own description of what had occurred <em>outside </em>the restaurant on the evening in question. He and Collingwood were the only persons who testified concerning those events, and their testimony conflicted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The only other reference to those events was in the Castillo statement, which was devoid of any evidence of harassment and provocation on Harris’ part, and which thus refuted Baez’ testimony and lent credibility to Collingwood’s rendition of the facts. Indeed, Castillo’s statement indicated that Harris had been rather friendly, even to the point of shaking hands with Rivera.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Thus, the contents of the statement created <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>an inference that, at least <em>outside </em>the restaurant, Baez was not threatened or provoked by Harris.</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[257,476,1153,588]]]'>By so weakening his credibility as to what happened outside the restaurant, the statement may well have led the jury to doubt Baez’ testimony that he was provoked <em>inside </em>the restaurant, especially in light of the conflicting testimony of the other witnesses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> It was directly contradictory to Baez’ version of the events; indeed, it was used for that very reason. In truth, it served not only to weaken Baez’ credibility, but, as noted earlier, it undermined the very substance of his claim of provocation.
