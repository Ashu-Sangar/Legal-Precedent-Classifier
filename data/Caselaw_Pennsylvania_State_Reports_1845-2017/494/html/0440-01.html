At the arraignment on the other charges, appellant was informed of the outstanding murder charges lodged against him in Pennsylvania.

The District Attorney in Mercer County, Joseph J. Nelson, contacted the Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to initiate extradition proceedings on December 7, 1973. After several communications among the Deputy Secretary, Nelson, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections, and appropriate New Jersey authorities, Nelson requested delivery of appellant to Pennsylvania authority pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> After denial of said request, Nelson contacted Governor William P. Cahill of New Jersey on behalf of Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp, again requesting delivery of appellant to Pennsylvania officials. A negative response from the Governor of New Jersey was received on February 19, 1974, reiterating their position that custody of appellant would not be transferred until the disposition of the charges against him. These prompt attempts by the Commonwealth to secure custody of appellant are more than enough evidence to establish due diligence by the Commonwealth. The time period in which the Commonwealth attempted to extradite appellant, December 7, 1973, until July 18, 1974, when the New Jersey authorities surrendered the appellant, was 223 days. When excluded from the 351 day period that ran between the filing of the complaint and the commencement of trial, it is obvious that appellant was tried well within the mandate of Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(a)(1).

Section (d) clearly and unequivocally provides for the exclusion of certain periods of delay when determining the period for the commencement of trial.

Employing the standard we have outlined above, we must seek some reasonable basis for the trial attorney’s decision to recommend that his client remain silent. At the PCHA evidentiary hearing, trial counsel testified that while the ultimate decision to testify rested with appellant, he advised his client not to take the witness stand. This tactical decision was based on several factors. Appellant’s testimony at the first trial was a matter of record and could serve as a tool of impeachment for the prosecutor if he deviated therefrom. Second, certain prejudicial evidence had been redacted by this Court in appellant’s first direct appeal, thereby weakening the case against appellant in the opinion of trial counsel. Furthermore, by testifying, appellant would expose himself on cross-examination to several critical events which he observed, but which could not be supplied by the witnesses available to the Commonwealth.</p>

Nonetheless, we place equal emphasis on the comment the judge made immediately following the challenged phrase in the charge. The judge qualified the objectionable statement by saying “. . . or at least you’re at the doorway ...” Reading the charge as a whole, as we are bound to do, <em>Commonwealth v. Woodward, </em><a href="/pa/483/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="483 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1751309" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0001-01">483 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="483 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1751309" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0001-01">394 A.2d 508</a> (1978), we conclude that the trial judge accurately reiterated the essential evidence of the case in a fair and impartial manner. Furthermore, the judge completed his charge by emphasizing:</p>
    <blockquote id="b588-7" data-blocks='[["BL_588.7",588,[282,2062,1105,95]]]'>“[y]ou are the finder’s of fact. You determine what really happened down there that night.”</blockquote>

Rather, the jury was fully and properly charged. Consequently, any objections to the portion of the charge in <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>question would have been dismissed as lacking merit. As we stated previously, counsel need not protect himself from accusations of ineffectiveness by making every possible objection or motion when they are, in fact, meritless. In light of our above disposition of appellant’s claims, we hereby deny the relief requested.</p>
