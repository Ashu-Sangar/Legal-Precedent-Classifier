Generally, in cases where the Commonwealth has been unable to establish a prima facie case against the individual petitioning for expungement, the Superior Court has determined that the burden falls upon the Commonwealth to present compelling evidence justifying the retention of the arrest record. <em>Commonwealth v. Briley, </em><a href="/pa-super/278/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="278 Pa.

The Superior Court reached that result in <em>Chase </em>even though appellant had been acquitted of the crime charged because it “was a case of mistaken identity” and the acquittal had resulted from that fact.</p>

We cannot agree with such a conclusion. Rather, if the Commonwealth <em>does </em>not bear its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (which occurred in <em>Chase), </em>or admits that it is <em>unable </em>to bear its burden of proof (as in the present case), the Commonwealth must bear the burden of justifying why the arrest record should not be expunged.
