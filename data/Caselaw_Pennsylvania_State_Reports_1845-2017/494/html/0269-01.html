The will provided that his wife Helen Corso receive in trust an amount equal to the maximum allowable marital deduction under federal estate tax laws and that their daughter Carol receive the residue of the estate in trust.

As a consequence, under section 2507(2) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, all provisions in testator’s will “in favor of or relating to” his divorced spouse were rendered “ineffective for all purposes.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thereafter, testator mar<a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>ried again, but did not alter his will.

Appellant Carol Corso filed exceptions to the decree, contending that since the pay-tax clause was intended to benefit only testator’s former spouse, it was rendered ineffective upon testator’s divorce by section 2507(2), along with all the other provisions “in favor of or relating to” his former spouse and thus could not benefit his second spouse’s intestate share.

Appellant argues, however, that because the general pay-tax clause <em>would have </em>conferred an economic benefit upon the divorced spouse if her bequests had <em>not </em>been nullified by operation of law, it favors her and, therefore, it too has become ineffective for <em>all </em>purposes. I disagree.</p>

The Report of the Joint State Government Commission on Decedent’s Estates, which Commission was responsible for drafting what eventually became Section 7(2) of the Wills Act of 1947, reflects the desire of the General Assembly to provide by law a testamentary scheme akin to that which it presumed a divorced testator would have intended in light of his dramatically changed circumstances:</p>

It is not a complete answer to say that the will can be changed or revoked. The testator may delay the change too long or may forget to make it or may be incompetent to make it. The real question is whether most persons so circumstanced (as in the case of <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>later marriage or birth) would wish their wills changed or would wish them to remain the same, and there is no doubt that most would wish them changed.</blockquote>

      <em>Report of the Joint State Government Commission of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania Relating to the Wills Act of 1947, </em>p. 42, (1947). Assuming that a testator ordinarily would not wish to confer a testamentary benefit upon one no longer his spouse, the General Assembly concluded that continuation of will provisions favoring the former spouse was simply a matter of inadvertence and provided for revocation thereof by operation of law. Thus, the purpose of the statute clearly is to prevent the <em>former spouse, </em>and <em>only </em>the former spouse, from receiving any type of benefit under the will.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

Since all bequests to the divorced spouse clearly were rendered ineffective by operation of law at the time of the divorce, the pay-tax provision here neither favors nor relates to her. It does mandate, however, that all death taxes otherwise chargeable to testator’s wife at the time of his death be paid out of the residuary estate, even though she takes by operation of law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

I conclude, therefore, that the pay-tax clause has not been rendered ineffective and that testator’s wife at the time of his death is entitled to take her share free of all taxes.</p>
