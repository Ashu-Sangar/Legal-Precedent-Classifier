Upon their arrival, appellant and the victim began arguing in the living room. The two then proceeded to the bedroom where the argument continued outside the hearing of Shillingford. Shortly thereafter, upon hearing a gunshot in the bedroom, Shillingford rushed in and observed the victim wounded and lying on the bed. Appellant and Shillingford then left the apartment.

The deputy medical examiner testified that it was evident from the nature of the wound and the powder burns on the skin of the victim that at the time the fatal shot was fired, the gun was being held with moderate to light pressure against her cheek. Furthermore, appellant himself took the stand and admitted pointing the gun at the victim’s cheek, pulling the trigger, and shooting her.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This evidence alone was sufficient to support the jury’s conclusion that appellant <em>intended </em>to kill the victim.

At trial, however, two witnesses, who had been identified without any reference to the tainted statement, testified without objection that, on the afternoon of the murder, appellant had showed them a snubnosed .38 caliber pistol with a two inch barrel and a pearl handle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> It was undisputed that the gun so described was the weapon used by appellant to shoot the victim.

Appellant challenges the expert’s use of the replica as an attempt by the Commonwealth to circumvent the findings of the suppression court. We disagree. The Commonwealth introduced without objection a description of the murder weapon obtained from an untainted source independent of the suppressed evidence, and then used the replica, only after making it clear to the jury that it was not the murder weapon, <em>solely </em>to illustrate the ballistic expert’s relevant technical testimony.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

After spending the night in a hotel, deliberations began at 9:30 a.m. the following morning and were interrupted by a brief lunch and two requests for additional instructions. At approximately 8:30 p.m. that evening, the trial judge told a court officer to inform the jury that it should end deliberations for the day and go to a hotel for dinner and rest. As the trial judge was preparing to leave, however, the court officer returned and informed her that one of the female jurors refused to go to the hotel and was threatening to go home. The trial judge thereupon summoned the assistant district attorney and defense counsel, explained what had transpired, and advised them that she intended to admonish the recalcitrant juror on the record. While a court reporter was being secured for that purpose, however, the jury reached a verdict. After the verdict was announced without objection at 10:05 p.m., the jurors were polled at the request of defense counsel, and it was determined that the verdict was unanimous.

The likelihood of inflaming the jurors was slim, particularly, in light of appellant’s admission that he had shot the victim and the clear communication to the jury that the replica was not the murder weapon. On the other hand, the replica was a valuable evidentiary tool, utilized to facilitate the jury’s understanding of expert testimony. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em><a href="/pa/475/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="475 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="1734104" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0331-01">475 Pa. 331</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="475 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="1734104" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0331-01">380 A.2d 747</a> (1977) (In determining the potential inflammatory nature of demonstrative evidence, the inflammatory nature of the evidence must be weighed against its “essential evidentiary value.”)</blockquote>
