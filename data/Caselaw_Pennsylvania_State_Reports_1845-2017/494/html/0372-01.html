At oral argument, heard on March 9, 1979, it was revealed that penal authorities had committed appellant to a mental institution after conviction. By order dated March 27, 1979, this Court remanded the record of the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County for an evidentiary hearing on the competency of appellant at the time of trial as well as sentencing. On remand, the court of common pleas considered appellant’s competency only at the time of trial. On August 16, 1979, this Court remanded the record for a determination of appellant’s competency at the time of sentencing. That determination was made on March 30, 1981, and this matter is now ready for decision.</p>

The victim, Gerald McGifford, died after he had been shot in the head at close range. Uniontown Police found the victim’s body on the night of the shooting after Barbara Maise, eyewitness and girlfriend of the victim, had reported the incident. Appellant was located the following evening in Pittsburgh, taken into police custody, and charged with criminal homicide, including murder of the first degree. Appellant gave police a statement.</p>

At trial, the Commonwealth sought to establish an intentional killing primarily through the testimony of eyewitness Maise. Maise testified that on the evening of the shooting she, appellant, and the victim had been riding in her car in the Uniontown area. Maise stated that, before the shooting, while the car was stopped and the victim was out of the car, appellant asked her, “Do you want me to hurt that punk?” According to Maise, the three later stopped the car in front of a private residence where appellant was <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>going to borrow money. She testified that, before going into the house, appellant shot the victim. Maise testified that, after the shooting,</p>

In the statement, appellant told police: “Gerald [(the victim)] and I got into an argument about the way Gerald was beating and treating [Maise]. He looked like he had something in his hand and I had a gun I had taken from my landlady. I shot Gerald twice. * * *”</p>
    <p id="b513-8" data-blocks='[["BL_513.8",513,[184,1265,1151,525]]]'>Appellant took the stand and presented a theory of self-defense. Appellant stated that, while sitting in the front seat of Maise’s car, he and the victim had argued about the victim’s habit of striking his girlfriend Maise. According to appellant, the victim “got a little peeved at me for telling him about his woman ...” and “proceeded to go into his pocket.” Appellant stated that he then shot the victim because he believed the victim was carrying a knife. Appellant (and another defense witness) also stated that he had been drinking throughout the day of the shooting.</p>

Additionally, the court charged the jury on self-defense and voluntary intoxication. On June 10, 1977, the jury returned its verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree. Shortly thereafter appellant was admitted to Far-view State Hospital for psychiatric evaluation. On October 27, 1977, a staff physician deemed appellant competent to be sentenced. On January 13, 1978, following the denial of written post-verdict motions, the court imposed sentence of <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>life imprisonment. This appeal followed, as did the evidentiary hearings on appellant’s competency.</p>

Although the doctors believed that appellant was suffering from mental illness, neither, could render an opinion on appellant’s competency to stand trial. On cross-examination both doctors indicated that appellant's condition could have been the result of his realization that he faced a sentence of life imprisonment. At the hearing on competency at sentencing, appellant offered no medical evidence. Instead, he testified that he could not recall the sentencing proceedings. Appellant claimed that he had been taking medication to such an extent as to affect his competency.</p>

    <p id="b517-7" data-blocks='[["BL_517.7",517,[185,1506,1151,586]]]'>Equally unsuccessful is appellant’s contention that venue should have been changed because of pre-trial publicity. Wholly lacking here is any evidence that prejudicial material was widely disseminated at the time of trial. See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Richardson, </em><a href="/pa/476/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="476 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1736930" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0571-01">476 Pa. 571</a>, 586-87, <a href="/pa/476/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="476 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1736930" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0571-01">383 A.2d 510</a>, 518 (1978); <em>Commonwealth v.

So too, there is no merit to appellant’s objection to the composition of the array from which his jury was selected. Appellant has failed to establish any systematic exclusion from the venire.
