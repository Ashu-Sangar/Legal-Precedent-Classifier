    <p id="b248-9" data-blocks='[["BL_248.10",248,[221,1094,1150,785]]]'>Appellee, Aristoteles J. Theros (Theros), a tenured professional employee of the Warwick School District in Lancaster County since 1965, was a teacher of business education. On June 29, 1976, the Warwick School Board adopted its budget for the 1976-1977 academic year. In an effort to reduce a projected budget deficit, the Board abolished three non-mandated supervisory positions, including the head of the Business Education Department and the Director of Athletics. At that time both supervisors were serving as half time administrators and half time teachers in the Business Education Department. After their administrative positions were eliminated, they were assigned to full time teaching positions in the Business Education Department. As a result, the business education staff had one more full time teacher than was needed.</p>
    <p id="b248-10" data-blocks='[["BL_248.11",248,[222,1910,1148,363]],["BL_249.1",249,[233,322,1151,458]]]'>None of the department’s six business education teachers was certified to teach in any other subject area. All six teachers were evaluated according to the provisions of the School Code, 24 P.S. § 1-101 et seq., and the requirements of the Commonwealth’s Department of Education. Theros was found to be the teacher with the lowest quality rating and the lowest total rating. On July 6, 1976, the School Board <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>reviewed the ratings of the business education teachers and placed Theros on suspension. At the same time it authorized the superintendent to inform the Department of Education of the entire procedure, and Theros was notified that he would be suspended, effective September 8,1976. Following a hearing which Theros requested pursuant to Local Agency Law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the School Board affirmed the suspension of Theros from his position as a professional employee in the Warwick School District.</p>
    <p id="b249-4" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[233,810,1150,520]]]'>Theros appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County which affirmed the School Board and dismissed the appeal. On appeal to the Commonwealth Court, the order of the Court of Common Pleas was reversed and the case remanded for “entry of an order directing the reinstatement of [Theros] as a professional employee of Warwick School District with payment of an amount of money equal to the compensation he would have been paid during the period of suspension.” We granted the School Board’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[253,821,1149,516]]]'>Clearly, the causes enumerated in paragraphs three and four were not applicable to the facts of this case. From the record of the hearing before the Board, it is also clear that the suspension of Theros was not based on a substantial decrease in pupil enrollment and that the elimination of supervisory positions in the district did not constitute curtailment or alteration of the educational program. In addition, the parties stipulated that if a teacher in the Business Education Department could be suspended legally, Theros was the appropriate one to be suspended.</p>
    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.6",250,[251,1357,1151,463]]]'>The Board does not claim that Theros was suspended for any of the four causes enumerated in § 1124. Instead, it maintains that § 1124 does not contain an exclusive list of permissible reasons for suspending a professional employee. The Board bases its claim for authority to decrease staff size when economic conditions require on the general powers granted to school directors by § 1106 of the School Code, 24 P.S. § 11-1106, and by Article 3, § 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Section 1106 provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b250-6" data-blocks='[["BL_250.7",250,[292,1836,1108,304]]]'>“[T]he Board of School Directors in every school district shall employ the <em>necessary </em>qualified professional employes, substitutes and temporary professional employes to keep the public schools open in their respective districts in compliance with the provisions of this Act.” (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

    <p id="b251-4" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[231,441,1151,684]]]'>The Board insists that § 1124 must be interpreted in light of the above constitutional and statutory provisions which justify the exercise of discretionary managerial authority by school boards in employment matters. It argues that the employment of unnecessary professional employees would violate its duties under § 1106 of the School Code as well as the Constitution’s mandate for an “efficient” system of education. The Board asserts support for its claim in Pennsylvania case law relying principally on a 1939 decision by this Court in which earlier comparable statutory and constitutional provisions were invoked as authority for approving a suspension. <em>Ehret v. Kulpmont Borough School District, </em><a href="/pa/333/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="333 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="1187945" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0518-01">333 Pa. 518</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20188" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 A.2d 188">5 A.2d 188</a> (1939).</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.6",251,[232,1165,1149,361]]]'>Thus, the Board argues that § 1124, which enumerates four specific causes for suspension, must be reconciled with the general grant of power given to school boards by the Constitution and § 1106 to hire the necessary teachers and to conduct an efficient system of public education.

At that time the only cause for suspension provided by the School Code was a “substantial decrease of pupil population within the school district.” In 1939 this Court was required to interpret the Tenure Act in <em>Ehret v. Kulpmont Borough School District, supra. </em>There we approved the suspension of a tenured kindergarten teacher where the district’s non-mandated kindergarten had been discontinued. The opinion in <em>Ehret </em>reflected the Court’s uncertainty as to the effect of the Tenure Act on suspensions when it stated:</p>

Further, the General Assembly addressed the specific problem presented by <em>Ehret </em>— viz., the abolition of departments and positions as well as changes in curriculum, by allowing for suspensions in the event of curtailment or alteration of program, provided the change was a result of substantial decrease in enrollment and was approved by the Department of Instruction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Finally, in the 1939 amendment the General Assembly provided for suspensions in the event of school consolidations. Section 1124 of the 1949 School Code substantially re-enacted the 1939 amendment to § 1205. In 1963, the legislature amended § 1124 by adding a fourth cause of <em>suspension </em>— viz., the reorganization of school districts.</p>

    <p id="b252-7" data-blocks='[["BL_252.6",252,[237,1874,1150,302]]]'>Thus, the Board’s contention that § 1124 does not delineate a complete list of permissible reasons for suspension must fail.

    <p id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[213,470,1152,895]]]'>We believe that Section 1124 must be interpreted in light of the constitutional and statutory provisions concerning the administration of education in the Commonwealth. Section 1106 of the School Code, 24 P.S. § 11 — 1106, provides that: “The board of school directors in every school district shall employ the necessary qualified professional employees . . . to keep the public schools open in their respective districts . . . . ” The Constitution, Article 3, Section 14, directs the General Assembly to “provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education . . . . ” In <em>Ehret v. Kulpmont Borough School District, </em><a href="/pa/333/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="333 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="1187945" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0518-01">333 Pa. 518</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20188" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="5 A.2d 188">5 A.2d 188</a> (1939), we recognized that a school board had discretion to add a supplementary department, in that case a kindergarten, and subsequently to suspend a teacher whose position was eliminated by the discontinuance of that department. In considering the statutory and constitutional provisions, we stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[253,1382,1110,957]],["BL_256.1",256,[282,308,1107,96]]]'>“ ‘Efficient’ has reference not only to the qualifications of the teacher, but relates to other basic matters associated with the school system. There are many factors that enter into the meaning of the word ‘necessary,’ as we said in <em>Wilson v. School Dist. of Phila., </em><a href="/pa/328/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="328 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1179655" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0225-01">328 Pa. 225</a>, 236 [<a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="195 A. 90">195 A. 90</a>], What would be ‘necessary’ under this provision is a matter within the administrative discretion of the board to a large extent. Thus, the board has discretion to add supplementary departments, and by so doing to create a necessity for more teachers. The uncertainty of the school tax rate comes from the uncertainty of the amount that is required to pay the teaching staff of each district, which may be increased without outside interference, and may be decreased within the limitations of the Act. “If the legislature intended teachers to be employed, or retained, who are rendered unnecessary by the abolition of a department, in order to preserve the continuity and efficiency of the school system as a whole, it should have <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>set forth such intention specifically in dealing with a subject as important as the one before us.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[239,422,1149,308]]]'>In <em>Sporie v.

Citing <em>Ehret, </em>the opinion states:</p>
    <blockquote id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.6",256,[281,744,1108,781]]]'>“Just as the Court in <em>Ehret </em>found school boards vested with a general power, under the School Code of 1911, to suspend tenure teachers who are no longer necessary for the efficient operation of the school district because their department has been abolished, we find that school boards possess a similar power under the existing school code. By allowing the suspension of professional employees upon the alteration or curtailment of an educational program ‘to conform with standards of organization . . . required by law’ and by continuing, in Section 1106 of the Code, the requirement or standard that school boards shall hire only necessary teachers, the legislature has authorized school boards to suspend professionals made unnecessary by the curtailment or alteration of a school’s educational program.”</blockquote>

That case is clearly distinguishable. A close reading of <em>Alberts </em>makes it apparent that this Court was not at all satisfied that the abolition of Alberts’ position and his removal as a professional employee was based purely on financial considerations.

Increasingly, school districts are <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>finding it difficult to meet the financial burden of operating their educational systems. For this Court to conclude that while a school district may abolish positions for economic reasons, it must nevertheless retain the teachers who held those positions even though those teachers would have no duties to perform, is to effectuate a result which the Legislature did not intend in enacting Section 1124. This is not to say that a school district may abolish a position or department merely to circumvent the tenure provisions of the Code or to suspend a professional employee for arbitrary reasons. It is only when a board has clearly established that the reduction conforms with the mandates of Section 1106 of the Code and the Constitutional provisions herein referred to, and that the suspension is made in accordance with the requirements of 24 P.S. § 11-1125, that the reduction and suspension should be approved.</p>
