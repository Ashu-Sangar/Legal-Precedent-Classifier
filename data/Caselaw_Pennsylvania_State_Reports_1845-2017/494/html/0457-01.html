In the “Statement of Questions Involved” portion of his brief, appellant also claims that trial counsel ineffectively failed to argue the voluntariness of appellant’s confession.

For example, where a petitioner has been represented by the same counsel at trial and on direct appeal, a claim of ineffective assistance of that counsel cannot have been previously litigated or waived. <em>Commonwealth v. Dancer, </em><a href="/pa/460/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="460 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="482887" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0095-01">460 Pa. 95</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="460 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="482887" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0095-01">331 A.2d 435</a> (1975). So too, where a petitioner asserts a right, not recognized at the time of his trial and direct appeal, whose retrospective application is constitutionally required, considerations of whether the claim has been waived or finally litigated are of course irrelevant.</p>
    <p id="b598-9" data-blocks='[["BL_598.10",598,[245,1862,1150,468]]]'>Here, however, appellant’s claims are not of such a nature. Even assuming that none of appellant’s claims was previously raised, appellant has not even suggested the existence of extraordinary circumstances which would justify his failure to have raised these issues in post-trial motions and on direct appeal. Therefore, any claims of appellant which have not in fact been finally litigated must be deemed to have been waived, 19 P.S. § 1180 — 4(b)(2), and the order of the P.C.H.A. court should be affirmed.</p>
