Appellant and Mr. Black lived together for ten years, beginning in 1968, during which time they had three children. Their relationship was marked by arguments, frequently over nothing, during which appellant’s husband often hit her. On the night of the shooting, appellant, her husband and two of their friends spent some time at the home of one friend’s daughter. After the four had left the daughter’s home, appellant and the decedent began arguing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> At the time, appellant and her husband were walking together about thirty to forty feet ahead of their friends.

Eisenberg &amp; E. Seymour, The Self-Defense Plea and Battered Women, 14 Trial Nos. 7, 34, 41 (1978) (“If she had knowledge, at the time, of prior specific acts of violence by the victim . .., that knowledge had to work on her mind, causing greater fear than if she had lacked such knowledge.”); Comment, 6 Pepperdine L.Rev. 213, 223 (1978) (“[Tjhere is no reason why a finding <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>of self-defense should not consider the mental state of a reasonable person who has suffered repeated previous beatings at the hands of the victim.”).</p>

    <blockquote id="Adq" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[220,935,1108,1021]]]'>The trial court concluded that appellant’s belief was unreasonable because appellant had seen the decedent in a drunken and abusive state on numerous previous occasions, and that on those previous occasions the decedent had never become physically violent towards her. We believe that these prior instances enhance, rather than diminish, appellant’s claim. On several prior occasions, according to the trial court, appellant had witnessed the decedent become verbally abusive when drunk. Never before had the decedent become physically abusive when drunk, however. On the night of his death, the decedent became physically violent, and directed that physical violence toward various objects within appellant’s apartment and within close proximity to her. This change in the decedent’s behavior gave appellant reason to believe that the violence which decedent had been directing toward the various objects within the room was about to be directed at her. That belief was reasonable under the circumstances.</blockquote>

The fact that Mr. Black possessed no weapon at the time of the shooting did not render appellant’s belief that she was in danger any less reasonable, since it is beyond question that manual strangulation can result in serious bodily injury, if not death.</p>
