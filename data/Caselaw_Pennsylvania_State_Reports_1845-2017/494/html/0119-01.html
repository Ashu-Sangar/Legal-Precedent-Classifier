    <p id="b259-7" data-blocks='[["BL_259.8",259,[209,736,1151,793]]]'>During the 1976-1977 school year, the Board of School Directors of the Lake Lehman School District requested its Superintendent to develop a school district reorganization plan. Such a plan was prepared and forwarded to the Department of Public Instruction for approval. The School Board adopted the plan on June 30, 1977. The Department of Public Instruction approved the reorganization on July 5, 1977, advising the Board that the proposed program changes met the mandated curriculum requirements of the School Code and regulations of the State Board. The Department also notified the Board that the proposed changes were not covered by Section 1124 of the Public School Code of 1949, Act of March 10,1949, P.L. 30, § 1124, 24 P.S. § 11-1124, and did not need official departmental approval since they were a local district option within the discretion of the Board.</p>
    <p id="b259-8" data-blocks='[["BL_259.9",259,[206,1552,1151,473]]]'>Pursuant to the reorganization plan, two tenured professional employees and two temporary professional employees were suspended, a German teacher was demoted and a custodian was dismissed. The dismissal and demotion are not involved in this appeal. The suspended employees requested a hearing pursuant to Local Agency Law, Act of December 2,1968, P.L. 1133, 53 P.S. § 11301 et seq. Following the hearing on August 9, 1977, the School Board issued an adjudication sustaining the suspensions.</p>
    <p id="b259-9" data-blocks='[["BL_259.10",259,[205,2046,1152,309]]]'>The employees appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County which affirmed the Board’s action and dismissed the appeals. They then appealed to the Commonwealth Court which reversed and remanded the case for entry of an order directing their reinstatement. We granted the District’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

Since the reorganization in this case was not required by law and did not require approval by the Department of Public Instruction, it did not qualify as an alteration of the District’s educational program under subsection (2) of Section 1124. Therefore, for the reasons set forth in <em>Warwick Board of School Directors v.

Additionally, I would like to add that the reason the legislature limited suspensions of teachers to the four enumerated situations was for the purpose of maintaining the quality of education. The legislature has wisely recognized that quality education of children is a priority service that must be provided to them both for their benefit and the benefit of our society. <em>See Walker v.
