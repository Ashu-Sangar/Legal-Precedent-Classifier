An analysis of the decision in <em>Lloyd v. Hart </em>is in full accord with the view we adopt and is not supportive of the position urged by appellee. The holding in <em>Lloyd v. Hart </em>was that the sale of real estate by the committee of a lunatic, for payment of his debts under a decree of the court, works no conversion of the funds, and the fund is distributed according to the rules of descent for real property. In that case the land was sold for Six Thousand ($6,000) Dollars and after payment of debts of the incompetent a balance remained in the fund of Three Thousand ($3,000) Dollars.</p>
    <p id="b728-6" data-blocks='[["BL_728.6",728,[259,1432,1151,625]]]'>It is to be noted that the fund at issue in <em>Lloyd v. Hart </em>was the balance that remained of the proceeds from the sale. There was no question of income generated by that fund. There the Court used the device of holding that these monies “retained the impress of real estate” to avoid a change in the distribution to heirs because of the conversion. So too, section 2514(16.1) and (18) protects the specific devisee from having her interest extinguished from the conversion of the property which was the subject of the specific bequest or devise. In neither case is there any suggestion that income generated during the incompetent testator’s lifetime should inure to the benefit of the devisee of the specific devise.</p>

After decedent’s death, Herman and Martha Belz claimed the proceeds of these bonds on the basis of their p.o.d. designation. In addition a claim was made for the accrued interest income earned prior to decedent’s death by the investment of these proceeds.</p>
    <p id="b729-5" data-blocks='[["BL_729.5",729,[172,966,1152,297]]]'>The court held that the redemption of the bonds by the guardians did not work an ademption of the p.o.d. beneficiaries’ right to the proceeds of the bonds. However, the court did reject the second claim for the interest generated by these proceeds prior to decedent’s death. The court stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b729-6" data-blocks='[["BL_729.6",729,[213,1289,1112,521]]]'>It is evident, however, that Mr. and Miss Belz are not entitled to the income earned prior to decedent’s death by the investment of the proceeds. <em>Their rights did not arise until the decedent died, and the estate is, therefore, entitled to all income earned or accrued by the segregated fund prior to that time. </em>The original proceeds of the bonds plus income earned after decedent’s death, less the portions thereof due the spouse under her election, constitute the interest of Mr. and Miss Belz in the fund.” <em>Ruck Estate, supra, </em>p. 785 (emphasis added).</blockquote>

Implicitly she suggests that possibility would justify her receipt of any income from the certificate during the lifetime of the testator. This position is obviously fallacious. Absent the provisions of section 2514(16.1), Ms. McCoy’s interest would have been completely extinguished as a result of the ademption. That result was altered only because of the legislative enactment in section 2514(16.1). The legislature saw fit to preserve for her only the net proceeds. Thus, what may or <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>may not have occurred to the real estate after its alienation is irrelevant. If it were contended that the trustees had improperly alienated the property with the purpose of diminishing the interest of the specific devisee, then a different question would be presented. Here there was no challenge to the propriety of the conversion of the real estate.</p>
