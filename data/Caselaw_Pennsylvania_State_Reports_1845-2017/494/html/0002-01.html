As a result of the contempt conviction, appellant was prohibited, for a period of six months, from practicing in the courtroom of the trial judge, I. Raymond Kremer. This direct appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>The facts are as follows. On August 3, 1978, appellant and Bruce Sagel, Esquire, another Assistant District Attorney, were representing the Commonwealth in the cases against three defendants, Lennis Pompey, Alfred Anderson and Ronald Moffatt, all of whom had entered pleas of guilty to numerous burglary and theft charges. After Moffatt had tendered his plea, the trial court asked if Moffatt had a prior record. When Moffatt’s attorney indicated that Moffatt was a first offender, Sagel informed the court that Moffatt had an outstanding fugitive warrant from New Jersey. Sagel also criticized Moffatt’s attorney for misrepresenting his client’s record. The trial court had some question as to whether it could consider the warrant and asked Sagel to research the applicable law and bring it to court the next day along with all documents pertaining to Moffatt’s criminal record. When Sagel informed the court that he could not be in court, appellant agreed to fulfill the court’s request.</p>
    <p id="b142-5" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[253,1280,1153,567]]]'>The following morning, appellant informed the court that the F.B.I. could not deliver the requested documents until sometime that afternoon. After chastising appellant for not having the documents and then launching into an attack about the conduct of the office of the District Attorney, the trial court referred to his opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Brooks<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and informed appellant that the court did not “wish to hear another solitary word from the District Attorney” unless appellant apologized to Moffatt’s attorney for Sagel’s statements the previous day.
