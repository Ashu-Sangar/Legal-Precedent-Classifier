    <p id="b719-9" data-blocks='[["BL_719.10",719,[179,1060,1151,308]]]'>By Order of this Court of February 4, 1981, the parties were requested to brief and argue whether principles of comity and equity require the courts of Pennsylvania to refrain from exercising jurisdiction pending final resolution of a similar action in the courts of New Jersey. <em>Geftman v.

Five days later, while cross-examination of Raymond Geftman was underway, Raymond Geftman sought to discontinue the New Jersey action. Through Pennsylvania counsel, American requested an expedited trial listing of the Pennsylvania action. Although certificates of readiness or praecipes for trial had not been signed by counsel for both sides as required by local rule of court, Judge Stanziani of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County advised counsel to be prepared to proceed to trial on October 6,1980. After ruling on jurisdic<a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>tional issues, Judge Stanziani set October 20, 1980, as the date for trial.</p>

The petition requested a stay of all proceedings before Judge Stanziani pending termination of proceedings in the courts of New Jersey. The same day, petitioners Wayne Geftman, Barry Geftman, and Walter Jeffries, as administrator C.T.A. for the estate of Norman Geftman, filed a petition for writ of prohibition with this Court to prohibit Judge Stanziani from entering any further orders in the Pennsylvania trial court proceedings. On October 20, 1980, Mr. Justice Nix issued a rule to show cause upon Judge Stanziani and ordered that all proceedings be stayed. This Court heard oral argument on October 23,1980. Pursuant to this Court’s order of February 4, 1981, the parties appeared before this Court on March 3, 1981, to brief and argue the issues of comity and equity.</p>
