On direct appeal, this Court reversed appellant’s judgments of sentence and awarded him a new trial, holding that appellant’s arrest was illegal and that the lower court had erred in admitting certain physical evidence which was obtained through the exploitation of that illegal arrest. <em>Commonwealth v.

Miller, a/k/a Abu-Ibn Hanifah Bey, was arrested and charged along with appellant for his participation in the robbery and shooting, and his separate trial resulted in convictions for murder of the second degree, aggravated robbery and burglary. On appeal, this Court reversed the judgments of sentence and ordered a new trial on the grounds that Miller’s confession was the product of unnecessary pre-arraignment delay and was admitted into evidence in violation of Rule 118 (now Rule 130), Pa.R.

Although Miller looked at his confession at least five times during his testimony and each time stated that the confession had refreshed his memory, he was still “unable” to recall whether he and appellant were accompanied by a third man at the Jamaica Inn; where appellant went once inside the bar; whether appellant accompanied him when he left the bar just before the robbery; whether appellant was with him when he reentered the bar just before the robbery; what happened inside the bar during the robbery; who had the shotgun; who fired the shot that killed Mr. DuBose; and who accompanied him when he left the bar after the robbery and shooting. The answers to all these questions were contained in Miller’s confession. When asked where he was at the time of his arrest, Miller’s initial response was that the answer was in his confession. Finally, when the trial judge sought to ascertain whether Miller had an independent recollection of the incident, Miller’s answer to two more inquiries was to the effect that he had already <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>testified to everything he could remember, and three further responses were to the effect that he could only offer additional information by actually reading from his confession.</p>

Following extended argument in chambers, the court granted this request, holding that Miller’s confession was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement and that it could be considered as substantive evidence under the reasoning of Mr. Justice Roberts’ dissent in <em>Commonwealth v. Gee, </em><a href="/pa/467/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="467 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1717273" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0123-01">467 Pa. 123</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="467 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1717273" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0123-01">354 A.2d 875</a> (1976).

The only remaining requirement — number 3 above — is that Miller must have lacked a present recollection of the event. By lack of present recollection, we mean that the witness must lack <em>“sufficient </em>present recollection to enable [him] to testify fully and accurately.” McCormick, Law of Evidence § 302 (2d ed. 1972) (emphasis added). With respect to this requirement, we do not regard Miller’s contrary affirmations as dispositive. In fact, Miller’s acknowledgments that his memory had been refreshed were belied by his behavior on the witness stand-by his repeated inability to remember relevant facts and by his constant references to the existence of his confession as a substitute for substantive responses. Furthermore, the fact that Miller’s lack of recall may have been the product of a “selective memory” — a conscious desire to withhold certain information — is not a bar to the establishment of this requirement. <em>See United States v.

Appellant also asserts, without <em>any </em>explanation that the admission of Miller’s confession violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Since appellant’s brief fails to elaborate upon this mere assertion, this claim has been waived. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em><a href="/pa/476/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="476 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="1736849" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0531-01">476 Pa. 531</a>, 534 n.1, <a href="/pa/476/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="476 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="1736849" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0531-01">383 A.2d 490</a>, 491 n.1 (1978) (opinion in support of affirmance).</p>

Whether or not Miller’s confession would have been suppressed at his own trial were it found to be involuntary or the fruit of his own unlawful arrest is irrelevant here. Likewise, any coercive quality inherent in Miller’s arrest, if that arrest was in fact unlawful, <em>see Commonwealth v.

Miller was questioned at various intervals over a five hour period following his arrest, during which time he repeatedly denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the robbery and shooting. It was not until Miller had been confronted with appellant’s confession that he admitted participating in the incident at the Jamaica Inn. <em>Commonwealth v.

Before Miller was excused from the stand, appellant’s counsel stated that he had no questions for the witness; after Miller’s confession was read to the jury, appellant’s counsel simply moved for a mistrial without requesting any opportunity to cross-examine Miller on his statement.</p>
