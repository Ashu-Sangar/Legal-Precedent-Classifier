For the reasons stated hereinafter, we remand this case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b445-7" data-blocks='[["BL_445.8",445,[184,904,1151,628]]]'>On November 9, 1976, appellant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to murder generally and to six counts of recklessly endangering another person. Other charges were nol prossed pursuant to the plea bargain wherein the Commonwealth certified that the degree of homicide would rise no higher than murder of the third degree. A degree of guilt hearing then determined the murder to be that of the third degree. On January 25, 1977, appellant was sentenced to ten to twenty years on the murder conviction and to consecutive sentences of two to twelve years on the recklessly endangering convictions. Appellant did not file a petition to withdraw the guilty plea and no direct appeal was taken.</p>

This petition was returned to appellant as being in violation of the PCHA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> A second pro se petition was then filed on May 10,1977, wherein appellant again attempted to state his position and requested the appointment of counsel other than his guilty plea counsel. By order of the lower court new counsel was appointed and oral argument was set for <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>June 6, 1977. Newly appointed counsel then moved for a continuance, claiming that he had not received certain information essential to the preparation of his argument, and argument was postponed indefinitely by the court below. Some eleven months later, in an order filed May 4, 1978, the court explained that argument had actually been postponed on the ground that appellant had retained private counsel, that neither the court nor appointed counsel had heard from “any private counsel” and that the proceedings should not be further delayed without the consent of appellant. Argument was then fixed for May 26, 1978.</p>
    <p id="b446-5" data-blocks='[["BL_446.5",446,[248,913,1148,201]]]'>In a motion filed May 12, 1978, appellant acknowledged that he had retained private counsel and successfully moved to postpone the scheduled argument so that he might meet with private counsel and prepare his petition.</p>

However, due to the illness and death of Senior Judge F. Joseph Thomas, reargument was not held until August 17, 1979. President Judge P. Richard Thomas, by opinion and order dated September 26, 1979, then dismissed the petition without granting an evidentiary hearing.</p>
