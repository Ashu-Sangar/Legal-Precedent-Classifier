The other school districts had a right under Sections 9 to 11 of Act 59, <em>supra, </em>to a correct and accurate determination of the amount of subsidy granted them. This right is the same as that of appellant. It is not one of entitlement to a determined portion of the total subsidy, but rather to a sum <em>to be determined </em>by correct computations of the Secretary of Education in accordance with the state school subsidy formula which included the use of a certified, accurate “personal income valuation” from the Secretary of Revenue. Even a right of anticipation of a fixed amount of subsidy did not exist for any of the school districts when the complaint was filed. The two payments made prior to May 23, 1978 were only estimates and the final payment which established the determined amount came into being the following June 1st, as mandated by the Code. No right as to a fixed dollar amount existed in the final payment, nor did the complaint in equity deemed a petition for review request a fixed dollar amount in its prayer for relief.
