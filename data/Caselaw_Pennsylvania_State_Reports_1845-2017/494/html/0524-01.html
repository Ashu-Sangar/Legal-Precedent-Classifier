He ran over, opened the car door, grabbed her by the collar and slapped her. During the argument that followed, Ferrell told appellant to “pick on me.” Appellant then drove to his mother-in-law’s house and obtained a loaded shotgun.</p>
    <p id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[237,1023,1149,580]]]'>Later that afternoon, appellant confronted his wife at a neighbor’s house and threw a shotgun shell at her, stating, “This one is for you.” He then left the house and returned to the 1201 Bar, where Ferrell was employed as a bartender. Holding the loaded shotgun, appellant entered the bar, walked to within a few feet of a pool table where Ferrell was standing, said, “I told you I’d be back,” and shot him. Appellant began to aim the shotgun again, but a patron in the bar struggled with him and prevented a second shot. With the gun still in his hands, appellant fled, but was apprehended outside the bar by two passing police officers.</p>

    <p id="b669-6" data-blocks='[["BL_669.6",669,[176,655,1151,595]]]'>II Wigmore on Evidence § 302 at 245 (Chadbourn rev. 1979). Here, the subsequent conduct, possession of the unloaded gun and shells which did not fit the gun, bore no similarity to the act of shooting for which appellant was being tried. Indeed, the record fails even to suggest that appellant had ever used the second shotgun. Thus this evidence carries no probative weight on the issue of whether the shooting was accidental. See <em>Commonwealth v. Bond, </em><a href="/pa-super/261/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="261 Pa. Super. 311" data-case-ids="110088" data-case-paths="/pa-super/261/0311-01">261 Pa.Super. 311</a>, 318, <a href="/pa-super/261/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="261 Pa.

    <p id="b669-7" data-blocks='[["BL_669.7",669,[171,1277,1155,975]]]'>The Commonwealth maintains that any error in permitting the introduction of the unloaded shotgun and shells which did not fit the gun was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in view of the allegedly “overwhelming” evidence of appellant’s guilt. However, if the Commonwealth’s evidence is so overwhelming, obviously no interest of justice was advanced by the Commonwealth’s insistence on the admission of prejudicial evidence over objection, wholly lacking in probative value, and the trial court’s admission of such evidence. Indeed, the fourteenth amendment forbids “fundamental unfairness in the use of evidence whether true or false.” <em>Lisenba v. California, </em><a href="/us/314/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="314 U.S. 219" data-case-ids="6139038" data-case-paths="/us/314/0219-01">314 U.S. 219</a>, 236, <a href="/us/314/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="314 U.S. 219" data-case-ids="6139038" data-case-paths="/us/314/0219-01">62 S.Ct. 280</a>, 290, <a href="/us/314/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="314 U.S. 219" data-case-ids="6139038" data-case-paths="/us/314/0219-01">86 L.Ed. 166</a> (1941). A truth-seeking process founded upon integrity and fairness and dedicated to the evenhanded administration of criminal justice manifestly cannot condone convictions stained by prosecutorial evidence which impermissibly impugns the accused. A verdict so obtained cannot stand.</p>
