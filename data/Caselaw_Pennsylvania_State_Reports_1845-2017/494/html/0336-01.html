On September 15, 1977, the court sustained defendants’ preliminary objections to plaintiffs’ amended complaint on the grounds that it was not a proper class action and that plaintiffs had failed to join certain “indispensable parties” as defendants. The court dismissed the complaint without prejudice to the rights of the named plaintiffs to proceed with individual actions. On September 25,1978, the Superior Court affirmed <em>per curiam, </em><a href="/pa-super/260/0617-03" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="394 A.2d 627" data-case-ids="108547,108662,108712,108730" data-case-paths="/pa-super/260/0617-03,/pa-super/260/0617-02,/pa-super/260/0619-01,/pa-super/260/0618-01">394 A.2d 627</a>. This Court granted plaintiffs’ petition for allowance of appeal on February 27, 1979. The factual allegations pertaining to plaintiff Martha Sharkus are as follows: Sharkus was treated in the accident ward of Jefferson Hospital on July 21, 1970, by Dr. J. David Hoffman, a staff physician of the hospital. Dr. Hoffman diagnosed her injury as a fracture of the distal fifth metatarsal of the left foot. He performed a closed reduction of the fracture and applied a short leg cast. Thereafter, for several months Sharkus continued to suffer swelling and discomfort which Hoffman diagnosed as sympathetic causalgia of the foot. On October 19, 1970, Hoffman admitted Sharkus to Jefferson where she received therapy and cortisone injections. <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>At the time of her hospitalization Sharkus was covered by a Subscription Agreement between the Budd Company and Blue Cross which provided, <em>inter alia </em>that:</p>

The Insurance Review Committee concurred with Blue Cross’ determination that Sharkus’ hospitalization was not covered by her Subscription Agreement. Consequently, Blue Cross recalled its previous payment to Jefferson on the ground that the hospitalization was not medically necessary.</p>

Thereafter, on October 20, 1968, Jefferson sent Riloff a bill demanding payment of $1,001.45 and notifying her for the first time that Blue Cross refused to make payment.

Jefferson asserts that the members of the proposed plaintiff class fall into three separate categories; (1) cases where the hospitalization was both medically necessary and not primarily for diagnostic purposes, in which case it should be covered by the Blue Cross contract; (2) cases where the hospitalization was for diagnostic purposes, in which case it is not covered by Blue Cross, but the services were appropriate and the patient should pay for them if consent was given; and (3) cases where the hospitalization was not justified, in which case the admitting physician might be liable. It maintains that individual factual determinations as to medical necessity and the extent of the patient’s reliance on medical advice are necessary to resolve the question of liability as to each class member. Thus, it contends, class action treatment is not appropriate since there was no common practice applicable to all members of the proposed class.</p>

Jefferson acknowledges that the physicians’ status as agents of the hospital does not require that they be joined as defendants. <em>See </em>3 Am.Jur.2d, Agency, § 342, p. 699; 53 Am.Jur.2d, Master and Servant, § 454, p. 475. Nevertheless, it maintains that the physicians will be affected by their interest in “the physician’s standard of care to his or her patients with regard to recommending hospitalization.” Plaintiffs reply that this litigation does not seek to impose any greater standard of care with respect to determining the medical necessity of hospitalization.</p>
    <p id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.6",485,[190,1680,1153,515]]]'>As we noted in ruling on plaintiffs’ class action claim, the present case does not seek to litigate the issue of medical necessity for hospitalization. In the case of each member of the plaintiff class, a determination has been made that the hospitalization was not medically necessary. Those determinations were not disputed in this action. Instead, plaintiffs seek a determination of the respective rights and obligations of Blue Cross subscribers, Blue Cross and the hospitals <em>inter se. </em>We cannot agree that, for this purpose, the admitting physicians are indispensable parties to the action.</p>

Appellants note that the relevant Blue Cross-subscriber agreements, as well as Section 8 of the applicable “Provider-Blue Cross Contract” require that hospitalization is to be rendered only on the recommendation of a physician who is a member of the staff of, or acceptable to the hospital. Further, the subscriber agreements provide that “benefits shall continue only during such time as a Subscriber is under the treatment and care of such a physician,” and Section 8 of the “Provider-Blue Cross Contract” requires that the hospital shall render covered services “only during such period as the Subscriber is in need of hospital care ... and is under the care of such physician.”</p>

Baker, Vice President of Provider Affairs, stated in his sworn deposition as the representative of Blue Cross that (1) a patient cannot make the determination whether or not his hospitalization is medically necessary; (2) the patient must depend upon the advice of the admitting physician; (3) the determination of medical necessity is a matter of judgment that differs among physicians; and (4) such a determination often cannot be made until after the fact.</p>
