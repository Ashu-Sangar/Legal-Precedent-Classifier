The Commonwealth sought to establish that, while standing on the front porch common to the Mendel and Stetler residences and waiting for police to arrive, the victim was pulled inside the Stetler residence and shot in the back several times by David Horner (son of James Horner and Geraldine Stetler) and once by appellant.</p>

Appellant was furnished a copy of the statement during the Commonwealth’s direct examination of Nancy Mendel. See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Hamm, </em><a href="/pa/474/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="474 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1732177" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0487-01">474 Pa. 487</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="474 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1732177" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0487-01">378 A.2d 1219</a> (1977). On the previous day of trial, appellant had been denied a copy during the Commonwealth’s direct examination of the officer who took the statement. Appellant maintains that the previous day’s denial precluded effective cross-examination of the officer. However, appellant fails to demonstrate that the trial court’s ruling prejudiced his ability to cross-examine either Nancy Mendel or the officer taking the statement. Failure to demonstrate prejudice is fatal to appellant’s claim. Compare <em>Hamm, </em><a href="/pa/474/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="474 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1732177" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0487-01">supra,</a> <a href="/pa/474/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="474 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1732177" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0487-01">474 Pa. at 502</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="474 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1732177" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0487-01">378 A.2d at 1219</a> (case remanded for inquiry into <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>prejudice where defense counsel not permitted access to statements).</p>
    <p id="b697-4" data-blocks='[["BL_697.5",697,[180,455,1151,632]]]'>Fourth among appellant’s assertions of error is the claim that a police sergeant who investigate the shooting impermissibly expressed an opinion that a stair railing inside the Stetler home had been dislodged before the shooting. The sergeant, who conducted his investigation about two and one-half hours after the shooting, based his opinion on the absence of debris in the area surrounding the railing. Appellant contends that the sergeant’s opinion testimony was beyond his area of expertise, and that prejudice occurred because the testimony contradicted appellant’s position that the damage to the railing occurred during the incident leading to the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b697-5" data-blocks='[["BL_697.6",697,[179,1112,1153,792]]]'>Like appellant, we do not believe that the sergeant’s opinion related to his investigatory expertise. See <em>Commonwealth v.

However, the record fails to disclose any defense evidence, either by way of appellant’s testimony or otherwise, indicating that the victim had damaged the railing upon entry of the residence. Indeed, the only reference to dislodging of the railing appears in the undisputed testimony of a police officer who, approximately one week before the shooting, had investigated an earlier confrontation between the victim and appellant. Thus, even if the police sergeant exceeded the scope of his expertise, his testimony was merely cumulative of other properly admitted evidence and, on this record, harmless. See <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. 391</a>, 411-12 nn. 20 — 21, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d 155</a>, 165 nn. 20 — 21 (1978) (citing cases).</p>

Appellant contends that the discrepancy in charges is attributable solely to the ages of the two defendants. On this record, revealing no arbitrary, vindictive, or selective prosecution, we see no basis for disturbing the manner in which the prosecutor exercised the charging function. See <em>Oyler v.

One of the calls was from appellant who, before the fatal shooting, had told police that “somebody next door just hit my buddy with a bat” and, “Hurry up, because I’m going to have my gun. I’m going to take his head off.” After the transcripts were read, tape recordings of the same calls were also played to the jury. Appellant complains that the playing of the tape recordings should have been sufficient.</p>

The witness testified that appellant had an “excellent” reputation for being a law-abiding, peaceful citizen. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the witness if she had ever been in the company of appellant at social events. After the witness responded in the affirmative, the following colloquy ensued:</p>

The court sustained defense objection and told the jury, “[djon’t concern yourselves with any past convictions of driving while intoxicated. We are not concerned about that.” The court denied the defense’s request for a mistrial. This ruling is now challenged.</p>
    <p id="b702-4" data-blocks='[["BL_702.5",702,[258,811,1150,694]]]'>Although the Commonwealth suggests that the prosecuting attorney’s questioning on recross-examination was proper, and that the trial court acted out of an “abundance of caution” in sustaining defense objection, the record is clear that the trial court correctly sustained the objection. Notwithstanding the prosecutor’s allusion to the witness’s familiarity with appellant’s community reputation, the clear thrust of the prosecutor’s questioning of the reputation witness was to put before the jury the fact that appellant had been previously convicted of driving while intoxicated. Such questioning is impermissible. See <em>Commonwealth v. Jenkins, </em><a href="/pa/413/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="413 Pa. 606" data-case-ids="1888572" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0606-01">413 Pa. 606</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.2d%20497" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="198 A.2d 497">198 A.2d 497</a> (1964).

    <p id="b702-5" data-blocks='[["BL_702.6",702,[258,1544,1149,584]]]'>However, we agree with the trial court that the error is not of sufficient magnitude to warrant relief. Manifestly, there is the danger that, finding a previous offense, the jury will “short cut the reputation process and use it more directly to convict in the case on trial.” McCormick, supra. But here the conviction of driving while intoxicated could have little bearing on the offenses with which appellant presently was charged. Evidence of the conviction added little to the undisputed fact that appellant drank on occasion, and intoxication was irrelevant both to the Commonwealth’s case and to appellant’s.</p>

However, this challenged evidence in no respect implicated appellant. Appellant has failed to show how this evidence prejudiced him. See <em>Commonwealth v.

In appellant’s view, such questioning constituted improper comment upon his constitutional right to remain silent. See, e. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Easley, </em><a href="/pa/483/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="483 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1751184" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0337-01">483 Pa. 337</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="483 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1751184" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0337-01">396 A.2d 1198</a> (1979). But appellant did not remain silent following arrest. Instead, he presented a version of the shooting to police which he later admitted, at trial, to be false. As in a recent case, “[t]he prosecutor was merely attempting to impeach appellant’s credibility by pointing out an inconsistency between appellant’s post-arrest statement and his trial testimony.” <em>Commonwealth v. Beavers, </em><a href="/pa/492/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="492 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1767169" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0522-01">492 Pa. 522</a>, 531, <a href="/pa/492/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="492 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1767169" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0522-01">424 A.2d 1313</a>, 1318 (1981).
