    <p id="b425-11" data-blocks='[["BL_425.13",425,[174,1476,1151,500]]]'>Shortly after midnight on November 10, 1975 the Plum Borough Police Department radio dispatcher received a telephone call wherein the caller stated, “this is Sakai at 5056 Hialeah. I have just killed my wife.” Police patrol cars were dispatched to the address. As the patrol cars arrived, a man subsequently identified as appellant, ran to the cars and yelled, “I killed my wife.” The officers discovered the body of the deceased wife inside the home and then arrested appellant. Appellant made no more statements until a few hours later.</p>

The latter doctor ultimately testified for the defense at trial, advancing his opinion that appellant was insane under the <em>M’Naghten </em>test, i. e., at the time of the act he either did not know the nature and quality of the act or did not know that it was wrong. <em>Commonwealth v. Hicks, </em><a href="/pa/483/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="483 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1751231" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0305-01">483 Pa. 305</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="483 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1751231" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0305-01">396 A.2d 1183</a> (1979). On November 25, 1975 appellant was adjudged incompetent to stand trial and was committed to Farview State Hospital. Seven months later appellant was deemed mentally fit for trial, which took place in August 1976 before a jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree.</p>

The test is <em>not </em>whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel’s decisions had any reasonable basis.

      <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>Appellant’s initial claim is that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for the suppression of an inculpatory statement he gave to an arresting officer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> At the PCHA hearing, the trial counsel testified that he was aware of one psychiatric opinion that appellant was insane at the time of the act. Because the voluntariness of a statement depends upon the totality of the circumstances, including an accused’s psychological state, a motion to suppress appellant’s statement might have been meritorious. However, the trial counsel’s plan to focus the trial on the issue of appellant’s mental state, the nature of his questions to the detectives on cross-examination, and the range of alternative interpretations of the statements convince us that the trial counsel pursued a reasonable trial strategy.</p>
    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[188,1032,1150,560]]]'>Appellant’s second allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel focuses upon the preparation and presentation of the insanity defense at trial. We do not adopt the Commonwealth’s position that this claim has not been preserved for review. We agree that issues, though raised in a PCHA petition, which are not pursued at the time of the hearing are waived. <em>Commonwealth v. Bowen, </em><a href="/pa/455/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="455 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="582213" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0152-01">455 Pa. 152</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%2024" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="314 A.2d 24">314 A.2d 24</a> (1974). In the instant case, however, appellant’s PCHA counsel asked questions that related to each of this argument’s components, as set out in the PCHA petition, and thereby preserved the issue for review.</p>

In his PCHA petition appellant referred to oral statements he made to arresting officers. At the PCHA hearing his counsel stated that the lack-of-suppression-motion argument was specifically directed to the November 11th statement given to Detective Jennings rather than to the November 14th statement given to Detective Zener, but contradicted himself moments later. Appellant’s brief to this Court refers only to an “inculpatory statement.” The substance of the November 11th statement given to Detective Jennings was that on the night of November 10th appellant and his wife had an argument; that he strangled her with his hands, with a beach towel, and finally with a dog chain; that he loved his wife and felt he had been choking her with his love; and that God would do what He thought was right. Both the statement to Detective Jennings and the November 14th statement to Detective Zener recounted how he had choked his wife previously on November 5th but had stopped when he came to his senses and realized what he was doing.</p>
