Following the denial of post-verdict motions, appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than five years nor more than ten years. This appeal ensues.</p>
    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.7",563,[204,723,1149,570]]]'>The facts which led to the prosecution in this case are briefly stated below. On January 6, 1979, David William Ludwig was standing at a bar in the Sheraton Inn in Monroeville, Pennsylvania. Appellant approached Ludwig from the rear, swung him around with his left hand and proceeded to stab him in the neck with a knife held in his right hand. Thereafter, appellant turned and walked away when the victim threw a drink at him. Immediately, appellant returned and lunged at the victim’s chest with his right hand. Ludwig died later that night from a stab wound to the chest.</p>
    <p id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.8",563,[203,1322,1148,409]]]'>Five issues have been raised on this direct appeal. Initially, appellant contends that the Commonwealth’s evidence was too contradictory to support the verdict. Specifically, he claims that the testimony of the Commonwealth’s primary witness was so contrary to the physical facts as stated by the Commonwealth’s pathologist that the verdict was the result of surmise and conjecture by the jury and must be overruled.</p>
    <p id="b563-7" data-blocks='[["BL_563.9",563,[202,1761,1149,308]]]'>In support of his argument, appellant highlights the testimony of an eye-witness. First, the witness testified that appellant approached the victim, grabbed the victim’s shirt with his left hand, and stabbed the victim’s neck in a downward fashion with the knife in his right hand. In describing this action, the witness testified:</p>
    <blockquote id="b563-8" data-blocks='[["BL_563.10",563,[244,2086,1105,141]]]'>“When he [appellant] pulled him [the victim] forward, he brought the knife up and straight down into, like into the side of his neck area on the man’s left side.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b564-8" data-blocks='[["BL_564.8",564,[242,1082,1150,557]]]'>This principle extends to testimony proffered by expert witnesses as well. <em>Commonwealth v.

Nonetheless, a jury will not be permitted to return a finding where the evidence offered to support a verdict is so unreliable and/or contradictory as to make the verdict based thereon pure conjecture. <em>Commonwealth v. Farquharson, </em><a href="/pa/467/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="467 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1717363" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0050-01">467 Pa. 50</a>, <a href="/pa/467/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="467 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1717363" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0050-01">354 A.2d 545</a> (1976). Appellant contends that the above two quotes were inescapably in conflict and made it “impossible for the fact-finder to determine guilt without relying on surmise or conjecture.”</p>
    <p id="b564-9" data-blocks='[["BL_564.9",564,[242,1667,1148,350]]]'>In support of his position, appellant mistakenly relies upon <em>Commonwealth v.

In that case, the testimony in conflict concerned uncontrovertible physical facts. Consequently, the police officer’s testimony that he observed the defendant exiting a certain door had to be rejected when the door was proven to be locked.</p>
    <p id="b564-10" data-blocks='[["BL_564.10",564,[242,2048,1148,306]],["BL_565.1",565,[195,288,1148,412]]]'>Herein, the testimony which appellant so vehemently characterizes as conflicting does not involve so absolute and unswerving a factual issue as the locked door in <em>Santana. </em>Rather, we are faced with a wound to the neck which admittedly could have been inflicted from two directions. Because the pathologist’s testimony concerning the wound <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>could be consonant with the eye-witness’ account, we cannot find that a verdict based thereon would be pure conjecture. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Farquharson, <a href="/pa/467/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="467 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1717363" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0050-01">supra.</a> </em>To do so would be to impinge upon the jury’s responsibility to reconcile conflicts in the testimony. <em>Commonwealth v. Kearney, </em><a href="/pa/459/0603-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="459 Pa. 603" data-case-ids="481070" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0603-01">459 Pa. 603</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0603-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="459 Pa. 603" data-case-ids="481070" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0603-01">331 A.2d 156</a> (1975). The instant conflict is easily subject to reconciliation, and falls well within the jury’s province as the trier of fact.</p>
    <p id="b565-5" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[194,721,1149,519]]]'>Furthermore, any conflict concerning this issue cannot be attributed sufficient weight so as to invalidate a jury verdict. Herein, the evidence of the neck wound was not the sole basis for the conviction. In fact, this wound was considered to be a superficial one, and did not contribute to or cause the victim’s death. The wound to the chest was the fatal wound and the verified cause of death. A contradiction, even if it were not so easily resolved, concerning an incidental wound could not transform an otherwise sound verdict into “pure conjecture.”</p>
    <p id="b565-6" data-blocks='[["BL_565.6",565,[195,1263,1149,253]]]'>Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in denying his requested point for charge regarding the law on inconsistent testimony.

Not only did defense counsel never request such instructions, but he then specifically denied that he had any objections to the charge when so questioned by the Court. Later, he again stated that he was satisfied with the further instructions given to the jury upon their request for additional information on the offenses with which appellant was charged. Here again, appellant attempts to assign error to the trial judge based upon the jury charge when appellant himself failed to comply with the mandate of Pa.R.Crim.P. 1119(a) and (b).

The final remark to which appellant objects is a quote attributed to police intelligence that prior to the stabbing, the victim had been summoned to the bar by appellant to discuss a debt which the victim owed. The newspaper article revealed that the information about the debt could not be presented to the jury because of insufficient proof.</p>

The conduct of the prosecution must be independently reviewed under the bright light of judicial scrutiny to determine if there existed a high probability that prejudice to appellant would, in fact, result from the comments. Only then would we categorize the District Attorney’s statements as inherently prejudicial.</p>

The isolated pre-trial remark and the post-trial comments did not consist of the type of emotionally-charged and inflammatory exposure observed in <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, supra, </em>nor did it rise to the level of publicity which inundated the trial in <em>Estes. </em>The presumption of prejudice which appellant would have us find requires the presence of exceptional circumstances. <em>Commonwealth v. Sutton, </em><a href="/pa/485/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="485 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1755517" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0047-01">485 Pa. 47</a>, <a href="/pa/485/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="485 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1755517" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0047-01">400 A.2d 1305</a> (1979). In <em>Pierce, </em>the defendant was subjected to extensive pre-trial public scrutiny and criticism. <em>Estes </em>contained sustained and pervasive pre-trial and trial publicity via media coverage. We have before us in the present case isolated comments dealing with peripheral aspects of the trial. Significantly, most of them were published after the trial. In the past, we <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>have held that even extensive pre-trial publicity does not absolutely preclude a fair and impartial trial, <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[274,601,1151,777]]]'>As noted above, the majority of the comments herein, unlike <em>Estes </em>and <em>Pierce, </em>were post-trial. Appellant’s only claim to prejudice would therefore be in reference to his sentencing. The post-trial comments contributed little, if any, to the sentencing judge’s knowledge of the case, especially since he had been exposed to all relevant facts at the time of trial. Just as a juror can “lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in Court,” <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em><a href="/us/366/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="366 U.S. 717" data-case-ids="1285471" data-case-paths="/us/366/0717-01">366 U.S. 717</a>, 722-723, <a href="/us/366/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="366 U.S. 717" data-case-ids="1285471" data-case-paths="/us/366/0717-01">81 S.Ct. 1639</a>, 1642, <a href="/us/366/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="366 U.S. 717" data-case-ids="1285471" data-case-paths="/us/366/0717-01">6 L.Ed.2d 751</a> (1961), so too can a judge disregard any potentially prejudicial information which may come to his attention prior to sentencing. We consequently find that appellant’s right to a fair trial was in no way jeopardized by the prosecution and no prejudice will be inferred from the pre-trial and post-trial publicity.</p>
