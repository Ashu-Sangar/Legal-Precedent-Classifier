Thus, medical opinion need only demonstrate, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that a defendant’s conduct <em>increased the risk </em>of the harm actually sustained, and the jury then must decide whether that conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm. <em>Gradel v.

Thus, the jury was precluded from deciding whether or not appellees’ conduct increased the risk of the harm which was <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>in fact sustained, and, if so, whether or not the increased risk was a substantial factor in producing the harm.

Undoubtedly, an unsuccessful effort to prove that appellees’ conduct was the direct and only cause of harm might well have succeeded in persuading the jury that appellees’ conduct <em>at least </em>increased the risk of the particular harm inflicted and was a substantial factor in bringing it about. Section 323(a) was designed to <em>relax </em>a plaintiff’s burden of proving causation, not to compound it.

Appellees’ witness, Dr. Hubbard of Montefiore Hospital, testified that prognosis after metastasis to a lymph <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>node is not as favorable as if metastasis had not occurred.

As explained at trial, when surgeons seek to locate a mass on a woman’s breast, they divide the breast into quadrants and use the hands of a clock as reference points. A principal issue at trial was whether the material removed was the mass at 12:30, as Dr. Kaufer testified, or the mass at 6:30, as appellants and Lousie Rodgers, a nurse and friend of Mrs. Jones, testified.</p>

Although appellants’ submission generally paraphrased Section 323(a), the specific wording requested would unduly restrict the discretion of the jury, since it instructs that once a defendant’s negligence is found to have increased the risk of the harm suffered by a plaintiff, liability <em>must </em>follow. This misconstrues the function of the jury as contemplated by Section 323(a). Once the medical testimony has demonstrated, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that a defendant’s conduct <em>increased the risk </em>that the harm sustained by a plaintiff would occur, even though it has not demonstrated that such conduct alone <em>caused </em>that harm, Section 323(a) requires the jury to decide whether or not “to <em>go further </em>and find that such increased risk was in turn a <em>substantial factor </em>in bringing about the resultant harm.” <em>Hamil v.
