(Where counsel is not available to explain his course of conduct, a reviewing court shall look to the record to determine whether there was any reasonable basis for his action). That review has uncovered no evidence whatsoever, outside of appellant’s assertion, indicating that defense counsel was made aware prior to the guilty plea proceeding of Joe’s decision to recant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Moreover, appellant totally ignores the existence of the incriminating statements of Tolver and Richardson given to police not long after the murder. In his statement, Tolver related that shortly before the shooting, he had seen appellant display a gun in the poolroom and that immediately after the shooting, he heard Joe ask appellant for the gun, but appellant refused to give it to him. He also related that when police arrived, the gun was thrown under a mailbox and that appellant must have thrown it since “. . . he [was] the only one who had it.” Likewise, in his statement, Richardson confirmed that appellant had the gun immediately after the shooting, and added that, at that time, he heard appellant say, “We got one.” Richardson also acknowledged hearing some talk about the gun in the poolroom a short time before the shooting.</p>

Furthermore, we note that when Joe finally did recant his prior statement at the guilty plea proceeding, the presiding judge found his testimony so contradictory and confusing that he held him in contempt of court (N.T. 3/22/66, 40). Surely, it is reasonable to assume that defense counsel, if he were aware of Joe’s decision to recant, was, like the judge, cognizant of the dubious nature of that recantation. <em>See Commonwealth v. Gaddy, </em><a href="/pa/492/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="492 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="1767198" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0434-01">492 Pa. 434</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="424 A.2d 1268" data-case-ids="1767192,1767198" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0433-01,/pa/492/0434-01">424 A.2d 1268</a> (1981).

Furthermore, in the District Attorney’s file there was a copy of a letter written by the prosecutor to defense counsel indicating that witnesses’ statements had been sent to the defense.</p>
