Michael Reed and his companion, Calvin Hill, were visiting a friend in the 1600 block of South Ringgold Street in the City of Philadelphia. Michael and Calvin left their friend’s home at about 3:30 in the afternoon and proceeded to walk south on Ringgold Street. After walking a short distance Michael yelled, “Run.” Calvin in response turned and saw appellant and a Michael Williams, both of whom he knew, approaching them. Appellant pointed a gun at Michael and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired. Appellant and Williams continued to pursue the decedent and Calvin Hill. During that chase, appellant fatally shot Michael Reed in the back. When Michael fell to the ground, appellant repeatedly kicked him as Williams stood nearby. Appellant and Williams then fled from the scene. These events were also witnessed by a Mr. Keith Shepherd.</p>

This direct appeal followed.</p>

Reviewing the totality of the circumstances there is nothing to indicate in this record either that the witness was mistaken in his testimony that appellant looked liked one of the two men he had seen or that this conclusion was compelled by the circumstances of the preliminary hearing. Moreover, appellant had the opportunity to present to the jury the witness’s reaction to the confrontation that occurred during the defense’s investigation. Considering all of these factors we are satisfied that the demands of a fair trial did not require the exclusion of Mr. Shepherd’s in-court identification testimony.

Appellant argues that these questions were designed to impugn the integrity of his counsel and to improperly suggest that the witness’s failure to identify Floyd on this occasion should have been ignored because of the impropriety of the event. For these reasons, it is asserted that the actions by the attorney for the Commonwealth constituted prosecutorial misconduct and that the request for a mistrial made by the defense at trial should have been granted.</p>

However, both sides have the responsibility of conducting their investigation in such a manner that innocent potential witnesses are not unnecessarily exposed to retaliation or intimidation. Without commenting upon the wisdom of the instant procedure, we are satisfied that the effect of the Commonwealth’s questioning in this regard did no more than to attempt to suggest the possible intimidation present to explain Mr. Shepherd’s motive for failing to identify appellant under the circumstances.</p>

For this reason we agree that the motion for mistrial was properly refused.

We are <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>satisfied that the learned trial judge wisely exercised his discretion in a most difficult situation. Here the occasion for counsel’s participation arose late in the trial. Counsel in fact took the stand after two weeks of trial. The court was faced with a decision of either preventing counsel from testifying, in which event the defense would have been denied the only witness available to prove the point at issue, or creating the present situation by allowing his testimony. Obviously, faced with these two options, the decision to allow counsel to testify was in appellant’s best interest.</p>
    <p id="b687-4" data-blocks='[["BL_687.5",687,[178,865,1152,788]]]'>Appellant concedes that it was in the best interest of the defense that counsel elected to take the stand. “Indeed, it was proper for counsel to take the stand and, in fact, mandatory to protect his client’s interest.” Appellant’s brief, page 26. However, it is now argued, when the need for counsel’s participation became apparent appellant’s motion for a mistrial should have been granted. Counsel was the last witness in a relatively protracted trial. The subject matter of counsel’s testimony was directed to a collateral issue and did not go to the heart of the case. The acceptance or rejection of his testimony by the jury was not necessarily critical to the decision to be reached in the matter. Under these circumstances, the decision to continue with the trial and to reject the requested motion for a mistrial was clearly reasonable.</p>
    <p id="b687-5" data-blocks='[["BL_687.6",687,[175,1675,1152,576]],["BL_688.1",688,[235,323,1151,625]]]'>When counsel concluded his testimony,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the court directed counsel to resume his role as appellant’s trial attorney. The question thus arises whether appellant was prejudiced. In considering the matter we must review the options open to the court at that point. We have already indicated that the court properly concluded that the trial should not have been aborted. Thus two alternatives were present. First, to recess the trial until new trial counsel could prepare to undertake the task of concluding the trial; second, to proceed as the trial court here decided. The problems involved in the first option are evident. Since <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>counsel was the last witness, new counsel would have been required to familiarize himself with virtually a complete trial record before he could undertake the summation to the jury. During this period, the jury would be subject to distractions and a diminution of their recollection of the testimony that had been presented to them. Despite new counsel’s good faith effort to familiarize himself with the record, he could not possibly obtain the flavor of the trial from a cold record. Weighing the pitfalls involved in the first alternative, we accept the trial court’s judgment in directing that original counsel should have been permitted to present closing arguments.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Appellant further contends the trial court erred: (1) in commencing jury selection prior to the disposition of a pre-trial motion to suppress identification in order to meet the requirements of Rule 1100; (2) in ruling that the prosecution could question appellant’s proposed character witness concerning appellant’s earlier, unrelated arrest for murder while a juvenile; in confining appellant to the face of the arrest and/or search warrant in eliciting testimony as to a determina<a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>tion of probable cause; (4) in instructing the jury on flight, without a definition of flight; and (5) in refusing to arrest the judgment of sentence for criminal conspiracy on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence or because the alleged co-conspirator was acquitted before appellant was sentenced. After a thorough review of the briefs and record in this case, we have concluded that these contentions of appellant are without merit.</p>
