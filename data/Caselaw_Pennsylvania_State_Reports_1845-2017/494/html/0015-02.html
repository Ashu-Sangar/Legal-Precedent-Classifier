    <p id="b157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_157.7",157,[195,968,1154,1388]]]'>At issue is the extent to which a court presiding over a rape trial may authorize counsel for the accused seeking to impeach the credibility of the complainant to inspect a rape crisis center file containing communications between the complainant and rape crisis center personnel. Appellant asks this Court to expand the common law of this Commonwealth to create an absolute privilege for all communications between PAAR personnel and persons seeking PAAR’s assistance. Although we recognize the important societal interest in promoting such communications, we also recognize the compelling societal interest in the truth-seeking function of our system of criminal justice. In harmony with both the societal interest in promoting PAAR communications and the societal interest in the truth-seeking function of our criminal justice system, and consistent with the views of amicus Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and amicus Women Organized Against Rape, we hold that upon defense request a court should authorize defense inspection of only those statements of the complainant contained in the file which bear on the facts of the alleged offense. The court, however, must not permit defense inspection of statements of the complainant having no bearing on the facts of the alleged offense and relating instead only to the counselling services PAAR provides. The trial court shall not permit defense review of any other aspect of the file.</p>

As I believe the majority’s resolution of this issue is correct, I join in the majority opinion. While refusing to create an absolute privilege, the majority nevertheless does not allow the defendant complete access to appellant’s files; the majority, however, fails, in my view, to adequately explain why only limited inspection is to be allowed. In my view, those portions of appellant’s files which must remain confidential must remain so because of the victim’s right to privacy. Hence, this concurring opinion.</p>

There is, for the victim, threat and actuality of physical harm that may cover the spectrum from bruises to maiming and death. In addition, there is the acute and severe loss of control by the victim over her circumstances. Furthermore, there is intrusion into her privacy in the most intensely personal way imaginable. As a result of the trauma of rape there are many different emotional reactions. Commonly one will find fear and panic based on what has actually happened or based on what might be imagined to happen as the result of a repeated attack. In addition, the individual may well feel shame and guilt over having been unable to prevent or stop the attack. Anger is a very common reaction and in addition there may be confusion. Very frequently the individual will have a period of depression, often occurring after an apparent period of stability. The range of short term and long lasting effects involves a number of mental disorders including, in rare individuals, the onset of psychosis, more commonly recognized as a “nervous breakdown”. It is common experience that some of the more severe and long lasting disorders will frequently require long periods of psychiatric care and can be manifested by significant disability for the individual. A common aspect of rape is that the victim often feels isolated and helpless during and immediately after the episode.... During this phase a frequent phenomenon is that guilt and shame will make it quite difficult for the individual immediately to establish the ability to express herself completely.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.6",179,[272,1384,1105,626]]]'>I believe that an honest analysis of the situation will reflect that the protective [media] shield placed around the rape victim results from a desire to deflect the special shame which is seen to attach only to victims of sexual crimes. Unlike the victims of any other crime, they are somehow suspected by society of being partially guilty; they are imagined to have contributed to the crime through some form of explicit or implicit seduction, or simply by not being as careful as they should have been. That these assumptions and suspicions are, in virtually all rape convictions, unwarranted, does not remove them from the conscious or subconscious minds of many.</blockquote>

Rarely is a robbery, or even assault, victim traumatized over possible contributory behavior. Certainly no social rebuke is forthcoming for the usual non-rape victim — society will not look askance at that victim (unless he/she were the aggressor) and ask what he/she did to “invite” the crime.</p>

The benefits of counseling to a rape victim are not just limited to the victim but inure to the benefit of those in these relationships with her, and unless the victims are encouraged and provided with an opportunity for therapy, many women and their relationships will be mere “shells.” The legal recognition of a testimonial privilege for communications made between the rape victim and her rape crisis counselor is the judicial vehicle to provide and foster this needed rehabilitation and attendant hope.</p>

We concluded, in <em>In re B, </em>“in Pennsylvania, an individual’s interest in preventing the disclosure of information revealed in the context of a psychotherapist-patient relationship ... is constitutionally based.” <a href="/pa/482/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="482 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="1749586" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0471-01">482 Pa. at 484</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="482 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="1749586" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0471-01">394 A.2d at 425</a>. <em>See also Hawaii Psychiatric Society v.

It is knowledge of private and personal matters by another that is offensive — not that the knowledge may or may not continue on a course of travel to yet another eager ear.” <em>In re June 1979 Allegheny County Investigating Grand Jury, </em><a href="/pa/490/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="490 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1763827" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0143-01">490 Pa. 143</a>, 154, <a href="/pa/490/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="490 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1763827" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0143-01">415 A.2d 73</a>, 79 (1980) (from dissenting opinion of Justice Rolf Larsen). This breach is no less severe because an inspection of the confidential communication has been made <em>in camera. </em>Under the procedure required by the majority, the confidential disclosures would be made available to the trial court, and at that moment, the confidence is broken, the trust in the relationship is shattered. And, the more sensitive the nature of the communication, the greater the need for protection.</p>
    <p id="b199-4" data-blocks='[["BL_199.4",199,[214,1194,1149,866]]]'>Moreover, even if the victim consents to letting the trial court view the crisis center records, what assurance does she have that it won’t go beyond? If the court should determine that no information is available to the defense counsel, counsel will surely appeal the adverse ruling. As the inspection is <em>in camera </em>and without the participation of counsel, such an appeal would be almost automatic as counsel would have no other means of verifying the validity of the trial court’s secret ruling. This appeal would necessitate transmittal of the records to the appellate court. Thus at least three more judges (a three judge panel of Superior Court) and their staff will have access to the confidential communications and will be required to review them. Further appeal is also quite possible and could result in review by seven members of this Court and their respective staffs which includes secretaries and law clerks.</p>

I submit that the majority’s <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>limitation will be difficult to apply. When the victim ruminates “I don’t know. Maybe my dress was too tight. Maybe it was my fault” in a state of depression and shame, is that a statement bearing only on the facts of the offense, or a statement “reflecting counseling”? Surely the defense counsel would argue such statements are of “facts” relevant to the defense of consent. Many courts might err in favor of the defendant. It matters not that an appellate court later holds that the communications were <em>not </em>statements relating only to the facts — the damage would have been done and would be irreversible. This breach of privacy is intolerable, for no therapeutic relationship can even begin when there exists the threat of any breach of privacy or of confidence.</p>
    <p id="b200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[236,1123,1148,807]]]'>It is also important to remember that in almost all of the cases cited by the majority, one side or the other (the plaintiff/prosecution or the defendant) had information, or access to information, which the other side did not. In such situations, the majority is rightly concerned with unnecessary “gamesmanship” which should not play a part in the outcome of a prosecution. Here, it has been made clear that PAAR has not revealed — and <em>never does reveal </em>— the victim’s communications to law enforcement officials. <em>All </em>rape crisis centers withhold their confidential communications with the victim from law enforcement agencies. Where the prosecution has received no benefit from the victim/counsel- or relationship (except incidental benefits in having a more stable witness), the majority’s fears of “gamesmanship” are exaggerated and unwarranted.</p>
