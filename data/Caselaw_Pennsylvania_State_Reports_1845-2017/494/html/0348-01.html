Everson had so commingled his separate and community assets that the court was unable to segregate or trace any separate funds or assets.

The court of appeals ruled there was no basis for the trial court’s conclusion on remand that all of the couple’s assets were community property. Thus, it reversed Rosanne Everson’s award of $367,961 for her share of Visioneering stock and found that all the Visioneering stock was the separate property of her former husband. However, it affirmed the valuation of his pension and distribution to Rosanne Everson of one-half that amount.

During the proceedings in Pennsylvania the Maricopa County Superior Court judgment dated January 25, 1977, was on appeal to the Arizona Court of Appeals. As noted earlier, the Lehigh County court denied Robert Everson’s request to stay enforcement of the Arizona judgment by Pennsylvania since he had failed to post bond, with surety, in the amount of $500,000, which was required to stay proceedings in Arizona.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> After allocatur was granted and oral argument advanced in this Court, the Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the January 25, 1977 order which has been contested all along in Pennsylvania.

Moreover, he argues that this Court should not be required to take into consideration the intervening Arizona appellate court decisions where neither the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas nor the Superior <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>Court of Pennsylvania had an opportunity to review them. Appellee maintains that while the intervening decisions may require certain modifications in the amount of the money judgment which can be made by the Lehigh County court, they do not affect the underlying validity of the January 25, 1977 judgment.

    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.6",496,[232,1050,1154,738]]]'>Ordinarily a judgment for the payment of money will not be enforced in another state unless it is a final judgment for a specific amount of money. However, a judgment may be final under the local law of the state of rendition as to some matters and yet not final as to other matters. Thus, it may have been finally determined that the judgment creditor should succeed in his claim but decision may not have been reached as to the amount of recovery. In such a case the judgment debtor will be precluded from contesting his liability to the plaintiff, but judgment will not be enforced in a second state until the amount of judgment has been finally determined. <em>See </em>30 Am.Jur.2d <em>Executions </em>§§ 5, 9 (1967); Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws §§ 107-108 (1971).</p>

However, the mere fact that a party has made a motion in the trial court to vacate the judgment and to grant a new trial or to modify the judgment or enter a new judgment does not deprive the judgment of its conclusive effect in another action between the parties. Where an execution is issued under a judgment which is subsequently amended or modified, regularity may be imparted to the execution by an amendment of the judgment on which it is based and by its <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>entry <em>nunc pro tunc.

Restatement of Judgments § 41 (1942). If, by the local law of the state of rendition, the appeal does not vacate the judgment action will lie on the judgment in another state. Usually, however, the courts of the state in which enforcement of the judgment is sought will either stay their judgment, or stay execution thereof, pending the determination of the appeal. Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws §§ 107, 112 (1971).</p>
    <p id="b497-6" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[179,1098,1150,418]]]'>The judgment sought to be enforced in this case was final as to Robert W. Everson’s liability but the amount of Rosanne Everson’s entitlement had not been finally determined. Under Arizona law the taking of an appeal does not operate to vacate the judgment, nor are proceedings stayed pending appeal unless the requisite bond is posted. Thus, action on the January 25,1977 Arizona judgment in Pennsylvania was not precluded by the pending appeal in Arizona.</p>
    <p id="b497-7" data-blocks='[["BL_497.7",497,[178,1543,1153,571]]]'>More particularly, enforcement of the judgment in Pennsylvania was authorized by the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 4306, which provides that at any time after the filing of a foreign judgment, a levy may be made on any property of the judgment debtor subject to execution regardless of whether final judgment has been obtained. The judgment debtor may preclude such execution upon a showing that an appeal will be taken and that he has furnished adequate security for satisfaction of the judgment.

The intervening decisions of the Arizona Court of Appeals may result in the award to appellee of an amount of money substantially different from the amount awarded by the January 25, 1977 judgment. Therefore, on remand we direct the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas to enter a stay of execution until such time as the Maricopa County Superior Court has complied with the mandate of the Arizona Court of Appeals and entered a new judgment.

    <p id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[248,1069,1153,685]]]'>Second, appellants argue that the 1973 Arizona judgment precludes execution against appellant’s trust property. The original Arizona decree entered in 1973 specifically ruled that appellant’s interest in the testamentary trust was created prior to his marriage, and therefore, it remained his sole and separate property. Appellants argue since appellee did not contest that determination before the Arizona Court of Appeals it was res judicata and the 1977 judgment entered on remand, which ordered an equal division of specific community assets, may not be satisfied by levying against appellant’s sole and separate Pennsylvania property. In effect, appellants argue that appellee may not do indirectly what she could not do directly.</p>
    <p id="b500-7" data-blocks='[["BL_500.6",500,[246,1781,1150,578]]]'>Once again we note that the judgment entered in Lehigh County pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act does not purport to stand for the proposition that the trust is community property, nor is its validity dependent in any way upon whether the trust is viewed as community or sole and separate property. The judgment was transferred to Pennsylvania and execution levied thereon for the purpose of satisfying a judgment for the payment of money and the 1973 judgment is irrelevant to this case. In rejecting appellants’ claim, we note with approval the trial court’s reasoning.</p>

The judgment is for the payment of money, and the only way it can possibly be enforced is by execution against defendant’s property. If the law were as defendant contends, there would be no possible way in which plaintiff could enforce the judgment in a state which did not have a community property law. This . . . is not the law. Indeed, we find nothing to recommend such a view.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[184,983,1151,685]]]'>Finally, appellants raise two related issues, both of which became moot after allocatur was granted in this case. First, they contend that judgment on the pleadings was improperly entered against garnishee-appellant, Walter A. Everson, since a genuine issue of material fact remained to be determined. Next, they maintain that appellant’s interest in the trust is contingent and, therefore, not subject to attachment execution since the language of the trust instrument permitted alternative dispositions by the trustee with the possibility of a divestiture. Thus, they argue, the unresolved issue which should have precluded judgment on the pleadings was whether appellant’s interest in the trust was, in fact, contingent or vested.</p>
    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.6",501,[184,1685,1153,578]]]'>We are not required to decide these issues since the garnishee-trustee died on July 19, 1979. Clearly, at that time appellant’s interest in his mother’s estate vested inasmuch as the instrument provided for termination of the trust and distribution of the res in equal shares to her two sons upon the death of the trustee. Thus, appellee is entitled to levy execution on appellant’s vested remainder interest in the trust following a determination of the amount of that interest by the Orphans’ Court and transfer of the new judgment by the Maricopa County Superior Court to Lehigh County.</p>
