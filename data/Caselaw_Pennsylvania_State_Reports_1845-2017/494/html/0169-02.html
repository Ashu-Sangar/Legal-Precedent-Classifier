    <p id="b308-13" data-blocks='[["BL_308.12",308,[230,1554,1150,577]]]'>Appellant Derek Woodson was convicted in a bench trial of murder of the third degree, two counts of aggravated assault, conspiracy and various weapons offenses. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to prison terms of five to twenty years for the murder conviction, two and one-half to five years for each of the assault convictions, and five to ten years for the conspiracy conviction. Appellant was also given a five year probationary term for the weapons offenses, said term to begin at the expiration of the prison term imposed for the murder conviction. No direct appeal was initially taken.</p>
