In this case the jury reached a verdict. Because of the presently complained of conduct on the part of the prosecution, this Court on direct appeal granted appellant a new trial, <em>Commonwealth v.

In my judgment, this result is legally untenable and permits a grave travesty upon justice. Prosecutorial misconduct may reach the point where due process would require the foreclosure of a subsequent trial for the same charges, however, such a point has not been reached in this case and the remedy of the award of the new <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>trial adequately protected appellant from the prosecutorial misconduct that has been cited.</p>
    <p id="b740-5" data-blocks='[["BL_740.4",740,[270,413,1152,829]]]'>The Court’s error stems from its persistent refusal to recognize that prosecutorial misconduct is generally a due process concern and not a matter of double jeopardy. This confusion arises from the misreading of <em>U.S. v. Dinitz, </em><a href="/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%2060" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="424 U.S. 60">424 U.S. 60</a>, <a href="/us/424/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="96 S.

In <em>Dinitz </em>prosecutorial misconduct became important in a double jeopardy context where that conduct prevented the tribunal from reaching a verdict. The finality of the adjudicative process is a double jeopardy concern. The fact of the prosecutorial misconduct was significant in <em>Dinitz </em>only because it occasioned the interruption of the trial. In contra-distinction, due process is concerned with the fairness of the proceedings and trial error such as prosecutorial misconduct strikes at the very heart of the fairness and impartiality of the proceeding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>This distinction is much more than a quibble over the appropriate analysis to address a specific wrong. Because double jeopardy has at its heart the concept of finality, the remedy for a violation thereof precludes further prosecution. On the other hand, where the asserted error relates to the fairness of the initial proceeding, in most instances, adequate relief can be given by providing the opportunity for a second trial free of that error. Here we are concerned with trial error which affected the fairness of the trial. Appellant received the full remedy to which he was entitled when he was awarded a new trial. The Opinion in Support of Reversal’s gratuitous grant of the greater remedy of discharge is not necessitated by the nature of the harm and abandons the societal interest in just determination in criminal matters.</p>

Even before the accused sought to present his alibi defense, supported by the sister of the victim, the Commonwealth’s case had already been weakened by both the suppression of statements obtained while appellant was beaten by a police officer and the inability of the Commonwealth’s sole eyewitness to identify appellant. The circumstantial proof which remained, primarily resting on the testimony of three persons placing appellant at or near the scene before the killing, had been undermined by defense counsel’s cross-examination pointing out serious flaws in the Commonwealth witnesses’ identification testimony. Faced with this fragile case, the prosecutor’s response was to engage in repeated acts of misconduct. This misconduct included gratuitous and prejudicial remarks in questioning the victim’s sister. It included an inquiry concerning the accused’s religious affiliation which, despite his representations of relevancy, the prosecutor never sought to justify.
