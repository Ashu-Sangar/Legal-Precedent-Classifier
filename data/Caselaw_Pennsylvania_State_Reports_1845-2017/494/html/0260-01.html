Appellant, Elgin L. Thornton, raises one claim of error: that the trial court, over defense objection, improperly admitted an oral statement made by the victim on the evening before the killing. The trial court ruled the statement admissible on the ground that it was within the “state of mind” exception to the rule against hearsay. We conclude that, because the victim’s state of mind was not a factor in issue, the statement was immaterial and irrelevant to the prosecution’s case and thus appellant’s objection should have been sustained. We also conclude that, when the statement is considered for its substantive truth, although material and relevant to the issue of appellant’s intent to kill, the statement could not have reasonably contributed to the jury’s verdict. Since we find the erroneous admission of the statement to be harmless error we affirm. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s sister and mother were also present. After discovering that Moore was carrying a gun, the police arrested him and then took him to the police station for booking. Although a police officer testified that there was no evidence of physical injury, appellant’s sister and mother both testified that they had been hit by Moore. They further testified that after Moore and the police had left, appellant’s brother Benny Thornton drove them to a hospital for emergency room treatment.</p>

Approximately twenty minutes later another acquaintance, Mike Dean, arrived with a message from Benny Thornton that Moore was at a neighborhood school.

Appellant testified that Moore “was turning on <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>me like he was going for a gun, so I just shot.” Noel Thomas, who had approached the school on foot, shot Moore in the leg with a pistol.

It is true that the declaration perhaps tends to establish that the victim, Moore, was fearful of the Thorntons. However, the victim’s state of mind was not a matter in issue in the case. It was appellant’s state of mind, not that of the victim, which was material to establish the degree of guilt, if any, on the charge of criminal homicide. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

During this time appellant sought <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>out the victim, first by going to a street corner where he believed Moore to be, and then by going to the school where Moore was found and killed. In addition to this evidence of premeditation, there was also undisputed evidence that a companion of appellant who had been riding in the same car approached the school from the side and shot Moore in the leg.</p>
    <p id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[251,735,1150,477]]]'>The only evidence to support appellant’s theories of self-defense and provocation was his own self-serving testimony that he was “upset” at the beating of his sister and mother by Larry Moore, and that when he shot Moore he thought Moore “was going for a gun.” This testimony in no respect establishes the requisite elements of self-defense. See 18 Pa.C.S. § 505. Nor on this record does this testimony, even if believed, establish sufficient provocation to reduce the killing to voluntary manslaughter.</p>
