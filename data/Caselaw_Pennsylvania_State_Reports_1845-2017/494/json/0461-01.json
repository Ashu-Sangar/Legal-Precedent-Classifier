        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nAppellant Callahan was a member of the Pennsylvania State Police and was classified \u201ctemporarily disabled\u201d under the Heart and Lung Act which entitled him to his full salary as long as he remained in that status. The State Police Medical Officer and an official in the State Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund unilaterally determined that his disability was no longer temporary but permanent and that he was not entitled to the Heart and Lung benefits. On January 5, 1978 Mr. Callahan received a letter from the Bureau of Personnel of the Pennsylvania State Police informing him that as of February 22, 1978 all benefits which he had been receiving under provisions of the \u201cHeart and Lung Act\u201d would be terminated. 53 P.S. \u00a7 637 (Supp. 1981-82).\nAppellant immediately requested a hearing. Without being afforded the requested hearing, his benefits were terminated on February 22, 1978. On March 3, 1978, he filed a \u201cpetition for review\u201d in the Commonwealth Court. On appellee\u2019s motion, the Commonwealth Court quashed the petition as untimely. Subsequently allocatur was granted and this appeal followed.\nThe Commonwealth Court held that the letter of January 5, 1978 informing appellant that his disability status would be changed from temporary to permanent was an adjudication pursuant to 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.2(a) because it announced a final determination of his property rights. The court reasoned that whether the petition for review invoked its original or its appellate jurisdiction, the result would be the same. It held that because the letter was an adjudication and therefore invoked the court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, an appeal was required within 30 days. Since the appeal was filed more than 30 days after January 5, 1978, the Commonwealth Court entered an order quashing it as untimely.\nThe court further concluded that if the action instituted by appellant was to be construed as an invocation of its original jurisdiction then that action would be barred because of the availability of the appeal from the adjudication. Thus original jurisdiction would be precluded because of the failure of appellant to proceed through the administrative process.\nThe key to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding was its judgment that the letter of January 5, 1978 constituted an adjudication. Appellant argues that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s ruling that the letter was an adjudication offends the requirements of procedural due process. Appellant\u2019s position is obviously correct but, in addition thereto, it is also clear that the letter in question did not comply with an adjudication as required by the terms of the Administrative Agency Law.\nThe Administrative Agency Law expressly requires an agency to supply an aggrieved party notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard. Section 1710.31 provides:\nNo adjudication shall be valid as to any party unless he shall have been afforded reasonable notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard. All testimony shall be stenographically recorded and a full and complete record should be kept of the proceedings.\nAct of June 4, 1945, P.L. 1388, \u00a7 31, 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.31.\nAdjudicatory action cannot be validly taken by any tribunal, whether judicial or administrative, except upon a hearing wherein each party has opportunity to know of the claims of his opponent, to hear the evidence introduced against him, to cross-examine witnesses, to introduce evidence on his own behalf, and to make argument. Pa. State Athletic Commission v. Bratton, 177 Pa.Super. 598, 112 A.2d 422 (1955); Byers v. Pennsylvania Publie Utility Commission, 176 Pa.Super. 620, 109 A.2d 232 (1955).\nHere, the letter of January 5, 1978 did not constitute a valid adjudication within the meaning of 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.31 because it failed to comply with the statutory requirements of notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard. The right of judicial review of an administrative decision occurs under section 1710.41 only when there has been an adjudication as defined under the Administrative Agency Law. Having concluded that the letter did not meet the Act\u2019s requirement of an adjudication, it therefore follows that the letter did not provide a basis for an appeal under section 1710.41.\nSince the letter was not a valid adjudication, the January 5, 1978 date has no legal significance. At best, it represented an expression of appellee\u2019s intention to act in a certain manner. It was not until the anticipated action was actually taken on February 22, 1978 that appellant had a legal basis to complain. In the interim, he did all that could be done, i. e., requested the opportunity to contest the proposed action. Having been denied that opportunity when the termination in fact occurred, his right to complain of that action ripened.\nWe further note that appellant in this complaint was in fact seeking the invocation of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction. The essence of his complaint is that his benefits were terminated without his having been afforded an adjudication as required by the Act. Since he is claiming that there is no adjudication, then an appeal under section 1710.41 would be inconsistent with his theory because that section conditions the right of an appeal on the existence of an adjudication. Thus if we strictly adhere to the procedural requirements of the Act in this situation, appellant\u2019s claim must be construed as an appeal to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction.\nNor does the fact of the review provided under section 1710.41 preclude his appeal to the court\u2019s original jurisdiction. There is no problem of exhaustion of remedies in this case because, as has been stated, his right of review under section 1710.41 was not available to him directly because of the conduct of which he complains.\nAccordingly, the Order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the cause is remanded to that Court to direct the Reinstatement of the order of compensation and to order the appropriate agency to conduct an administrative hearing on the question of the termination of benefits in accordance with the terms of the Administrative Agency Law.\nO\u2019BRIEN, C. J., and WILKINSON, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision in this case.\n. Act of June 28, 1935, P.L. 477, \u00a7 1, 53 P.S. \u00a7 637, as amended May 31, 1974, P.L. 309, No. 99, \u00a7 1, 53 P.S. \u00a7 637 (Supp. 1981-82).\n. (a) \u201cAdjudication means any final order, decree, decision, determination or ruling by an agency affecting personal or property rights, privileges, immunities or obligations of any or all of the parties to the proceeding in which the adjudication is made, but shall not mean any final order, decree, decision, determination or ruling based upon a proceeding before a court, or which involves the seizure or forfeiture of property, or which involves paroles or pardons.\nAct of June 4, 1945, P.L. 1388, \u00a7 2(a); 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.2(a) repealed 1978, April 28, P.L. 202, No. 53, \u00a7 2(a) [1244], effective June 27, 1978 (current version at 2 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 101).\n. Act of June 4, 1945, P.L. 1388, \u00a7 31, 71 P.S. \u00a7 1710.31 repealed, 1978, April 28, P.L. 202, No. 53, \u00a7 2(a) [1244], effective June 27, 1978 (current version at 2 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 504).\n.
