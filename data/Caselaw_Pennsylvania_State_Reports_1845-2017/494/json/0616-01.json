        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis appeal from a final decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, presents the question whether 15,667 shares of stock received by the trustee of a testamentary trust as part of a 3-for-2 stock distribution should be treated as income, as contended by appellants, or allocated to principal. The orphans\u2019 court held the distribution to be controlled by the Principal and Income Act, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8105(a), which provides:\n\u201cCorporate distributions made to a trustee in the shares of the distributing corporation, however described or designated by the distributing corporation, shall be deemed principal but if the number of shares ... is 6% or less of the number of shares . . . outstanding . . . the shares so distributed shall be deemed income.\u201d\nThe court accordingly decreed that the shares be allocated to trust principal. For the reasons set forth below, we agree and affirm.\nI.\nThe parties to this appeal, settlor\u2019s two surviving children (appellants at No. 37) and the three children of settlor\u2019s deceased son (appellants at No. 45; hereafter \u201cappellees\u201d), have stipulated to all relevant facts. Settlor William N. Reynolds, Jr., died on January 2, 1957, leaving a will and a trust agreement dated August 11, 1955. Settlor, who never married, was survived by three adopted children (his nieces and nephew), seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren. Paragraph EIGHTH of settlor\u2019s will directs that the residue of his estate be placed in trust with Miners National Bank of Wilkes-Barre (now United Penn Bank), in accordance with the trust agreement, which is incorporated into the will.\nParagraph FIRST of the trust agreement provides that the trustee shall pay trust income in equal shares to settlor\u2019s three children during their lives. Upon the death of each of these children, the principal supporting his or her one-third share of income is to be divided per capita among all living grandchildren of settlor and distributed to those who have reached age thirty-five. The share of any grandchild who has not reached the age of thirty-five at the time of such division is to be held in a separate trust until he or she becomes thirty-five. If any grandchild dies before the trust terminates, his or her issue is to receive, per stirpes, the grandchild\u2019s share of trust income and principal. The share of a grandchild who dies without issue is to be divided among the surviving grandchildren. The trust agreement does not authorize the trustee to invade principal.\nParagraph THIRD of the trust agreement provides:\n\u201cIn distinguishing between principal and income hereunder, the Trustee need not amortize premiums paid for or charged in respect of investments and shall take no account of discounts. The Trustee may so apportion between principal and income, any expenditures, which in its opinion should be apportioned, notwithstanding any legal rules to the contrary. Any and all dividends shall be considered as income. (Emphasis supplied.)\nThere is no comparable provision in the will.\nAt the time of his death in 1957, settlor, an attorney, owned 12,400 shares of the common stock of United States Fidelity and Guarantee Company (\u201cU.S.F. & G.\u201d) and had served on its Board of Directors since 1934. The stock of U.S.F. & G., a Maryland corporation, was traded over the counter from 1952 to 1970. Since July 27, 1970, it has been traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\nDuring the administration of settlor\u2019s estate and prior to the funding of the trust, U.S.F. & G. announced a 2-for-l stock split and a 10% stock dividend, resulting in an increase in the shares held by the estate to 27,280. These shares were distributed to the trustee on June 14, 1960. In 1962, 1965, and 1966, U.S.F. & G. issued stock \u201cdividends\u201d of 10%, 5%, and 10%, respectively, and in 1970 it paid a 2-for-l stock split, reducing the par value of its shares from $5.00 to $2.50. The trustee allocated the shares received in the first three distributions to income and added the shares received through the 1970 split to principal.\nSettlor\u2019s son, Stewart Reynolds, died on June 19, 1975. After the filing and confirmation of a first and partial account, to which no objections were taken, the trustee distributed one third of the trust principal, including 15,666 of the 47,000 U.S.F. & G. shares then held by the trust, to settlor\u2019s six surviving grandchildren.\nOn May 3, 1977, the trustee received an additional 15,667 shares of U.S.F. & G. stock, together with a letter from the President and Chairman of the Board of the company, advising the trustee that, as a stockholder, the trust was entitled to participate \u201cin the 3-for-2 stock split up declared by the Board of Directors on February 23, 1977, at the rate of one share of common stock for each two shares held of record at the close of business on April 1, 1977.\u201d The letter further advised that the regular quarterly cash dividend would be mailed separately.\nThe trustee treated the \u201csplit up\u201d as a dividend and allocated all of the resulting 15,667 shares to trust income, in accordance with its interpretation of the direction in paragraph THIRD of the trust agreement that \u201cany and all dividends shall be considered as income.\u201d At the same time it filed a second and partial account of trust assets and a petition for adjudication with the orphans\u2019 court, seeking a judicial determination of the proper allocation of the shares.\nIn addition to the history set forth above, the parties also stipulated that:\n1. The 1977 stock distribution was made pursuant to a resolution by the Board of Directors of U.S.F. & G., which stated:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that for the purposes of effectuating a 3-for-2 stock split-up of the issued shares of common stock, $2.50 par value, of this Company, a 50% stock dividend and distribution (namely, the distribution of one share of such common stock for each two shares held) be and the same is hereby declared, in shares of the common stock of this Company -at the close of business on April 1, 1977.\n2. The distribution was accompanied by a transfer of $20,545,420, representing the par value of the newly issued shares, from the earned surplus account to the capital account on the U.S.F. & G. books.\n3. The U.S.F. & G. 1976 annual report to stockholders described the May, 1977, distribution as \u201ca 3-for-2 stock split-up.\u201d\n4. The application filed by U.S.F. & G. with the New York Stock Exchange for Exchange approval of the listing of the shares distributed in May, 1977, described the distribution as \u201ca 3-for-2 split-up of the Common Stock, $2.50 par value, of the Company.\u201d\n5. The Standard and Poor\u2019s 1977 Annual Dividend record reported the 1977 U.S.F. & G. distribution as \u201ca 3-for-2 split.\u201d\n6. The Commerce Clearing House Capital Changes Reporter, June 17, 1977 at 1613, reported the 1977 U.S.F. & G. stock distribution as \u201ca common split 3-2.\u201d\n7. As of November 30, 1976 (prior to the May, 1977, 15,667-share stock distribution), the fair market value of the trust principal, including 31,334 shares of U.S.F. & G., was $2,197,570. The 31,334 shares of U.S.F. & G. were valued at approximately $1,570,616, and the closing price for U.S.F. & G. on the New York Stock Exchange on that date was 50Vs.\n8. As of November 30, 1977, the fair market value of the trust principal, including 31,334 shares of U.S.F. & G. but not including the shares distributed in May, 1977, was $1,710,585. The fair market value of the 31,334-share U.S.F. & G. holding was $1,049,689. The 15,667 shares distributed the previous May had a market value of $524,844. The closing price for U.S.F. & G. on the New York Stock Exchange on that date was 33y2.\nII.\nIn the orphans\u2019 court, appellees contended that both settlor\u2019s intent and the terms of section 8105(a) of the Principal and Income Act require that the shares be allocated to principal. Appellants, the two surviving income beneficiaries, argued that by the terms of paragraph THIRD of the trust agreement, settlor had displayed a clear intent to override the application of the Act and that, as a stock dividend, the shares should be distributed as income.\nThe auditing judge, although observing that \u201c[t]here seems little doubt that the law in Pennsylvania considers the U.S.F. & G. distribution ... a stock dividend,\u201d held that settlor had not expressed a \u201ccontrary clear intent\u201d that the Principal and Income Act not apply to the trust and that the stock distribution should thus be allocated to principal. The auditing judge also held inadmissible three letters written by settlor to his children in 1952 and offered by appellees as probative of settlor\u2019s intent that a large stock distribution benefit the remaindermen rather than the income beneficiaries. Appellees excepted to the exclusion of these letters. Appellants excepted on several grounds to the court\u2019s allocation of the stock to principal, contending, inter alia, that such an allocation was inconsistent with the fact that the \u201cAuditing Judge held that the 50% stock distribution in issue is unquestionably a stock dividend.\u201d\nAppellees initially regarded the above \u201cholding\u201d as to the nature of the distribution as mere discussion to which no exception would properly lie, see Pa.R.Civ.P. (Equity) 1518; Supreme Court Orphans\u2019 Court Rule 3.1; 64 Luz.Leg.Reg. 155 (1974). However, once appellants challenged their failure to except, appellees immediately petitioned for leave to file an exception nunc pro tunc, which was granted over appellants\u2019 objection. The court then considered and dismissed all exceptions of both parties and decreed that the 15,667 shares of U.S.F. & G. stock be allocated to principal. In so doing, the court reiterated its conclusion, \u201cwithout qualification, that the stock distribution was a stock dividend under Pennsylvania law\u201d and again stated that this conclusion was irrelevant to the determination of whether settlor had expressed a clear and unambiguous intent to override the application of the Principal and Income Act to the distribution at issue.\nFrom this decree both parties appealed. Appellees continue to dispute the auditing judge\u2019s characterization of the distribution as a \u201cdividend.\u201d Appellants persist in their contention that settlor\u2019s direction in Paragraph THIRD that \u201cany and all dividends shall be considered as income\u201d requires the allocation of the distribution to income.\nIII.\nIt is clear that a settlor may \u201chimself direct the manner of ascertainment of income and principal . . . and such provisions . . . shall control.\u201d 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8102. To supersede the operation of the Principal and Income Act, such a direction must be clearly expressed. Dunham Trust, 433 Pa. 273, 249 A.2d 531 (1969). Accord, McEldowney Estate, 415 Pa. 87, 202 A.2d 100 (1964). It is undisputed that, absent a direction of sufficient clarity, section 8105(a) of the Act mandates the allocation of the distribution at issue to principal.\nIn essence, appellants\u2019 argument is that (1) the words \u201cany and all dividends shall be considered as income\u201d are such a clear and unambiguous direction; and (2) since the U.S.F. & G. stock distribution is \u201cunquestionably a stock dividend\u201d under Pennsylvania law, it should be allocated to income. An examination of the latter contention sheds considerable light on the former, and crucial, issue.\nA.\nThe authority for the auditing judge\u2019s characterization of the distribution as a dividend is this Court\u2019s decision in Pew Trust, 398 Pa. 523, 158 A.2d 552 (1960). At issue there was whether, under the \u201cPennsylvania Rule of Apportionment,\u201d a stock distribution involving no transfer of funds from the corporation\u2019s earned surplus account to its stated capital was \u201can apportionable event.\u201d In holding that the distribution was a non-apportionable event, allocable entirely to principal, this Court observed in dicta:\n\u201cA substantial and conclusive difference exists between a \u2018stock split\u2019 and a \u2018stock dividend\u2019: in the former, a division of the shares of stock, not of the earnings or profits of the corporation, takes place without any change in or impingement upon the then existing status on the corporate books of the earned surplus and capital accounts; in the latter, an addition of shares of stock and a division of, at least, some of the earnings or profits of the corporation take place, such division being reflected on the corporate books by an irreversible allocation of corporate funds from the earned surplus to the capital account.\u201d\nId., 398 Pa. at 529, 158 A.2d at 555 (footnote omitted).\nEven though the discussion of stock dividends in Pew was clearly dicta and the rule of apportionment to which it applied has been abrogated and replaced by the Principal and Income Act, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8105, appellants maintain that the Pew test is nevertheless applicable to stock distributions controlled by the Act. In support they cite Wasserman Estate, 57 D. & C. 127 (O.C.Phila.1972), where the orphans\u2019 court held that a detailed direction to treat as income dividends, \u201ceither regular or extraordinary,\u201d from any source, and \u201cirrespective of the form in which the same may be declared and paid,\u201d was sufficiently clear to override the application of the Principal and Income Act and require the allocation to income of all stock distributions supported by a transfer of any amount from earned surplus to capital. In so holding, the orphans\u2019 court stated:\n\u201cAs the court found in Pew, the achievement of certainty dictates that whenever any earned surplus is transferred, the transaction is a stock dividend. Only when there is absolutely no change in the financial structure of the corporation is the distribution of new shares to be regarded as a stock split.\u201d\nId. at 135 (emphasis in original).\nThe achievement of certainty is undoubtedly a commendable goal, but in a case governed by the Principal and Income Act, the search for certainty through a test applicable to the old, legislatively abrogated rule of apportionment is a misguided and futile effort. Indeed, it was the very uncertainty created by the antiquated rule that led the Legislature to replace the rule with the Principal and Income Act of 1947.\nOur cases have chronicled in detail the history and demise of the rule of apportionment. First applied by judicial decision in Earp\u2019s Appeal, 28 Pa. 368 (1857), the Rule \u201cwas an equitable one which at the time of its conception and for many years thereafter \u2014 under vastly different economic conditions than those of the last several decades \u2014 strove to balance the equities between life tenants and remaindermen with the aim of protecting the interests of both.\u201d Catherwood Trust, 405 Pa. 61, 65-66, 173 A.2d 86, 88 (1961). However,\n\u201c[i]n recent years, the ingenuity of corporate management, seeking to achieve various ends such as broadening or enhancing the market for its stock, effect tax savings, etc., has produced a complexity of corporate transactions which involve the transfer on corporate books of earnings, earned surplus, etc., from one account to another. Earnings, under modern corporate practice, no longer retain the simplicity of meaning of the earnings considered by this Court in Earp\u2019s Appeal, supra, and other decisions.\u201d\nCunningham Estate, 395 Pa. 1, 11, 149 A.2d 72, 78 (1959).\n\u201cIn the face of the generally known and experienced difficulty, complexity and uncertainty under the prior rule of apportionment in ascertaining the \u2018intact value\u2019 of designated shares of stock at a given time, the Legislature acted to provide for a fairer, more orderly and more uniform apportionment between income and principal. The particular definitions which the Legislature adopted by the 1947 Act represent what that body determined to be a pragmatic necessity for a current, definite, more understandable and more workable rule of fair apportionment.\u201d\nNorvell Estate, 415 Pa. 427, 435, 203 A.2d 538, 542 (1964) (footnote omitted). Accord, Anthony Estate, 423 Pa. 401, 223 A.2d 857 (1966). Designed \u201cto provide convenient and workable rules of administration of estates in conformity with what would be the wishes of most settlors,\u201d III Scott on Trusts, \u00a7 241A at 2102 (3d ed. 1967), the Principal and Income Act looks not to changes in the corporate balance sheet, as did the former rule of apportionment, but to the form of the distribution. Thus, section 8105(a), as amended by Act of August 1, 1963, provides simply that distributions by a corporation in its own shares, \u201chowever described or designated by the distributing corporation,\u201d shall be deemed principal if the number of shares is greater than 6% of the number of shares outstanding, and income if 6% or less. In adopting the Act and abrogating the old rule, the Legislature has effectively declared irrelevant the \u201ccapitalization of earnings\u201d test of stock distributions enunciated in Pew Trust, supra, and followed in Wasserman Estate, supra.\nB.\nThe sole question under the Principal and Income Act, therefore, is whether the settlor has expressed, pursuant to section 8102, a clear intent to override the application of the Act to stock distributions.\nOf course, the words \u201cany and all dividends shall be considered as income\u201d must not be read in a vacuum. It is hornbook law that a will is to be construed according to the intent of the testator. \u201cTo ascertain this intent, a court examines the words of the instrument and, if necessary, the scheme of distribution, the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will and other facts bearing on the question.\u201d Sykes Estate, 477 Pa. 254, 257, 383 A.2d 920, 921 (1978). Accord, e. g., Houston Estate, 491 Pa. 339, 421 A.2d 166 (1980); Hamilton Estate, 454 Pa. 495, 312 A.2d 373 (1973). This well-settled principle applies equally to trusts. Pew Trust, 411 Pa. 96, 191 A.2d 399 (1963); Walton Estate, 409 Pa. 225, 186 A.2d 32 (1962). Here, however, nothing in the will, the trust agreement, or the surrounding circumstances provides any support for appellants\u2019 position that settlor would have intended the 15,667 shares involved in this stock distribution to go to the income beneficiaries.\nAppellants argue that a clear intent is expressed because settlor would have regarded the 3-for-2 stock distribution as a \u201cdividend\u201d and wished it allocated to income. In support, appellants rely on the facts that settlor was a director of U.S.F. & G. during a period when it characterized several relatively small stock distributions as \u201cdividends\u201d and that the U.S.F. & G. Board of Directors characterized the present distribution, in an internal memorandum, as \u201ca 50% stock dividend and distribution\u201d \u201cfor the purposes of effectuating a 3-for-2 stock split-up.\u201d\nThat the corporation privately described the distribution as both a \u201cdividend\u201d and a \u201csplit-up\u201d is certainly not dispositive of the issue. As Justice Holmes observed in a related context, \u201c[a] word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances at the time in which it is used.\u201d Towne v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425, 38 S.Ct. 158, 159, 62 L.Ed. 372 (1918). Significantly, in all its public descriptions of the distribution, including its announcement of the distribution to shareholders and its annual report, U.S.F. & G. referred to the distribution only as a \u201csplit-up.\u201d Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and generally accepted accounting principles, U.S.F. & G. could not have described its 3-for-2 distribution as a dividend without transferring to stated capital the fair market value of the newly issued shares, not simply the par value, as was transferred here. See New York Stock Exchange Company Manual, \u00a7 A-263; American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Ch. 7, Section B, \u00b6 11 (1953). See also Fletcher, Cyclopedia Corporations, \u00a7 5362.1 at 750 (1971 ed.; 1979 cum. supp.) (\u201ccapitalization of earnings incident to an increase in the number of outstanding shares is far from conclusive as to whether the transaction is properly designated as a dividend or a split\u201d). Manifestly, to attempt a precise categorization of a stock distribution as a \u201cdividend\u201d or a \u201csplit\u201d and a divination of settlor's intent on the basis of conflicting corporate descriptions is to ignore the mandate of the Legislature in adopting the Principal and Income Act and to return to the confusion of the old rule of apportionment.\nNor does the modification of the word \u201cdividends\u201d by the adjectives \u201cany and all\u201d resolve the ambiguity, as contended by appellants. New York, which has adopted a principal and income act similar to Pennsylvania\u2019s, has observed:\n\u201cThe term \u2018stock dividend\u2019 is inherently ambiguous in that there are technical distinctions between \u2018stock dividends\u2019 and \u2018stock splits\u2019 (see Matter of Payne, 7 N.Y.2d 1, 194 N.Y.S.2d 465,163 N.E.2d 301; Matter of Fosdick, 4 N.Y.2d 646,176 N.Y.S.2d 966,152 N.E.2d 228). Thus, the Practice Commentary to EPTL 11-2.1 explicitly states that a direction in the governing instrument to allocate a \u2018stock dividend\u2019 in a certain way would not constitute a sufficiently clear expression of the creator\u2019s intention to preclude the application of the 6% rule (Hoffman, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons.Laws of N.Y., Book 17B, p. 130).\u201d\nMatter of Estate of Ward, 58 A.D.2d 606, 607, 395 N.Y.S.2d 671, 672 (1977) (emphasis in original). As long as the meaning of \u201cdividends\u201d remains uncertain, the words \u201cany and all\u201d can of course add nothing.\nAppellants urge that settlor\u2019s grant of discretion to the trustee to allocate expenses between income and principal \u201cnotwithstanding any legal rules to the contrary,\u201d which appears in the sentence preceding settlor\u2019s direction as to \u201cdividends,\u201d demonstrates settlor\u2019s intent to preclude the operation of the Principal and Income Act as to stock \u201cdividends\u201d as well. Clearly, however, the phrase \u201cnotwithstanding any legal rules to the contrary\u201d applies only to the allocation of trust expenses. To view it as modifying the succeeding sentence referring to \u201cdividends\u201d would distort syntax and defy logic. See Houston Estate, supra, 491 Pa. at 349, 421 A.2d at 172.\nThe identity of the respective beneficiaries likewise fails to support appellants\u2019 position. If settlor had bequeathed the principal of his trust to a charity or to unascertained descendants, one might assume that he would prefer to benefit his children, the income beneficiaries, over such distant legatees. See Scott, supra at \u00a7 236.3, 1985. Here, however, the remaindermen are settlor\u2019s grandchildren, all of whom were living at the time he executed his will and trust agreement. Indeed, the trust provides for the gradual distribution of principal to these grandchildren, directing that they are to receive immediately the share of any deceased income beneficiary. Moreover, the trustee is granted no power to invade the corpus on behalf of the income beneficiaries.\nAn examination of the alternative allocations of the stock distribution in light of the identity of the beneficiaries and the above trust provisions further undercuts appellants\u2019 position that settlor would wish the distribution allocated to income. If the 15,667 shares distributed in U.S.F. & G.\u2019s 3-for-2 stock \u201csplit-up\u201d are allocated to principal, the value of the trust corpus will remain virtually unchanged, and settlor\u2019s surviving children will be entitled to receive the dividend income from all 47,001 shares of U.S.F. & G. stock held by the trust. On the other hand, if the distribution is allocated to income, the value of the U.S.F. & G. stock remaining in the trust will be reduced by nearly one third, and the value of total trust assets by 25%.\nNothing prevents a settlor from achieving such a seemingly inequitable result, if he wishes to do so. He must, however, direct it by clear and unambiguous language. Dunham Trust, supra; McEldowney Estate, supra. In the will and trust agreement of settlor William Reynolds, Jr., no such clear direction exists. The words \u201cany and all dividends shall be considered as income\u201d do not begin to approach the level of clarity necessary to preclude the operation of section 8105(a) of the Principal and Income Act.\nAccordingly, the decree of the orphans\u2019 court, allocating the 15,667 shares received in the 3-for-2 stock distribution to principal, is affirmed.\nEach party pay own costs.\n. Settlor\u2019s seventh grandchild died without issue in 1965.\n. Thus, stipulations # 7 and # 8 indicate that treatment of the distribution as principal would restore the trust to its pre-distribution value, whereas treatment of the distribution as income would result in a 25% decrease in the value of trust assets.\n. Appellants urge us to hold that appellees have waived their objection to the description of the distribution as a dividend through their failure to file a timely exception and that the auditing judge abused his discretion in permitting them to file an exception nunc pro tunc. Because we agree with the auditing judge that the precise characterization of the distribution under Pennsylvania law is irrelevant to the ultimate determination of this appeal, we do not address this contention.\n. Although the Principal and Income Act was adopted in 1947, this Court initially held unconstitutional its application to receipts of trusts created prior to the effective date of the Act. Crawford Estate, 362 Pa. 458, 67 A.2d 124 (1949); Pew Estate, 362 Pa. 468, 67 A.2d 129 (1949); Warden Trust, 382 Pa. 311, 115 A2d 159 (1955). Thus, until this Court reversed its position and held constitutional the application of the Act to all trust receipts after the effective date, Catherwood Trust, 405 Pa. 61, 173 A.2d 86 (1961), the Rule of Apportionment remained applicable to all receipts of pre-1947 trusts.",
