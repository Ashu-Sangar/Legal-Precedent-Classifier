        "text": "OPINION\nKAUFFMAN, Justice.\nFollowing a jury trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, appellant, T. H. Styles, was convicted of third degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime in connection with the shooting death of Salone Ferrell. Post verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 7 to 20 years for the murder conviction and 2*/2 to 5 years for the weapons offense. Appellant here argues that the trial judge (1) erred in allowing the Commonwealth to introduce evidence of subsequent criminal conduct and (2) abused her discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial after an outburst by a spectator in the courtroom. Finding both of these contentions to be without merit, we affirm the judgment of sentence.\nThe relevant facts are as follows: At approximately 3:00 p. m. on February 2, 1978, appellant discovered his wife sitting in a parked car with Ferrell near the 1201 Bar in South Philadelphia. He ran over, opened the car door, grabbed her by the collar and slapped her. During the argument that followed, Ferrell told appellant to \u201cpick on me.\u201d Appellant then drove to his mother-in-law\u2019s house and obtained a loaded shotgun.\nLater that afternoon, appellant confronted his wife at a neighbor\u2019s house and threw a shotgun shell at her, stating, \u201cThis one is for you.\u201d He then left the house and returned to the 1201 Bar, where Ferrell was employed as a bartender. Holding the loaded shotgun, appellant entered the bar, walked to within a few feet of a pool table where Ferrell was standing, said, \u201cI told you I\u2019d be back,\u201d and shot him. Appellant began to aim the shotgun again, but a patron in the bar struggled with him and prevented a second shot. With the gun still in his hands, appellant fled, but was apprehended outside the bar by two passing police officers.\nFollowing his arrest, appellant was taken to Graduate Hospital where Ferrell, who was in critical condition, identified him as his assailant. Appellant was then charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault and various lesser offenses in connection with the shooting. Later that night, he was released on bail. Ferrell died early the next day, however, and an arrest warrant was issued charging appellant with murder.\nAt approximately 6:30 p. m. on the day after the shooting, appellant was again arrested when he was observed by police walking down the street carrying a sawed-off shotgun. It was not until after appellant was taken to District Headquarters that police became aware of the outstanding warrant for his arrest in the Ferrell murder.\nAt trial, the prosecution sought to prove that appellant had intentionally killed Ferrell as part of a plan to murder both Ferrell and his wife. Taking the stand in his own defense, appellant testified that he had gone back to the bar only to force an \u201capology\u201d from Ferrell; that he never intended to kill him; and that the shotgun discharged accidentally.\nAppellant first contends that the trial judge erred in permitting the Commonwealth to present evidence of his possession of a sawed-off shotgun and a pocket full of shells the day after the shooting. We disagree.\nIt is well settled that evidence of other unrelated criminal conduct of an accused is generally inadmissible to prove his commission of the crime for which he is being tried. Commonwealth v. Brown, 489 Pa. 285, 414 A.2d 70 (1980); Commonwealth v. Peterson, 453 Pa. 187, 307 A.2d 264 (1973). As we have stated:\n\u201c \u2018[t]he purpose of this rule is to prevent the conviction of an accused for one crime by the use of evidence that he has committed other unrelated crimes, and to preclude the inference that because he has committed other crimes he was more likely to commit that crime for which he is being tried. The presumed effect of such evidence is to predispose the minds of the jurors to believe the accused guilty, and thus effectually to strip him of the presumption of innocence.\u2019 \u201d\nCommonwealth v. Spruill, 480 Pa. 601, 604-5, 391 A.2d 1048, 1049-50 (1978), quoting Commonwealth v. Terry, 462 Pa. 595, 599-600, 342 A.2d 92, 94-95 (1975) and Commonwealth v. Clark, 453 Pa. 449, 452-53, 309 A.2d 589, 590-91 (1973). It is equally settled, however, that evidence of other crimes is admissible where it is relevant to prove (1) motive, (2) intent, (3) a common scheme or plan involving the commission of two or more crimes so closely related that proof of one tends to prove the other, (4) the identity of the accused as the perpetrator, (5) accident or (6) lack of mistake. Commonwealth v. Brown, supra.\nAt trial, there was no question that appellant shot and killed Ferrell; the only issue was whether the shooting was intentional or accidental. It is inconceivable that one who claims to have shot and killed another by accident would virtually immediately thereafter arm himself with another gun \u2014 a sawed-off shotgun \u2014 and walk the streets with it and a pocket full of shells. Accordingly, we conclude that appellant\u2019s subsequent criminal conduct within hours after the shooting was admissible to rebut his claim that the shotgun discharged accidentally.\nAppellant further contends that the trial judge abused her discretion in refusing to declare a mistrial after an \u201cemotional outburst\u201d in the courtroom by a spectator.\n\u201cA motion for mistrial is addressed to the discretion of the court . . . [and] in the area of bystander misconduct, ... it is primarily within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to determine whether the defendant was prejudiced by the misconduct.\u201d Commonwealth v. Craig, 471 Pa. 310, 313, 370 A.2d 317, 319 (1977). When the incident occurred, a short recess was ordered, and at the close of appellant\u2019s testimony, the trial judge instructed the jury:\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, you will remember that during the witness\u2019 testimony there was a brief outburst by a person who was seated in the courtroom. You are not in any way to be inflamed by that outburst. You are not to let that in any way prejudice you against the defendant. So erase from your mind whatever you saw of that brief episode.\n(N.T. 451-52). Appellant has failed even to make an effort to describe any manner in which he was prejudiced by the so-called \u201coutburst,\u201d and, on the present record, we cannot conclude that the trial judge abused her discretion in refusing to declare a mistrial.\nAccordingly, the judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722.\n. Possession of a sawed-off shotgun is a misdemeanor of the first degree under section 908 of the Crimes Code. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 908. Pursuant to appellant\u2019s pre-trial motion, this latter charge was severed from the charges relating to Ferrell\u2019s murder.\n. Appellant testified that he had been \u201cpistol whipped\u201d by Ferrell during their earlier confrontation and that he went back to the bar to extract an apology from him \u201cfor disrespect to [him] as a man.\u201d (N.T. 344). In contrast, appellant\u2019s wife testified that although Ferrell was carrying a gun at the time of the confrontation, he did not draw it from \u201cunderneath his jacket\u201d or use it to threaten or \u201cpistol whip\u201d appellant.\n. Appellant argues that his subsequent criminal conduct was not relevant to negate his claim of accident because the sawed-off shot gun was not loaded and because the shells he was carrying did not flt the gun. We disagree. While these factors bear upon the weight to be accorded the evidence, they do not render appellant\u2019s subsequent criminal conduct so dissimilar as to render it totally irrelevant to the question at hand. Indeed, there was no evidence that appellant did not know the shells he was carrying would not flt the gun.\n. In the Opinion of the court below, the so-called \u201coutburst\u201d is described as \u201caudible ... [but] brief ... crying, not ... words.\u201d The incident occurred during the course of appellant\u2019s cross-examination; however, the record does not clearly reflect either the nature of the \u201coutburst\u201d or its source. Appellant states in his brief that the \u201coutburst\u201d was made by his wife; the trial judge characterizes the source as merely a \u201cperson who was seated in the courtroom\u201d and a \u201cspectator.\u201d Regardless of its source, we are not persuaded that the \u201coutburst\u201d was prejudicial.\n. Appellant does no more than make the bald assertion that the outburst was \u201chighly prejudicial and inflammatory.\u201d",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI dissent. The trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth, over defense objection, to discredit appellant\u2019s defense by way of evidence that, on the day after commission of the offenses charged, appellant was arrested while possessing an unloaded shotgun and shells which did not fit the gun. This error in admitting such highly prejudicial evidence over defense objection requires that the judgment of sentence be vacated and a new trial ordered.\nIt is hornbook law that \u201cthe prosecution may not introduce evidence of other criminal acts of the accused unless the evidence is substantially relevant for some other purpose than to show a probability that he committed the crime on trial because he is a man of criminal character.\u201d McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 190 at 447 (Cleary ed. 1972). See, e. g., 1 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 192-194 (3d ed. 1940). As our cases have often stated,\n\u201c[t]he purpose of this rule is to prevent the conviction of an accused for one crime by the use of evidence that he has committed other unrelated crimes, and to preclude the inference that because he has committed other crimes he was more likely to commit that crime for which he is being tried. The presumed effect of such evidence is to predispose the minds of the jurors to believe the accused guilty, and thus effectually to strip him of the presumption of innocence.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Spruill, 480 Pa. 601, 604-605, 391 A.2d 1048, 1049-50 (1978). Accord, e. g., Commonwealth v. Terry, 462 Pa. 595, 342 A.2d 92 (1975); Commonwealth v. Clark, 453 Pa. 449, 309 A.2d 589 (1973); Commonwealth v. Allen, 448 Pa. 177, 292 A.2d 373 (1972).\nThe majority recognizes the general prohibition against introduction of other criminal acts. However, the majority points to the exception permitting the introduction of evidence which tends to show, \u201cby similar acts or incidents, that the act on trial was not inadvertent, accidental, unintentional, or without guilty knowledge.\u201d McCormick, supra, at p. 450 (footnote omitted). In the view of the majority, the Commonwealth permissibly introduced evidence that, on the day after the shooting, appellant possessed an unloaded shotgun and shells which did not fit the gun because the evidence tended to negate appellant\u2019s claim that the shooting was wholly accidental.\nContrary to the majority\u2019s summary assertion, the challenged evidence utterly fails to negate appellant\u2019s claim of accident. Essential to the legitimate use of other criminal conduct as a means of negating a claim of accident is\nsimilarity. See Commonwealth v. Raymond, 412 Pa. 194,194 A.2d 150 (1963). As Wigmore explains,\n\u201cit is at least necessary that prior acts should be similar. Since it is the improbability of a like result being repeated by mere chance that carries probative weight, the essence of this probative effect is the likeness of the instance.\u201d\nII Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 302 at 245 (Chadbourn rev. 1979). Here, the subsequent conduct, possession of the unloaded gun and shells which did not fit the gun, bore no similarity to the act of shooting for which appellant was being tried. Indeed, the record fails even to suggest that appellant had ever used the second shotgun. Thus this evidence carries no probative weight on the issue of whether the shooting was accidental. See Commonwealth v. Bond, 261 Pa.Super. 311, 318, 396 A.2d 414, 417 (1978) (Spaeth, J.) (previous unsuccessful extortion threat against robbery victim not sufficiently similar to robbery to show intent to rob).\nThe Commonwealth maintains that any error in permitting the introduction of the unloaded shotgun and shells which did not fit the gun was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in view of the allegedly \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt. However, if the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is so overwhelming, obviously no interest of justice was advanced by the Commonwealth\u2019s insistence on the admission of prejudicial evidence over objection, wholly lacking in probative value, and the trial court\u2019s admission of such evidence. Indeed, the fourteenth amendment forbids \u201cfundamental unfairness in the use of evidence whether true or false.\u201d Lisenba v. California, 314 U.S. 219, 236, 62 S.Ct. 280, 290, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941).

A verdict so obtained cannot stand.\nAppellant should be granted a new trial.",
