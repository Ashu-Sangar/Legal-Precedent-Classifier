Appellant collaterally attacked his guilty plea in a PCHA proceeding but was denied relief. This appeal followed. Appellant claims his confession was involuntary and that the existence of the involuntary confession caused appellant to plead guilty. Thus, appellant concludes that his guilty plea was involuntary and should be set aside.\nAfter reviewing the record, we find appellant\u2019s claim to be without merit. Consequently, the judgment of the PCHA court, denying relief, is affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., concurred in the result.\nThis case was assigned to the writer on March 2, 1981.",
