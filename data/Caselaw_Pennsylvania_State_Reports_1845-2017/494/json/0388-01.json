        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nKAUFFMAN, Justice.\nAppellant, Angel Santo Baez (\u201cBaez\u201d), was convicted of murder of the first degree after a jury trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County. Post verdict motions were denied, a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed, and this appeal followed. Baez contends that the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to read directly from a hearsay statement in an effort to impeach his credibility on cross-examination. We agree and, accordingly, vacate and remand for a new trial.\nThe relevant facts are as follows. On March 23, 1979, at approximately 2:00 a. m., Clark Harris (\u201cHarris\u201d) was stabbed and killed in an all night restaurant. Baez was arrested and charged with first degree murder. At trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief was supported by the testimony of several eyewitnesses to the incident, all of whom testified that Baez had stabbed Harris. Their testimony varied, however, with respect to what, if anything, had occurred inside the restaurant between Harris and Baez immediately prior to the stabbing. Some witnesses testified that before the stabbing Harris had called Baez a \u201chippie\u201d; others testified that no words had been exchanged between the two. One witness testified that Harris had first grabbed Baez by the shirt, while others testified that there was no physical contact prior to the stabbing.\nBaez argued that he acted in self-defense, or, in the alternative, that Harris had provoked the incident by harassing, grabbing, and threatening him. He testified that on the night in question, two of his friends, Reinaldo Castillo (\u201cCastillo\u201d) and Angel Rivera (\u201cRivera\u201d), drove him to the restaurant, parked across the street, dropped him off, and then drove away. He contended that the events leading up to the stabbing began outside the restaurant, alleging that as he approached the restaurant, two \u201cguys\u201d who were bigger than he and whom he had never seen before, pushed him and called him names, and that one of them, Harris, threatened to kill him. He further testified that once inside the restaurant, he walked over to the two men and told them he did not \u201cwant any trouble\u201d; that Harris then grabbed him by the shirt, lifted him in the air, and again threatened to kill him; that as a result, he \u201clost [his] mind,\u201d took the knife out, and after that his mind went \u201cblank\u201d; and finally, that he remembered leaving the restaurant and going home, but did not remember stabbing Harris.\nOn cross-examination of Baez, the Commonwealth, over defense objection, was permitted to read directly from a written statement allegedly given by Castillo to police Detective Richard Runstedler shortly after the incident. Castillo\u2019s statement made no reference to any conflict between Harris and Baez outside the restaurant. It thus contradicted Baez\u2019 testimony with respect to the name calling, pushing and threats, which he contended had occurred on the sidewalk. Moreover, Baez had testified that after Castillo and Rivera dropped him off near the restaurant, they immediately drove away. Castillo\u2019s statement, however, asserted that he and Rivera did not immediately drive away, but rather remained in front of the restaurant. It further recounted that \u201ctwo white guys\u201d came over to the car, one of whom shook hands with Rivera before entering the restaurant, and that Castillo and Rivera later looked through the window of the restaurant for Baez before getting back into the car and driving away.\nSince the statement allegedly given by Castillo to Detective Runstedler was clearly hearsay, the Commonwealth could not introduce it as substantive evidence. Instead, while cross-examining Baez, the prosecutor read portions of the statement to him and asked whether those assertions were true. When the defense objected to this use of Castillo\u2019s alleged statement, the trial judge said, \u201cI am letting the Assistant District Attorney read exactly what [Castillo] said and he\u2019s asking [Baez] if that\u2019s true. It\u2019s cross-examination. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it if Mr. Runstedler took the statement.\u201d (N.T. 299). Recognizing the hearsay nature of the statement, however, he instructed the jury that it was not to be considered as substantive evidence, but was to be considered only for the purpose of impeaching Baez\u2019 credibility. (N.T. 300)\nIn an effort to support the trial judge\u2019s ruling, the Commonwealth argues that Castillo\u2019s statement was not hearsay \u201csince it was not offered for the truth of the matter contained therein\u201d or, alternatively, that despite its hearsay nature the statement had indicia of reliability making it sufficiently probative to warrant its use, at least for \u201cimpeachment\u201d purposes. The Commonwealth further asserts that use of the statement, if erroneous, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in view of the other \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence in the case. We disagree.\nThe credibility of a witness may be impeached (1) by showing that on a prior occasion he made a statement, either oral or written, that is inconsistent with his present testimony; (2) by competent evidence tending to show bias, bad character for truth and honesty, or defects in memory, perception or capacity or (3) by the competent contradictory testimony of other witnesses whose version of the facts differs from that of the witness being impeached; Commonwealth v. Hamm, 474 Pa. 487, 378 A.2d 1219, (1976); McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 33 at 66 (2d ed. 1972).\nThe first of these three methods of impeachment is obviously inapplicable, for it is axiomatic that when attempting to discredit a witness\u2019 testimony by means of a prior inconsistent statement, the statement must have been made or adopted by the witness whose credibility is being impeached. There is no contention that Baez at any time adopted the contents of Castillo\u2019s statement. The second method could be applicable only to the extent that competent testimony at variance with that of the witness always raises the possibility of defective memory or perception. Here, however, Castillo\u2019s alleged statement, which was wholly incompatible with Baez\u2019 testimony, could not have differed merely on the basis of memory or perception, but could only have been used to impeach pursuant to the third method, as \u201ccontradictory testimony.\u201d It is further axiomatic, however, that if contradictory testimony is not competent to be introduced as substantive evidence, then it equally cannot be used for impeachment purposes. See Commonwealth v. Noble, 371 Pa. 138, 88 A.2d 760 (1952).\nThe Commonwealth seeks to avoid the question of competency by suggesting that since its use of the statement was for the sole purpose of attacking appellant\u2019s credibility, the statement \u201cwas not offered for the truth of the matter contained therein\u201d and thus was not hearsay. By incorporating Castillo\u2019s alleged statement into his questions on cross-examination, the prosecutor, argues the Commonwealth, only presented the jury with the fact that Castillo made the statement, not with the content of the statement as substantive evidence. In our view, however, this argument either reflects a hopelessly shallow understanding of the function of the hearsay rule, or, worse, disingenuously seeks to defend a subterfuge to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence under the guise of impeachment. The statement was offered, in fact, for no reason but the truth of Castillo\u2019s assertions, for impeachment by contradiction, by its very nature, is founded upon the truth of the contradictory evidence offered. In his treatise on the law of evidence, Professor Wigmore explains the principle as follows:\n[The] contradiction in itself does nothing probatively, not unless the contradicting witness or witnesses are believed in preference to the first one, i. e., unless his error is established. It is not the contradiction, but the truth of the contradicting assertion as opposed to the first one, that constitutes the probative end.\nWigmore, Evidence, III A, \u00a7 1000, p. 957 (Revised, 1970). (Emphasis supplied). It is precisely this proposition which gives rise to the axiom that a statement incompetent as direct evidence is equally incompetent for the purpose of impeachment. The statement here in question, obviously incompetent hearsay if offered as direct evidence, gained no competency by virtue of the fact that it was brought out on cross-examination in an effort to establish that Baez\u2019 recitation of the facts was untrue. Moreover, the notion that the jury, if cautioned, would not use Castillo\u2019s statement for its substance is an obvious fiction, for the content of the statement undermined the very basis of Baez\u2019 claim of provocation. Its impact could not have been more substantive had it been read directly into the record.\nThe principle underlying the hearsay rule was well articulated many years ago by Justice Musmanno, speaking for a unanimous court in Johnson v. Peoples Cab Company, 386 Pa. 513, 126 A.2d 720 (1956):\nThe primary object of a trial in American courts is to bring to the tribunal, which is passing on the dispute involved, those persons who know of their own knowledge the facts to which they testify. If it were not for this\nabsolute sine qua non, trials could be conducted on paper without the presence of a single flesh and blood witness. But with such a pen-and-ink procedure, there would be no opportunity to check on testimonial defects such as fallacious memory, limited observation, purposeful distortions, and outright fabrication. The great engine of cross-examination would lie unused while error and perjury would travel untrammeledly to an unreliable and often-tainted judgment. Accordingly, nothing is more adamantly established in American trial procedure than that no one may testify to what somebody else told him. He may only relate what is within the sphere of his own memory brought to him by the couriers of his own senses.\n386 Pa. at 515, 126 A.2d 721. The statement in question here is precisely the type of unreliable out-of-court declaration the hearsay rule was designed to exclude. Indeed, the problems associated with hearsay are multiplied here, as we are presented with an extrajudicial written statement which incorporates an extrajudicial oral statement.\nNonetheless, the Commonwealth argues that if the statement was, in fact, hearsay, its use for impeachment purposes was not error because it bore indicia of reliability sufficient to render it competent despite the fact that it did not fall into a recognized exception to the rule against hearsay. We disagree. The statement was a classic example of double hearsay, for at best it is merely Detective Runstedler\u2019s written account of what Castillo told him. Although the Commonwealth called Detective Runstedler as a witness, it failed to question him with respect to the statement. Other than the Assistant District Attorney\u2019s assertion that \u201cDetective Runstedler, who\u2019s seated right here, took the statement from [Castillo] and he can testify as such,\u201d (N.T. 298-99), the Commonwealth made no attempt to render the statement competent. Instead, verbatim excerpts were introduced through Baez under the guise of cross-examination. Even if a rule permitting admission of hearsay bearing indicia of reliability were settled law in Pennsylvania, this form of questioning would have been clearly improper, as neither the authenticity nor reliability of the statement had ever been established.\nFinally, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the admission of the Castillo statement, if error, was harmless. Under the standard in Pennsylvania, as articulated by this Court in Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 383 A.2d 155 (1977), for a reviewing court to conclude that an error is harmless, it must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. We do not believe that the error here could be considered conclusively harmless under any standard, much less that established by Story. The crux of Baez\u2019 defense was that he lacked the requisite mental state to commit first degree murder. First, he argued that he had acted in self defense. Alternatively, he argued that he had acted out of rage and anger in response to provocation by Harris. Baez\u2019 defense relied heavily on his own description of what had occurred outside the restaurant on the evening in question. He and Collingwood were the only persons who testified concerning those events, and their testimony conflicted. The only other reference to those events was in the Castillo statement, which was devoid of any evidence of harassment and provocation on Harris\u2019 part, and which thus refuted Baez\u2019 testimony and lent credibility to Collingwood\u2019s rendition of the facts. Indeed, Castillo\u2019s statement indicated that Harris had been rather friendly, even to the point of shaking hands with Rivera. Thus, the contents of the statement created an inference that, at least outside the restaurant, Baez was not threatened or provoked by Harris.\nBy so weakening his credibility as to what happened outside the restaurant, the statement may well have led the jury to doubt Baez\u2019 testimony that he was provoked inside the restaurant, especially in light of the conflicting testimony of the other witnesses. It was directly contradictory to Baez\u2019 version of the events; indeed, it was used for that very reason. In truth, it served not only to weaken Baez\u2019 credibility, but, as noted earlier, it undermined the very substance of his claim of provocation. We thus conclude that the erroneously admitted statement is likely to have contributed to Baez\u2019 conviction.\nAccordingly, the judgment of sentence is vacated and the matter is remanded for a new trial.\nFLAHERTY, J., joined in this opinion and filed a separate concurring opinion.\nNIX, J., concurred in the result.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, as amended, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722(1).\n. One of the eyewitnesses was Harris\u2019 cousin, Walter Collingwood (\u201cCollingwood\u201d), who had accompanied him to the restaurant on the evening in question.\n. Baez testified: \u201cThey started pushing me and they started calling me gut sucker \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re a mother-fucker,\u2019 and \u2018You\u2019re a gut sucker;\u2019 and then they started pushing me and said \u2018You mother-fucker Puerto Rican, we are going to kill you.\u2019 \u201d (N.T. 269). In contrast, Collingwood testified that nothing had occurred outside the restaurant except that he commented to Harris that the \u201cguys\u201d outside the restaurant, a group of eight to ten Puerto Ricans, were \u201clong-hair hippies\u201d and needed a haircut.\n. Castillo was killed in an unrelated automobile accident sometime before the trial. The Commonwealth made no effort to prove, through the testimony of Detective Runstedler or otherwise, the circumstances under which the statement was given, when it was given, whether Castillo had read and understood the statement or whether he had in fact signed it. In short, the statement was hearsay, and no effort was made to qualify it under any of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n. Relevant portions of the cross-examination are as follows:\nQ When you got out of the car, did the car stay there or leave?\nA Leave.\nQ You saw it leave?\nA Yes, I did.\nQ Did it leave before the two white guys came over?\nA Yes, before. I got out and locked the door and they went.\nQ [Castillo] told the police that after you got out of the car ... \u2018Just at that time two white guys came by my car and one of them said, \u201c \u2018Hello\u2019 \u201d shook hands with Rivera ... \u2019\nA That\u2019s not true. That\u2019s not true because nobody was there. I didn\u2019t see anybody when I get out ... just when I was walking.\nQ [Castillo] told the police that, Me and Rivera stayed in my car. After a couple of minutes we got out of my car and looked in the window for Baez. You said they /eft; are you sure they /eft?\nA I am sure. Yes.\nQ So this ... what [Castillo] is telling the police ... is not the way you remember it happened?\nA I wish he were here; he could testify.\nQ Is [Castillo] the kind of person that would lie? Is that the kind of friend you have?\nA I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t say whether he lie or not. I know they take off.\n* * * * * *\nQ And nobody was there? [Castillo] was gone then? ... [Castillo] and Mr. Rivera?\nA I didn\u2019t see nobody there ... nobody was there.\n* * * * * *\nQ Are you sure nobody was there?\nA I am sure.\nQ [Castillo] says he was there with Rivera.\nA I didn\u2019t see them in there. They took off. If they were there, then nothing would have happened.\n* * * * * *\n(N.T. 304-305, 306, 308). (Emphasis added).\n. In order for a murder to be of the first degree the crime must be \u201cwillful, deliberate, and premeditated.\u201d Commonwealth v. O\u2019Searo, 466 Pa. 224, 352 A.2d 30 (1976); Commonwealth v. Fostar, 455 Pa. 216, 317 A.2d 188 (1974).\n. Rivera, who, according to Castillo\u2019s statement, was also outside the restaurant that night, was not called as a witness.\n. As previously noted, Baez had testified that Castillo and Rivera had already left the area outside the restaurant when Harris and Collingwood arrived. See note 5 supra.\n. We note that Castillo\u2019s statement did not relate to already proven facts, as there was a dispute at trial between Collingwood and Baez concerning the events which occurred outside the restaurant. Thus, it cannot be said that the statement was merely cumulative. See Commonwealth v. Rodgers, 472 Pa. 435, 372 A.2d 771 (1977).",
