        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nThe Court being equally divided, the Order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nO\u2019BRIEN, C. J., files an Opinion in Support of Affirmance which NIX and LARSEN, JJ., join.\nLARSEN, J., files a separate Opinion in Support of Affirmance.\nFLAHERTY, J., files an Opinion in Support of Reversal which ROBERTS and KAUFFMAN, JJ., join.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\nO\u2019BRIEN, Chief Justice.\nThis case presents the issue of whether a school board may legally suspend a tenured professional employee for financial reasons alone without establishing any of the causes for suspension enumerated in \u00a7 1124 of The Public School Code.\nAppellee, Aristoteles J. Theros (Theros), a tenured professional employee of the Warwick School District in Lancaster County since 1965, was a teacher of business education. On June 29, 1976, the Warwick School Board adopted its budget for the 1976-1977 academic year. In an effort to reduce a projected budget deficit, the Board abolished three non-mandated supervisory positions, including the head of the Business Education Department and the Director of Athletics. At that time both supervisors were serving as half time administrators and half time teachers in the Business Education Department. After their administrative positions were eliminated, they were assigned to full time teaching positions in the Business Education Department. As a result, the business education staff had one more full time teacher than was needed.\nNone of the department\u2019s six business education teachers was certified to teach in any other subject area. All six teachers were evaluated according to the provisions of the School Code, 24 P.S. \u00a7 1-101 et seq., and the requirements of the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Education. Theros was found to be the teacher with the lowest quality rating and the lowest total rating. On July 6, 1976, the School Board reviewed the ratings of the business education teachers and placed Theros on suspension. At the same time it authorized the superintendent to inform the Department of Education of the entire procedure, and Theros was notified that he would be suspended, effective September 8,1976. Following a hearing which Theros requested pursuant to Local Agency Law, the School Board affirmed the suspension of Theros from his position as a professional employee in the Warwick School District.\nTheros appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County which affirmed the School Board and dismissed the appeal. On appeal to the Commonwealth Court, the order of the Court of Common Pleas was reversed and the case remanded for \u201centry of an order directing the reinstatement of [Theros] as a professional employee of Warwick School District with payment of an amount of money equal to the compensation he would have been paid during the period of suspension.\u201d We granted the School Board\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nTheros does not assert that the School Board suspended him for political or arbitrary reasons. He maintains only that the Board failed to establish a cause of suspension under \u00a7 1124 of the School Code, which provides as follows:\n\u201cAny board of school directors may suspend the necessary number of professional employes, for any of the causes hereinafter enumerated:\n\u201c(1) Substantial decrease in pupil enrollment in the school district.\n\u201c(2) Curtailment or alteration of the educational program on recommendation of the superintendent, concurred in by the board of school directors, approved by the Department of Public Instruction, as a result of substantial decline in class or course enrollments or to conform with standards of organization or educational activities required by law or recommended by the Department of Public Instruction;\n\u201c(3) Consolidation of schools, whether within a single district, through a merger of districts, or as a result of joint board agreements, when such consolidation makes it unnecessary to retain the full staff of professional employes.\n\u201c(4) When new school districts are established as the result of reorganization of school districts pursuant to Article II, subdivision (i) of this act, and when such reorganization makes it unnecessary to retain the full staff of professional employes.\u201d\nClearly, the causes enumerated in paragraphs three and four were not applicable to the facts of this case. From the record of the hearing before the Board, it is also clear that the suspension of Theros was not based on a substantial decrease in pupil enrollment and that the elimination of supervisory positions in the district did not constitute curtailment or alteration of the educational program. In addition, the parties stipulated that if a teacher in the Business Education Department could be suspended legally, Theros was the appropriate one to be suspended.\nThe Board does not claim that Theros was suspended for any of the four causes enumerated in \u00a7 1124. Instead, it maintains that \u00a7 1124 does not contain an exclusive list of permissible reasons for suspending a professional employee. The Board bases its claim for authority to decrease staff size when economic conditions require on the general powers granted to school directors by \u00a7 1106 of the School Code, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1106, and by Article 3, \u00a7 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Section 1106 provides as follows:\n\u201c[T]he Board of School Directors in every school district shall employ the necessary qualified professional employes, substitutes and temporary professional employes to keep the public schools open in their respective districts in compliance with the provisions of this Act.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)\nThe Pennsylvania Constitution, article III, \u00a7 14, directs the General Assembly to \u201cprovide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education . . . . \u201d (Emphasis supplied)\nThe Board insists that \u00a7 1124 must be interpreted in light of the above constitutional and statutory provisions which justify the exercise of discretionary managerial authority by school boards in employment matters. It argues that the employment of unnecessary professional employees would violate its duties under \u00a7 1106 of the School Code as well as the Constitution\u2019s mandate for an \u201cefficient\u201d system of education. The Board asserts support for its claim in Pennsylvania case law relying principally on a 1939 decision by this Court in which earlier comparable statutory and constitutional provisions were invoked as authority for approving a suspension. Ehret v. Kulpmont Borough School District, 333 Pa. 518, 5 A.2d 188 (1939).\nThus, the Board argues that \u00a7 1124, which enumerates four specific causes for suspension, must be reconciled with the general grant of power given to school boards by the Constitution and \u00a7 1106 to hire the necessary teachers and to conduct an efficient system of public education. In determining the legislative intent in this matter, we are aided by a review of the history of \u00a7 1124.\nIn 1937 the Teachers\u2019 Tenure Act was enacted to assure continuous employment to capable and competent professional educators by removing the discretionary power of school boards to suspend or dismiss employees without cause. See Streibert v. York School Directors, 339 Pa. 119, 14 A.2d 303 (1940); Malone v. Hayden, 329 Pa. 213,197 A. 344 (1938). At that time the only cause for suspension provided by the School Code was a \u201csubstantial decrease of pupil population within the school district.\u201d In 1939 this Court was required to interpret the Tenure Act in Ehret v. Kulpmont Borough School District, supra. There we approved the suspension of a tenured kindergarten teacher where the district\u2019s non-mandated kindergarten had been discontinued. The opinion in Ehret reflected the Court\u2019s uncertainty as to the effect of the Tenure Act on suspensions when it stated:\n\u201cIf the legislature intended teachers to be employed, or retained, who are rendered unnecessary by the abolition of a department, in order to preserve the continuity and efficiency of the school system as a whole, it should have set forth such intention. . . . \u201d 333 Pa. at 526, 5 A.2d at 192.\nResponding to Ehret, in 1939 the General Assembly amended \u00a7 1205 of the 1911 School Code to change \u201csubstantial decrease in pupil population\u201d to \u201cpupil enrollment\u201d, as the first and fundamental cause of suspension. Further, the General Assembly addressed the specific problem presented by Ehret \u2014 viz., the abolition of departments and positions as well as changes in curriculum, by allowing for suspensions in the event of curtailment or alteration of program, provided the change was a result of substantial decrease in enrollment and was approved by the Department of Instruction. Finally, in the 1939 amendment the General Assembly provided for suspensions in the event of school consolidations. Section 1124 of the 1949 School Code substantially re-enacted the 1939 amendment to \u00a7 1205. In 1963, the legislature amended \u00a7 1124 by adding a fourth cause of suspension \u2014 viz., the reorganization of school districts.\nA review of the legislative history of \u00a7 1124 clearly shows the General Assembly has responded over time to changed circumstances since the initial passage of the Tenure Act by enumerating additional causes for suspension. In so doing, its clear intent was to exclude all other causes not so enumerated in order to protect the rights of tenured professional employees.\nThus, the Board\u2019s contention that \u00a7 1124 does not delineate a complete list of permissible reasons for suspension must fail. Such an interpretation would render \u00a7 1124 meaningless since it would set no restrictions whatever on the Board\u2019s power to suspend. Clearly, this was not the legislature\u2019s intent.\nFurthermore, our case law is in accord with the conclusion that \u00a7 1124 contains the only four statutory reasons for which a tenured employee may be suspended. See Alberts v. Garofalo, 393 Pa. 212, 142 A.2d 280 (1958); Bragg v. Swarthmore School District, 337 Pa. 363, 11 A.2d 152 (1940); Fatscher v. Board of School Directors, 28 Pa.Cmwlth. 170, 367 A.2d 1130 (1977). Since the Warwick School Board\u2019s action was not prompted by any of the causes specified in the Code but instead was taken to reduce the district\u2019s operating expenses, it was unlawful. As necessary and desirable as the goal of budgetary economy may be, it is not included among the reasons permitted by the General Assembly for suspending a tenured professional employee.\nThe Pennsylvania Constitution, Article 3, \u00a7 14, places responsibility for the educational system with the General Assembly. If the financial burden of operating Pennsylvania\u2019s system of public education has become so onerous that cutbacks in tenured professional staff are required, the General Assembly has the authority to respond by further amending \u00a7 1124 to permit suspensions for additional reasons. This Court should not presume to interfere with the General Assembly\u2019s constitutional authority for reasons of public policy.\nI would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court and remand the case to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County to proceed in accordance therewith.\nNIX and LARSEN, JJ., join in this opinion.\nLARSEN, J., files a separate Opinion in Support of Affirmance.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\nLARSEN, Justice.\nI join in Mr. Chief Justice O\u2019Brien\u2019s Opinion in Support of Affirmance. Additionally, I would like to add that the reason the legislature limited suspensions of teachers to the four enumerated situations was for the purpose of maintaining the quality of education. The legislature has wisely recognized that quality education of children is a priority service that must be provided to them both for their benefit and the benefit of our society. See Walker v. School Dist. of Scranton, 338 Pa. 104, 12 A.2d 46 (1940) (underlying purpose of Teacher Tenure Act is to achieve fundamental public policy of obtaining best education possible for the children of the Commonwealth) and Kaplan v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 178 Pa.Super. 88, 113 A.2d 164 (1955), aff\u2019d. 388 Pa. 213, 130 A.2d 672 (1957) (intent of general assembly in enacting Teacher Tenure Act, including section 1124, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1124, is to provide for the welfare of the students by providing them with best education possible). While \u201ceconomic measures\u201d such as suspending teachers for reasons other than those enumerated in section 1124 can provide financial savings, the General Assembly has determined that such measures are not educationally sound.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThe Opinion in Support of Affirmance authored by Mr. Chief Justice O\u2019Brien too narrowly construes statutory provisions permitting the suspension of professional employees of school districts. The conclusion that the Legislature intended Section 1124 of the School Code to delineate the sole permissible reasons for the suspension of teachers is not at all convincing.\nSection 1124 provides that the board \u201cmay\u201d suspend the necessary number of employees for \u201cany\u201d of the causes enumerated. Surely, had the Legislature intended that a board could suspend for only the causes enumerated, it would have said so. Interestingly, Section 1125 of the Code, 24 P.S. 11-1125, begins as follows: \u201cWhenever a board of school directors decreases the size of the staff of professional employees ...\u201d and the section goes onto provide a rating system for boards to follow in making suspensions. Section 1125 makes no reference to Section 1124 as providing the only reasons for which a staff may be reduced. Clearly, the Legislature intended that school boards have authority to decrease the size of their professional staffs when economic conditions require such a decrease.\nWe believe that Section 1124 must be interpreted in light of the constitutional and statutory provisions concerning the administration of education in the Commonwealth. Section 1106 of the School Code, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11 \u2014 1106, provides that: \u201cThe board of school directors in every school district shall employ the necessary qualified professional employees . . . to keep the public schools open in their respective districts . . . . \u201d The Constitution, Article 3, Section 14, directs the General Assembly to \u201cprovide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education . . . . \u201d In Ehret v. Kulpmont Borough School District, 333 Pa. 518, 5 A.2d 188 (1939), we recognized that a school board had discretion to add a supplementary department, in that case a kindergarten, and subsequently to suspend a teacher whose position was eliminated by the discontinuance of that department. In considering the statutory and constitutional provisions, we stated:\n\u201c \u2018Efficient\u2019 has reference not only to the qualifications of the teacher, but relates to other basic matters associated with the school system. There are many factors that enter into the meaning of the word \u2018necessary,\u2019 as we said in Wilson v. School Dist. of Phila., 328 Pa. 225, 236 [195 A. 90], What would be \u2018necessary\u2019 under this provision is a matter within the administrative discretion of the board to a large extent. Thus, the board has discretion to add supplementary departments, and by so doing to create a necessity for more teachers. The uncertainty of the school tax rate comes from the uncertainty of the amount that is required to pay the teaching staff of each district, which may be increased without outside interference, and may be decreased within the limitations of the Act. \u201cIf the legislature intended teachers to be employed, or retained, who are rendered unnecessary by the abolition of a department, in order to preserve the continuity and efficiency of the school system as a whole, it should have set forth such intention specifically in dealing with a subject as important as the one before us.\u201d\nIn Sporie v. Eastern Westmoreland Area Vo-Tech School, 47 Pa.Cmwlth. 390, 408 A.2d 888 (1979), the Commonwealth Court affirmed the suspension of a teacher, certified in agriculture, when the school\u2019s agriculture program was curtailed by the elimination of the vocational agricultural course. Citing Ehret, the opinion states:\n\u201cJust as the Court in Ehret found school boards vested with a general power, under the School Code of 1911, to suspend tenure teachers who are no longer necessary for the efficient operation of the school district because their department has been abolished, we find that school boards possess a similar power under the existing school code. By allowing the suspension of professional employees upon the alteration or curtailment of an educational program \u2018to conform with standards of organization . . . required by law\u2019 and by continuing, in Section 1106 of the Code, the requirement or standard that school boards shall hire only necessary teachers, the legislature has authorized school boards to suspend professionals made unnecessary by the curtailment or alteration of a school\u2019s educational program.\u201d\nTheros relies heavily on our decision in Alberts v. Garofalo, 393 Pa. 212, 142 A.2d 280 (1958). That case is clearly distinguishable. A close reading of Alberts makes it apparent that this Court was not at all satisfied that the abolition of Alberts\u2019 position and his removal as a professional employee was based purely on financial considerations. As Justice Cohen noted:\n\u201cAlthough there was testimony before the court below that this action was taken as an \u2018economy measure\u2019, no reason therefor was recorded in the minutes of the meeting; nor is there evidence that there had been previous discussion or approval of this action by the directors, the country superintendent of public instruction.\u201d\nConsiderations of public policy favor resolution of this case against the appellee. Increasingly, school districts are finding it difficult to meet the financial burden of operating their educational systems. For this Court to conclude that while a school district may abolish positions for economic reasons, it must nevertheless retain the teachers who held those positions even though those teachers would have no duties to perform, is to effectuate a result which the Legislature did not intend in enacting Section 1124. This is not to say that a school district may abolish a position or department merely to circumvent the tenure provisions of the Code or to suspend a professional employee for arbitrary reasons. It is only when a board has clearly established that the reduction conforms with the mandates of Section 1106 of the Code and the Constitutional provisions herein referred to, and that the suspension is made in accordance with the requirements of 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1125, that the reduction and suspension should be approved.\nHence, we would reverse the Order of Commonwealth Court and reinstate the Order of the Court of Common Pleas.\nROBERTS and KAUFFMAN, JJ., join in this Opinion in Support of Reversal.\n. Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as amended, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1124.\n. Act of December 2, 1968, P.L. 1133, formerly 53 P.S. \u00a7 11301 et seq., repealed by Section 2(a) of the Judiciary Act Repealer Act, Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202.\n. A professional employee may always be terminated for cause shown. Section 1122 of the School Code, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1122.\n. Thus, Ehret is mistakenly relied upon by the Board as authority for upholding Theros\u2019 suspension inasmuch as the Code was subsequently amended to permit suspensions resulting from program changes under circumstances which clearly are not present in this case.",
