        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nOn February 1, 1957, Anthony C. Corso (\u201ctestator\u201d) executed his will. The will provided that his wife Helen Corso receive in trust an amount equal to the maximum allowable marital deduction under federal estate tax laws and that their daughter Carol receive the residue of the estate in trust. The will also contained a tax allocation clause directing that all inheritance and estate taxes be paid from the residuary estate. Some fifteen years after the execution of this will, testator and his wife Helen were divorced. As a consequence, under section 2507(2) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, all provisions in testator\u2019s will \u201cin favor of or relating to\u201d his divorced spouse were rendered \u201cineffective for all purposes.\u201d Thereafter, testator married again, but did not alter his will. Testator died on September 19, 1976. His second wife, as an after-married spouse, received one half of the estate, \u201cthe share of the estate to which . . . [she] would have been entitled had the testator died intestate . . . . \u201d 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2507(3). The remainder of the estate went to testator\u2019s daughter Carol as residuary beneficiary.\nOn August 27, 1979, the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County entered a decree of distribution confirming the executor\u2019s final account, which, relying upon the pay-tax clause, charged all the taxes on the after-married spouse\u2019s intestate share to the residuary estate. Appellant Carol Corso filed exceptions to the decree, contending that since the pay-tax clause was intended to benefit only testator\u2019s former spouse, it was rendered ineffective upon testator\u2019s divorce by section 2507(2), along with all the other provisions \u201cin favor of or relating to\u201d his former spouse and thus could not benefit his second spouse\u2019s intestate share. The orphans\u2019 court en banc, Judge Boyle dissenting, dismissed appellant\u2019s exceptions and this appeal followed.\nRelying upon this Court\u2019s decision in Neamand Estate, 456 Pa. 22, 318 A.2d 730 (1974), the orphans\u2019 court held that the pay-tax clause was not revoked in toto by testator\u2019s divorce and thus applied to relieve testator\u2019s second spouse, taking by operation of law, of her share of estate and inheritance taxes. In fact, the issue here is not the extent to which section 2507(2) revokes the pay-tax clause but, rather, whether testator\u2019s second spouse, whose existence was uncontemplated when testator executed his will in 1957, may reap the benefit of the pay-tax clause in addition to her statutorily mandated intestate share. The rationale of our decision in Neamand Estate, supra, and fundamental principles governing the ascertainment of testamentary intent compel the conclusion that she may not, and accordingly we reverse.\nIn Neamand Estate, this Court held that a spouse who elected to take against the will could nonetheless receive the benefit of a general pay-tax clause quite similar to the one at issue here, ostensibly intended to benefit the share which the spouse would have received had she taken under the will. Neamand Estate did not hold, as the orphans\u2019 court stated, that a general pay-tax clause benefits any spouse, present or subsequent, who takes \u201cby operation of law.\u201d Rather, the holding is based primarily on the reasoning that, because \u201c \u2018every married testator knows, or is presumed to know, that his surviving spouse may elect to take against the will,\u2019 \u201d id., 456 Pa. at 34, 318 A.2d at 737, quoting Schmick Estate, 349 Pa. 65, 70, 36 A.2d 305, 308 (1944), a testator would intend a broad pay-tax clause to apply to his spouse\u2019s share whether or not she took under the will. Accord, Bertolet Estate, 483 Pa. 496, 397 A.2d 776 (1979).\nThus, the holding in Neamand is based upon a legal presumption of testamentary intent and was clearly intended to apply only to a spouse who was married to a testator at the time of the execution of the will and who later chose to elect against the will. In those specific circumstances, language in the will allocating taxes on transfers outside the will was held to evince the \u201ccontrary intent\u201d necessary to relieve a testator\u2019s spouse of tax liability on her elective share.\nHere, on the other hand, although the pay-tax clause refers to property outside the testamentary estate, it is absurd to suppose that testator intended the clause to benefit the intestate share of a spouse whose existence was undreamed of when he executed his will in 1957. Under the rationale of Neamand, we would have to presume that, at the time he executed his will, testator foresaw and provided for his subsequent divorce, remarriage, preservation of his will, and consequent partial intestacy. Law, as well as common sense, prohibits such a flight of fancy, for it is settled by our cases that \u201cone who writes a will is presumed to intend to dispose of all of his estate and not to die intestate as to any portion thereof.\u201d Carmany Estate, 357 Pa. 296, 299, 53 A.2d 731, 732 (1947); accord, Provident Trust Co. of Philadelphia v. Scott, 335 Pa. 231, 6 A.2d 814 (1939); Duffy\u2019s Estate, 313 Pa. 101, 169 A. 142 (1933).\nThe tax allocation clause in testator\u2019s will is clearly a provision \u201cin favor of\u201d testator\u2019s former spouse. Neamand Estate, supra; Loeb Estate, 400 Pa. 368, 162 A.2d 207 (1960). Indeed, since the will named only two beneficiaries \u2014 testator\u2019s wife Helen, whose taxes were to be paid, and their daughter Carol, who was to pay her mother\u2019s taxes \u2014 the pay-tax clause was intended to favor only testator\u2019s former spouse. Therefore, upon testator\u2019s divorce, section 2507(2) rendered the tax allocation clause \u201cineffective for all purposes,\u201d along with all the other provisions in the will \u201cin favor of or relating to\u201d testator\u2019s divorced spouse.\nOur decision today thus accords with both the plain language of section 2507(2) and fundamental principles of testamentary intent. When he executed his will in 1957, Anthony Corso did not intend to die intestate, did not intend to divorce and remarry, and thus could not have intended his subsequent spouse to benefit from the pay-tax clause or any other provision of his will. By operation of section 2507(3), testator\u2019s second wife receives an intestate share of her husband\u2019s estate. By no legitimate application of the principles governing the ascertainment of testamentary intent may she also derive a benefit from the will which he executed prior to his divorce and second marriage. See Carmany Estate, supra; see also Ellowitz Estate, 64 Lane. L.R. 127 (1974) (pay-tax clause not applicable to spouse who marries subsequent to execution of will and takes by intestacy); Nicely\u2019s Estate, 235 Cal.App.2d 174, 44 Cal.Rptr. 804 (1965) (intestate share may not benefit from pay-tax clause).\nThe decree of the orphans\u2019 court is reversed and the case remanded for entry of a decree consistent with this opinion.\nEach party pay own costs.\nKAUFFMAN, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. The tax allocation clause reads:\n\u201cNINTH: I direct my Executor to pay out of the principal of my residuary estate all Federal Estate, State Inheritance, or Estate and Succession Taxes imposed upon or with respect to my estate or any property in which I may have an interest, including any property not forming a part of my testamentary estate but included in my gross estate for tax purposes, except any property over which I have a taxable power of appointment in this Will, at such times and in such manner as my Executor, in its discretion, shall deem advisable, and no such taxes or any portion thereof so paid shall be collected from or paid by any other person, persons or Corporations by way of reimbursement, proration, apportionment or otherwise.\u201d\nThis case was reassigned to the present writer on February 3, 1981.\n. Section 2507(2) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, No. 164, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2507(2), provides for modification of a will by operation of law upon the divorce of a testator:\n\u201c(2) Divorce \u2014 If the testator is divorced from the bonds of matrimony after making a will, all provisions in the will in favor of or relating to his spouse so divorced shall thereby become ineffective for all purposes.\u201d\n. 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2102(2) provides that in cases of intestacy the surviving spouse is entitled to a one-half share of the estate \u201cif the decedent is survived by one child only .... \u201d\n. Appellant challenges only the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s allocation of Pennsylvania inheritance taxes on the intestate share to the residuary estate. The allocation of federal estate taxes is not in dispute.\n. The Legislature\u2019s amendment of section 3703 of the Probate Estate and Fiduciaries Code in 1976 to provide that a tax allocation clause shall not relieve an electing spouse\u2019s share of an apportionment of estate taxes and the subsequent enactment of section 2204(d) in 1978, providing the same rule as to inheritance taxes, would require a different result in Neamand Estate if the case were decided today.\nThese legislative actions do not affect the validity of the principles of interpretation of testamentary intent applied in the Neamand decision and in fact provide implicit support for the result we reach today. See Fiduciary Review, October, 1980, at 2 (statutes affecting Neamand provide \u201ca strong indication of legislative policy in a closely analogous situation\u201d).\n. The only time relevant to a determination of a testator\u2019s intended beneficiaries is the date of the execution of his will, not the date of his death.

        "text": "KAUFFMAN, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe sole issue presented here is whether a general pay-tax clause, which would have relieved a testator\u2019s divorced spouse of all tax liability on the share of his estate to which she would have been entitled if all bequests to her had not become ineffective by operation of law, has been revoked in toto by reason of the divorce. The court en banc answered in the negative. I agree and would affirm.\nThough paying lipservice to section 2507(2) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, No. 164, 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2507(2), the majority, by focusing solely on the testator\u2019s presumed intent at the time he executed his will, effectively ignores the statute and the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting it. Section 2507(2) provides for modification of a will by operation of law upon divorce of a testator:\n(2) Divorce \u2014 If the testator is divorced from the bonds of matrimony after making a will, all provisions in the will in favor of or relating to his spouse so divorced shall thereby become ineffective for all purposes.\nThere is no dispute that the personal effects and marital deduction bequests to testator\u2019s first wife thus have become ineffective for all purposes and that she takes nothing under his will. Appellant argues, however, that because the general pay-tax clause would have conferred an economic benefit upon the divorced spouse if her bequests had not been nullified by operation of law, it favors her and, therefore, it too has become ineffective for all purposes. I disagree.\nSection 2507(2) is a verbatim re-enactment of Section 7(2) of the Wills Act of 1947, in which the General Assembly, to promote justice, provided for modification of a will by operation of law upon a testator\u2019s divorce. Cf. McGuigen Estate, 388 Pa. 475, 131 A.2d 124 (1957). Under the prior law of this Commonwealth, a testator\u2019s subsequent divorce did not operate by law to revoke a testamentary gift to the divorced spouse. Re Jones\u2019 Estate, 211 Pa. 364, 60 A. 915 (1905). The Report of the Joint State Government Commission on Decedent\u2019s Estates, which Commission was responsible for drafting what eventually became Section 7(2) of the Wills Act of 1947, reflects the desire of the General Assembly to provide by law a testamentary scheme akin to that which it presumed a divorced testator would have intended in light of his dramatically changed circumstances:\nThis [section] is taken from section 53 of the Model Probate Code. There is no similar provision in the 1917 act. A will in favor of a named spouse remained good in Pennsylvania without regard to a subsequent divorce: Jones\u2019s Est., 211 Pa. 364. It is not a complete answer to say that the will can be changed or revoked. The testator may delay the change too long or may forget to make it or may be incompetent to make it. The real question is whether most persons so circumstanced (as in the case of later marriage or birth) would wish their wills changed or would wish them to remain the same, and there is no doubt that most would wish them changed.\nReport of the Joint State Government Commission of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania Relating to the Wills Act of 1947, p. 42, (1947). Assuming that a testator ordinarily would not wish to confer a testamentary benefit upon one no longer his spouse, the General Assembly concluded that continuation of will provisions favoring the former spouse was simply a matter of inadvertence and provided for revocation thereof by operation of law. Thus, the purpose of the statute clearly is to prevent the former spouse, and only the former spouse, from receiving any type of benefit under the will.\nA general pay-tax clause obviously applies only to those who receive part of a testator\u2019s gross estate for tax purposes. Since all bequests to the divorced spouse clearly were rendered ineffective by operation of law at the time of the divorce, the pay-tax provision here neither favors nor relates to her. It does mandate, however, that all death taxes otherwise chargeable to testator\u2019s wife at the time of his death be paid out of the residuary estate, even though she takes by operation of law.\nIt is ironic and unjust for the majority to interpret a statute designed to effectuate a decedent\u2019s presumed intent to nullify will provisions favoring his divorced spouse in a manner which results instead in detriment to his wife at the time of his death. The objective of the legislation was to bar only the divorced spouse from benefits under the will. I conclude, therefore, that the pay-tax clause has not been rendered ineffective and that testator\u2019s wife at the time of his death is entitled to take her share free of all taxes.\n. Act of April 24, 1947, P.L. 89, No. 38, as amended, Act of February 17, 1956, P.L. 1070, No. 346.\n. \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly....\u201d Statutory Construction Act of 1972, P.L. 1339, No. 290, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a).\n\u201c \u2018[I]n ascertaining the legislative meaning ... the report of a legislative commission or a Senate or House committee may, if obscurity or ambiguity exists, be considered.\u2019 \u201d McGuigen Estate, 388 Pa. 475, 482, 131 A.2d 124, 128 (1957) (citations omitted). Further, in construing an ambiguous statute, we must consider the object of the legislation, \u201cand the former law, including statutes, upon the same or similar subjects.\u201d Casey v. Pennsylvania State University, 463 Pa. 606, 615, 345 A.2d 695, 700 (1975).\n. I note that Paragraph Ninth of testator\u2019s will expressly applies to \u201cany property not forming a part of [testator\u2019s] testamentary estate but included in [testator\u2019s] gross estate for tax purposes.\u201d Thus, by unambiguous language testator provided that the pay-tax provision would apply to state inheritance taxes imposed upon all property whether part of his testamentary estate or otherwise. Although the second wife\u2019s share of testator\u2019s estate passed to her by operation of law, it was \u201cincluded in [his] gross estate for tax purposes.\u201d",
