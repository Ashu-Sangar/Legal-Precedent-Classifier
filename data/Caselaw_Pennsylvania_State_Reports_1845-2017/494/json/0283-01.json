        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nAppellant was tried before a jury for the beating death of a young Pittsburgh woman, found guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and sentenced to undergo incarceration for a term of not less than five years nor more than ten years. Appellant then brought this direct appeal in which he raises three issues: 1) the suppression court erred in finding that appellant\u2019s consent to a search of his residence was freely, specifically, unequivocally, and voluntarily given, see Commonwealth v. Mamon, 449 Pa. 249, 297 A.2d 471 (1972); 2) the trial court erred in not sustaining his demurrer on the grounds that the Commonwealth failed to prove the identity (i. e., name) of the victim; and 3) the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction because it was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant perpetrated the crime.\nWe have reviewed the record and find these contentions to be without merit. First, there was ample evidence to support the suppression court\u2019s finding that appellant freely, specifically, unequivocally, and voluntarily consented to a search of his residence, and that finding will not, therefore, be disturbed on appeal. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 467 Pa. 146, 152, 354 A.2d 886, 889 (1976). Second, appellant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth failed to prove the name and identity of the victim is not supported by the record; nor is appellant\u2019s assertion that the victim\u2019s name is an essential part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case supported by the law. And, finally, the circumstantial evidence considered as a whole, including the fact that appellant\u2019s footprints were found in the victim\u2019s blood and blood consistent with the victim\u2019s was found on appellant\u2019s clothing, forms a sufficient basis for the jury\u2019s conclusion that appellant perpetrated the crime. See Commonwealth v. Long, 470 Pa. 204, 368 A.2d 265 (1977), and Commonwealth v. Dawson, 464 Pa. 254, 346 A.2d 545 (1975).\nAccordingly, the judgment of sentence is affirmed.",
