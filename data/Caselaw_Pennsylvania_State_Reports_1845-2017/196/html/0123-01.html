After the plaintiff’s statement of claim was filed and before a plea was entered the defendants presented a petition for an interpleader between the plaintiff and Shupert and in which they averred that the garishee proceedings were served on them before they had any ‘notice of the assignment of the claim to the use plaintiff. The petition contained an offer by the defendants to pay into court the sum they owed for merchandise bought of Barnes &amp; Company or to dispose thereof as the court should order.

On October 8,1898, the court refused to order the plaintiff and the attaching creditor to interplead and made absolute that part of the rule allowing the defendants to pay the money into court.

The defendants then filed an affidavit of defense admitting the claim but again setting forth all the facts and circumstances of the •case, and in conclusion asked the court to so mold the judgment ■as to protect them from a double liability in the premises.
