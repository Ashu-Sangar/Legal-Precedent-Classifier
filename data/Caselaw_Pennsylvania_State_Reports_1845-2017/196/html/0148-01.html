It strikes the court, that, while an action of ejectment is an equitable actjon, the parties under the testimony introduced upon the one side and the other, rely principally upon what is called the legal or paper title, and, in disposing of these cases we will dispose of them along the line of the legal principles that we think apply under the law and the decisions to the question raised here; and that is relating to descent. What has been said by counsel that this would be a hardship and that, if we had any doubt as to how we ought to decide the case, we should settle the doubt by applying the equities in the case, we think hardly applies to these cases. There has been eliminated from the cases any defense, while they introduced some evidence along that line, of adverse possession, or any equitable defense, which makes, particularly an equitable defense in an action of ejectment, an equitable action. So I say that the parties here are depending on the one side and the other upon their legal titles, or paper titles, which they have to the contested interest in this tract of land and in the coal.</p>
