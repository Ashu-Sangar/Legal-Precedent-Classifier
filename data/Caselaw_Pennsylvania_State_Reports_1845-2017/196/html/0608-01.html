Jenkins, as my confidential agent and trustee, was the stock of the Spring Brook Railway Company which he converted to his own use, and thus appropriated property of mine which I valued at $100,000.

When I discovered that he was thus acting in breach of the trust he had accepted for me, both as to the railroad company stock, and the coal company stock aforesaid, I at once demanded an account and settlement, which being refused I filed in said Lackawanna county a bill in equity against him to compel such account and settlement, which is still pending.</p>
