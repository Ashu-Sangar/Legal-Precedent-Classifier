It does not appear that the defendant had any knowledge that the plaintiff was the owner of the bonds in suit, or that the plaintiff, who resides a¡t Jamestown, Pa., had any actual notice or knowledge of said call. The plaintiff became the owner of the bonds in suit in 1887, and continued such owner down to the time of the trial of this case, and on September 26, 1887, the plaintiff made a special deposit of the bonds in suit, and $20,000 of other Erie city coupon bonds, in said Keystone -National Bank of Erie for safekeeping, at which time plaintiff took a receipt from said bank as follows, viz:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b32-5" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[283,780,1178,964]]]'>The city in the present case was not misled. It had no knowledge that the bank had the custody of plaintiff’s bonds. This depositing of the $40,000 in the bank was not a payment of any of the bonds, and was not so intended. It was placed there that the bank might pay off the bonds for the city as they should be presented. Enough was not deposited to pay all the bonds, and certainly the city did not appropriate it or direct its appropriation to the payment of any particular part of the $50,000 call. There was $40,000 of this call of bonds not held by plaintiff, and had all of such other bonds been presented to the bank it would have been plain duty of the bank to have redeemed such other bonds when presented, although that would have exhausted the deposit and left plaintiff’s bonds unpaid. In fact the bank did expend $31,000 in redemption of such other bonds. How can it then be successfully urged that the remaining $9,000 actually paid that amount of Mrs. Gibson’s bonds; for if the city’s placing the $40,000 in the bank operated as a payment of any of plaintiff’s bonds it paid them all, which is not contended.</p>

The city called in the bonds and stopped the interest. Therefore, in my opinion, the plaintiff is entitled to recover on her bonds, with lawful interest from the date when demand for payment was made. This result does no injury to the defendant, as plaintiff recovers no interest on her bonds from January 1, 1897, to January 12, 1898.</p>

The fact that the bank collected her coupons and sent her the proceeds did not in the least impair her own title to the bonds. The bank was the agent of the city for the purpose of paying the interest, and was also its agent for the payment of the principal to the extent of $40,000 when that amount was deposited by the city for that purpose. The plaintiff has the bonds and is entitled to have the money for them from the city.</p>
