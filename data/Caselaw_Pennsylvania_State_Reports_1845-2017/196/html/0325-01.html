It would not be profitable labor in this connection, to distingnish between the case in hand, and the cases cited by the counsel for exceptants, in support of his contention.

The argument in support of this view rests wholly upon the fact that the gift is to the brothers' and sisters as a class, reinforced, as it is claimed, by the further circumstance, that the clause of the will next following the gift, provides that the child or children of any of the brothers or sisters “ who may then be dead,” shall take and receive the share that his or their parent would have taken if living. It is insisted that the period here fixed is annexed to the gift itself, and not merely to its payment; that the individuals entitled to take under this bequest could not be ascertained until after the determination of the life estate, and that the occurrence of such an uncertain event, as the survival of any particular brother or sister, or child of brother or sister, deceased, being required, has the effect to.make the remainder contingent.</p>

But this is far from sufficient; before it can avail to postpone the vesting of this legacy, it must appear plainly, manifestly and indisputably to be the construction the testator intended; not resulting from the application of artificial rules, but the unmistakable meaning derived from the language used. Such was the test applied in King v. King, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20206" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 206">1 W. &amp; S. 206</a>.</p>

The circumstance of a limitation over in case of the death of a legatee, whether single or one of a class, before the time appointed for the enjoyment, is held to be explanatory of the sense in which the testator intended the legatee’s interest in the fund to depend, on his surviving the period of distribution, namely that at that period it should become absolute and indefeasible, and always in such case it vests immediately. This rule may be found in 2 Jarman on Wills, p. 425, and in the note, a citation of many American cases in which it has been applied. The authorities in our own state which recognizes this principle are not few.</p>

Lukens, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20Pa.%2032" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="23 Pa. 32">23 Pa. 32</a>, the devise was to the <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>wife during life or widowhood, and “ whenever her death or marriage should take place,” it was to be equally divided among testator’s children “ which may then be alive, or who may have left legitimate heirs.” Two of the children died intestate, without issue. In deciding the case, Lowbie, J., says, “We cannot treat the expression ‘ legitimate heirs' ’ as meaning ‘ issne ’ in the technical sense; for we are sure that the testator had no thought of creating an estate tail. Nor can we substitute the word ‘ children ’ in the English sense, which is never equivalent to ‘heirs ’ if by so doing we should give to the first takers only a life estate, with an executory devise to their unborn children; for nothing was further from the intention of the testator than such an artificial devise as this. Besides, the rule that no limitation will be deemed an executory devise if it can be treated as a remainder, is too peremptory and too valuable to allow this. We cannot allow the word ‘whenever,’ referring to the time when the property is to be divided, to make the devise to children contingent; for that word, or its synonyms, almost always appear where a vested remainder is created: Kerlin v. Bull, 1 Dali. 175; Erame v. Stewart, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20485" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts 485">5 Watts, 485</a>.

Neither does it depend upon the defeasibility or indefeasibility of the right of possession; for many estates are vested without possession, as well as with, which are yet defeasible. If there is a present right to a future possession though that right may be defeated by some future event, contingent or certain, there is nevertheless a vested estate. An unpossessed estate is vested, if it is certain to take effect in possession, by enduring longer than the precedent estate. Any additional contingency destroys its vested character; but in this case there is no other.</p>

Besides this, it is plain that the very object of the clause was to prevent the estate of the devisees from being defeated by their death during the precedent estate. What then becomes of the shares of the two who died first ? The clause intending to provide for this is absurd in its literal sense, because it gives the land to them, even though they should be dead. The testator did not mean this, but something that is reasonable. It is manifest that he was thinking that some of his children might die before his wife, and that, if they should have children, these children ought not to be excluded by the will, and he unnecessarily inserts a clause expressive of this thought. When the two children died without issue, their brother Peter inherited their shares.”</p>

In this last mentioned case, the report of the auditor is given in full, and adopted by the court. We quote from it: “Where the devise is to a person when or if he shall live to attain a certain age or at a certain age, this standing alone would be contingent ; yet if it be followed by a limitation over if he shall die before a certain age, this is regarded as explanatory of the nature of the estate, which it was intended the devisee should take upon arriving at the age named, i. e., that it should then become absolute and indefeasible. The interest, therefore, in such eases, is held to vest upon the decease of the testator. Where the devise over is made dependent upon the first devisee <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>dying before he comes of age, or without issue, or any similar event, it is considered that the devise is equivalent to a provision that the first donor shall take an immediate vested interest, liable to be defeated by the happening of the contingency named; or if it do not happen, the estate then to become absolute and indefeasible.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[179,680,1186,1749]]]'>These authorities leave it beyond question that, primarily, a limitation over in the event of a legatee dying before the period of distribution, without more, denotes an intention that the gift shall immediately vest. Again, the bequest here to the brothers and sisters is unqualified and immediate. The effect of the subsequent clause is doubtless to divest the interest of any who died during the continuance of the prior estate leaving children. So much was intended; but it stops there. A gift intended to divest a previous vested interest is to be strictly construed, and an estate once vested will not be divested; unless all the events which are to precede the vesting of a substituted devise happen. And this applies as well in regard to events which respect the personal qualifications of the substituted devisee, as those which are collateral to him. In every case the original • devise remains in force, until the substituted devise is complete. Thus, if a devise is made to A. to be divested on a given event in favor of persons unborn or unascertained, it will not be affected by the happening of the event described, unless also the object of the substituted gift come in esse and answer the qualifications which the testator has annexed thereto: 2 J arman on W ills, p. 442. The author cites, in support of this principle, the case of Strother v. Dutton, 1 De G. &amp; J. 675, where the testator gave to his daughter R. 1,000 pounds to be invested and the interest paid to her for life, and at her death to be called in and distributed equally among her children: “ In case any lawful children are living from son or daughter, being dead, the issue of their marriage, that such child or children shall be equally entitled to the part or share their parent would be entitled to if they had been living.” R. had several children, of whom four died in her lifetime without issue; and it was held that the shares which vested in them on their births were not divested ; for the gift in favor of the. issue of the children who had issue, did not affect the shares of the children who died without leaving issue.</p>

And if the devise be to A., if or when he shall attain a given age, with a limitation over upon his death under that age without issue, A. takes a vested estate, defeasible only in the event of his death without issue under the specified age.

Many cases in our own and other states might be added to those cited by the court which clearly show the correctness’of his conclusions, but it is unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b356-7" data-blocks='[["BL_356.8",356,[239,1557,1179,455]]]'>The testatrix devised and bequeathed her entire estate to her executor in trust to convert the same into monej^ and to pay the interest and income thereof to her husband, Edward Carstensen, during his life. The -will then provides as follows: “And from and after the decease of my said husband, I give, devise, and bequeath the whole estate then remaining to my brothers and sisters; the child or children of any of my said brothers or sisters who may then be dead, to take and receive the share that his or their parent would have taken if living.”</p>
    <p id="b356-8" data-blocks='[["BL_356.9",356,[237,2019,1178,394]],["BL_357.1",357,[172,364,1183,1124]]]'>The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the ulterior bequest to the brothers and sisters was to them as a class, and ivhile conceding the rule to be that prima facie the members of a class are to be ascertained at the death of the testatrix, yet he maintains that the language used in Mrs. Carstensen’s will is sufficient to overcome that presumption and to show that at the time of distribution is the date at which those entitled to her estate are to be determined. He therefore in<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>sists that the interests of the legatees did not vest at the death of the testatrix. We are, however, by no means convinced that his interpretation of Mrs. Carstensen’s will is the right one. The brothers and sisters of the testatrix were in esse at the date of her death, and the time when they were to come into possession of their legacies was fixed by the will, to wit: at the death of Edward Carstensen, the life tenant. The bequest is not qualified, but is absolute and immediate. There was no condition precedent attached to the gift which the legatees were required to fulfil prior to receiving the bequest. The time fixed by the testatrix for the enjoyment of the ulterior interests in her estate was not annexed to the legacies themselves and was in no sense a part of the description of the objects of her bounty. The language of the will, under the well recognized rules of construction, does not support such a contention. It is evident that the only object of the testatrix in the postponement of the distribution of the estate among her brothers and sisters was the desire she had to give her husband a life interest in it. This is quite apparent from the whole will. We think, therefore, that the interest of the brothers and sisters was not contingent upon their surviving the life tenant, but that it vested at the death of the testatrix.</p>
    <p id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[170,1507,1187,918]],["BL_358.1",358,[248,361,1173,202]]]'>We cannot agree with the appellant that the condition upon which the legacies were liable to be divested or defeated was simply the death of the legatees in the lifetime of Edward Carstensen, the life tenant. The divesting contingency was not merely the death of the legatee during the continuance of the particular estate but it was his or her death during that period leaving a child or children. The testatrix in her will makes an absolute bequest to her brothers and sisters and then is added the clause: “ the child or children of any of my said brothers and sisters who may then be dead, to take and receive the share that his or their parent would have taken if living.” •There is no provision made in the will for the disposition of the interest of any brother or sister who might die prior to the death of the life tenant without leaving a child or children. In such an event, there is no divestiture of the title acquired by the general bequest. But should any of the brothers or sisters die leaving children during the life tenancy, the effect would be, under the clause we have just quoted, to divest the interest the <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>deceased parent acquired under the preceding clause of the will. The substituted legacy would thus become complete on the happening of this contingency and the interest bequeathed to the deceased parent would vest in his surviving child.</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[245,569,1177,866]]]'>The views above expressed are fully sustained by the authorities cited in the opinion of the court below and they need not be repeated here. They are likewise confirmed by the application of the well established rule that a legacy will be regarded as vested rather than contingent unless the language of the will indicates that the testator had a different intention. There is nothing whatever in Mrs. Carstensen’s will that affords any ground for the contention that she intended only those of her brothers and sisters and children of a deceased brother or sister who survived her husband, to participate in the distribution of her estate. On the contrary, the language used, we think, conveys a different intention and, as interpreted by the well known rules applied in the construction of wills, leads to the conclusion that the interest given the primary legatees in the will in hand was intended to be absolute and indefeasible, subject to be defeated only by the death of the legatee leaving children during the life tenancy of the first taker.</p>
    <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[243,1443,1177,553]]]'>It results from what we have said that on the death of William Maurice Johns, his interest in his sister’s estate was divested and such interest was thereupon immediately vested in his son, Willie M. Johns, who was his father’s only child and in esse at his father’s death. The son having died without issue, the interest in Mrs. Carstensen’s estate acquired by him during the tenancy of Edward Carstensen was, after the latter’s death, payable to the son’s legal representative. The interest of Samuel Dunn Johns who died without issue during the continuance of the life tenancy, was not divested and hence, in this distribution, must be awarded to his administrator.</p>

Even if the legacy to the brothers and sisters, being to a class, vested at the death of testatrix, it vested subject to the condition that it must open to let in after-born members of the class, and equally that it must close <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>or be narrowed as to any member dying in the lifetime of the husband. If the member so dying left issue then such issue came in under the express words of the will, not by inheritance but as purchasers whom no act of their ancestor could exclude. Their mere survivorship of him divested his interest if it was vested before. So in the other event of a member dying without issue, his interest was divested and he dropped out of the distribution by the necessary intendment that the gift should not go to any one else during the husband’s life, and that no brother or sister should have any benefit or control over it unless he or she survived the husband. This actual intent of the testatrix being to me perfectly clear, I would not permit any rules of construction to impose a different artificial or conventional meaning on her words.</p>
