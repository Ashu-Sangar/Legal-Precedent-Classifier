    <p class="summary" id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[246,653,1176,816]]]'>8. The 3d section of the ordinance reads as follows: “ Section 3.

    <p class="summary" id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[243,1477,1177,972]]]'>9. The 9th section of the ordinance provides that: “The said railway company shall at its own expense in addition to keeping said streets in good repair pave said portion of the streets on which it passes with asphaltum, fire brick or other suitable material whenever and as fast as the borough of Shamokin shall pave the other part of said streets, the material used to be subject to the approval of the town council, and in like manner shall pave the streets wherever turnouts shall be laid the entire width thereof between the curb lines for the full length of said turnouts and thirty feet beyond the extreme ends of such turnouts, and the said company shall at all times without delay, upon five days’ notice given by the chief burgess, repair and pave inside and outside of said tracks and turnouts whenever the same is out of repair, or if paved, the paving shall get out of repair, and upon failure of said company so to do, the borough of Shamokin shall do the work, and recover the expenses thereof with a penalty of twenty per centum of cost of such work added thereto in an action at law against the company.”</p>

Under the direction and supervision of the committee on streets and highways the defendant constructed a single track or line of railway as provided in said ordinance, “ beginning at the borough line near Sixth street, thence along and upon Sunbury street to Shamokin street, thence along and upon Shamokin street to Commerce street, thence along and upon Commerce street to Mt. Carmel street, thence along and upon Mt. Carmel street to the eastern boundary line of said borough.” Upon Sunbury street between Liberty and Rock streets at the time of the construction of the single track a siding was built north of the main track and connected therewith at Liberty and Rock streets. On account of the limited width of the street at this point, and objections made by property owners along it, the main track was laid south and the siding an equal distance north of its center line, thus giving the appearance of a double track railway. The siding is upwards of 400 feet in length, is located near the Northern Central and Reading Railway passenger stations and was intended for the use of cars to be operated between Hickory Ridge and Shamokin. As the Hickory Ridge branch was never built, a siding was not needed in the operation of the road, and it has been occasionally used as a place for the temporary storage of cars.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b191-3" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[184,1527,1179,765]]]'>11. The siding being unnecessary for the successful operation of the line of railway its maintenance was burdensome to the company, and it has for some years desired to take it out and straighten the track. This is evidenced by a letter of Mr. Smith, the president of the company, dated June 21, 1897, and directed to the chief burgess and town council wherein he, on behalf of his company, requests the privilege of shortening the “loop ” by the removal either of the part lying east of Washington street or the part west of that street. On failure '.to grant either request he stated that the company would exercise its right to remove one of the lines of track at any-time it might see proper to do so. July 6, 1897, the council acted on this request and authorized the chief burgess to notify the railway company “ that the borough would insist on the contract as it at present exists.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b191-4" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[188,2300,1175,145]],["BL_192.1",192,[266,386,1177,301]]]'>12. December 13,1898, the burgess approved an ordinance for the paving of Sunbury street with vitrified brick, and on May 31,1899, the contract was entered into with the Alcatraz <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>Paving Company to do the work. By this ordinance the railway company was directed to pave so much of the street as is required by the ordinance granting it the right of way, and on failure so to do the chief burgess and committee on streets and highways are authorized to pave and collect the cost thereof from the company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[266,696,1178,662]]]'>13. The company was about to take out the southern track on Sunbury street and move the north track over to the center of the street thus making a straight single track or line of railway through this portion of the street. Permission so to do had not been obtained from councils or the committee on streets and highways and it was protested against by the chief burgess. A bill was then filed and an injunction issued to restrain the threatened action of the company on the ground that it “is contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the borough of Shamokin.!’ This is denied in the answer and it is claimed that the reduction of the number of tracks and straightening the line “ would be to the advantage of the citizens of said borough, and especially to those residing on Sunbury street.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[263,1366,1180,662]]]'>14. That the proposed change would be beneficial to the abutting property owners, to the renters and business men and to all persons who ride or drive upon the street, can scarcely be questioned. We have testimony to the contrary to be sure, witnesses who own property on the street have given as their opinion that the two tracks with curves, frogs and switches are not more injurious than a single straight one, but this opinion was more or less influenced by the fact that with a single track they might have to face an assessment for paving. Councils knew that two trades would be burdensome and annoying, for in the ordinance granting the right of way they prescribed a penalty of paving the street from curb to curb the entire length and thirty feet beyond the end of each turnout.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b192-6" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[262,2037,1177,405]],["BL_193.1",193,[199,377,1180,95]]]'>15. While the siding seems to be unnecessary for the successful operation of the railway, and the company has for years desired to remove it, the right claimed to take out one track whenever it saw fit to do so, was not attempted to be exercised until after the excavation of the street for the paving. As with this siding or turnout in the street the company under its contract with the borough must pay the cost of paving from curb to curb it is very plain that the contemplated action was not <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>prompted by the uselessness of the tracks alone. We are well satisfied, that a desire to avoid this liability was a potent factor.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.6",193,[200,742,1181,406]]]'>This a novel case. Railway tracks have always been considered a burden on a street and treated as such. Only municipal authorities in whom the power has been vested can impose this servitude on the abutting property, and all contests have been waged to prevent the incumbrance. Here the proposed change in the tracks of the railway company would greatly improve the street and benefit the property owners, their tenants and all persons having occasion to drive on it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b193-6" data-blocks='[["BL_193.7",193,[201,1157,1188,820]]]'>Wherein the taking up of the south track and the moving of the north one to the center of the street is “ prejudicial to the interests of the borough of Shamokin ” is not set forth in the bill. Not a word can be found in that paper relating to paving, and the answer following its averments is also silent on the subject. The purpose of the introduction of the evidence relating to the paving of the street was to show wherein the removal of the track was prejudicial to the interest of the borough, and. that the uselessness of the siding was not the sole cause for taking up the track as might be inferred from the fifth paragraph of the answer. But the terms of the contract relating to paving, or how, or why the removal of the track at this time will relieve the company from liability is not.set forth in the bill. That an ample remedy at law has been provided in the ordinance for every default of the company in that line, may account for its not being introduced here.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b193-7" data-blocks='[["BL_193.8",193,[201,1985,1179,455]],["BL_194.1",194,[233,378,1180,855]]]'>Nor is it charged that the purpose of the company was to avoid liability, or that the motive which prompted the action in any way affected its right to take up the tracks. Complainant’s whole case is rested on the 1st and 3d sections of the ordinance granting the right of way with the reservation of supervisory powers to council and the street committee, and it is contended that under this ordinance, which is the contract between the parties, no rail can be changed, taken up, or removed without permission of the municipal authorities. This is denied by the <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>respondents and thus the issue is raised. Its determination depends entirely upon the construction of the above sections of the ordinance. As the company contemplates the relocation of one track and the taking up and removal of another, two questions present themselves. By the 1st section the “railway track, switches, turnouts and sidings are in all cases to be located under the supervision of the committee on streets and highways.” To hold that when the main track and sidings were once placed on the ground that the duties of the committee were at an end and their power of supervision, exhausted, would be a cramped construction of the section. In effect this would turn over the streets to the railway company and they could relocate their tracks at will, changing them from side to side regardless of the rights of property owners and the traveling public. It is clear to us that if the company want to change the location of either the main track or siding, consent of the street committee must first be obtained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[229,1253,1179,921]]]'>Nothing in this section bears on the right of the company to take up, remove or abandon a track or siding, and if-any prohibition exists if must be in the 3d section of the ordinance. If we take that part of the section printed in the bill alone the borough would have a clear case. By it the track shall in no instance be changed except under the direct supervision of the borough council. But the whole section is one cumbersome sentence which treats of grades, “ the track shall be laid to grade, shall strictly conform to existing grades, unless consent be given to their change or alteration, in which event, shall conform to altered grades, company shall take up and change railway so as to conform to such grades, as may be fixed by the authorities, ” etc. Only by reading the entire sentence can one gather its true meaning. By doing so we are led to the conclusion that when in the first clause it sajrs, “ the track shall be laid to grade, and shall in no instance be changed, ” the change meant is one of grade and that such change can only be made by resolution of council.</p>

Whether this was because it was thought the taking up of any portion of the track would by that much reduce the burden on the streets, or, owing to the belief that this was a progressive company and would want more room rather than less, the present situation was not anticipated, is not material. We must take the contract as the parties have made it.</p>
