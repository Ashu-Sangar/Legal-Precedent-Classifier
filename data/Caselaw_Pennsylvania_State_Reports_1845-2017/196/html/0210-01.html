Your orators aver that said defendants have not the power and authority claimed by them as set forth in paragraph six and aver that the said election was not due and legal, but that the same was invalid and illegal, for the following reasons:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b233-8" data-blocks='[["BL_233.7",233,[196,1370,1185,455]]]'>(1) That the ordinance of said borough purporting to authorize the increase of indebtedness for the purpose of purchasing or erecting an electric light plant, was not legally ordained and enacted by said council, in that it purports to have been passed at a special meeting of said council held January 5, 1900, of which meeting the minutes of said council fail to show notice to the members of said council and at which meeting only six of the eight members of said council attended and of which meeting legal notice was not given.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b234-6" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[262,489,1175,196]]]'>(4) Said ordinance failed to designate the year in which the proposed election should be held and therefore there was no authority for advertising an election to be held February 20, in the year 1900.</p>
