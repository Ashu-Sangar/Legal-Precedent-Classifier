In the meantime, to wit: on July 24, 1896, a bill was filed in this court by Hugh C. Moore against <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>the Lincoln Park and Steamboat Consolidated Company, alleging the insolvency of the said company and praying for the appointment of receivers, whereupon this court, the same day, July 24, 1896, issued an injunction against the officers of the company, restraining them from further continuing the business of the company or interfering with its property, and appointed George McGowan and Bernard Gilpin receivers of the property, real and personal of the said company. An ancillary receivership was appointed in the state of New Jersey consisting of Messrs. McGowan and Gilpin, with a resident of the state of New Jersey, as required by the laws of the state. Upon the appointment of the receivers they took the steamboats out of the custody of the sheriff, and proceeded to operate them during the summer season, carrying on the business of the Lincoln Park and Steamboat Consolidated Company the same as before the attachment and receivership. No order of court was made authorizing the receivers to do this, but it appears to have been done on some agreement between them and the sheriff. After the summer season had closed, to wit: on October 17, 1896, the sheriff presented his petition to the court alleging that the steamboats were chargeable and perishable, and asking for an order to sell the boats. The auditor reports on page 64 of his report that “ there was considerable trouble in procuring the consent of the sheriff to the receivers selling the boats ” all of which was unnecessary as the sheriff was the proper party to make the sale. After considerable delay and very large expenses had been incurred, the Georgeanna was sold for $8,800, and the Vibbard for $6,800, making a total of $14,600, out of which was deducted the auctioneer’s bill for advertising and commissions amounting to $1,270.23, thus leaving a balance of $13,329.77, for distribution amongst the creditors.</p>

The first and principal exception is to the allowances to the receivers, it being alleged that they are mere intruders, who took the boats out of the hands of the sheriff for the purpose of carrying on the business of the park during the summer season, without any authority of law whatever. We are of the opinion that the exceptions to the allowance of any sum to the receivers, or to their counsel, or bondsmen, should be sustained, under the principle laid down in the late case of Lane v. The Washington Hotel Company, <a href="/pa/190/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="190 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="905129" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0230-01">190 Pa. 230</a>, in which it was decided that even when receivers are authorized to carry on a business and sell the property of the company of which they are receivers, they cannot diminish the fund due to the creditors who are secured by liens by retaining an allowance for receivers’ commissions and counsel fees.</p>

However, with that authority before us, which we welcome not only as a guide, but as the application of a wise, just and sensible principle of law, we sustain the exceptions and disallow all claims of the receivers and counsel, referring them for their compensation to the fund which they received in New Jersey from the sale of the property there, and the use of the boats.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b545-4" data-blocks='[["BL_545.3",545,[158,364,1178,1908]]]'>
      <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>The next and important question is upon the claim of the Equitable Trust Company. The steamboats Chauncey Vibbard and Georgeanna belonged to the Lincoln Park and Steamboat Consolidated Company, a corporation whose residence was in the state of New Jersey, and Bridgeton, the port of entry in the collection district in which the residence of the Lincoln Park and Steamboat Consolidated Company was located, is the place where those steamboats should have been enrolled: The Thomas Fletcher, 24 Fed. Repr. 375. Instead of that they were enrolled in the custom house at Philadelphia, and the mortgage of said boats was also recorded there. It is a well settled principle of United States maritime law that a vessel must be enrolled or registered in the home port of its owner. Where there are several owners the vessel may be enrolled in the home port of the ship’s husband or managing owner. It is contended that inasmuch as George McGowan, the president of the Lincoln Park and Steamboat Consolidated Company, resided in Philadelphia, his residence justified the company in enrolling and registering the boats in the custom house at Philadelphia, where they were previously enrolled. But the fallacy of that argument consists in this, that Mr. McGowan is not a part owner of the boats, he was merely a shareholder in the company which owns the boats. Mr. McGowan had no individual interest whatever in the boats as boats. He had shares of stock in a company, which company was the sole owner of the boats, and as that company resided in the collection district of Bridgeton, New Jersey, the steamboats should have been enrolled there in order to give a lien for any mortgages thereon. Without elaborating upon the law on this subject it is sufficient for us to refer to the case of Johnson v. Merrill, <a href="/mass/122/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="122 Mass. 153" data-case-ids="2134649" data-case-paths="/mass/122/0153-01">122 Mass. 153</a>, where the law has been fully considered and decided by Chief Justice Guay. See also on this point the cases of White’s Bank y. Smith, 7 Wallace, 646, The Augustine Kobbe, 37 Fed. Repr. 696, and The John T. Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Woods%2061" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Woods 61">3 Woods, 61</a>. The claim of the Equitable Trust Company is like that on a mortgage of real estate recorded in the wrong county. It acquires no lien, having been recorded in the wrong county.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[161,2279,1175,147]],["BL_546.1",546,[296,370,1175,407]]]'>Nor can the claim be sustained as a merely temporary enrollment of the vessels. They were enrolled February 27, 1893, on the oath of George McGowan, president of the Lincoln <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>Park and Steamboat Consolidated Company. The company became insolvent in July, 1896, and the steamboats were levied upon in July, 1896. This enrollment of more than two years cannot be considered a temporary enrollment. Besides this, a temporary enrollment will not support a mortgage. We sustain the auditor in rejecting the claim of the Equitable Trust Company as trustee and mortgagee and relegate it to the list of general creditors.</p>

An interlocutory order was made with the consent of all the parties on May 29, 1899, for the payment of the auditor, the stenographer, the prothonotary, the printing of the auditor’s reports, and some minor expenses, amounting altogether to $2,174.15. By the same order certain claims of seamen’s wages and towing prior to the attachment were allowed, amounting to $1,590.08. The total of these payments, $3,764.23, will be first deducted out of the fund for distribution.</p>

Objection is made to this claim on legal grounds. Messrs. Morris &amp; Mathis, it is alleged, were shareholders and directors or managers of the Lincoln Park and Steamboat Consolidated Company, and it is argued that because they are such, they are not entitled to a preference over the lien creditors of the company, for this the cases of the Murphy Tugs, 28 Fed. Repr. 429, and the Queen of the St. Johns, 31 Fed. Repr. 24, are cited. Without deciding the case as a question of law, we prefer to pass upon it as the auditor has. He finds that the work was done upon contracts made with and upon the credit of the company, and not under a contract express or implied, for a lien upon the boats. These claimants had a running account with the Lincoln Park Company, with whom the dealings were had, as owners on their personal credit. The boats were not in distress nor was the owner known to be insolvent. On the contrary the owner made payments on account of this claim. Following the auditor we relegate this claim to the list of general creditors.</p>

Therefore, all expenses incurred and paid by them in suits in this and other courts will be allowed. We have gone to the utmost length of indulgence in this matter. The order of court made on the petition of the sheriff directing the receivers to sell the boats does not entitle the receivers to commissions or counsel fees in preference to fixed liens. The misunderstanding as to the receivers’ compensation has been caused by treating the account before us as a general account, whereas it is merely an account of the moneys received from the sale of two steamboats which were incumbered by maritime liens in excess of the amount they sold for. The auctioneer’s charges for selling the boats, §1,270.23, appear to us to be extravagant, but having been paid, we have approved the payment. The act of the receivers taking possession of the boats and keeping them for a long time increased the sheriff’s costs and wharfage, making the costs |506, and altogether there does not appear to have been that watchful regard for the rights of the creditors and others interested in the sale of the boats which should have been given.</p>

Following the decision in Johnson v. Merrill, <a href="/mass/122/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="122 Mass. 153" data-case-ids="2134649" data-case-paths="/mass/122/0153-01">122 Mass. 153</a>, we have heretofore decided that the mortgages held by the trust company were improperly enrolled in the custom house in Philadelphia instead of Bridge-ton, New Jersey, and therefore, we decided that they were not a lien on the vessels. Reflection leads us to a different conclusion. Section 4141 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (act of December 31, 1792) provides that “every vessel shall be registered by the collector of that collection district which includes the port to which such vessel shall belong at the time of her registry: which port shall be deemed to be that at or nearest to which the owner, if there be but one, or if more than one, the husband or acting or managing owner of such vessel, usually resides.” Previous to registry an oath is required showing the place where the vessel was built, her owner or owners’ names and place of abode, with some other details, and the penalty for false swearing is the forfeiture of the vessel Sections 4142, 4143.</p>

Therefore, the residence of the owner, if only one, or the ship’s husband, if there are more owners than one, was designated as the place at which registry or enrollment should be made. Registers for vessels owned by an incorporated company may be issued in the name of the president or secretary of the company, but a new registry or enrollment must be taken out on the death, removal or resignation of such president or secretary: Act of March 3, 1825, secs. 4137, 4138, 4313, 4315. These sections are permissive and have no application to the present case, as the vessels of the Lincoln Park Company were enrolled in the name of the company and not in the name of its president or secretary.</p>

Ownership was generally vested in individuals who resided at or near the port from which their vessels sailed, and their residence was a fact generally known or easily ascertained upon inquiry; but now, in view of the great increase in the business of transportation by vessels and the change in the present modes of living, by which business men have more than one residence, it is casting a heavy burden on the mortgagee of •a vessel to require him to inquire where the owner of an enrolled vessel lives, and if he has two residences, which is his legal residence, as for voting or taxing purposes. If the owner has a residence in two states, between which he divides his time equally, or even unequally, is a mortgagee bound to take the risk of deciding which is the legal residence of the owner and the <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>home port of the vessels owned b}r him. Or, if the owner resides in an inland state, as Montana, for instance, and buys a vessel in Boston and enrolls her there, is a mortgagee to decide whether the owner should have enrolled the vessel at some other port, as New York, New Orleans, or Portland, Oregon, which is nearer the place at which he usually resides ? Judge Wake in the case of The St. Lawrence, <a href="/f-cas/21/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Ware 211" data-case-ids="6563239" data-case-paths="/f-cas/21/0185-01">3 Ware, 211</a>, had this question before him, and he decided that where the legal domicile of a ship’s husband was in Northport Maine, but he passed two thirds of his time in New York and carried on business there, he might enroll the vessel in New York. This ruling would apply to a corporation, which, while it may be said to reside, so far as a corporation can be said to have a residence, in the state in which it was created, nevertheless does business in other states. Thus a corporation chartered in West Virginia and transacting its business in another state or other states, of which it is common knowledge that there are many, might be at a loss to know where to enroll its vessels. We may very readily conclude that if such a corporation enrolls its vessels in the port in which it transacts its business, it complies with the law so far as it can ; and we may also conclude that any corporation licensed to do business in a state other than that which created it, may enroll its vessels there without fear of their being forfeited, and that a mortgagee may safely enroll its mortgage in the port where the vessel is enrolled in order to obtain a lien thereon. We must give the statutes an interpretation which will facilitate the transaction of business according to the changes in the customs and conditions of the people engaged in business, otherwise the laws made for the lawful transaction of buiness would be the means of causing insecurity instead of the safety they meant to insure.</p>

As the learned judge of the court below in his opinion of July 5,1899, sustained some of the exceptions to the report of the auditor, and referred it back to him for the purpose of restating the account and allowances, it could not be considered as a final decree of distribution. Besides the opin<a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>ion of July 5, 1899 was modified by the opinion of November 2,1899. The final distribution of the fund made by the auditor was subsequent to and in conformity with the opinion of July 5, 1899, as modified by the opinion of November 2,1899. We therefore affirm the final distribution as made, upon the opinion of Judge Arnold modified as above stated.</p>
