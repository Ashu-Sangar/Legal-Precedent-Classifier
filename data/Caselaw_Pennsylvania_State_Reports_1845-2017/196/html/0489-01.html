There have undoubtedly been cases in which we have held that where language somewhat similar was used, the failure of issue, upon which the estate of the first taker was to determine, was a definite and not an indefinite failure of issue; but, in all of these cases some particular reasons, founded upon the language of the will indicating that the testator intended a definite failure of issue, controlled the decision. It was contended for the appellants that such a reason exists in the present case, in the fact that the limitation over is to the sister Mary, by name, and that she, being a living person at the death of the testator, a definite failure of issue must have been intended, and that such a limitation was not too remote to sustain an executory devise. There are cases in which such a fact is held important, in connection with other considerations, but, standing alone, it is clearly not sufficient, as has been held in many of the cases. Thus, in Eichelberger v. Barnitz the limitation over was to the testator’s ‘ other three children, Adam and Anna Mary and Susanna.’ They were the testator’s own children, and were specifically named as second takers, which might be well urged against the failure of issue being regarded as indefinite; yet it was so held.”</p>
