Besides other indebtedness the real estate in both Warren and McKean counties was incumbered by mortgages and judgments. The land in McKean county had been sold for taxes, and the title under the sales had matured in one J. M. Wardwell by reason of a failure to redeem therefrom. The deceased during his lifetime had commenced an action in ejectment to recover the <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>same from the purchaser, which action was then pending. What has been termed an “ improvident bark contract,” had been made affecting a part of the timber land in McKean county. After the death of the decedent the ejectment case was abandoned, and in 1887 a proceeding in equity was commenced in McKean county in the name of the widow and the heirs against Wardwell, the purchaser and mortgagee of the lands in that county, resulting in the recovery of the land and finally in an adjustment of the bark contract, the sale of part of the timber thereon for $35,000, and the payment of the Wardwell indebtedness. While the accountant was the principal actor therein, this proceeding, adjustment, sale and payment was made by and in the name of the heirs, the fund not passing through the hands of the administrator as such. In order to raise a working fund the heirs also, in a limited way, undertook the manufacture and marketing of lumber from the land in Warren county, which, after an effort by a creditor to enjoin further work, was soon abandoned.</p>

To prevent encroachments upon the lines of the larger tract of land in Warren county by adjoining owners, a considerable sum was also expended by him in employing watchmen, erecting shanties for their accommodation, etc.</p>

The final adjudication in this matter may be found in Shearman v.

The exceptants contend that many of the items referred to are not proper credits in his administration account, and thus the present controversj'- arises.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[280,774,1180,497]]]'>It will be observed that the accountant was connected with these matters in various ways. 1.

Those arising out of the other relations remain to be settled. In the present controversy we have to do only with those which properly arise out of his administration of the estate. No creditors have intervened or are concerned. The difficulty arises from the inability of the accountant and the exceptants as heirs to agree upon a dividing line between acts properly of administration and those which are extra-administrative in character. A determination of the difficulty involves a consideration of the duties of an administrator as regards the real estate of a decedent under the law. There is no controversy as to the personal estate.</p>

The writing, marked “ Exhibit No. 1,” does not sustain any such inference, but rather strengthens a contrary conclusion. If general authority in the premises had been given to him as administrator this paper would have been wholly unnecessary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b105-6" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[213,1019,1179,457]]]'>It is contended, however, that if the excepting heirs did not expressly authorize in advance his control over the real estate and the disbursements made by him as administrator, that they had full knowledge during the progress of the settlement of the estate of the course being pursued by him, and of what was being done and what expenses were being incurred, and that their assent thereto must necessarily be implied from such knowledge.

He was then in funds, with additional receipts in prospect. The various items for which he now claims credit, aggregating $904.02, for “ protecting lands of the estate,” appear from the account and vouchers to have all been contracted and paid subsequent to the sale of the real estate. Those entitled “ debts, labor,” etc., aggregating $890.97, were all paid subsequent to the sale of the real estate, and, with but few exceptions, all contracted subsequent to that date. Those aggregating $856.96, for “ addition and repairs to house,” were contracted and paid subsequent to 1888, and some as late as 1895. Those aggregating $129.78, for “sundries,” except one item of $6.00 for entrance fee into cemetery, bear date subsequent to the sale. So, excluding the item of $8,000 for compensation of accountant, the same is true with the much larger part of the remaining items entitled “ taxes,” “ hotel bills,” “ telegrams and postage,” “ railroad fare and <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>hack hire,” and “ sundry legal expenses,” for which credit is claimed.</p>

As was said by Mehard, J., in Shearman v. Morrison, <a href="/pa/149/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="149 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="832523" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0386-01">supra,</a> “The defendant (now the accountant) was treasurer and paymaster for the plaintiffs (here the exceptants), as well as for himself. All parties evidently regarded him as the source from which the labor and materials for these repairs and improvements were to be paid. The plaintiffs must have believed that he was paying their proportion out of such of their money as they supposed he had in his hands.” The items of expense here referred to, and which the accountant as trustee was then seeking to set off against the trust fund in his hands are largely the identical ones for which he is now seeking an allowance. The fund for which he is now accounting, and which came into his hands as administrator, is as much an appropriated trust fund as that which came into his hands by virtue of the writings signed by the exceptants, for which he was then accounting. Here the terms of the trust and the duties of the trustee are fixed by statute. They are even less subject to the control of the parties than if they were in writing. The entire fund coming into the hands of the administrator was appropriated by law, first, to the payment of debts against the estate. This appropriation, without the knowledge and consent of creditors, could not be changed. We have been cited to no authority and know of none which holds that the terms of such a trust may be enlarged or changed by parol or otherwise by a part of the beneficiaries. The heirs’ interest therein comes in only secondarily, and as shown by the account there are still debts unpaid. The trustee gives security for the faithful performance of his duties under the law, and not those arising from subsequent collateral agreements among the heirs. Surely the liability of his bondsmen could not be enlarged without their knowledge or consent.</p>

All questions relating to these subjects were carefully considered and properly decided by the learned judge of the orphans’ court specially presiding., The services of the accountant were of an unusual character and of great value to the estate, but they were not performed by him entirely in his capacity as administrator. He was acting in his own interest as an heir, as a trustee for some of the other heirs, possibly as an agent for others, and as administrator. The allowance made is in excess of the usual amount, being five per cent of the total fund, a large part of which was realized from the sale-^of real estate. This is all he was entitled to. Whatever claim for compensation and for expenses incurred he may have against the other heirs may be adjusted in another proceeding, but it cannot be considered in this.</p>
