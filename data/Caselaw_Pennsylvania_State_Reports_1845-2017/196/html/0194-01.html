It is not necessary that he collect all these in one review. If he understands in detail all that he is about and chooses with understanding and reason between one disposition and another, it is sufficient for the making of a will.

In rightly determining that question there is only one safe and reliable test. If the testimony is such that after a fair and impartial trial, resulting in a verdict against the proponents of the alleged "will, the trial judge, after a careful review of all the testimony, would feel constrained to set aside the verdict as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, it cannot be said that a dispute, within the meaning of the act, has arisen. On the other hand, if the state of the evidence is such that the judge would not feel constrained to set aside the verdict, the dispute should be considered substantial, and an issue to determine it should be directed. This simple and only safe test is supported alike by reason and authority: Appeal of Knauss, <a href="/pa/114/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="114 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="549988" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0010-01">114 Pa. 10</a>; Herster v.

It appears that Thomas F. Yoglesong,, who instituted these proceedings, is a brother of testator, and that the two had only met four times in the last five years of testator’s life, yet Thomas said he believed that his brother’s mind was “ altogether off,” because his talk “ was from one thing to another; he would commence a thing and turn around and tell you something else.” Thomas failed to give any specific instance of this sudden change of conversational topic and from any point of view, his testimony is of little value. As an illustration of this it may be mentioned, that after stating in regard to his brother’s age, “ I guess he was about eighty-nine or something,” he corrected himself in answer to a leading question from his attorney and said, “ It was seventy-nine I guess; I can’t mind things like I used to.” The principal witness for the contestant was William P. Eckels, who was married to a sister of testator’s wife, and who, after years of litigation with testator about a farm, had the humiliation of seeing his antagonist successful. The witness was never satisfied with the result and averred <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>upon the stand that Mr. Yoglesong got about $273 more than was coming to him. The relations between Mr. Eckels and his brother-in-law were so strained that for many years they had no personal communication with each other, yet at an audit, at which they were both present, Mr. Eckels concluded that Mr. Voglesong “ didn’t seem to have the mind he ought to have,” because he denied that he had a sister Betsey. Upon cross-examination it was developed that he did not have a sister Betsey, but had a sister named Elizabeth, whose full name at the time of the audit was Mrs. Elizabeth Garman. The occasional expressions of the testator during the last few years of his life, that the Eckel’s people were still fighting him, can be readily construed to refer to the belief and assertion on their part that he had won an unjust legal victory over them. The only other witness for the contestant whose statements need to be specially noticed, was Samuel McKnight, who, in answer to a leading question (which really invalidates the testimony on this point), said that when the testator was asked to do something, he would answer both yes and no. McKnight’s deposition, taken as a whole, amounts to a very little, especially as he finally stated that in' the year 1897 the testator seemed to talk all right.</p>

Paul, who subscribed their names as witnesses thereto, is clear and convincing as to the testator’s soundness of mind on April 27, 1897, at the time he executed it. The testimony also of Rev. H. R. Fleck, S. F. Hauck, Sam-, uel Miller and numerous other persons who were brought into frequent contact with testator, showed that up to within a few weeks of his death, he was a good business man, with an intelligent understanding of his estate and of all transactions with which he was connected, and consequently thoroughly competent to make a will. He signed the will by his mark because his eyesight had been bad for sometime, and he wrote his name with great difficulty. It is true that a few weeks before his <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>■death, which occurred on March 24,1889, he became very feeble and his mind wandered, but prior to that time his sanity had not been questioned in his comparatively wide circle of friends and acquaintances.</p>
