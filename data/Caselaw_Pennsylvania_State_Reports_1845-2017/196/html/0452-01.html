Langdon is president, contemplated and still contemplates the construction of a railroad from Johnstown via Ehensburg to a point in Clearfield county near Ramey, the present terminus of the Altoona and Philips-burg Connecting Railroad. The Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad Company is duly chartered under the laws of the commonwealth, and has constructed and has in operation a railroad from Juniata borough in Blair county, to a point named Dougherty in Cambria county. The line of the road as constructed and operated is about fifteen miles in length. The Altoona and Philipsburg Connecting Railroad Company has a road constructed and in operation, from Philipsburg, Centre county, to Ramey in Clearfield county, a distance of about thirteen miles. The distance from Ramey, the present western terminus of the Altoona and Philipsburg Connecting Railroad to Dougherty, the present northwestern terminus of the Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad is about seventeen miles. [Between Dougherty and- Ramey there has not been any railroad constructed, and there is none in process of construction. The contemplated route of the Altoona, Beech Creek and Terminal Railroad is from the present terminus of the Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad at Juniata borough to Altoona, a distance of about two miles. Said road has not been constructed and is not yet in process of construction. There has been nothing done toward the construction of the Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ehensburg and Eastern Railroad from Johnstown to Ramey, except a survey of a route. Whether said survey has been properly adopted does not appear.] [12] This was and is the status of the railroads and railroad companies who became parties to the lease, which gives rise to the controversy in this case, at the time of its execution. The Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad Company executed its lease December 8, 1897, to Samuel P.

And while the lease does not fix any time within which the contemplated connecting railroads should be constructed, yet the evidence shows that the understanding of the parties was that they would be constructed within a year or more from the date of the execution of the lease. And as there was no definite time fixed in the lease, the law and equity would require that part of the contract to be complied with within a reasonable time. It would be of great interest to the Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad Company to have the connections provided for in the lease made. It would enhance the value of its road; then the rental, upon the completion of the connections was, as provided in the lease, to be one per centum of the gross earnings of the road from Ramey to Altoona, in addition to the |600 per annum; then, when the understanding of theparties at the time of the execution of the lease was that the connecting roads would be built during the summer and winter of 1898, and another year has elapsed since it was understood the roads would be built, and nothing has been done, and there is no immediate prospect of anything being done practically in relation thereto; then is not the lapse of over two <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>years, under the conditions of the lease, a reasonable time for the promotion of the enterprises, and at least to have the probability of their speedy completion, in some sound tangible shape ?

Up to this time, however, they have failed. They further urge as against the forfeiture of the lease, that they have expended moneys in making surveys of the contemplated route of the Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad, and in traveling to New York from Philadelphia and back, and in organizing the Altoona and Beech Creek Terminal, assume that the lessees did expend money hi surveying the route from Ramey to Johnstown, for the Pitts-burg, Johnstown, Ebénsburg and Eastern Railroad Company. It was done in the interest of that company, and was not, on -account of the lease having been made, and the lessor company is not a stockholder in the Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad Company. The same may be said as to the traveling expenses to secure funds for the construction of the Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad. The same may be also said as to the money alleged to have been expended in the organization of the Altoona and Beech Creek Terminal Railroad Company, one of the lessees. So that there does not appear from the evidence, any expenditure of money on the part of the lessees except snch as was to promote the advancement of the roads they, if constructed, would own and control, and in which the lessor company had no direct interest, that would raise- an equity against the termination of the lease, and surely any moneys expended to advance their own personal corporate interests conld raise none.</p>

By the decree made, the lease between the appellee and the Pittsburg, Johns-town, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad Company and the Altoona, Beech Creek and Terminal Railroad Company was declared to be null and void, on the ground that its execution had been ultra vires as to the parties to it. The learned judge was led to this conclusion under what he regarded as “ the great weight of authority, ” citing, in support of the view he expressed, Pittsburg and Connellsville R. R. Co. v. Bedford and Bridgeport R. R. Co. et al., <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20104" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="81* Pa. 104">81* Pa. 104</a>, and Van Steuben v. The Central R. R.

In the former case, Mr. Justice Sharswood, delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ The principal question which has been raised and discussed upon this motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction heretofore granted is, whether the Bedford and Bridgeport Railroad Company have any right to execute a lease to the Pittsburg and Connellsville Railroad Company, as proposed by the resolution offered in the board of directors at their meeting of October 13, 1870. If it shall appear that no such right exists, then it will be altogether unnecessary to consider and determine two other questions which have been the subject of much earnest contention before us.” The question there was, not whether a <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>contract already executed, as the one -before us, should be declared null and void and set aside as being ultra vires, but whether one, manifestly so, should, in the face of a complaining stockholder, coming into court before its execution and asking for equitable relief, be executed by the officers of the corporation. In the second case, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey sought to evade responsibility for its negligence by shifting it upon an alleged 'lessee; but, as no valid lease had been made — as the company had executed no valid agreement under which it could cast upon another the duty of carefully and properly operating the road — it, and it alone, was held to be liable. This is all that was decided by our Brother McCollum. There is a marked distinction between these cases, relied upon by the learned judge below, and the one we are now considering.</p>

If it is ultra vires now, it was ultra vires then, when the contract was solemnly entered into by this appellee, with the full knowledge that there was no connecting line, and equity will turn a deaf ear for relief from a compact intelligently and deliberately made when prayed for by a party to it, whose conscience has become quickened only when hopes are disappointed and expectations not realized. If we are asked to give equitable relief to extended hands, they must not only be clean, but unfettered by a contract of their own making. No one injured by this alleged illegal lease is here complaining, and the commonwealth that gave life and being to its creatures, retaining the right to at all times supervise their conduct, is not challenging the proper use of the powers and privileges conferred. Conscience, which is the source of equity, says to this appellee that its prayer for relief cannot be granted, and, if authority should be asked for, it will be found in the following and the many other utterances of our own court to which we could turn. “ The law never sustains a defense of this nature out of regard for a defendant; it does so only where an imperative rule of public policy requires it. The instances are rare in which a corporation or individual has been permitted to set up its own wrong in order to retain both the property and its price. ...

They then attempted to repudiate the modification and fall back upon the original agreement of July 26. Yet, the illegality, if any existed, was to be found in the original <em>contract; </em>assuming that to be legal, the modification of it was equally so.

That portion of the decree of the court below enjoining the collection of the rent alleged to be due, by process of distress, is affirmed; and it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that, if on or before July 1, 1900, the appellants pay the rental due to the appellee, as found by the court below, to wit: 1800 due December 8, 1899, and all subsequently accruing rent, and that on or before January 1, 1901, appellants construct the railroad and make the connections contemplated and provided for in the agreement of lease, the bill of complaint and the cross-bill be dismissed; and, upon failure to so pay the said rent, or to so construct the said railroad and make the said connections, that thereupon the appellants shall forthwith surrender possession of the railroad property and franchises leased and mentioned in said lease, unto the appellee, one half of the costs of the proceedings in the court below and on this appeal to be borne and paid by the appellants and the other half by the appellee.</p>
