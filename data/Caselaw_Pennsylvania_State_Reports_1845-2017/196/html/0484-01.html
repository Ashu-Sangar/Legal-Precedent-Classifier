In this conversation the particulars are fully stated, and the testimony bears the impress of truth. The conversation referred to by the witnesses Ida Myers and Harry L. Myers occurred in Lancaster county at their home, on the wedding trip of John and Agnes Krug, in the fall of the year 1891. They were both present. Mrs. Ida Myers testifies: The conversation commenced about “ trouble with wills.” Mrs. Krug said that she and her husband had a contract before they were married, that his property was to go to his children and her property was to go to her brothers. She appealed to her husband to say if her statement was not correct and he answered, “ Yes.”</p>

The courts have ever jealously guarded the rights of married women and widows. In their distress they pre-eminently require all proper protection by the courts, and it is not singular that when an attempt was made in that case, to exclude the widow from any share of her husband’s estate, that the court should have required more than a slight preponderance of testimony — such testimony as would be satisfactory when considered with the counter-testimony — to find and sustain the antenuptial contract relied upon by the heirs of the husband against his widow.</p>
