The testimony is somewhat conflicting as to whether he reported three or four bids. He submitted plans and specifications drawn by an expert builder for a building of brick upon certain lots in Bridgeport. The lowest bid he reported was that of Mr. Martin, of Conshohocken, of $5,300. He offered to build the building for $5,500, and take payment in a mortgage. Mr. Martin wanted $5,300, in cash, and the other bidders predicated their bids upon cash in payment.</p>

If it be true, as alleged, that Bate, being a director and member of the building committee, was intrusted, along with his associates, with the duty of procuring the erection of the buildings at the lowest price, then after ascertaining from Schoffner that it could be erected for less than $4,000, represented to the directors that it could not be built at actual cost for less than $5,500, and thus secured the contract for his firm at a profit of nearly $1,500, that was a fraud upon the corporation which warranted the rescission of the contract.”</p>

What, if anything, did Mr. Bate say at directors’ meetings prior to February 23, about what the building would cost? A. At the time the bids were submitted there were plans and specifications for this brick building. He said he had a bid on it from a builder named Martin, in Conshohocken, from $5,300 to $5,500. We were also recommended to go and look up prices of iron buildings, and I think Mr. <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>Pennington looked at them and he reported a price of about $6,000. I was asked to leave them in Bridgeport and go and get prices from Mr. Green, and Mr. Green reluctantly gave me a price of about $6,500 or $6,700. He said be would not make that as a price on plans and specifications left him by Mr. Pennington. By Mr. Holland: Q. What kind of building was that? A. Brick building. By Mr. Hannis: Q. $6,500? A. Yes, sir. By Mr. Eyre: Q. On the specifications Mr. Pennington had? A. Yes, sir. I didn’t see the plans and specifications, but on what he had gone over with Mr. Pennington, and Mr. Bate said that he had this price from this builder Martin of $5,300 to $5,500, and that it would cost him about $50.00 for getting out the plans and specifications. Q. How much did he say it would cost him for the contract ? A. He said the entire cost would be about $5,500. Q. What did he say as to how much it would cost him? (Objected to.) Q. What did he say? A. He said that on the plans and specifications as had been submitted there, he would build a building for $5,500; that he had a price from Mr. Martin of $5,300 to $5,500; that it would cost him about $50.00 for getting out the plans and specifications, and that $5,500 would just be about the cost of the building. Q. About when was that ? You say prior to February 23. How long before February 23 ? A. I think that was on February 23, and I think on the strength of that report the secretary was authorized to notify the firm of William T. Bate &amp; Son that we would accept the proposition. Q. Did he mention to you any bid of $4,000, or anything like it at that time ? A. No, sir; I never heard of such a price. Q. What was the lowest bid spoken of there ? A. $5,300. Q. Did he mention the name of Schoffner as a contractor to make a bid? A. I never heard of Schoffner.”</p>

What bids did he report? A. Well, there were several bids brought in there, but I didn’t pay a great deal of attention to the bids, to tell you the truth, except the one of $5,500. Q. Why was it that that proposition was accepted? A. Because Mr. Bate said it was about the best. Q. On the strength of what representations, if any, made by Mr. Bate, did they accept that bid of $5,500 ? A. Simply because we were getting the full value; at least, I <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>did. Q. Who was it said you were going to get full value ? A. Mr. Bate. He said it would cost him $5,500 to erect that building, and when that building was finished he would have to go in his pockets and pay the $5,500 in solid money, and .he thought he was doing a great deal for the company. Q. He would have to pay it in solid money to whom ? A. Why, to the contractors, as soon as the building was finished. Q. Did he at that time — or, in fact, at any other time — mention to you that there was a person by the name of Schoffner who was a contractor? A. No, sir. Q. For a bid of little less than $4,000 ? A.

At that time there was only about three days from the time we decided to build the mill at Bridgeport until the board of directors wanted to have the thing definitely settled. He spoke about three bids at that time. Q. And only three ? A. Three only, as far as my recollection goes. Q. What were those bids? A. Well, the lowest, I think, was $5,300, and the highest something over $6,000. Q. He didn’t say anything about the bid of Schoffner of $4,000 ? A. I never heard Schoffner’s name mentioned at the meeting. Q. Did he say anything about what the cost would be ? A. Cost to the company only. I never heard what it cost him. The understanding was that he was— Q. I mean the understanding as stated by him? A. That the building should cost him, or would cost him, what he was turning it over to the company for. Q.

He was bound by that contract, and so were they. If Mr. Bate took that bid, believing that he had to pay Martin $300, and his labor and supervision was worth $200, and, fortunately for him, found a bidder lower than Mr. Martin, he was not obliged to make known that fact to his company and give them the benefit of it.

If, for instance, the foreman of your jury, having a house to rent, gives over the key to a man who wants to look at the house, and the man goes into that house and takes possession; that is to say, goes there and says, “ I am going to hold this,” that man has no legal possession. That man is in the occupancy of that house, but his possession is wrongful, and he is not there in possession of that house at all. The legal possession of that house is in the foreman of the jury. Or, take a case which we frequently see, that of a large building being-constructed, in the hands and possession of the contractors, and a single room in that building fitted up for the use of the architect and his draughtsman. That possession is not the possession of the owner of the land and the man who is to have the building when he pays for it. That architect and his draughtsmen are in there simply permissively. They are there simply by the grace and good will of the contractor, and if there subsequently became a question as to whether the owner of the building had accepted the building from the contractor, no judge would say, and no injury would find, I take it, that the mere <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>permissive use of that room in that building was an acceptance of the building by the man for whom it was being constructed.</p>

If Mr. Bate had the right, under his contract, to give possession while Pennington was actually at work in the building, and if he did actually turn over that building to Pennington and the Keystone company, then the Keystone company was in possession. But, gentlemen, the presumption is that the man who was building it was in possession of it, and it would require affirmative- evidence to show -you that he parted with his possession. If he did, and if these people were in possession of that building under all the evidence in this case, then what the Supreme Court said applies to this case; and, that is, that Mr. Bate had no right to assert his right to recover possession by dispossessing these people; but if, in point of fact, they were there, as Mr. Pennington said, and perhaps some of the rest — I won’t take the time to go over this testimony in detail — if they were there with a warning that they were there at their own risk; that what they were doing was at their own risk, and there was not, on the part of Mr. Bate, any turning over of the possession of that building to the Keystone Surgical Supply Manufacturing Company, then they could not be dispossessed because they were not in possession.

The facts were that at a meeting of the directors of the plaintiff company held on that day, a proposition was submitted by defendants embodying the substance of the agreement on the subject-matter concerned and that proposition was accepted by a vote of the directors. It may be conceded that the offer and acceptance amounted to a meeting of the minds of the parties and would be sufficient to constitute a contract between them if they so understood and intended. But where parties to an arrangement of this kind show either by express words or by their action that they regard it as preliminary only, and to be put into final shape thereafter, and subsequently execute a formal instrument in writing, the latter is the only contract, and the preliminary steps, however elaborate, go into the category of mere negotiations leading up to the final result. This is always the presumption of the law where a written contract is made, and in the present case it is rendered conclusive by the circumstances. The meeting by a separate resolution directed the secretary to notify the defendants of the acceptance of their proposal, showing knowledge that something more than the mere acceptance was necessary to complete the contract. Subsequently on March 16, the written contract was executed and it embodied some provisions that were not in the proposal or the acceptance, such as the agreement of the defendants to build according to the specifications submitted to and accepted by the plaintiff, and the stipulation by the plaintiff that the mortgage it was to give in payment should be a purchase money mortgage and payable in five years. These provisions it is <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>true are in harmony with the prior arrangement and are merely supplementary to it, but if they had been in any way in conflict they must have prevailed as the final agreement of the parties. On the undisputed evidence therefore the jury should have been instructed that the contract was the written instrument of March 16.</p>
    <p id="b597-4" data-blocks='[["BL_597.4",597,[139,668,1182,1183]]]'>There was error also in the manner of submitting to the jury the question of possession. The plaintiff claimed to be the owner of the land, as having bought and paid for it, and the defendants were contractors for erecting a building upon it. If, therefore, plaintiff as owner was in peaceful possession, even though the contract time for delivery had not yet arrived, the contractor had no authority to dispossess it, or to inte:fere with the possession further than was necessary to enable him to complete his work, and a fortiori, none, if as appellant contends, the work was in fact completed a week before the dispossession took place. On this subject it was said by our brother Dean in the former case <a href="/pa/187/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="187 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="900261" data-case-paths="/pa/187/0460-01">187 Pa. 460</a>, 468, “ But, it is argued, the company did not perform its contract with Bate &amp; Son by a delivery or tender of the <em>mortgage; </em>admit it; but what right did that give building contractors to eject the owner from the peaceable possession of his own premises ? A mere breach of covenant confers no such remedy on the wronged party and if the latter adopts it, he is liable to an action in damages.” The question for the jury therefore on this branch of the case was simply the fact of plaintiff’s possession, and the qualification that it was there with notice that what it was doing was at its own risk to which prominence was given in the charge, was wholly immaterial.</p>

No doubt the learned judge was largely influenced by his view that the contract was complete on February 23, for confining the evidence to matters prior to that date, plaintiff’s case was meager. But defendants are sued on the ground of fraudulent representations, and concealment of facts which good faith and their position of quasi <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>trust required them to disclose. This is the main issue and it should be put before the jury with a full explanation of the law, and an open door to all evidence fairly bearing on the question.</p>
