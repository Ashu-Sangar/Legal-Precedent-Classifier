      <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>Plaintiff while driving a two-horse buggy on a country road approached agrade crossing of a railroad which was atan oblique angle. About 600 or 600 feet from the crossing and on the side on which the train approached, the tracks were in a cut of considerable depth. When plaintiff was about 176 feet from the crossing, he stopped, looked and listened par-' ticularly in the direction of the cut. Neither hearing nor seeing a train he proceeded to go on, and after he had gone about twenty feet, a boy who was riding with him drew down a side curtain and looked up the tracks, and reported that no train was in sight. His horses at this time were on a slow trot, and so continued until the crossing was reached. The diagonal crossing was forty-five feet in length, and going in the direction in which the plaintiff drove, the left hind wheel of a wagon was about three feet beyond the tracks before the right hind wheel was clear of them. The plaintiff knew nothing of the approach of the train until he was about in the middle of the crossing, and then only by observing the flash of the headlight on the ground between his horses. The right hind wheel of the buggy was struck after the left hind wheel was clear of the tracks. No notice was given by whistle or bell or otherwise of the approach of the train, which was running on a down grade at the rate of forty-five or fifty miles an hour. The place at which the plaintiff stopped was the usual place of stopping to look and listen for the approach of a train by those who used the highway. It was the best place from which to observe the approach of a train, as between that place and the crossing the view was obstructed by an embankment. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury, and that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>

From the testimony presented by the plaintiff it appeared that he was driving two horses to a top-buggy after dark on a country road which is crossed by the tracks of the defendant’s road at an oblique angle. On the side on which the train approached the crossing, and 500 or 600 feet from it, the railroad tracks are in a cut of considerable depth. There is also a curve in the tracks, with its convex side toward the highway. The plaintiff, when about 175 feet from the crossing, stopped, looked and listened, and in order to obtain a better view turned his horses to one side, so that he could see up the tracks as far as possible. Neither seeing nor hearing a train he drove on. After he had gone about twenty feet a boy who was riding with him drew down a side curtain and looked up the tracks and reported that no train was in sight.

It was the best place from which to observe the approach of a train, as between that place and the crossing the view was obstructed by an embankment.

The standard of negligence is what persons of ordinary prudence and carefulness would do under the same circumstances, .and a general habit of the public to stop in a certain place is persuasive evidence that that place is the right one. The further the stopping place is from the track the greater will be the chance of an intervening peril before actual crossing. The duty of the traveler is therefore not only to keep a vigilant and •continuous outlook, but to stop if a second place affords any increased facility to discover impending danger, but whether there is any such second place is a question of fact which is for the jury if at all in doubt.” Nor could the court have said that .in driving on the tracks the plaintiff was heedless of a danger which he either saw or could have seen. The train came on a down grade around a curve and through a cut, and could be seen at a distance of 500 or 600 feet only from the crossing. From the edge of the crossing the plaintiff had forty-five feet to drive, and he was within a few inches of getting over the crossing in safety. The train may have come into view after he started to cross. The rule stated in Carroll v. Penna. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=12%20W.N.C.%20348" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="12 W.N.C. 348">12 W. N.
