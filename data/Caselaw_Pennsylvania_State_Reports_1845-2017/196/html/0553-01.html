    <p class="summary" id="b577-6" data-blocks='[["BL_577.6",577,[174,947,1183,709]]]'>The defendants offered no evidence on their side. Their contention is purely legal. They claim that taking the evidence of the plaintiff alone and giving it the fullest credit, the bill should be dismissed. They rely on the application of the Act of May 16, 1889, P. L. 242, to the facts established by the plaintiff. The 11th section of this act provides as follows: “ If any company incorporated under this act, or any of its supplements, shall not proceed in good faith to carry on its work and construct or acquire its necessary buildings, structures, property or improvements within the space of two years from the date of its letters patent, and shall not within the space of five years thereafter complete the same, the rights and privileges thereby granted to said corporation shall revert to the commonwealth.’ ’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b577-7" data-blocks='[["BL_577.7",577,[176,1675,1185,818]]]'>According to the view we take of the law, we cannot decide in the present proceedings the question of the forfeiture of the plaintiff’s corporate rights by reason of nonuser or for any other reason. Whether or not the plaintiff company has complied with the provisions of the 11th section of the act of 1889 by proceeding in good faith to carry on its work within the specified period is a matter that we cannot inquire into now. It is true that our findings of fact set forth the extent of the company’s work. We did this for the'purpose of reducing the plaintiff’s testimony to concise and specific conclusions. But the legal position maintained by the defendants is clearly untenable. To formulate a conclusion of law which controls the case at bar we state that the corporate existence of a company cannot be attacked collaterally or incidentally, but it must be done in a direct proceeding brought for that purpose by a proper party.</p>
