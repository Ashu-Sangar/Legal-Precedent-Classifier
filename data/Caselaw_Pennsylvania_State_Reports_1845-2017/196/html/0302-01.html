No duty had been imposed by statute upon the city of Philadelphia to either protect the land of plaintiff and the meadow lands, of which it formed a part, from the overflow of the river, or to drain the low-lying ground. If such duty had been imposed, and the injuries suffered by plaintiff were due to a neglect to properly discharge it, the city undoubtedly would be liable. When a legal duty-has been imposed by statute upon a municipal corporation, it is undoubtedly liable for injuries resulting from the neglect of that duty; in such case it stands on the same footing in respect to negligence as a purely private corporation or an individual: Erie City v. Schwingle, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Pa.%20388" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="22 Pa. 388">22 Pa. 388</a>; Dillon, Mun. Corp. sec<a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>tions 961-965. But the duty imposed must be absolute or imperative, not such as, under a grant of authority, is intrusted to the judgment and discretion of the municipal authorities; for it is a well settled doctrine that a municipal corporation is not liable to an action for damages either for the nonexercise of, or for the manner in which, in good faith, it exercises discretionary powers of a public or legislative character: Dillon, Mun. Corp. section 949. It is certainly unnecessary to cite further authorities in support of a principle so well settled; indeed, we do not understand the general doctrine to be denied, but it is argued that it is inapplicable to the case now in hand: McDade v. Chester City, <a href="/pa/117/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="117 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="555840" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0414-01">117 Pa. 414</a>. The city contended, before the referee, that it was not liable, because it was under no duty to construct and maintain the sluice, and, while he did not distinctly find that there was no such duty on its part, he did hold that this reason, urged by the city, could be assumed to be correct, and that the plaintiff had “ not founded his case upon any such claim.” We have quoted from the statement, in which the claim is so apparently made. We concur with the referee that it can be assumed to be correct that, it was not the duty of the city of Philadelphia to construct or maintain the sluice in question, and that no liability had attached to it from failure to properly discharge an imposed obligation.</p>

City of Erie, <a href="/pa/69/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="69 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="1026528" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0420-01">69 Pa. 420</a>; Allentown v.

Municipal corporations, under the conditions herein stated, fall within the operation of this rule of law, and are liable, accordingly to civil actions for damages when the requisite elements of liability coexist. To create such a liability it is fundamentally necessary that the act done which is injurious to others must be within the scope of the corporate powers as prescribed by charter or positive enactment. In other words it must not be ultra vires in the sense that it is not within the power or authority of the corporation to act in reference to it under any circumstances. If the act complained of necessarily lies wholly outside of the general or special powers of the corporation as conferred by its charter or by statute, the corporation can in no event be liable to an action for damages, whether it directly commanded the performance of the act, or whether it be done by its officers without its express command; for a corporation cannot of course be impliedly liable to a greater extent than it could make itself by express corporate vote or action: ” Dillon on Mun. Corp. (4th ed.) sec. 968. In Cavanagh v. Boston, <a href="/mass/139/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="139 Mass. 426" data-case-ids="759873" data-case-paths="/mass/139/0426-01">139 Mass. 426</a>, the plaintiff was the owner of an island and the flats adjacent thereto. It being alleged that certain other flats, in consequence of being left bare at low tide, gave forth an offensive odor, the city council directed a dam to be built across the flats and upon part of the island owned by the plaintiff, by driving pile sheeting into the flats and island, and with gates in the part known as Pile Island Channel, which adjoined said flats. By reason of the omission properly to ballast said dam, the gates were washed away, and the dam was weakened, in consequence of which the property of plaintiff was injured. Verdict was directed for defendant. On appeal, Allen, J., said: “ The difficulty with the plaintiff’s case is, that neithér the board of health nor the city government had any authority to abate the nuisance in the manner which was adopted. That manner was by the erection of a dam, the easterly portion of which was built across the flats and upon the upland of the plaintiff, for the purpose of raising the water so as to flow over other flats away from the flat of the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s evidence tending to show that no nuisance existed on their own flats. This was an occupation of the plaintiff’s land which the city had no power to make without the plaintiff’s consent. . ; . <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>When the preservation of the public health has been thought to require such acts as the filling of land or raising its grade over a considerable extent of territory, or the covering of land with water, or the removal of dams from streams, in order to allow better drainage, or to prevent the accumulation of offensive materials, it has been usual to pass statutes giving the requisite authority and making due provision for the protection of the property of individuals. . . . The acts done having been beyond the authority and power of the city to do, the city cannot be held responsible in damages for what was done under the supposed authority of illegal and void votes. . . . The plaintiff seeks to avoid the result by urging that part of the damage came from the negligent construction of the dam,; but since it was illegal to build it at all, it is not apparent how negligence in .the trespassers can entail a responsibility on the city.” Nothing was presented to the referee and nothing has been brought to our notice showing that what the city did was done in the exercise of any authority or the execution of any power conferred upon it. On the other hand, by the Act of April 12, 1760, 1 Sm. L. p. 227, entitled “An act to enable the owners of Greenwich Island to embank and drain the same, to keep the outside banks and dams in good repair forever, and to raise a fund to defray sundry contingent and yearly expenses accruing thereon,” the power was expressly given to the Greenwich Island Meadow Company to do, or to cause to be done, the very thing which the city of Philadelphia undertook to do without any authority, express or implied. The learned referee seems to have concluded that, as the defendant had been unable to show “ that the legislature, at any time, or in any manner, prohibited the city of Philadelphia as a municipal corporation,” from doing the kind of work which it had undertaken, it had the power to do it. The learned court very properly said, in considering this portion of the report: “ But we are of opinion that the defendant was not called upon to show a legislative prohibition, but that the plaintiff was bound to show that the city either first, had the power granted in express words, or second, that the power was necessarily implied in, or incident to the powers expressly granted, or third, that they were essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation; not simply convenient, but indispensable; and, fourth, that they were powers <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>not exercised under the general police power, but such powers as are exercised by a municipality when acting as a private corporation.” The powers given to the Greenwich Island Meadow Company were never expressly repealed, nor can they be considered repealed by implication. The principle of implied repeal is to be applied with great caution: Dillon on Mun. Corp. (3d ed.), secs. 87, 88. It cannot, therefore, be seriously contended that what the city did was done in the exercise of any power conferred upon it, and, not having so acted, no liability attached to it by reason of a negligent exercise of such power,</p>
    <p id="b334-5" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[245,900,1181,1177]]]'>Though it is manifest that no breach of duty imposed upon the city was proven, and no improper or negligent exercise of power conferred upon it was shown that would render it liable to the plaintiff, can it be compelled to pay upon any other ground ? If there was no failure to perform a plain duty, and if there was no power or authority to construct and maintain the sluice, how did the city act? The proper answer to this question would have saved the learned referee from the error into which he fell. It acted either in the exercise of its police power, or as a mere volunteer without authority, in relief of the Meadow Island Company. If in the former capacity, and our judgment is that it did so act, there is no responsibility for any damages resulting from the improper or negligent exercise of the power. No principle is better settled: Elliott v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/75/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="75 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1036793" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0347-01">75 Pa. 347</a>; Boyd v. Ins. Patrol, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20Pa.%20270" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="113 Pa. 270">113 Pa. 270</a>. If, on the other hand, it did not act in the exercise of its police power, the Avork done was that of a mere volunteer, without authority, and was in relief of the Greemvich Island Meadow Company. The duty to do the work was that of the Meadow Company, and if the city did the work in opposition to its wishes, it was done in the exercise of police power, or, if with the consent of the company, as a mere volunteer. If done as a mere .volunteer, no duty arose to the appellant.</p>

But, in that case, a sewer had been constructed by the city in the exercise of its lawful authority as a municipal corporation. Therein the case differs from the one now before us. Here, the city had no .authority to build the sluice, except in the exercise of its police power. The authority to construct, maintain, supervise :and control the banks, dams, sluices, flood gates, drains, etc., had been acquired by the Greenwich Island Meadow Company from the commonwealth, in the exercise of its police power, and the city could not lawfully act in the premises, except in the exercise of a like potent power.</p>
