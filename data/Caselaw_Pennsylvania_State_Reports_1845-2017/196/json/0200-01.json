        "text": "\u25a0Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Green,\nWe were very willing to grant a rehearing in this case as it is one of a quite exceptional character, and the leading question at issue is so barren of authority as to make it a case of first impression. We have heard with much interest the able argument of counsel upon the second hearing and have given a patient study of the case, but we are unable to see any sufficient reason for changing the conclusions' expressed in the first opinion filed. For the reasons there stated we still think that all the issues of capital stock were entirely illegal and void. As the claimants represented by the plaintiff, of the office of trustees, found their title to the office upon the votes of the holders of capital stock, and we hold that there never was any valid issue of stock, we cannot consider them as having any title to* the office claimed. But there can be no doubt, we think, that. the administration of the affairs of the company during the long-period succeeding the organization of the company must be-regarded as entirely legal in all respects. The trustees were-originally elected in strict conformity with the by-laws of the-company, and their title was never questioned until in the present litigation; they were trustees de facto and the acts done by them were within the line of their duty as such officials-The claim of title to the office by the defendant and those whom he represented we cannot consider as valid. . The function of the original coporators was exhausted when their successors-were designated by them, and we do not see how their original authority could be resuscitated by the action of two of their number after a delay of thirty-two years and a constant acquiescence in the action of the original corporators in establishing their successors in office. We do not consider the title of the defendant and those he represents to the office of trustee as of any validity.\nIn this situation it seems to us that immediate steps should be taken to remedy this anomalous condition of affairs. The corporation is certainly the owner of the property except such as has been sold to plot holders and is devoid of a legally constituted managing body. As the private interests of certain parties have always been recognized in the way of a proportionate holding of the corporation, it seems to us that there ought to be no difficulty in effecting a reorganization under the general corporation law of the commonwealth. Of course we cannot undertake to give advice as to what should be done nor to be bound by any suggestions we now make, but it may be quite possible that in any such reorganization the proportionate interests of the several parties holding stock can be recognized as the basis upon which the ultimate division of interests may be founded. W e make no decision upon the subject but leave the whole matter open for future consideration. We make no-change in the judgment as formerly entered.\nThe judgment of the court below is reversed and judgment is now entered for the defendant with costs under the case stated.",

        "text": "Mr. Justice Mitchell,\ndissenting:\nBy the act of incorporation certain persons were declared and created to be a corporation under the name of the Char-tiers Cemetery Company and as such empowered not only to carry into effect the objects of the company but also \u201c generally do all such other matters and things as are incident to a corporation\u201d and specifically to establish a rural cemetery on Marshall\u2019s land. The power to issue stock was necessarily implied. No mode was provided for the acquisition of the land, and the natural and usual method \u201cincident to a corporation\u201d\" for that purpose was to obtain subscriptions for stock and buy the land from the fund thus raised or by the direct \u2022 issue of stock to the landowner. It is said that the corporators might-mortgage the land and thus obtain the money. Perhaps so, and perhaps not; there is nothing to show whether they could or not. But conceding that they might, they were not confined to this mode. The money had to be raised, and there is no-evidence that the organizers were willing to contribute it in equal amounts. If not they could only protect their proportionate interests by a partnership, which the statute did not contemplate, or by the creation of stock. Even if not the only or even the best way it was a reasonable and effective way of performing the express duty laid on the corporation, and was-therefore within the discretion necessarily implied by the command of the act.\nThe power subsequently to increase the number of shares is-not so clear but it is not now material to consider.\nBut secondly even if the original issue of stock was ultra vires the title of the complainants should be sustained until they are deprived of office in some regular and orderly way. They are the de facto and de jure board of trustees to which the government of the affairs of the corporation is committed by the charter.\nSection 2 of the act of incorporation provides that \u201cthe government of the said company and the management and disposition of its affairs is hereby vested in a board of trustees who shall be elected at such times and in such manner as the said company shall by its rules and regulations direct.\u201d Under this section the corporators met and elected the predecessors of complainants by a vote in proportion to the funds each contributed to start the corporation. It was a perfectly lawful mode of election. Even if they had formed a partnership a regulation that each should have a voice in the management in proportion to his capital invested would have been entirely valid. The act of incorporation commanded the creation of a board of trustees but left the mode of election wholly to such rules and regulations as the company should establish. The company established the mode of election by stock vote, and even if the stock was invalid and ultra vires, as stock, it was a legitimate means of carrying out the regulation established by the company for the election of its trustees, and has been recognized and acted under as such for thirty-five years. Under it the plaintiffs were duly elected in the same manner as all their predecessors had been, and their title now should be held clear and valid until their successors are elected in accordance with the practice, or the regulation itself is changed in some orderly and legal manner by the full board of the corporators or their successors or representatives in the present corporation. The appellants are a body of disgruntled stockholders, mere intruders into the government, self-elected by a disorderly and illegal proceeding not authorized by any regulation of the corporation but in direct violation of the only corporate regulation on the subject and the uniform usage for thirty-five years.\nSterrett, C. J., and Fell, J., join in this dissent.",
