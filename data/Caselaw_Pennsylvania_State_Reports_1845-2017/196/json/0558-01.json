As the use party, on the trial of the case- before a jury, has a full opportunity to meet the defense opposed to his claim, and declined to meet it on the hearing of the rule, he has no cause to complain.

Lewis.\nJudgment\u2014 Opening judgment \u2014 Appeals.\nThe Supreme Court will not reverse an order opening a judgment, where testimony has been submitted by the defendant without any having been submitted by the plaintiff. As the latter will have a full opportunity at the trial to meet the defense opposed to his claim, and as he declined to meet it at the hearing of the rule, he has no cause to complain.\nArgued March 14, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 364, Jan. T., 1899, by N. N. Betts, cashier, from order of C. P. Bradford Co., May T., 1899, No. 379, making absolute rule to open judgment, in case of John Howie, to use of N. N. Betts, Cashier, y. Evan Lewis.\nBefore McCollum, Mitchell, Dean, Fell and Brown, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule to open judgment entered on a judgment note.\n^ From the record it appeared that the note was for 13,500. Evidence for the defendant tended to show that he was an old man, ignorant of writing, and that he had signed the note on the statement made to him by the plaintiff, John Howie, for whose accommodation he signed it; that the note was for $300; that the note was originally made out for $300, and had been raised by Howie to $3,500. The note contained these words: \u201c This note shall be subject to the same rules governing commercial paper, as to equities.\u201d The note was under seal. No evidence was offez\u2019ed by the use plaintiff.\nThe court made the rulo absolute.\nError assigned was in making the rule absolute.\nRodney A. Mereur and L. M. Hall, for appellant.\nTP. J.
