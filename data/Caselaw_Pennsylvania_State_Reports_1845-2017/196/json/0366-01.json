He gave his estate in trust to his executors for the purpose of accumulation until the time of final distribution. During the interval they were to pay certain designated annuities and bequests to grandchildren. He then directed as follows : \u201c Then after the death of all my grandchildren and the youngest grandchild living of my son has become twenty-two years of age ; then all my real estate shall be sold at public sale .... and the proceeds along with all the personal property I own shall be converted into money by my executors, to be divided among the lawful heirs of my son, share and share alike according to law, not taking into consideration any bequests and payments I otherwise have made.\u201d Held, that the rule against perpetuities was violated and that the son took the estate absolutely.\nArgued May 14, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 427, Jan. T., 1899, by H. F. Breneman et al., executors of Andrew Gerber, deceased, from decree of O. C.

See that he has an honest, good man to manage the farm along with him, or rent the farm on the shares that they think best for his family, and to keep the farm in good repair and condition, until it shall be sold as I order. After the death of my grandson, Martin, his family shall have no more possession right on said premises by my will but they shall be at the mercy of my executors until final distribution is made by them as I have ordered. Not any lawyer nor Auditor need be employed to distribute my effects.\n\u201c I leave my whole estate in the hands of my executors, hereinafter named, and their successors chosen as herein provided, and I order that they shall as best as can for my estate, either at public or private sale as they can agree, sell all my real estate and give title to the purchaser as above ordered, and after realizing from all of my personal property, as ordered, then they shall appoint a day and place to meet to make the final distribution.

I order that my executors shall keep the account of my estate in the First National Bank of Mount Joy in my name as I have it, and one of my executors shall do the signing, as is required by the bank, as all payment out of my estate shall be made by checks.\u201d\n\u201cAll the proceeds of my income, properties sold, interest collected from money, stocks, bonds, rentals and whatsoever realized out of my properties from time to time, converted into cash, shall be deposited to my credit in said bank as it comes into the hands of my executors.\n\u201c I order that my executors shall loan out as best as they can for my estate on-real estate securities, the money that is left over yearly by April 1st after all the yearly payments have been made I have ordered.\n\u201cI further order that if anyone of my executors, hereinafter named, should die or become unfit or refuse to act his part in good faith, then his pay shall be stopped at once and the other two shall choose another one in his place from among the church members of either of the four churches mentioned that the $50.00 payments are to be made yearly; they shall choose a young man, not under 25 years of age, of good standing, with sound sense and being a faithful housekeeper of his own affairs, and an honest church member of the mentioned Old Mennonite Church.\n\u201cIf my executors shall not agree on a proper manas ordered in 30 days after the vacancy has occurred, then I order that the deacons of the four churches mentioned to receive yearly.payments shall jointly name a man in good standing in their church, as mentioned, to fill the vacancy that may happen from time to time among my hereinafter named executors and their successors.\n\u201cAnd for all the work and trouble that my executors hereinafter named or their successors will necessarily have to do in looking after and managing my estate for the benefit of my bequests, my grandchildren and the legal heirs coming after them of my son, Christian N. Gerber, and the final settling up .and distributing my effects as I have ordered in this my last will and testament. Thus I order that each\" one of my executors shall draw out of my account $50.00 for the payments of their services yearly, which shall be in lieu of the percentage, otherwise allowed by law to executors settling up such estate.\n\u201c I hereby constitute and appoint Dr. Henry F. Breneman, Abraham L. Nissely and Michael M. Souder, married to my granddaughter, Martha, to be my executors of this my last will and testament, signed and sealed the first (1st) day of August, A. D. 1896.\u201d\nThe auditor reported as follows:\nThe said testator died testate on June 23, 1898, leaving one child, Christian N. Gerber, who has appointed the Lancaster Trust Company his trustee, as above stated.\nTestator left eight grandchildren, all children of his only child, Christain N. Gerber, who are named in the minutes attached hereto.\nTestator left seven great-grandchildren, being grandchildren of his son, Christian N. Gerber, all of whom are named in the minutes attached hereto.\nA copy of the will of decedent is attached hereto.\nFrom an examination of the annexed copy of the will it is apparent that in it the testator attempts to create two separate and distinct interests or estates out of the money in the hands of the accountants, to wit:\n1. An estate or interest in trust (his executors as trustees) for the purpose of accumulation until the time it is to be paid to those who are to receive it in final distribution, and during a part of this time to pay the annuities of $250 to three of his grandchildren, the board and washing of another, and during the whole of this time to pay $400 to four churches, $30.00 to or for five Sunday schools, and $5.00 to a cemetery and taxes and insurance on testator\u2019s property.\nHe further directs that annuities are to be paid to great-grandchildren on their arrival at a certain age.\n2. Upon the determination of the first estate, an absolute estate to the heirs of his son, C. N. Gerber, in the following words: \u201c Then after the death of all my grandchildren and the youngest grandchild living of my son, C. N. Gerber, has become twenty-two years of age; then all my real estate shall be sold at public sale .... and the proceeds along with all the personal property I own shall be converted into money by my executors, to be divided among the lawful heirs of my son, G. N. Gerber, share and share alike according to law, not taking into consideration any bequests and payments I otherwise have made.\u201d\nYour auditor will first deal with the second estate. First, is it a vested estate or will the time when it will vest occur beyond the period allowed by the rule against perpetuities, viz: life or lives in being at the death of testator and twenty-one years thereafter, and is it therefore void ?\nIn order to determine these two questions it will be necessary to find from the will just what the testator intended, and then apply the rule.\nProf. Gray, in section 629 of Work on the Rule against Perpetuities, says: \u201c The rule against perpetuities is not a rule of construction, but a peremptory command of law. It is not like a rule of construction, a test more or less artificial to determine intention. Its object is to defeat intention. Therefore every provision in a will or settlement is to be construed as if the rule did not exist, and then to the provisions so construed the rule is to be remorselessly applied.\u201d\nIt is only necessary to ascertain the time when the testator intended the heirs of O. N. Gerber to get his estate for the purpose of applying the rule.\n1. It must occur after the death of O. N. Gerber, testator\u2019s son, for until then the heirs of C. N. Gerber could not be ascertained.\n2. It must occur after the death of all O. N. Gerber\u2019s children, testator\u2019s grandchildren, which would include those living at the time of testator\u2019s death as well as those born afterwards. Those born after testator\u2019s death and their children are objects of testator\u2019s bounty. They would all be heirs of C. N. Gerber. It has been held, in Minnig v. Batdorff, 5 Pa. 503, that if there is \u201c a gift over to the children of the person taking the interest, or any other person, the limitation will embrace not only the objects living at the death of the testator, but all who shall subsequently come into existence before the period of distribution.\u201d The reasoning in that case will apply with equal force where the time for distribution is fixed by the death of all of a class.\n3. It must occur after or at the time when \u201c the youngest grandchild living of my son, C. N. Gerber, has become twenty-two years of age.\u201d Much depends on what testator intended by the word \u201c living.\u201d Did he mean living at the time of his death or at the time of his distribution ? That he meant living at the time of his distribution is shown.\n1. All C. N. Gerber\u2019s children might die before his death. The youngest great-grandchild living at the time of testator\u2019s death might attain the age of twenty-two years before C. N. Gerber\u2019s death. The time for distribution might thus arrive with no one to take, as the heirs of C. N. Gerber cannot be ascertained until his -death. But if testator meant after the death of all children of C. N. Gerber, those living at the time of his death as well as those born after, and the arrival of the youngest great-grandchild living, after the death of all grandchildren, the time for distribution could arrive and those who were to take could be ascertained.\n2. The whole shows his intention to provide for all children of his grandchildren, even though they have none at the time of testator\u2019s death.\nHe provides for the children of Martha Souder (item 2), Benjamin F. Gerber (item 5), Barbara Eby (item 6), Christian S. Gerber, (item 7) ; yet none of these had children at the time of the testator\u2019s death. If the testator meant living at his death, none of these provisions could be carried out, if these children should die about the same time, after the death of the other grandchildren, and after the great-grandchildren living at the death of testator had attained the age of twenty-two years.\n3. Testator had only seven great-grandchildren at the time of his death, yet he provided for the payment of annuities to them when three have attained the age of twenty-two years, and there are no more than eighteen in sight; and these annuities are to be increased when six attain the age of twenty-two years and there are no more than twenty in sight.\n4. The children of Barbara Eby are provided for until they are twenty-two years of age (item 6) yet she had none at the time of testator\u2019s death. This might be impossible if it meant living at death of testator.\n5. It provides for the payment of annuities to his great grandchildren until the youngest and last one is twenty-two years of age (item 15). This would be impossible if it meant only those living at the death of testator.\n6. Because it is a presumption of law that he meant the great-grandchildren living at his death as well as those who subsequently came into existence prior to the period of distribution : Minnig v. Batdorff, 5 Pa. 503.\n7. Because he provides for the executors caring for all the children of Sarah Hershey (item 3) and Kate A. Landis (item 4) until they arrive at the age of twenty-two years, which would certainly include those living at the death of testator as well as those born subsequently. This might be impossible if the will meant that final distribution was to be made when the youngest great-grandchild living at death of testator had attained the age of twenty-two years.\nThe will must be construed so that all of it may stand, if this be possible. As has been shown, many parts of the will would be meaningless if the word \u201c living \u201d is to be construed as meaning \u201c living at death of testator.\u201d All parts of the will would have a meaning if the word \u201c living \u201d means \u201c living at the time of distribution.\u201d Therefore your auditor finds this is the construction that must be given it. The testator meant that when C. N. Gerber was dead; when all his children, those living at testator\u2019s death, as well as those born afterwards, were dead; and when the youngest one of their children living (not making it necessary for a younger one who had died, would have been twenty-two had it lived) was twenty-two years of age, the estate should be distributed.\nCan this time for distribution arrive after lives in being and twenty-one years ?\nIn answering this question we will endeavor to see if it i\u00bb possible that the time for distribution may arrive after lives in being and twenty-one years, and not whether it is likely to occur within that time.\n\u201cIt is not enough that a contingent event may happen, or-even that it will probably happen within the limits of the rule against perpetuities, if it can possibly happen beyond those-limits, an interest conditioned on it is too remote: \u201d Gray on, Perpetuities, sec. 214; Coggins\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 10.\n\u201c For the, purpose of determining questions of remoteness men and women are deemed capable (Gray on Perpetuities,, sec. 215) of having issue so long as they live.\u201d\nThe \u201c lives in being \u201d in the present case are all the children of C. N. Gerber, born prior to testator\u2019s death, possibly including C. N. Gerber himself.\nKeeping these principles in mind, your auditor finds that, the period for distribution in this estate can occur in each of the following ways, at a period beyond that allowed by the rule agains perpetuities.\n1. Christian N. Gerber, testator\u2019s son, was about fifty-five years of age when testator died. He may have children born after the death of testator. Such children might survive C. N. Gerber, and all of his children who were alive at the death of testator for a period in excess of twenty-one years. There could be no distribution while they lived, for it must be after the death of all testator\u2019s grandchildren. The time for distribution would then be postponed until after \u201c lives in being at death of testator\u201d (grandchildren living at death of testator and possibly C. N. Gerber) and the twenty-one years or longer time that these second children might survive these \u201c lives in being at the death of testator.\u201d\n2. Christian N. Gerber (testator\u2019s son) had eight children (testator\u2019s great-grandchildren) at the time of testator\u2019s death. Christian N. Gerber and his eight children must die before the time for distribution arrives. The seven- great-grandchildren of testator may die before their parents. Some of the eight grandchildren may leave a child or children who would not be a year old at the time of the death of C. N. Gerber and the last of C. N. Gerber\u2019s eight children. The time for distribution then could not arrive until it or they had attained the age of twenty-two, which would be more than twenty-one years after lives in being at the death of testator.\n3. The eight children of C. N. Gerber might survive him; the seven children of these eight children might survive their parents, who may leave other children besides these seven. Some of or one of these other or later children might not be a year old at the death of the last of C. N. Gerber\u2019s eight children. It must attain the age of twenty-two years before there can be a distribution. This would postpone the time for distribution for more than twenty-one years after the expiration of lives in being at the death of testator.\nThe rule against perpetuities is as follows:\n\u201cNo interest subject to a'condition precedent is good unless the condition must be fulfilled, if at all, within the twenty-one years after some life (lives) in being at the creation of the interest: \u201d Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 201.\nThe rule, as laid down by our Supreme Court, is :\n\u201c 1. Perpetuities are grants of property wherein the vesting of an estate or interest is unlawfully postponed; and they are called perpetuities not because the grant as written would actually make them perpetual but because they transgress the limits which the law has set in restraint of grants that tend to a perpetual suspense of the title or its vesting.\n\u201c 2. The law allows th'e vesting of an estate or interest to be postponed for the period of lives in being and twenty-one years and nine months thereafter, and all restraints upon the vesting that may suspend it beyond that period are treated as perpetual restraints and, therefore, as void, and consequently the estate or interests dependent upon them are void, and nothing is denounced as a perpetuity that does not transgress this rule:\u201d Phila. v. Girard\u2019s Heirs, 45 Pa. 26.\nThe interest given to the heirs of C. N. Gerber is not vested.\nIf it were a vested interest the rule against perpetuities would not affect it. The rule does not deal with vested interests as is stated in the citation above for Phila. v. Girard\u2019s Heirs, 45 Pa. 26. Also see Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 205, Coggins\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 10, and Johnston\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 179.\n\u201c An estate is said to be vested in interest when there is a present fixed right in some one of future enjoyment of it; it is not vested but contingent, when either the person who is to enjoy it or the event upon which the estate is to arise is uncertain:\u201d Johnston\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 179.\n\u201c Where real or personal estate is divided or bequeathed to such children .... or individuals as shall attain a given age .... or be living at a certain time, without any distinct gift to the whole class preceding such restrictive description, so that the uncertain event forms part of the description of the devisee or legatee, the interest so devised is necessarily contingent on account of the person. For until the age is attained, the character sustained or the act performed, the person is unascertained ; there is no person answering to the description of the person to take as devisee or legatee: \u201d Smith on Executory Interests, p. 281, cited Johnston\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 186,\nSee also Coggins\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 10, for an application of the rule very similar to the present case.\nUnder the will of Andrew Gerber there is no present fixed right in some one of future enjoyment of his estate. The persons who are to enjoy it are uncertain. They must be heirs of C. N. Gerber, and until his death no one answers that description. The time of enjoyment is also uncertain. So that the future interests given under this will are contingent and not vested.\nThere is but one more observation necessary as to the second estate. Under the ways suggested in which it may not vest until more than twenty-one years after a life or lives in being it might vest in some of the class, viz: those great-grandchildren who were over a year old at the time of the death of the last grandchild of testator. If it, however, is void as to one member of a class it is void as to all: Coggins\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 10.\nHaving shown that this second estate is not a vested interest; that it may possibly not vest in any one until a life or lives in being and twenty-one years thereafter, and that in this it offends the rul\u00e9 against perpetuities, we therefore believe it to be void. A very similar case has been decided in Pennsylvania, in the opinion of which much that applies to this case has been examined, and the auditor rests his opinion as to this second estate or interest, almost entirely on this case. It is Coggins\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 10.\n2. The auditor will next consider the first estate or interest named above.\nThe rule against perpetuities is only directed against future estates. There was nothing future about this estate except its continuance. It began within the required limits, viz: lives in being and twenty-one years and it is of no consequence, so far as concerns the rule that it extends beyond it. If the rule admits of no exceptions, but it is to be applied in every case, then this particular estate must stand. But that is a conclusion that it would seem right if possible to be avoided, for this estate or interest left standing alone cannot with any reason be said to express the testator\u2019s wishes.\nThe auditor used the language of Judge Stewaet, in Johnston\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 179, in the above statement, a very similar case. His opinion was commended very highly by the Supreme Court and adopted as their own in that case.\nA testator left 'his estate to trustees for seventy-five years. First, to pay taxes and repairs. Second, pay income to his children and their legal descendants. Third, to sell the real estate and at the end of- seventy-five years to pay principal to his children that were living and the legal descendants of those who were dead. The court held that these were two estates, one to the trustees, vested at the death of testator and on that account not offending the rule against perpetuities, and an estate or interest in the children of testator who were living at the expiration of seventy-five years, or the legal descendants of such as were dead.\nThe latter estate was held void because it violated the rule against perpetuities.\nThe former estate, the one to trustees, was held void also. It did not violate the rule against perpetuities, but came within two exceptions to the rule, and this case established this as the law in Pennsylvania.\nThe exceptions, as expressed in the opinion, were as follows (P-191):\n\u201cNo cases are to be found in Pennsylvania supporting the view here expressed, but neither can any be found which are in conflict with it. There are cases, Lawrence\u2019s Estate, 136 Pa. 354, and others which recognize the general rule as stated by Lewis, viz: \u2018that a prior estate neither receives enlargement nor suffers diminution when a remainder expectant upon it is declared void for remoteness,\u2019 but the question whether this general rule admits of exceptions is nowhere discussed in any of them. Elsewhere we have seen the rule is not invariably applied, and a recognized exception is where, as in this case (1) the failure of the ulterior estate disturbs, so as to defeat the main and dominant purpose of the testator. (2) Another is where a particular prior estate is adopted as a means for the accomplishment of that which the law forbids. The present \u25a0case falls within both exceptions.\u201d\nThe reason for these conclusions is most clearly stated in the opinion on bottom of pages 189 to 192.\nProf. Gray, in his work on perpetuities, says that if the question that arose in that estate, came before the courts, it would be decided just as the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania did decide it in Johnston\u2019s Estate.\nIn see. 418, Gray on Perpetuities, says: \u201cIf the main (not only) object of an executory trust were to create too remote limitations so that apart from such object, there remained nothing to carry out, it is probable that the whole trust would fall, although there is no case so holding: \u201d Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 671.\n\u201c Thus if there be a direction in a will to accumulate the income for fifty years, and at the end of the time pay the accumulated fund to those who shall then be the heirs of the testator, the gift is void, and those persons will be entitled to the property who would have been entitled to it, had the direction to accumulate and the gift of the accumulated fund both been omitted from the will. The gift of the accumulated fund is \u25a0 void, the direction to accumulate is also to be disregarded and this can be done in either of the two theories. It may be said, that the trust to accumulate exists only for the sake of the gift of the accumulated fund, and as the gift is void, the trust to accumulate fails also.\u201d\nAs has been stated Johnston\u2019s Estate and the present one are very similar. In both the wills attempt to create two estates or interests. In both the estates clearly violated the rule against perpetuities. In the estates to trustees in both there was a power of sale which violated the rul\u00e9 against perpetuities. (The power in this estate might not be exercised until time for distribution.) Both required payment of taxes. Both gave of the income to certain people. In Johnston\u2019s Estate all of the income to the heirs of the testator until final distribution; in this estate, a small part of the income which includes taxes on their farms, to the grandchildren of testator during their lives. In this estate there are annuities to charities until final distribution amounting to $435, there being \u25a0five Sunday schools in Mount Joy. In this estate there are annuities to the great-grandchildren of from $50.00 to $100 which may not vest in lives in being and twenty-one years, under the \u2022second plan and which are, therefore, void and will not be considered here.\nIn Johnston\u2019s Estate the particular estate to trustees was -held void. Will the two points wherein the particular estate mnder the Gerber will differs from that under the Johnston will save it? These points of difference are, first, the payment \u25a0of $550 of the income to or for the grandchildren of testator annually (assuming that the board and washing of testator\u2019s grandson, Samuel, will amount annually to $300) and, second, the payment of $435 of the income annually to charities (churches, coal and cemetery).\nThe balance in the hands of the executors or trustees is over \u25a0$83,000; the real estate of which they have control will run the amount to over $100,000. With accumulations and real \u25a0estate that must come into their hands before time for distribution, this sum will certainly exceed $250,000. But it is fair to assume that now the income is more than $5,000 annually. Of this he directs to. be given to and for certain grandchildren .and to charity, not permanently, but during the lives of the former and to the latter until final distribution, less than one fifth.\nCould it be contended that this particular estate in the trustees was created for the purpose of paying this one fifth of the income ? Does it not seem that the intention of the testator in creating this particular estate was rather to tie up his estate, increasing it by accumulation, until his youngest living great-grandchild was twenty-two years of age ? This particular \u00e9state was a hook in which he desired to suspend this tied up \u25a0estate. \u201c How does it in any way,\u201d quoting from the opinion in Johnston\u2019s Estate, \u201c enforce testator\u2019s wishes to leave the hook in its place, when there is no estate to suspend upon it? ... . Instead of observing his will, is it not rather enforcing one not Ms, to keep alive under such circumstances, an estate which he contemplated only in connection with, another and larger one-which the law has annulled ? \u201d\nThe \u201cmain and dominant purpose\u201d of the testator, was to tie up and accumulate his estate until a future time. It was-not the \u201c main and dominant purpose \u201d to tie it up that one fifth and what will soon be one tenth, more- likely one twentieth, of the income might be paid to charity.\nThe \u201c main and dominant purpose \u201d being defeated by the destruction of the ulterior estate, the intention of the testator would certainly not be carried out by permitting this estate to-stand and to accumulate, for a long, uncertain, illegal period, probably one hundred years, in order that a small part of the income might be paid to charity. If he wanted, as his main and dominant purpose, to provide for these objects of his charity,, he would have provided for them permanently and not only until final distribution.\n\u201c It is equally clear that in the present case the only purpose-the testator had in connection with the trust he established was to make an invalid gift. His aim was to control the disposition of his property beyond the period that the law allows, and this devise was the scheme adopted to accomplish it. It was a manifest attempt to accomplish an illegal object, and for this reason, if for no other, the whole scheme should fail:\u201d Johnston\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 191.\nIf a man desired to tie up his estate for an indefinite and illegal time, before having it divided among his heirs, say possibly a hundred years,'and could accomplish it by giving one fifth,, or what must eventually, be less than one twentieth of the income, to charity, or to individuals, what is to prevent him tying it up for two hundred years by giving one hundredth of the* income to charity? Or if he can do so by giving annually $435 to charity, what is to prevent him doing so if he gives $4.35 to charity ? If the rule against perpetuities could thus be. set at naught, what would be the use of having it at all ?\nIt seems to the auditor the differences between this estate- and Johnson\u2019s estate are not such as will save the particular estate to the trustees under the Gerber will. . The creation of the particular estate being the scheme adopted to control the disposition of his property beyond the period that the law allows was a manifest attempt to accomplish an illegal object, and for this reason the whole scheme must fail, in this estate just as it did in Johnston\u2019s Estate. See also Hillyard v. Miller, 10 Pa. 326.\nThe auditor rests his opinion upon the two following cases: Coggins\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 10, for the destruction of the ulterior estate, and Johnston\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 179, for the destruction of the particular estate in the trustees.\nThe auditor\u2019s conclusion is that the entire amount now in the hands of the executors, less costs of audit, should be paid the Lancaster Trust Company, trustee of Christian N. Gerber, the only son.\nError assigned was the decree dismissing exception to auditor\u2019s report. \u00ab\nA. Gr.Eiclcson, with him W. U.

McCormick, 51 Pa. 504; Chess\u2019s App., 87 Pa. 362.\nIf it be decided that the estate given by this will is a vested interest, then it is not subject to the rule against perpetuities, for ex vi termini it is not subject to a condition precedent: Gray on Perpetuities, see. 205.\nThe fact that a provision would be too remote if construed in a certain way is a reason for supposing that it was not intended to be construed in that way, which, although it cannot avail against a clear form of words, may well be held to govern when the expression is ambiguous : Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 633; Wolf\u2019s Est., 9 W.
