        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThere is not a particle of merit in the claim of the plaintiff in this case. The relations between himself and the defendant were carefully prescribed in the written and sealed agreement made between them on March 2, 1895, and in that agreement it was most positively provided that nothing therein contained should \u201c be construed to vest in Ivery any interest, right, claim or demand in the clay lease or operation whatsoever, the relation between the said M. W. Phillips and the said J. W. Ivery being merely that of employer and employee.\u201d It is not pretended that any interest in the lease or clay was given to Ivery by anything contained in the contract and the claim to a one-fifth interest as 'now set up is founded upon the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony as to a parol understanding previously had. But as this was necessarily, merged in the subsequent written contract it cannot be permitted to be established by any parol testimony on this record. The character of the verbal testimony is such that no court could possibly allow it to alter or change the written contract in any respect. The testimony of Ivery is not only flatly and positively contradicted by Phillips but also by other disinterested witnesses. Moreover Ivery subsequently gave the defendant a receipt in full of all demands, and that fact also is fatally inconsistent with his claim.\nJudgment affirmed.",

The testimony of the superintendent on this subject was flatly and positively contradicted by the owner and other disinterested witnesses. It also appeared that the superintendent had subsequently to the written agreement and prior to the institution of the suit given the owner a receipt in full of all demands. Held, that it was proper to give binding instructions for defendant.\nArgued April 24, 1900.\nAppeal, No. 109, Jan. T., 1900, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Cumberland Co., Nov.

The contract contained the following provision: \u201c It is further agreed that nothing herein contained shall be construed to vest in J. W. Ivery any interest, right, claim or demand in the clay lease or operation whatsoever, the relation between the said M. W. Phillips and the said J. W. Ivery being merely that of employer and employee.\u201d ' Plaintiff alleged that by parol agreement made prior to the written agreement he- was to have a one-fifth interest in the lease. This was denied by the defendant and by several disinterested witnesses. On August 22,1896, Ivery sent to Phillips the following communication :\n\u201cMt.\" Holly Springs, Pa., Aug. 22,1896.\n\u201c M. W.
