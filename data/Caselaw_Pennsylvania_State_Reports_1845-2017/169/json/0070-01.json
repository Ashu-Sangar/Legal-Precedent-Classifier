    "head_matter": "City of York School District\u2019s Appeal.\nConstitutional law \u2014 Statutes \u2014 Local and special legislation \u2014 Act of June 6, 1893 \u2014 Burial places.\nThe act of June 6, 1893, P. L. 342, entitled \u201cAn act authorizing and regulating the taking, use and occupancy of certain public burial places, under certain circumstances for purposes of common school education,\u201d is local and special legislation and repugnant to article III. sec. 7, of the constitution forbidding the general assembly to pass any local or special law \u201cregulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs or school districts,\u201d or \u201crelating to cemeteries, graveyards, or public grounds, not of the state.\u201d\nArgued May 23, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 32, July T., 1895, by the City of York School District, from order of C. P. York Co., setting aside report of viewers.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Williams, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for the appointment of viewers to assess damages for the taking of one half acre of a public burial ground for school purposes.\nFrom the record it appeared that John Penn and John R. Coates by deed dated June 11, 1816, conveyed to the burgess and inhabitants of the borough of York \u201c two contiguous lots of ground called Potter\u2019s Field, situate on the East side of Beaver Street, bounded south by New Street (now College Avenue) and north by the Roman Catholic burying ground, to have and to hold the said two contiguous lots called Potter\u2019s Field unto the Burgess and inhabitants of the Borough of York, to be kept as a public burial place forever and for no other use, intent or purpose.\u201d These lots have been used as a public burial place ever since the conveyance. The board of school controllers of the City of York School District, on Feb. 8,1894, passed a resolution, declaring its intention to take a half acre of this burial place for purposes of common school education under the act of June 6, 1893, P. L. 342, and presented its petition to the court of common pleas of York county for the appointment of viewers to assess damages, etc. The viewers accordingly were appointed and made their report to the court on June 4, 1894. To this report exceptions were filed by the city of York and by R. A. Gr. Ault, a citizen of said city.\nThe court sustained the exceptions in an opinion by Latimer, P. J., and Bittenger, J., the material part of which is as follows :\n\u201cWe are compelled to consider the act of assembly in question unconstitutional for several reasons, which will be stated as briefly as possible.\n\u201c 1st. Because it impairs the validity of a contract. The deed from John Penn and John R. Coates to the municipal corporation, accepted by the latter, was a contract which is entirely abrogated by this act of assembly, a contract to hold the land to a public charitable use, which is overthrown without any adequate method being provided to secure the substitution of the money value of the land, or any part of it, for the land itself, in the continuance of the charity. And to the limited extent to which it does preserve the charity, to wit: the extent of requiring the reinterment of the dead, it substitutes another trustee, to wit: the board of school directors, in place of the one chosen by the grantors. Furthermore, instead of imposing on the substituted trustee the duty of buying other land to serve as a public burial place, it leaves it discretionary with the school board to do so, if they deem it necessary. It is to be observed that the viewers assign this very provision of the act of assembly as a reason for not awarding any damages to the city.\n\u201c2d. We think the act of assembly unconstitutional because it is a local and special act regulating the affairs of a school district, as well as relating to a graveyard not of the state. Its very title shows that it is special and not general. It is entitled \u2018An act authorizing the taking, use and occupancy of certain public burial grounds, under certain circumstances.\u2019 It is well known that this act of assembly was prepared and its passage procured for this particular case, to enable this school board to take this burial ground; and that this was done after a special law avowedly for the same purpose had been vetoed byr the governor. It is special legislation in the guise of a general law \u2014 the most specious and vicious form that special legislation can assume. That this particular school district and this particular burial ground were intended to be affected is made manifest by the 1st section of the act in which all words of general operative effect are so hedged in and limited by other words, confining their operation as to render it extremely probable that there is no other graveyard in the commonwealth within the operation of the act. Certainly they must be very few in number. The act would'have been little, if any, more apparently'' special, if it had enacted that \u2018whenever the school board of York city desired to occupy the Potter\u2019s Field therein, it should be lawful for them,\u2019 etc. Localization and specialization mayr be produced by matter of description, geographical or otherwise, or by words of limitation confining the operation of general terms to an individualized subject-matter. See Com. v. Patton, 88 Pa. 258; Philadelphia v. Cemetery Co., 162 Pa. 105; Weinman v. Pass. Ry. Co., 118 Pa. 192.\n\u201c Being local and special legislation in regard to a matter already provided for by general laws, this act violates the last paragraph of section 7 of act 3 of the constitution. The act of April 9, 1867, which is general law, provides ample machinery for school boards to acquire sites for school houses. Incident* ally it may be suggested that if the city of York desires, for any reason, to dispose of this Potter\u2019s Field, the act of April 18, 1853, known as the Price act, affords an easy method of doing so, and still preserving the charity.\n\u201c Having sustained the 8th and 10th exceptions, we might recommit the report to the viewers, if these exceptions alone were involved. But as in our judgment the act of assembly under which the viewers were appointed is unconstitutional and void, we set aside the report of viewers, and dismiss the petition, thus affording the school board an opportunity, by appeal, to have our ruling reviewed. Feb. 4,1893, decreed accordingly.\u201d\nError assigned was order setting aside report of viewers.\nMay 30, 1895:\nCharles A. Hawkins, for appellant,\ncited: Reading v. Savage, 124 Pa. 334; Evans v. Phillipi, 117 Pa. 226,\nHobert E. Gribson, for appellees\nThe Act of 1893 is unconstitutional : Ayar\u2019s App., 122 Pa. 266; Scranton School Dist. App., 113 Pa. 176; Tyrone Twp. School Dist.
