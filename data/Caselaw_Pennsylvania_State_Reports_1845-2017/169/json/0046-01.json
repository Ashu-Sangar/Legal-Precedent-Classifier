On the other hand, the alleged warranty was denied by the plaintiff; and the questions of fact thus presented were properly submitted to the jury, whose findings were adverse to the defendant.\nAn examination of the record, with special reference to the assignments of error, has not convinced us that there is anything therein to justify a reversal of the judgment entered on the verdict.

    "head_matter": "Ezra M. Eshleman v. James H. Lightner, Appellant.\nSate \u2014 Warranty.\nWhere the sole defense to an action for money due for the purchase of a horse was a warranty of the horse and a breach thereof, evidence that, upon discovering the breach, defendant rescinded the sale and returned the horse to plaintiff, was not admissible.\nArgued May 21,1895.\nAppeal, No. 191, Jan. T., 1895, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Lancaster Co., Nov. T., 1893, No. 36, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Williams, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on a promissory note. Before Livingston, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the note was given as part consideration for a horse sold and delivered by plaintiff to defendant on June 4, 1893. The defense was that the horse was not as warranted by the vendor.\nDefendant testified as to the alleged warranty as follows:\n\u201cA. His answer was, first, he says, \u2018Well, you know it is important to have your neck insured; you want, Mr. Lightner, a family horse, one that a lady can drive, and you can take children out with you with perfect safety. When jmu have this hor$e, you are as safe as 1 am now sitting in this arm chair, perfectly safe.\u2019 Said I, \u2018 Mr. Eshleman, that is your reason for asking this enormous price, $125 more than the1 .appearance or grade of that horse warrants him to be worth?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir, it is in consideration of those extra qualities, I want this extra price.\u2019 Says I, \u2018Will you guarantee, warrant this horse to be good, safe, sound, free from all faults and perfect in every way ? \u2019 \u2018I will,\u2019 he said, and went over my expression, and then went this way (indicating) to clinch the nail on the head. He used gestures to make his statement stronger. This occurred in my dining room. There was nobody present at this conversation.\n\u201c Q. I understand you say, under oath, he warranted this horse to be perfect ? A. I will say under oath, he warranted this horse to be perfectly safe, sound, gentle, that a lady could drive him, and ladies and children could be driven behind him with perfect safety, \u2014 had no tricks and faults whatever. On account of this double guaranty, \u2014 warranty, he wanted $125 extra.\u201d\nJames Hires testified as follows:\n\u201c Q. Will you please state to the court and jury all that occurred, and everything that you can remember that was said on that occasion there by Mr. Lightner or Mr. Eshleman ? A. I heard Mr. Lightner ask Mr. Eshleman whether this horse was sound. Mr. Eshleman said the horse wa$ safe, sound, and any lady could drive him, and very gentle.\u201d\nPlaintiff denied that he made any warranty at all as to the horse.\nThe following letters were produced in evidence :\n\u201cLancaster, Pa., July 26th.\n\u201c Mr. E. Eshleman,\n\u201cDear sir: On August 7th according to agreement I was to pay you in full for the horse; therefore you can look for a letter and check from me at that time; should it not reach you on that particular day, don\u2019t be uneasy, as it will, be sent as soon as possible.\n\u201c I am, etc.,\n\u201c James H. Lightner.\u201d\n\u201c The horse looks first rate and pleases me in every way.\u201d\n\u201c Lancaster, Pa., August 14, 1893.\n\u201c To Mr. E. Eshleman :\n\u201cThe very hard times all over the country now prevailing is the reason I have not paid in full for the horse before this. Within a short time an improvement is expected by eveiy one. Therefore I trust you will have patience awhile longer, as I want to pay you as soon as possible; within a month from this time, most likely.\n\u201cYours, etc.,\n\u201c James H. Lightner,\n\u201c 349 North Duke Steet.\u201d\nThe defendant offered to prove that he rescinded the contract and returned the horse to Mr. Eshleman, the plaintiff, on discovery of the breach of warranty, and that the horse was not as represented.\nObjected to by plaintiff. Disallowed and bill sealed. [1]\nPlaintiff\u2019s points were as follows:\n\u201c1. There is a clear distinction between a warranty and a mere representation. A mere representation that an article is sound and safe is not a warranty. Answer: I affirm that point. [4]\n\u201c 2. If the jury believe from the testimony of James H. Lightner and from the admissions in his letters of June 5th and July 26th, that the horse was all right, tlie verdict must be for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim. Answer: That point we affirm. Because if he did that, had no complaint to make, there was no warranty broken, the time having passed.\u201d [5]\nDefendant\u2019s points were as follows:\n\u201c1. If the jury believes the testimony of the defendant and of James H. Hires that the plaintiff expressly warranted this horse to be sound, safe and gentle, fit for ladies to drive; and that the time said warranty was given said horse was dumb, that was a breach of warranty, and the verdict should be for defendant. Answer: I will say here Mr. Hires did not use the word warranty at all. You have heard the words he did use. They were a representation, not necessarily a warranty. If you believe the testimony of Mr. Lightuer, however, he did warrant this horse expressly. If he used the words Lightner said he used, that would be a warranty, and if the horse was unsound at that time, if you believe that from the evidence, then he would be entitled to damages for the breach of warrant}', which should set off against the amount of this note with interest, and on such finding you will have to ascertain from the evidence what was the amount of damages he sustained. If it was greater than the value of the note and its interest, then your verdict should be for the defendant simply. If it.is not so great, then you will have to ascertain what it is, and deduct it from the amount of the note and interest, and render your verdict for the difference between the amount of damages and the amount of the note and interest for the plaintiff. [6]\n\u201c 2. If the jury believe the testimony of George Nolty and of Dr. E. K. Shaub that this horse was dumb and unsound at the time this warranty was given, they should find for the defendant. Answer: In that we say, first you would have to find there was a warranty. Then you will remember the length of time between the sale and the time they saw him, and if the time was so close as to warrant them in saying he was unsound at the time of sale, if you believe that, you have it all before you, it is a question of fact; then if you find the amount of damages sustained, if there was warranty and that the horse was dumb and unsound at the time of the warranty, the time of the sale, then you will have to do as I have told you with reference to the first point: ascertain the amount of damages, and if the amount is greater than the amount of the note and interest, then find simply for the defendant; if it is not so great, deduct it from the amount of the note and interest and return a verdict for'the plaintiff for the difference between them.\u201d [7]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $280.80. Defendant appealed.\nMirrors assigned, among others, were (1) rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions ; (4-7) above instructions, quoting them.\nMay 30, 1895:\nGeorge A. Lane, O. G.
