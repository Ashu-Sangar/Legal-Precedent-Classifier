Eschenbach skidded and hauled logs to mill, for which lie was to be paid at first $1.50, and after they moved the mill $2.00, per thousand. Both commenced work in June and worked till the sheriff came, which appears to have been on the 23d of, January, 1894. Both were paid a little in cash, and more in goods from the store. Neither kept any book account of the amount of their work, nor of the amount of the charges against them, on account of the same. Keiper, however, swears that the balance due him is at least $50.00 and Eschenbach swears that the balance due him is at least $200, if not more; that the total amount of his work might be $600, $700, or $800, including boarding the men, and the sum total of store bill and cash received should not be $400. That no part of the $200 is for board. Both assert in their notices to the sheriff that the balances claimed are for work in December and January. Eschenbach swears that he never had a settlement with defendants, although he went once to the store for that purpose, but was told that the books were not there.</p>

Smith for the purchase of a stock of store goods at Effort, in Chestnuthill township. An inventory of the goods was taken in the name of Jefferson D- Kresge, amounting to something over $1,200. It was then agreed between Kresge and Green that the latter should clerk for the former at the compensation of $15.00 per month and board until he became of age, when, if everything went right, he might become a partner. In the meantime, Green was to be considered by the <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>public as a partner. The business was to be conducted in the name of Kresge &amp; Green. As Mr. Green very naively testifies, his name was to be used in this way, “So that business might be better, being as I had clerked there three years and was acquainted with the people.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b429-3" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[156,617,1163,451]]]'>“ Manifestly, the intention was to convey the impression that Green ivas a partner, or had an interest in the business. The whole subsequent conduct of the parties was in accordance with this idea. Their goods were bought and sold in the name of Kresge &amp; Green; the store books were kept in the name of Kresge &amp; Green ; the bank account was kept in the name of Kresge &amp; Green, and cheeks were drawn in the name of Kresge &amp; Green. A part, at least, of the lumber business was carried on in the name of Kresge &amp; Green.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[156,1077,1164,909]]]'>“ 3. As a part of the consideration for the stock of store goods bought from Wm. Smith, Jefferson D. Kresge and Oscar Green gave six individual notes of $100 each. Green testifies that the judgment on which fi. fa. No. 29 issued was entered upon one of the notes given to Smith for store stock. This execution is against Jefferson D. Kresge and Oscar Green. Green also testifies that the judgment against Jefferson D. Kresge and Oscar Green, on which fi. fa. No. 24, Feb. T., 1894, was issued, was also entered on a note given for money borrowed from Edwin Serfass that went into the business. It thus appears that Green had not only an ostensible, but an actual interest in the concern, to the extent of the credit, if not money, which he contributed to its capital; if, indeed, a minor who gives his note as his contribution to the capital stock, and, after his arrival at full age, repudiates the obligation, as Green does in this case, can be said to have, in fact, contributed anything at all to the alleged firm’s capital. He testifies that he never contributed anything in money.</p>

Kresge purchased, in his own name, the tract of timber land in Tunkhannock township, on which a part at least of his subsequent lumber operations was conducted. He took the title to this land in his own name, bought a portable sawmill, in his.own name, so far as appears; at least, according to Green, he borrowed $800 from his father, Jerome Kresge, for which he gave his individual note alone, as the fi. fa. No. 26, Feb. T., 1894, in evidence shows; and of this <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>$800, $500 went to pay on the sawmill, and the balance on the land. Kresge hired the men in the woods, and kept the books for the Tunkhannock operations, according to Green, in Kresge’s own name. The men who worked on the lumber job in Tunkhannock were paid partly in cash, and partly, — perhaps chiefly, —in goods from the store at Effort, which, as shown, was run in the name of Kresge &amp; Green. Green kept the account of the men in the woods, from data given him by Wilson Kresge, the foreman.</p>

L. 176, gives a preference in the distribution of the proceeds of sheriff’s sales of saw logs, or of sales made by assignees for the benefit of creditors, for all moneys due for cutting, skidding, hauling and driving of saw logs, limiting the amount to $200 to any one laborer. In this case there was a sale by the sheriff under executions, of a stock of saw logs and lumber <em>inter alia, </em>and two laborers gave notice to the sheriff of their claims, in due form as required by the act. Charles Eschenbaugh claimed a lien for two hundred dollars, and Edwin Keiper claimed a lien for fifty dollars for work done within the statute. The notices to the sheriff were in due form and sufficiently described the character and particulars of the claims. The auditor found as a fact that the work was done to the full amount of the claim in both cases, and this finding was affirmed by the learned court below. The appellants claim that the evidence upon which the auditor acted was not sufficiently definite to justify his findings.</p>

Having read the report of the auditor, and the testimony of the men, each one of whom swore positively that the amount claimed by each was certainly due for work actually done by each, we are satisfied of the truth of the fact and see no occasion to revise the findings of the auditor on this subject. Common laborers do not keep books of account for the work they do, setting down each day the amount of work they have done. Their employers keep such books in which the time made by the men is daily credited, and if any mistake is made by the men in the claims they present, it is in the power of the employers to correct them at once. In this case the auditor reports that one of the employers was present and the other within easy reach and neither was called to disprove either of the claims. <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>We are satisfied with, the report of the auditor upon this branch of the case.</p>

That while it is true Green permitted himself to be held out to the world as a partner, and therefore if he were of age he would be liable as such, in point of fact he was merely a hired man working for fixed wages and had no interest in the business or its profits or losses. He also finds that Green contributed no money or property to the concern, and that while he signed some notes given for a stock of store goods, he paid nothing on the notes, and being a minor who repudiated his obligations on account of his minority, he was subject to no legal liability upon the notes.</p>

But one of the partners had in fact not paid in any part of the capital, and the assets of the firm were in reality contributed by the other partner, whose property they were prior to the partnership. It was held that an individual execution creditor of the partner who owned the assets, was entitled to preference in. the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the property of the firm over a partnership execution creditor. Thompson, J., <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>delivering the opinion, said, “ Between partners themselves the' assets of the firm constitute a fund for the payment of their liabilities, and each member has an equity which he can enforce to accomplish this result and, of consequence, a lien on the property to this extent. . . . When a creditor levies on the property of a firm, his execution fixes and attaches to this right to the same extent that it existed in the partners, and hence the preference over a separate execution creditor in the distribution. All this is predicable of a case of joint property only. But where there was no joint property, the rule has nothing to operate on. The mere name is not enough in such a case— there must be an equity. If that equity never existed, a creditor’s execution could not attach to any right amounting to a lien, to have the assets appropriated to a partnership debt. That Moore has no interest in the firm property is found by the auditor. . . . This being so the property levied on was individual property in fact though seized in the firm’s name. The appellant cannot work out his equity through the partners, for they as such did not exist, inter se, and the individual owner could not give him this right over a prior execution against him individually.” All this, and more, was said of a case in which there was an actual partnership fully agreed upon and really carried on for a number of months. But in the case at bar there never was a partnership as between the alleged partners, and this tñe auditor finds as a fact upon undisputed testimony. In addition to that Green never furnished anything to the firm, and therefore acquired no title to the firm property. He either signed or indorsed some notes with his individual name, but he paid nothing on them. On the contrary he was paid a monthly compensation for his services as clerk or assistant. It is too plain for argument that as between Green and Kresge there never was, and never was agreed to be, any partnership relation. In point of fact Green never contributed a dollar of money or anjr article of property to the partnership, and he never agreed, or intended, to do anything of that kind, nor could Kresge expect him to do so. The notes on which his name appeared not only were never paid by him in whole or in part, but they did not appear on their face to be firm notes, and his liability could never be more than an individual liability. But such as they were, he was a minor when he gave them, he <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>had a legal right to repudiate them, and he actually did repudiate them, as soon as he attained his majoritju We find it-impossible to discover in the testimony, any proof of the existance of any real equity in Green as a partner, and therefore there is nothing upon which to build up a right on the part of any firm creditor to seize upon any firm property, as against an individual execution creditor of Kresge, who had acquired a prior lien upon the goods.</p>
