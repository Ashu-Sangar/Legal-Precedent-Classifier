    <p class="summary" id="b91-3" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[150,541,1166,1018]]]'>From the record it appeared that John Penn and John R. Coates by deed dated June 11, 1816, conveyed to the burgess and inhabitants of the borough of York “ two contiguous lots of ground called Potter’s Field, situate on the East side of Beaver Street, bounded south by New Street (now College Avenue) and north by the Roman Catholic burying ground, to have and to hold the said two contiguous lots called Potter’s Field unto the Burgess and inhabitants of the Borough of York, to be kept as a public burial place forever and for no other use, intent or purpose.” These lots have been used as a public burial place ever since the conveyance. The board of school controllers of the City of York School District, on Feb. 8,1894, passed a resolution, declaring its intention to take a half acre of this burial place for purposes of common school education under the act of June 6, 1893, P. L. 342, and presented its petition to the court of common pleas of York county for the appointment of viewers to assess damages, etc. The viewers accordingly were appointed and made their report to the court on June 4, 1894. To this report exceptions were filed by the city of York and by R. A. Gr. Ault, a citizen of said city.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b91-4" data-blocks='[["BL_91.5",91,[154,1566,1164,138]]]'>The court sustained the exceptions in an opinion by Latimer, P. J., and Bittenger, J., the material part of which is as follows :</p>

The deed from John Penn and John R. Coates to the municipal corporation, accepted by the latter, was a contract which is entirely abrogated by this act of assembly, a contract to hold the land to a public charitable use, which is overthrown without any adequate method being provided to secure the substitution of the money value of the land, or any part of it, for the land itself, in the continuance of the charity. And to the limited extent to which it does preserve the charity, to wit: the extent of requiring the reinterment of the dead, it substitutes another trustee, to wit: the board of school directors, in <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>place of the one chosen by the grantors. Furthermore, instead of imposing on the substituted trustee the duty of buying other land to serve as a public burial place, it leaves it discretionary with the school board to do so, if they deem it necessary. It is to be observed that the viewers assign this very provision of the act of assembly as a reason for not awarding any damages to the city.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b92-5" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[252,740,1168,1419]]]'>“2d. We think the act of assembly unconstitutional because it is a local and special act regulating the affairs of a school district, as well as relating to a graveyard not of the state. Its very title shows that it is special and not general. It is entitled ‘An act authorizing the taking, use and occupancy of certain public burial grounds, under certain circumstances.’ It is well known that this act of assembly was prepared and its passage procured for this particular case, to enable this school board to take this burial ground; and that this was done after a special law avowedly for the same purpose had been vetoed byr the governor. It is special legislation in the guise of a general law — the most specious and vicious form that special legislation can assume. That this particular school district and this particular burial ground were intended to be affected is made manifest by the 1st section of the act in which all words of general operative effect are so hedged in and limited by other words, confining their operation as to render it extremely probable that there is no other graveyard in the commonwealth within the operation of the act. Certainly they must be very few in number. The act would'have been little, if any, more apparently'' special, if it had enacted that ‘whenever the school board of York city desired to occupy the Potter’s Field therein, it should be lawful for them,’ etc. Localization and specialization mayr be produced by matter of description, geographical or otherwise, or by words of limitation confining the operation of general terms to an individualized subject-matter.
