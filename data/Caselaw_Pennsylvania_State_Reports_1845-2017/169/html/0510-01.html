That the contract was made and that the houses were painted and the money earned is not in dispute. The defense is that the houses were owned by Isabella Heron and not by Patrick, and that by a contract made between Isabella and Patrick it was agreed that Patrick should build the houses but not file any liens, and, according to the law, a contract such as that will prevent a subcontractor from recovering for work done on houses by himself. So that the main question in dispute, and in fact the only question in dispute, is who owned the houses, Isabella or Patrick. It is contended by the plaintiff that Patrick was not onty contractor but he was the owner and that Isabella, his sister, was a mere secret trustee for him. That is the substance of the plaintiff’s contention. [The defense is made on behalf of Isabella, who is not present in court. Her <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>testimony has been read in which she says she has been all her life a servant girl, earning various sums of money, as weekly wages, and that she had earned enough to buy property and build houses.] [1] That testimony was taken on her former trial, but she is not here to-day. Patrick Heron denies that he had any ownership in the property. He says he boards in one of the houses, denies that he receives the rent, but will not say who collects it.</p>

If you believe, upon all the testimonjq that she was the absolute owner of the property, that Patrick was not, then this contract is sufficient answer to a claim by a subcontractor. If you believe that the whole transaction was a mere scheme to defraud creditors by putting the property in her name which belonged to Patrick, then the contract between Patrick and his sister is merely a contract by himself to himself and it does not stand in the way of a lien by a subcontractor.] [2]</p>

It comes down to the question, who owned the property? Was the property owned bona fide by Isabella? If so, the lien is bad. If the property was owned by Patrick, and put in her name to defraud creditors and defeat subcontractors of their lien, the contract is no defense and the lien would be good.” [6]</p>

As this effort was necessary to be proved in order to lay the foundation for admitting the notes of her testimony on the former trial, of course the offer of the proof was competent and was properly allowed.</p>

The evidence was not offered to create a resulting trust adverse to the holder of the legal title, but to establish a charge of fraud in which it was claimed that both the parties to the title participated, for the purpose of defrauding strangers <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>to the title, who dealt,with the parties in the way of furnishing labor and materials.

    <p id="b535-3" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[106,637,1161,1731]]]'>The only remaining question therefore was, whether there was sufficient evidence to leave to the jury on this subject. An examination of the testimony of the two defendants convinces us that the evidence was quite sufficient to raise the question. Aside from the proof that Isabella Heron was always a servant girl only working for small weekly wages, and, therefore, could not have the means to engage in such enterprises, it was quite undisputed that the actual transactions were all conducted by her brother. It was he who made the contract, he who raised the money to pay for the cost of the buildings, by effecting a loan upon a ground rent deed signed by his sister because the title to the land was in her, he- who had the title insured when the loan was made. The sister when examined had little or no knowledge, even of the deposits in bank to her credit, from the money borrowed, nor could she tell from what sources she derived money to anything like the extent required in the transaction. The brother drew the checks for the money that was paid out, his sister merely signing them, and he testified that he sometimes made the deposits for her. When asked for information as to where his sister lived or could be found, he denied all knowledge upon that subject, and also as to her occupation. When asked as to the collection of rents of the houses he refused to answer. His testimony was evidently uncan did, unsatisfactory, and given with an apparent desire to conceal the real state of the facts. The testimony of the sister was inadequate, apparently on account of her ignorance of the actual facts of the situation. It can be easily understood that the appearance, and the manner of testifying, of such witnesses, were of great importance in determining their credibility, and the true effect of their testimony. The case was one which necessarily required a submission of all the testimony to the jury who alone could adjudge the facts. We think the court was entirely correct in refusing a binding instruction to find for the defendant and in leaving the whole case to the jury.</p>
