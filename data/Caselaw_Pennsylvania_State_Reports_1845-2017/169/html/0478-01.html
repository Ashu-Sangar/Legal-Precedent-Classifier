The brokers received and retained the certificate for the stock, and in December, 1892, at defendant’s request resold the stock and retained the pi’oceeds. Subsequently defendant directed the brokers to purchase shares of a traction company, and these in turn were sold by the brokers, and the proceeds retained by them.

    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[280,876,1160,754]]]'>The appellant himself testified that the first transaction involved in this case was his purchase of two hundred shares of Reading. “I bought them outright,” and paid for them. Shortly afterwards he sold them, and on his order the brokers bought Traction stock, and retained the proceeds of the Reading as part payment for it. The subsequent transactions were of the same character, actual purchases and sales in which the stocks bought were received by the brokers for defendant, and those sold delivered by them for him to the purchasers. There was all the time on the broker’s book a standing credit to appellant of the monejr received on his account from the sale of the Reading stock, and the subsequent debits and credits for the later purchases and sales. The account closed unfortunatety for appellant with a balance against him, but there is no allegation, certainly no evidence, that it was not correct.</p>
