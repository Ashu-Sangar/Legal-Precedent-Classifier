The land has since passed into possession of other parties, and the several interests of the devisees are now held by Isaac Styer, who is in possession of the same.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b87-11" data-blocks='[["BL_87.10",87,[127,1570,1166,755]]]'>“ The auditor further finds, among other facts, that Mary Weiler, the widow, died on Oct. 18, 1875; that Silas Weiler was adjudged a bankrupt in 1868; on December 17th of that year David G. Esbleman, the assignee in bankruptcy of Silas Weiler, conveyed all the right and title of said Silas Weiler at the time he was adjudged a bankrupt, of the thirty-acre tract of land in question, which interest was subsequently purchased by Isaac Styer, the present owner; that after the death of the widow, George Weiler on Nov. 6,1875, conveyed his undivided interest in said land to Rebecca Weiler, widow of Silas Weiler; that the sheriff of Lancaster county on á writ of venditioni ex-ponas issued out of the court of common pleas, on Oct. 6,1880, sold the interest of George Weiler in said land to John B. Good, who, in turn, sold and conveyed the same to Isaac Styer, the present owner.</p>

There is no doubt, in our opinion, that the acceptance of the real estate was, in law, a purchase by the devisees, to take effect after the decease of the widow, upon condition of the <em>payment </em>of these moneys, <em>that </em>this was the evident intent of the testator in making the devise to his sons can be readily seen from the disposition he makes of the moneys, which formed part of the estate for the purposes of distribution, as it is to be equally divided among his ten children, which includes the devisees. The interest that these devisees, therefore, had in the property was merely an equitable one, the legal title to the land being conditioned upon the payment of the valuation moneys.</p>
