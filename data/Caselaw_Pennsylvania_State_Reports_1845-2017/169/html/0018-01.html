The way is over rough land, unfit for cultivation and of but little value, and was granted in connection with the mining rights and the right to deposit on the land minerals, ores, dirt and other materials used for mining purposes to the extent to which the defendants or their assigns might desire. The construction of the road does not interfere with any present or prospective use of the land, and the injury if any is to the bare legal right. The plaintiffs made no objection to the construction of the road during the progress of the work, nor until more than a year after its completion. Three years after it was finished an action of trespass was brought, and subsequently this bill was filed to restrain the defendants from using the road and to require its removal. The defendants deny that they have committed any trespass. They aver that the title and possession of the land are in them; that the road was built under a claim of right recognized at the time by the acquiescence of the plaintiffs; that the market value of the land covered by the right of way is merely nominal ; that the injury to the plaintiffs, if any, is trifling, and that an action at law is pending for the same alleged trespass.</p>
