Souder was indebted to his sister, the testatrix, in the sum of $7,000. The origin or nature of the debt "was not stated to the auditing judge, but it does not appear that the creditor held any evidence of its existence, or that it was anything else than a mere simple contract debt. At the date mentioned, Joseph W. Souder made to his sister, in consideration of the debt, an absolute conveyance of his interest in •the estate of a brother, Benjamin K. Souder, who had died some time previously. In March, 1882, Mr. Souder, recognizing the fact that the property included in the deed was not likely to pay the debt for which it had been accepted, transferred to his sister 140 shares of stock of the Chester Land Improvement Company, of the par value of $50.00 per share. This stock had no market value, either then or at the present time; but the property belonging to the company is said to be of a character to ultimately yield large profits, and Mr. Souder testified that it is his belief the stock thus assigned to the testatrix will be worth $20,000. It was therefore agreed at the time of the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>assignment that if he should ever pay the debt, or if upon the sale of the stock it should be paid, the testatrix, in the one case, would reassign to him, and in the other that she would give him the surplus. After the conveyance, according to the testimony, there was no right on the part of the creditor to demand payment of the debt. It was an absolute assignment in extinguishment of the debt, with a collateral agreement to reassign, as in Spering’s Appeal, 10 Smith, 199; Lauman’s App., 18 Smith, 88; Haines v. Thomson, 20 Smith, 484; R. R. Co. v. Casey, 29 Smith, .81; etc.</p>

The witness declared that, being indebted to the testatrix, he conveyed to her three houses on Oxford street, which she afterwards, in 1878 or 1880, sold, but failed to realize upon by reason of the incumbrances. He then, on Jan. 24,1879, conveyed to her by deed, the consideration of which -was expressed to be $7,000, his undivided interest in certain real estate which he had derived from his deceased brother. The property was unproductive, and, on March 80, 1882, he caused to be assigned to the testatrix one hundred and forty shares of stock in the Chester Land and Improvement Company of the par value per share of $50.00 but which, he said, had at the time no market value. He declared that the deed of Jan. 24, 1879, was delivered in payment of the debt, and that the transfer of the stock, three years afterwards, was made with the understanding that out of the proceeds, when sold, the testatrix should receive $7,000, and should give him the balance, together with a reconveyance of the properties. If this testimony can be accepted as unimpeached, it established as a fact that the debt was extinguished in 1879, and that the subsequent transfer of stock was founded upon the consideration that the grantee would reconvey. In that event, the case is at one with Haines v. Thompson, <a href="/pa/70/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="70 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1028151" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0484-01">70 Pa. 484</a>, where the deed from the debtor to the creditor was absolute in its terms, and the alleged defeasance bore a much later date, and where the transaction was decided to have been a sale.</p>

It is a remarkable circumstance that while he insists that the <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>deed of 1879.was in payment of the debt, he makes no such claim for the deed of the Oxford street houses which preceded it, and leaves it open to conjecture whether that conveyance passed by way of part payment of the debt or as collateral security for the debt, or whether it denoted a pure gift by him or a purchase by the testatrix. There is absolutely no evidence whatever outside of his own statements to rebut the presumption that both deeds represented out and out sales for a consideration, of which the indebtedness of the grantor formed no part. But these declarations of the debtor are exactly balanced by the testamentary declarations of the creditor. They are, moreover, irreconcilable with his transactions with the testatrix after the conveyances in question had been made. It is possible that a man may be found who will consent to part with his property as collateral security for a debt which he no longer owes, but it is not probable; and something more than his oath will be required to show that his indebtedness had been canceled before he undertook to secure it. The declarations which the legatee now makes are at variance even with his own statements of record. In the inventory which he filed in December, 1886, he set out as an asset of the estate the following: ‘ J. W. Souder, due decedent with collateral $7,000.’ If we accept the testimony of the legatee, we throw into a case which, so far as the record goes, is perfectly simple and consistent in all its parts, an element of confusion and incongruity. It is conceded that the decedent was her brother’s creditor to the extent of $7,000, and it is not pretended that she ever pressed him for payment, It would not be extraordinary that she should purchase from him some small properties, while she permitted his indebtedness to remain, nor that she should afterwards accept from him as collateral security for that debt stock which had in it a large prospective value. The will which she wrote, and the inventory which the debtor filed, are-both in harmony with this theory, and are inexplicable on any other. In opposition thereto, the debtor would have us believe that he paid his debt by a conveyance of properties whose value was far below the amount of the debt; and that years afterwards he assigned, by an instrument absolute in its terms, stock which he asserted was intrinsically worth $20,000 to secure the debt from which he had been absolved. We can only say that if the legatee is to be believed the testatrix cannot be.</p>

He owned this propertjr out in West Philadelphia, those houses out there.” He further said that the deed was absolute and that it was dated the 24th of January, 1879, leaving no doubt as to the identity of the instrument. But he had just previously said it was given as collateral to the $7,000 debt. The fact that the deed was absolute was not at all inconsistent with its being given, and received, as collateral for the debt, because the absolute form of the conveyance was the proper and customary mode of passing the title. He did not say that he told his sister that he gave it in payment of the debt or that she received it as such. A little earlier in his first examination he was asked: “Q. Do you know what the collaterals are without their production? A. I gave her in the first place three houses on Oxford street for the consideration of $3,000, between 17th <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>and 18th streets, on the south side. In 1878 or 1880 she soid them to the mortgagee. I do not think she got anything out of them. I then gave her an assignment of all the real estate —of the real estate I had conveyed to me from my brother’s estate.”</p>
    <p id="b267-5" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[136,619,1160,398]]]'>In this connection he calls the deed an assignment and classes it among the collaterals. The question was asked in reference to the account filed by the executors, of whom the witness, J. W. Souder, was one. The account proper contained a distribution account annexed to it, in which occurred the following item: “Indebtedness of J. W. Souder secured by collateral retained by the executors for further accounting when a sale of the collateral becomes possible — $7,000.”</p>
    <p id="b267-6" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[139,1025,1161,856]]]'>The accountants asked that the remainder of the funds in their hands should be distributed, amounting to $3,000 of principal and $473.25 of interest, and that this “ indebtedness of J. W. Souder ” which was secured by collateral “ should be reserved by the executors for further accounting when a sale of the collateral becomes possible.” It was to ascertain what the collaterals were that the above question was asked and answered. Now the account was filed on Nov. 10, 1893, seven years after the death of the testatrix, and the above testimony of J. W. Souder was delivered on Jan. 5, 1894, whereas the deed which he says paid off the $7,000 debt was made to his sister in January, 1879. If the debt was paid byr the deed it could not be a subject of collateral, either when the account was filed, or when Souder testified. If the debt was paid in 1879 there could not be any “future accounting” for it in November, 1893, when the account was filed, nor in January, 1894, when Souder testified as above.</p>

Souder altogether inconsistent with the theory that the debt was paid by the deed. He had transferred to his sister in 1882 one hundred and forty-shares of stock in the Chester Land and Improvement Company, the par value of which was $50.00 per share, amounting on its face .to $7,000. He was asked about this transfer and said, “ No, sir; I gave her that stock in this way. She never got any income from this property. I said to her, ‘ Kate, there is the stock which will be worth maybe $20,000 or more; I will give you the first $7,000 out of these shares ; then you can give me <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>any properties I got.’ Q. Then the understanding was when you sold a certain portion of that stock and got $7,000 out of it for her you were to have the deed back ? A. When I paid the $7,000, yes, sir. . . . Q. What else did you give as security to your sister besides that deed and that certificate of stock ? A. I do not think I gave anything at all, sir. I do not remember a thing. ... By the Court: Mr. Souder, as I understand, no part of the $7,000 has ever been paid ? A. No, sir. . . . Q. So the prior debt of $7,000 is still unpaid ? A. Seven thousand dollars, sir.”</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[263,876,1160,297]]]'>With all the charity which it is possible to extend to the witness, and with a perfect willingness to attribute to him a mere misunderstanding of his rights, and a misconception of his true position, it is certainly not possible to regard his testimony, taken in its entirety, as the basis of a judicial sentence or decree that his debt of $7,000 was paid by the deed of 1879.</p>
    <p id="b268-5" data-blocks='[["BL_268.5",268,[263,1180,1158,243]]]'>In the inventory of his sister’s estate taken in December, 1886, a few months after her decease, this debt was noticed as an asset of the estate thus: “ Indebtedness of J. W. Souder to decedent of $7,000, secured by sundry collateral of.uncertain and unknown value. Face value $7,000.”</p>
    <p id="b268-6" data-blocks='[["BL_268.6",268,[261,1435,1160,1007]]]'>As this inventory was filed bjr the executors, of whom he was one, it must be taken as their deliberate assertion that the entire debt was then due to the estate, three years and more after the deed of 1879 was given. Again, when the account was filed in November, 1893 lie, as one of the executors, charged himself with an item called “ Indebtedness of J. W. Souder. . . . $7,000,” and it was one of the several items which constituted an aggregate of $10,944.57 of assets of the estate. This account was verified by the affidavit of its correctness made by J. W. Souder himself. The description of it in the annexed distribution account we have already given. We are very clearly of opinion that upon the testimony and acts of Mr. Souder it must be adjudged that his debt to the testatrix was not paid by giving her the deed, that no part of it has ever yet been paid, and that it is a present subsisting indebtedness. It was not barred by the statute of limitations because the transfer of stock which was made in 1882, was a distinct acknowledgment of the debt from which a promise to pay was reasonably deducible, Palmer v. Gillespie, <a href="/pa/95/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="95 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="492912" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0340-01">95 Pa. 340</a>, and this took place within six years of the death of the testatrix.</p>
    <p id="b269-4" data-blocks='[["BL_269.3",269,[145,367,1161,608]]]'>
      <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>In addition to the foregoing considerations it is perfectly plain that the testatrix considered the claim as an existing debt against her brother at the time her will was made in June, 1886. She there recites it as a debt which her brother owes her and bequeaths it when paid, to various charitable legatees. While such a declaration could not operate to create a debt, it is certainly strong evidence that a debt already existing, still continued. It could not be extinguished by the acceptance of the deed unless she so intended at the time, and of that there is no evidence. Souder’s statement that the debt was paid by the deed is nothing more than his own opinion to that effect. He does not say that she agreed to take it as payment.</p>
    <p id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[144,984,1161,442]]]'>We do not understand that the court below personally surcharged the executors with the amount of this debt. The court simply ordered that the executors should make sale of the securities and file an account of the proceeds, and that notice of the sale should be given to all parties in interest. This we think was correct. No time was fixed within which the sale should be made. We think a sale should be made after a notice to redeem has been given, for which a reasonable time should be allowed to the debtor.</p>
    <p id="b269-6" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[143,1444,1162,291]]]'>The decree of the court below is affirmed, and it is ordered that the accountants make sale of the securities received from Joseph W.
