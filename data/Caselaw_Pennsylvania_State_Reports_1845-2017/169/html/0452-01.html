It may be made of anything which will produce a hard firm smooth surface for travel. But that with which we are specially concerned in the class of cases to which this belongs, is a pavement which marks the ^conversion in a legal sense, of a common road into a street, for that is the only kind for which under the settled line of authorities from Hanmiett v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/65/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="65 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="430574" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0146-01">65 Pa. 146</a>, down, an abutting property owner can be compelled to pay. As said by the present chief justice in Harrisburg v. Segelbaum, <a href="/pa/151/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="151 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="836719" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0172-01">151 Pa. 172</a>, “the controlling consideration is not so much whether the prior improvement of Market street by macadamizing was in the strict sense of the word a paving thereof, as whether by said improvement the street was changed from an ordinary clay road into a good, reasonably smooth and substantial artificial highway, practically equivalent to an ordinarily well improved street, paved with cobble stone or other materials then used for paving.”</p>

Not necessarily by formal-ordinance declaring the change, for it is not always convenient or even possible to make such documentary proof, but municipal recognition of the pave,ment of the street, as such, must appear, either by action in the first instance or by acquiescence and adoption subsequently. The other questions which usually arise as to the kind of pavement, whether by wood, or cobble stones or macadamizing or otherwise, and who paid for it, are subordinate, and are only material or relevant as bearing on the main issue of municipal recognition. They have been treated therefore by this court not as questions of law but as questions of fact whose weight and bearing depended on the other evidence and the circumstances of each ease.</p>

Neither ordinance nor contract is proved.

Laird, Harrisburg v. Segelbaum, and Boyer v. Reading. Some illustrations of the legislative use of the word in relation to paving will be found in the opinion of WILLSON, J., quoted in Leake v. Phila., <a href="/pa/150/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="150 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="834402" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0643-01">150 Pa. 643</a>, 649, 650, and in some of the other cases cited, supra. ' But Philadelphia v. Ehret, <a href="/pa/158/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="158 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="848178" data-case-paths="/pa/158/0001-01">158 Pa. 1</a>, shows that there is no hard,and fast rule on the subject of the kind of paving. It is a question of fact in each case, and’the governing consideration is the nature of the municipal action with regard to it. When the boundaries of the city of Philadelphia were made coterminous with the count, by the consolidation act of 1854, certain rural and suburban districts, with their roads, were brought under the municipal jurisdiction. Some of these were mere township roads, while others were main arteries of travel and trade, built up closely for considerable distances so as^to be practically streets. Radiating from the old city were several principal thoroughfares such as Moyamensing and Passyunk roads to the south, Erankford, Old York, Germantown and Ridge roads to the north. These the c^ might continue as ordinary though important and much traveled roads, and keep in repair as such until the proper time should arrive for the change, or on the other hand might recognize or adopt as streets sufficient^ well paved for all the requirements of the present or near future. And if the latter cour&amp;e was adopted as to any road or any portion thereof, no matter how or with what material it <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>was paved, then it became a street as a result of such action, and the future growth of the city, and necessity of a different pavement would not change its character or subject the abutting owners to charge for new paving. The case of Allegheny Avenue, Philadelphia, v. Ehret, <a href="/pa/153/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="153 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="840250" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0001-01">153 Pa. 1</a>, is an illustration of this result.</p>
    <p id="b479-3" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[134,672,1164,1312]]]'>The present claim is for paying with Belgian blocks a part of Ridge avenue, one of the main thoroughfares above referred to, leading northwest from the old city. The affidavit of defense sets forth that the road was macadamized by the Ridge Turnpike Company in 1811, and so maintained until it was acquired by the city in 1873; and since 1873 the city “has maintained the said road or turnpike as a public highway, and has repeatedly repaired and repaved the same with macadam.” There is nothing here to show that Ridge avenue, where appellant’s property is situated, has ceased to be a road and become a street, still less that it has become so by municipal action or acquiescence. The Ridge turnpike by the charter of 1811 (P. L. 167) began at Tenth and Vine streets in Philadelphia, and extended to Perkiomen bridge in Montgomery county. In fact it was made to begin at Ninth and Vine. We might assume'from our general knowledge of the localities that in 1890 it had certainly become a street at Ninth and Vine, and almost certainly had not become a street at Perkiomen bridge. But its status as a road or a street at the intermediate point in Roxborough does not appear, and the affidavit showing that down to 1873 it was not a paved street, the burden was on appellant to show that its character in that respect had changed. This the affidavit fails to do. Mere maintenance as a highway, and repairs and repavings for the purpose of such maintenance, are all that are averred, and 'these are not sufficient: Phila. v. Dibeler, <a href="/pa/147/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="147 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="829774" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0261-01">147 Pa. 261</a>.</p>
