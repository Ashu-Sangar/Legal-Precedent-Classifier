In the summer of 1889, the company began the construction of an armory upon the lot from funds collected by voluntary subscriptions. After the foundation walls had been erected, and a part of the stone for the superstructure laid, the lot was found unsuitable, and the work was stopped. The company, however, did not formally undertake to sell the lot until November, 1891. In July, 1892, it was sold to the University of Pennsylvania. The proceeds of t.he sale, together with other funds collected, were applied to the erection of an armory elsewhere, which is now completed and in occupation. The city claimed to collect the tax assessed for the year 1891 upon the lot in question. The court gave binding instructions for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</p>

It is a military organization maintained,by state appropriations and public subscriptions, and its only object is the gratuitous service of the public without any profit or expectation of gain. The lot in question was purchased for the purpose of erecting thereon an armory building for the use of the Battery and was of course public property. If the building had been completed and used for its intended purpose, it is not contended that, it would have been liable to taxation. But the building was only commenced, and then abandoned on account of an objectionable location, and the appellee then sought, and finally obtained, another lot upon which they afterwards erected a complete armory building. The first lot was finally sold and the proceeds were used in the purchase of the new lot and the erection of the new armory. It is argued for the appellant that during the interval between the abandonment of the first building- and the erection of the new one, the first lot and partly constructed building were subject to taxation.</p>

There was nothing in the evidence to show that the lot was held for investment purposes or for any purpose of profit. It was manifestly held only until it could be sold, and it was sold as soon as a purchaser could be obtained, and the proceeds used for the erection of the new building.</p>
