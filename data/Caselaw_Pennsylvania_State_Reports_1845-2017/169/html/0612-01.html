The first one of these is, whether or not the bond taken by the sheriff is in such form as to satisfy the requirement of the law. It is claimed by the plaintiff that it is not, and that the sheriff is liable by reason of taking the bond which is not in such form as to enable the defendant to get any benefit out of it. The only condition in the bond which is necessary to refer to is the condition, ‘That if the said W. H. Thompson shall be and appear at the county court of common pleas to be held at War<a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>ren, in and for the said county, upon the first Monday of September next, then and there to defend and make good his claim to the said piano/ and so on, then the bond ‘ to be void; or else1 to be in full force and virtue.’ It is claimed by the plaintiff that this means merely that Thompson shall be and appear at the September court for the purpose of making good his claim ; and as he did that-entered his appearance in due course .of the proceeding — he has satisfied the condition, and therefore the bond was of no value; that it has never been broken and was of no use to the plaintiff in that suit,</p>

We think it means, in substance, that the defendant, the obligor, Thompson, should appear on the first Monday of September next, and should thereafter in due course of the proceedings make good his claim of title to the property. If he failed to do that, the bond is forfeited. And had the sureties been good and responsible, the plaintiff in this suit might collect the amount of the judgment from them — Thompson being himself insolvent.] [8]</p>

And it is argued, with a good deal of force, that the reasons which lean to such a construction apply with equal force to the claim property bond given by the defendant who keeps the property, claiming it as his own. In both cases the bond is taken by the sheriff, who is the sole judge of the sufficiency of the sureties. Both bonds contain a clause for the indemnification of the sheriff. Suits upon them must be brought in the name of the sheriff for the use of the person injured. In all these particulars they are alike, and the reasoning would seem to apply as well to one as to the other.</p>

Did the sheriff use due care and reasonable diligence to secure sureties who would be responsible, and probably responsible at the end of the proceedings ? He was bound to know that these sureties could not be called upon to pay until the end of the replevin proceedings. Of course, he was bound to require sureties whom he had reasonable cause for believing that they would not only be good at the moment, but good at the end of the proceedings; that they should be solvent — having sufficient estate to answer the amount of the bond, and such credit as would lead to a reasonable probability that they would be solvent at the end of the replevin proceedings. If he did that, made a reasonable inquiry as to these facts, acted as a prudent man would act in his own business, and just as careful, then he discharged his duty, and he would not be responsible. But if he failed in this respect he is responsible. If he failed to secure proper sureties bjr his own negligence, or failed to give such attention and care as a prudent man would give to his own business, under similar circumstances, then he would be liable to the plaintiff, otherwise not. If, when this bond was executed, the sureties were in fact — or if only one was in fact such a surety as I have described, having estate sufficient to answer the bond, and of such credit as would lead to a reasonable probability that he would continue to be good to the end of the proceedings, the sheriff would not be liable, even although .the sureties afterwards became insolvent, and the debt be lost by the plaintiff by reason of it.

Knake, plaintiff’s intestate, issued a writ of replevin against one W. H. Thompson for a piano valued at $600. The writ was placed in the hands of defendant, sheriff Henry Fuellhart who, on the second day afterwards, served it on Thompson, who gave to the sheriff a claim property bond, with two sureties, in penal sum of $1,200, and retained possession of the piano. Thompson then entered appearance and plea, and on 25th of February, 1892, after trial, plaintiff got a verdict for $550, upon which judgment was entered. Upon this, <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>he issued execution against Thompson, which was returned nulla bona. Then plaintiff brought this suit against the sheriff, averring that the property bond accepted from Thompson was defective in form, and the sureties insufficient, and for his neglect in accepting such bond he was answerable to him in damages. The sheriff, by proper plea, denied his liability. When the case was on trial, the plaintiff offered in evidence the bond, to show that it was insufficient in form, in that it did not contain an obligation that defendant “ shall abide the judgment of the court in all things relating to the premises.” This, plaintiff argued, was the omission of any undertaking on part of the sureties that Thompson would pay the judgment against him in the action of replevin. The court, however, held that the following stipulation in the bond was a sufficient undertaking to that effect: “That if the said W. H. Thompson shall be and appear at the county court of common pleas to be held at Warren .... on first Monday of September next, then and there to make good his claim to the piano; ” that this was an undertaking by the sureties that Thompson should be successful in his defense of the suit, and if not the sureties would pay the judgment against him.</p>

The question put to the witnesses by defendant’s counsel was, whether A. R. Blood, one of the sureties, was solvent or insolvent. This was objected to by plaintiff’s counsel, on the ground that witness could only testify to what the surety owned and what he owed, leaving the inference of solvency or insolvency to be drawn bjr the jury. The witness stated he was solvent. Appellant now argues, this was proving solvency by reputation. An examination of the testimony, however, shows this to be a mistake. The witness was a brother of the surety, and the latter, previous to this trial, died. The witness knew his brother’s affairs in his lifetime, and had assisted in the settlement of his estate. From his thorough knowledge, he considered him amply solvent at the date of the bond, and for some time afterwards. He could not give a list of his debts, or a list and value of his brother’s properties. But his own means of knowledge of his brother’s affairs warranted a belief, and this he testified to. As to the alleged error in admitting this testimony, we can only say, there are no known means of ascertaining, with absolute certainty, the solvency of men engaged in business; it is seldom, other than the owner knows or can know just what he owns; it is a rare case that other than the debtor knows, or can know, just what he owes. Still, men act in contracting and crediting on their judgment, because in most eases they can act on nothing else. If courts, banks, public officers and business men, did not move in important transactions until absolutely certain of the solvency of those with whom they dealt, the affairs &lt;ff the world would stop. Partnerships, banks, corporations and individuals, believed to be solvent, sometimes fail, bringing loss and disaster to those who, in the exercise of judgment, trusted them ; but this only shows that in a comparatively small percentage of cases good judgment and care have been at fault; so here, with the most intimate knowledge of his brother’s affairs, the witness believed him solvent when the bond was accepted, and that he so continued for some time after. The testimony of the other three witnesses was of the same import; one was his banker, the other two his business partners; from their opportunities of knowledge, thejr testified as to their judgment, and further said that he was reputed solvent among business men. It was proper to give his repute, not to prove solvency, but to negative <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>any assertion of negligence on part of sheriff, by accepting sureties reputed insolvent. Of itself, it was not evidence, but plaintiff had offered evidence which was claimed to show notorious insolvency, and this was in answer thereto.</p>
    <p id="b642-5" data-blocks='[["BL_642.4",642,[240,582,1162,1163]]]'>The fifth to eighth assignments, inclusive, are to the refusal to affirm plaintiff’s first to ninth, inclusive, written prayers for instructions to the jury, as to insufficiency in form of the bond. The court, in its general charge, had already interpreted the obligation of the bond as fixing the liability of the sureties for anjr judgment obtained by plaintiff when the bond was accepted; this was a distinct denial of each of these points, and plaintiff has an exception to the general charge, which puts the error, if error there was, in shape to be corrected on appeal. The interpretation of the written bond was for the court, and not for the jury; after stating clearly the court’s view of the obligation to the jury, it would have been a wholly useless formality to have read and denied these nine points; th'e whole nine were but a repetition of the idea, the bond was not properly drawn, so as to fix the liability of the sureties in the event of an adverse judgment in the replevin suit. We agree with the interpretation of the court below. The condition, that if the principal should appear in court and there defend and make good his claim to the piano, then the bond to be void, or else to be in full force and virtue, was a full assumption of liability by the sureties ; he did appear, but did not make good his claim to the piano; in that event, the sureties undertook to pay the value, or what is the same thing, the amount of the verdict.</p>

Humphreys, 14 S. &amp; R. 23, it is laid down as a settled rule that, as to a replevin bond tendered by the plaintiff for the delivery of the property to him, the sheriff is answerable to the defendant, not only for the sufficiency of the sureties when the bond is taken, but when the judgment has determined the property to be in defendant. And so the law has stood. An examination of these cases will show that they followed the English rule, where the writ lay, only in cases of goods distrained for rent in arrears; Oxley v. Cowperthwaite was decided in 1788; Pearce v. Hum<a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>phreys, supra, follows <em>it </em>thirty-eight years after, and in the opinion, Duncan, "J., regrets that the rule does not accord with his sense of justice, but considers it too firmly established to be set aside. But in all the cases since, the question was, as in that ease, as to the sufficiency of the bond given by the plaintiff, the replevin bond. The liability of the sheriff for the acceptance of sureties in the claim property bond, who were solvent at the time, yet when the event of the suit worked a forfeiture of their bond turned out to be insolvent, was not a question for decision in those cases. Duncan, J., in Pearce v. Humphreys, supra, says : “ If I were to be guided by my own sense of justice without regard to authority, I must own that it would seem to me that commutative justice would require a different criterion; for as the sheriff would be liable to an action of trespass for removing the goods and delivering them to plaintiff, when the defendant offers sufficient pledges on the claim of property, and could not justify under the replevin; and that as the criterion there would be their sufficiency at the time, so it ought to be where he delivers up the goods to the plaintiff in replevin. Their apparent responsibility at the time when he accepted them would have been the justest rule at first. The sheriff does all he can to make diligent inquiry; he ought not to be bound to know what nobody else knows.” The intimation here is, that the sheriff in a claim property bond is only answerable for the sufficiency of the sureties when accepted. Again, in Commonwealth v. Rees, <a href="/whart/3/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="3 Whart. 123" data-case-ids="1833423" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0123-01">3 Whart. 123</a>, Gibson, C. J., remarks, when speaking of the decisions in Oxley v. Cowperthwaite and Pearce v. Humphreys, supra: “ The construction in the case of a replevin bond, unjust as it is in its extreme breadth, which holds the officer to a measure of carefulness, unprecedented in the case of any one else but a carrier, is founded, as in the case of a carrier, in policy alone; with this difference, however, that the carrier is a voluntary agent and the officer an involuntary one.” And again, in Myers v. Clark, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 535" data-case-ids="1854613" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0535-01">3 <em>W. </em>&amp; S. 535</a>, Kennedy, J., says, the decisions in the two leading cases already cited have placed “the sheriff under a most unreasonable if not unjust responsibility.” So, although the injustice of holding the sheriff to such a rigorous liability in case of a replevin bond has been often remarked on by the court, that responsibility has in no case been denied, and it exists to-day <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>as in Oxley v.

But it never has been decided in this state that he is answerable for the solvency of the sureties in a claim property bond, at the end of the trial of the replevin suit. As we have noticed, this court with much reluctance has adhered to precedent in the case of the sheriff’s liability on a replevin bond, but this is the first, case so far as we have found where it was sought to hold him to the same liability on a claim property bond.</p>

The replevin bond is a statutory requirement; without it, the writ cannot be served; if the writ be executed, the situation of the parties is changed; the plaintiff has the possession of the disputed property before his right is judicially determined; the defendant is deprived of the possession of what may afterwards be found to be rightfully his; the change of status is altogether in favor of plaintiff and prejudicial to defendant, during the pendency of suit. The tendency of the proceeding, if the utmost rigor in exacting sufficient sureties on the replevin bond, be not enforced would be to tempt the unscrupulous to assert unfounded claims to chattels, and secure possession by the tender of worthless bonds to the sheriff., But if defendant tender a bond with sureties, at the time sufficient, then the suit is at once turned into a chose in action, resulting in a judgment in favor of plaintiff, if the right be in him. The parties, so far as possession of the disputed property is concerned, stand as before the writ, but, if the right be determined in favor of plaintiff, he has' personal judgment against defendant, ripe for execution, and also recourse to the property bond.</p>

This was, in substance, the law, as declared by the learned judge of the court below, both in his general charge and in his answers to points; in so declaring, he committed no error.
