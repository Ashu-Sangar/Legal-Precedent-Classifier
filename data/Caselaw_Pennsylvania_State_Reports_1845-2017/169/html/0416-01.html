Of course by demurring the defendants admit the truth of the allegations, and the question is whether the facts thus established entitle the plaintiff to the relief asked for. It will be noticed that the bill does not deny absolutely the right of the two companies to occupy South Fourth street with their track, but only denies the right to occupy the street ‘under said ordinances.’ The reason assigned is that these ordinances are special, and ‘ that it was incompetent for the said city of Easton to grant the said privilege to the said Easton &amp; Bethlehem Transit Co. by special ordinance without first providing the terms and conditions by a general ordinance.’</p>

By act June 14, 1887, § 32, P.

But even if the law were otherwise there is no proper averment in the bill that a general ordinance was not passed. Every material fact, to which the plaintiff means to offer evidence, ought to be distinctly stated: Story’s Eq. PL § 528. The contention that the ordinances under consideration contravene the constitutional clause against the passing of any local or special law granting to any corporation any special or exclusive privilege, <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>is fairly met bj^ Klingler v.

But the plaintiff has another grievance and a substantial one, as to which the city of Easton is made codefendant. He is the owner of a house and lot on said street, and the averment in the bill is ‘that the grade of the said Fourth street in front of the said premises was changed by raising the level of the street about one foot,’ causing irreparable injury. When or by whom the change of grade was made we are not informed, but on this single averment, we are asked to award an injunction compelling the Easton &amp; Bethlehem Transit Co. to restore South Fourth street to the same condition it was in before the construction of its railway and also compelling the city of Easton ‘ to maintain the grade of said Fourth street in front of the premises aforesaid according to gradients established by the legal enacted ordinances of said city.’</p>

In other words, there must be such certainty in the averment of the title upon which the bill is founded, that the defendant may be distinctly informed of the nature of the case which he is called upon to meet. The other material facts ought also to be plainly yet succinctly alleged and with all necessary and convenient certainty as to the essential circumstances of time, place, manner and other incidents: ’ Story’s Eq.

Indeed it is a fair inference from one of the ordinances recited in the bill, and the fact is believed to be, that the change was made b3r the company with the knowledge and consent of the city authorities and under the supervision of its department of highways. If therefore the company simply made the physical change and in doing so acted as the agent of the city, which had the exclusive right to make the change, and to unmake it if neeessar}T, then the change was the act of the city, and the company can no more be enjoined to restore the original grade than one of its workmen. On the other hand, if the change of grade was made by the city, it cannot be doubted, especially in the absence of any averment that the change was illegally made, that the remedy of the plaintiff is on the law side of the court. For the reasons given we think that the case made by the bill does not entitle the plaintiff to equitable relief, and that the demurrer should be allowed. Even if the bill was in other respects free from criticism, it is an open question whether it is not bad for multifariousness : Story’s Eq. PI. §§ 271-286.</p>

It is scarcely necessary to review in detail the considerations expressed in the very clear and satisfactory opinion filed. In substance the complaint of the plain<a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>tiff is that his property is injuriously affected by the flowing, in times of storm, of water and gravel over the curbstone, the depth of which from the top to the surface of the gutter stone, has been reduced from six inches to two inches. This result it is alleged was accomplished by a slight elevation in the surface line of the street amounting, according to the averments of the bill, to one foot in the center of the street to four inches at the curb line. As the elevation in the center of the street is not alleged to be, and most probably,is not, in and of itself, a cause of any injury, it must be considered that whatever injury is sustained by the plaintiff results from an insufficient depth of the gutter in front of his property. But the city in its corporate capacity has the supreme control over the streets, pavements, alleys and passages of all kinds, and determines in the exercise of its function's, everything in connection with their grading, paving and condition according to its best judgment. If it chooses to grade its streets so as to leave only a two inch depth of gutter instead of six, we see no reason why it may not do so without being subject to any control of the courts. While it may well be that for any arbitrary or unreasonable arrangement of its grades which works injury to the property of an abutting owner, it may be responsible in damages for the injury, we cannot understand how the courts can take away from the city by a mandatory injunction, its right exclusively to establish the street grades. In the present case the change is alleged to have been made by the transit company, acting under an ordinance of the city councils granting permission to construct a passenger railway over certain named streets, upon certain conditions, one of which was the widening of Dock street by the company to a uniform width of twenty-four feet. One of the ordinances to which the Transit Company became subject in the laying of its track, provided that the surface of the rails when laid must be kept on a level with “ the present established grades, or such grades as may hereafter be established for the streets on which said tracks are now located or may hereafter be located.” And the bill also alleges that the same ordinance provides that, “ whenever in the construction or reconstruction of its roadbeds or tracks it may be necessary to change the contour and cross sections of the streets to accommodate said tracks to existing gradients <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>and regulations, all expense thus entailed shall be borne by the said railway compaiy', and the work shall be done under the supervision of the department of highways.”</p>
    <p id="b445-3" data-blocks='[["BL_445.4",445,[185,515,1167,913]]]'>Now the fourth clause of the bill alleges that the Transit Company by virtue of the said ordinances began to lay their tracks in front of the plaintiff’s lot, and that in doing so they changed the grade of the street by raising it one foot in the center and four inches at the curb, and thereby caused the flowage of water and other substances as complained of, but there is no allegation that this was done without the consent of the city, or that it was not done under the supervision of the department of highways. If, as the first part of the fourth clause alleges, the work was done, “under and by virtue” of the ordinances, the necessary inference is, in the absence of a contrary allegation, that it was done in the way permitted by the ordinances, that is, under the supervision of the department of highways. This inference is very much strengthened by the fact that the city of Easton is not complaining of any violation of the ordinances, and in fact is a defendant in this bill, and a decree is asked that the city shall be ordered to maintain the grade, “according to legal enacted ordinances.”</p>
    <p id="b445-4" data-blocks='[["BL_445.5",445,[187,1435,1164,546]]]'>Now an averment that the change of grade was made b}r virtue of the ordinances, and the only allegation of any violation of the ordinances being that the grade was slightly raised when such a change is permitted by the ordinances, is not a sufficiently specific allegation of any wrongful act to warrant a court of equity in interfering by the extreme process of injunction. There should certainly be an allegation that the work was not done under the supervision of the department of highways, as that element would be necessary to make the work illegal, and contrary to the ordinances. There is nothing of this kind in the bill.</p>
    <p id="b445-5" data-blocks='[["BL_445.6",445,[190,1996,1161,88]]]'>We think there is no merit in the second and fifth specifications of error.</p>
