The answer further denied that the so-called debt of J. W. Souder was represented by certain interests in the real and personal estate of his deceased brother, and that it was an obligation such as could be enforced at law, averring that it consisted simply of an option on his part to claim the reassignment of the stock upon payment by him of the $7,000, and that at' no time since decedent’s death had the stock attained any value because the real estate operation which it represented as yet remained immature. It further denied the insolvency of J. W. Souder, and averred that he is in better circumstances than when nominated as executor by decedent, who was fully acquainted with his financial condition. It admitted the change of residence of two of the executors, but denied the alleged incapacity of Harry N Williams, and averred that the executors had managed the estate for the best interests of all concerned, had even voluntarily added to it without expectation of reimbursement, and had received no commission for their services; and further, that it was contrary to the intent of the will itself that said Souder should be removed from control of said stock.</p>

The power of removal of the two executors who have ceased to reside in the state is discretionary. Act March 29, 1832, § 27, Purd. 560; Grotz’s App., 1 Northampton 96. It is submitted that the removal of Mrs. Manderson would not further the cause of administration, nor would her continuance as executor prejudice the estate remaining undistributed. If the application for the removal of Mr. Williams is based on the ground of physical disability under act May 1, 1861, § 2, Purd. 561, it is to be observed that this act applies to <em>sole </em>executors only, and to cases of incompetency to discharge the duties of his trust by reason of his disability. Moreover, the answer denies that Mr. Williams is incompetent to discharge the duties of his trust by reason of his infirmity. The action of the executors regarding the $7,000 legacy, (see preceding case) does not justify their removal on that account.</p>

The case was heard in the court below on the petition of a legatee under the will of the deceased, and the answer of the executors thereto. No testimony of any kind was taken, and hence the facts set forth in the answer which are responsive to the petition, and deny its material allegations, must be taken as true. The matters contained in the petition and which are relied upon as causes of dismissal, are all denied in the answer, and especially the allegation concerning the mismanagement of the estate and the non-collection of the $7,000 debt owing by Joseph W. Souder. The answer avers that it has been impossible to realize on the securities for that debt, as they have heretofore had no market value, but that there is a prospective value which may be realized, upon some further delay. The answer also denies that the change of residence of the two executors in any way interferes with their ability to manage the estate, and it also denies that Mr. Williams is an invalid. The answer alleges that J. W. Souder and Margaret Manderson, who are a brother and sister of the testatrix, are legatees, and also residuary legatees, under the will, and that their sister knew all about them when she selected them as executors. The answer also alleges that the executors have, administered all the estate except that one item of the claim against J. W. Souder, that they have charged no commission for their services, and that they.have advanced money to pay some of the legacies. It is true that <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>J. W. Souder denies that he owes the estate a debt of $7,000, but admits that he will have to pay $7,000 in order to redeem the 140 shares of the stock of the Chester Land and Improvement Company which he assigned to the testatrix.</p>
