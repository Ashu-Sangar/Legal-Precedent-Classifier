The aggregate of the assessments for house connections in the First Sewer District, as made by the city engineer in obedience to the ordinance, is larger than the aggregate cost and expense of the said house connections will be, but the charge against Mrs. Witman’s property is a fair charge for the work to be done there, and no evidence was offered to <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>support the allegation that the sum of $12.50 is more than the work will actually cost.</p>

The first sewer district aforesaid has an area of from three fourths of a square mile to one square mile, and the assessment by the foot front is for sewers being constructed, or about to be constructed, in every street within its limits, except the following streets, namely: A part of Canal street between Bingaman and Seventh streets; Grape street between Second and Third streets; Furnace street, Mill street, a part of Neversink street between Eighth street and Neversink alley, South Ninth street from South street to the southern city limits, Chestnut street from Canal street to River street, Spruce street from Canal street to River street, Bingaman street from Canal street to River street, and River street from Bingaman street to Chestnut street. The streets upon which sewers are being constructed, or are about to be constructed, have a total length of nearly eighteen miles and a width which varies from twenty feet or less to eighty feet, or if the highway known as Penn Square is included, to a width of two hundred feet. The district embraces a portion of the business center of the city, and extends to the western and southern city limits. It includes all sizes of property, from small dwelling houses with a frontage of ten feet to industrial and manufacturing establishments, coal, lumber, aud freight yards, having a frontage of hundreds of feet, and in some cases a frontage upon more streets than one. It embraces properties situate a mile or more apart, some of which on Penn street, are assessed, at, and are worth, with the buildings thereon erected, as much as $1,600 per front foot; and some of which, in the remote parts of the district and on narrow streets, are assessed at and are worth not more than <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>fort}' dollars per front foot; or in the case of corner properties, reckoning both fronts, are assessed at and worth not more than ten dollars per front foot.

It is simply a convenient method of assessing the cost of certain public improvements upon the properties directly affected thereby; and it is supported, and can only be supported, because these properties are so nearly equal in value that equality of burden is thus attained. It rests upon the facts either actually existing or assumed to exist in each particular case, that the lots assessed by this method lie in a similar situation and are similarly affected by all the circumstances which give them value. Minor differences between them are disregarded (although the result of those dif<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>ferences may be a real inequality in value), as long as the inequality is not considerable; the reason being, that exact equality of burden can rarely be reached by any form of taxation, and therefore that approximate equality must be accepted. But the essence of the transaction is taxation according to value, and this is not the less true, although it is also true that the value is not a visible but only an assumed factor in the calculation. The process could not be misunderstood, if a different method of calculation should be adopted and if each foot of ground affected by the improvement should be appraised at the same definite value, and the aggregate of values should then be divided into the cost of the improvement. A rate per cent of taxation would thus be produced, and this rate when applied to the value of each foot would give the same result as is now attained by assuming each foot to be just as valuable as every other foot and dividing the cost of the improvement by the number of feet. Both methods rest alike upon the valuation of the property affected, and the only difference is that one method specifies the value and declares it to be the same throughout, while the other method assumes the value to be the same throughout, but does not specify it. This is well understood and need not be supported by the citation of authorities.</p>

It is also conceivable that a difficulty of this kind might arise upon the same street or the same section of a street in a city; even there, under the most favorable circumstances for the application of the rule, inequality in value or in benefits might be so considerable as to make the rule substantially unequal and therefore substantially unjust. And if, as the learned counsel for the city stated at the trial, there is now as much inequality in value between properties at different points upon a single street in the city of Reading, as exists between the most and the least valuable properties in this sewer district, it does not follow (as he seemed to argue), that the foot front rule could nevertheless be applied to all properties upon that street, and therefore that it might be with equal propriety applied throughout the whole district. The consequences would rather be, that the rule would have to be given up or restricted within proper limits, even upon the street, or else that a different and more equitable method of apportionment would have to be adopted.</p>

It is no doubt easy of application, but this is precisely the reason why it is apt to be abused, and why its exercise ought to be jealously scrutinized. It is vastly more important to the well-being of the citizens and the city, that municipal taxation should fall with equal weight upon the property burdened, and thus that a dangerous cause of discontent and irritation and social division should be avoided, than that a method of mere convenience should be adhered to and extended. Municipal improvements will not cease because the foot front rule is not always applicable. Two other methods of assessment, namely: according to actual valuation and according to benefits, are at the city’s command ; and while they are somewhat more cumbrous, and perhaps a little more expensive, they have many countervailing advantages. We need not discuss them, however; our present concern is simply with the foot front rule as the city of Reading proposes now to apply it, and we may bring this part of the opinion to a close, by formally stating the conclusion already foreshadowed; That, because this proposed application would produce inequality of valuation and inequality of benefits to the extent above indicated in the finding of facts, it is illegal and therefore void.</p>

This assessment is not according to the foot front rule, but is based upon an estimate, which is averred in the answer to be a fair price for the work. In the absence of evidence, the answer must stand, and we have accordingly found the fact in accordance with its averments. Obviously, if the plaintiff’s property is not charged more than a fair price, we can give no <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>weight in this proceeding to the admitted fact that the aggregate of assessments for house connections throughout the district' is in excess of the cost and expense of the aggregate work.

Her objection to this assessment is simply that she is being charged too much, and as the fact is otherwise, the objection must fall.</p>

In reply to this objection, it might perhaps be said that the common knowledge of the bench and the bar concerning the municipal effort to collect the cost of public improvements from abutting property owners would enable the court to say with sufficient certainty that so extensive a scheme as this, affecting hundreds of owners in every variety of situation, could not be carried out without producing a multiplicity of suits. But, without relying upon this reason for the equitable jurisdiction, or allowing any influence to the obvious consideration that a speedy decision of the important questions involved, is at least as much to the ultimate advantage of the defendant as of the plaintiff, it is enough to say briefly that the jurisdiction rests safely upon another ground. This is not the case of mere irregularity in the exercise of a conceded power to tax, or even of oppression in its exercise, as may happen when the undoubted discretion of the taxing authority has been abused; but it is the case of an attempt to tax <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>by a method which will clearly produce an unjust and therefore an illegal result.

From this result we are constrained to differ. While the foot front rule of assessment, it is true does not express a principle of taxation but merely a convenient method, yet its foundation is not in uniformity of value, but in uniformity of benefit. The latter is not always, and perhaps not even generally dependent on the'former, or in any fixed ratio to it. Properties in the same general situation are presumed to get the same general benefit from a common improvement, aud as this benefit is assessed exclusively on property abutting on the line of the improvement, it is presumed to be fairly measured by the foot frontage of the property on that line, though values may be aud usually are very different, and dependent on other circumstances, such as the depth of the lots, the buildings erected upon them, the use to which they are put, and their proximity to business centers, etc. Value undoubtedly is one element to be considered but no case has been cited, nor have I found any in which it was held to be controlling, while in at least one, Harrisburg v.

McCormick, <a href="/pa/129/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="129 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="568024" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0213-01">supra,</a> and Michener v.

No system of taxation which the wit of man ever devised has been found perfectly equal.” And he adds, “ perhaps no fairer rule can be adopted than the proportion of feet front, though there must be some inequalities if the lots differ in situation and depth.” And in Washington Avenue, <a href="/pa/69/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="69 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="1026331" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0352-01">69 Pa. 352</a>, although the foot front rule was held inapplicable to the circumstances of the property there charged, 3ret Chief Justice Agnew says of it, “ whatever doubt might have been originally entertained of it as a substitute, which it really is, for actual assessment by jurors or assessors under oath, it has been so often sanctioned by decision, it would ill become us now to unsettle its foundation by disputing its principle.”</p>

It is objected that by this method the properties in front of which the smaller sewers are laid, are assessed with more than the cost of those sewers, and that they thus have to pay in part the cost of other sewérs from which they derive no benefit. And this result is found as a fact in the case. The objection must prevail, .for it is settled that while the measure of assessment is the amount of benefit, yet it is limited to the cost of the improvement. -If the cost is only one dollar a foot, that is all that can be assessed p_n the property, though the benefit may be equal to two dollars a foot. It may be said <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>with some plausibility that while by the system pursued in this case the small sewer fronts pay more than the actual cost of such sewers, yet they get the advantage of the outlet into the larger ones, and therefore do not pay more than for the benefit received. If each local sewer had to be extended to the point of final discharge its length and cost would be greatly increased. If instead of being thus extended, it gets its outlet through the medium of another sewer, there.is a certain fairness in assessing the properties with a part of the cost of that other sewer, and it is argued that such part may be reasonably included in the cost of the small sewer. This argument however is open to the serious objection that it presents no principle on which the limitations of such charges can be fixed. The main sewer into which any particular branch shall empty is not located or its size determined by the needs or convenience of that branch alone or even chiefly, but by the requirements of the whole district. This includes, or may include many branches, of different situations and very various cost. Thus one branch may be through ordinary ground having a natural grade in the right direction, while another may have to be built up through low land with the wrong slope, or cut through rock at greatly increased expense. A ratio of cost made up of the average of these, is-not an accurate measure of any one of them.</p>
