That note would mature six months from its date, which would be about the 12th of August of the same year. On the 12th or 15th of August, Dr. Stever was called upon to renew this note; and, according to the evidence, he went to Bedford to see L. B. Doty and did see him. He staid at the hotel that night and then went to the bank the following day. E. S. Doty is cashier of the First National Bank of Bedford, and a brother of L. B. Doty. Dr. Stever testifies that he went to the bank and had an interview with L. B. Doty and E. S. Doty; and he testifies that E. S. Doty said to him there that he knew all about the consideration of this note, which was equivalent to saying that he knew of <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>this agreement, because the consideration in the- note is expressed in this written agreement that I have read, and said, according to Dr. Stever’s testimony, that the signing of this note was to be formal and that Dr. Stever would not be liable upon it. He was liable at that very time ; he had been liable on that note from the 26th day of February; and there was nothing that E. S. Doty said or did there that day, which he had authority to say or do, that would release Dr. Stever from his previous liability" upon this note ; so that what occurred in the bank that day is not material to constitute the defense set up here. [In the first place, when Dr. Stever signed this note, he made a written obligation to pajr according to its terms; and his own verbal testimony cannot be received in law to change these terms, because they are the terms that he agreed upon, and he cannot say in law that, because he agreed to pay $5,150, he did not there become liable. The law fixes the liability by that act.] [1] On the 15th of August, this note was renewed at Bedford ; and, at the time of the renewal or on the 12th of that month, and in connection with it, Dr. Stever took from L. B. Doty this paper, which reads as follows:</p>

It seems to have been voluntarily renewed by him at four months; <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>and it was then again renewed for the last time on the 17th of June, 1893, by Dr. Stever signing a new note, not having any contract with the bank affecting the legal obligation of the note itself. [On the 6th of October, 1893, the bank or E. S. Doty, its cashier, or E. S. Doty individually — I do not have the letter before me — wrote to Dr. Stever requesting an assignment of his stock as collateral security for the payment of this note. Dr. Stever declined to give that assignment; but he testifies that he prepared an assignment of his stock and inclosed it in a letter to the bank, in absolute payment of the note. Mr. E. S. Doty, cashier of the bank, testifies that a letter was received from Dr. Stever about that time, but that there was no assignment of the stock in it; and the officers of the bank have testified that they never received any such assignment of this stock, and that they do not have any such paper in their possession or under their control. And in addition to that, the certificates of stock have been exhibited in this trial, and they are made out to Dr. J. C. Stever and to no one else. They are to-day in his name and held by the treasurer of the company, E. S. Doty, to be delivered to him and to no one else, upon payment of this note.</p>

S. Doty, in which he said he knew of the transaction, referring to the agreement, as notice to the bank before the discounting of the note, we must regard it then as notice of what is contained in the written agreement and in the note itself; and that is not sufficient in law to defeat a recovery here, because the very agreement impliedly, if not expressly, suggests the negotiation of the note and a provision, required by Dr. Stever, that somebody else would assist him to take care of it. There is no branch of the agreement that is not complied with, so far as we know.] [2] L. B. Doty was endeavoring to form a syndicate to purchase a controlling interest in the stock of the hotel property; and, if he succeeded in that, Dr. Stever was to be the resident physician; and, so far as L. B. Doty had power to appoint him to that position, he was appointed. Of course, Dr. Stever would know that unless there was a controlling interest purchased, the appointment would fail, because it would be liable to be controlled by others. Dr. Stever never received that position, so far as this evidence <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>is concerned. Now, while that part of the agreement has not been kept by L. B. Doty, yet if, upon the faith of that part of the agreement, Dr. Stever did execute and deliver his note for $5,150, providing for the negotiation of that note and its renewal, if that agreement has been violated, a right of action would arise in law against L. B. Doty in favor of Dr. Stever; but it would not go to the extent of defeating an innocent holder for value who paid his money for the note.</p>

He did fail to accomplish that object and he also failed to do everything else that he agreed to do in the contract, by means of which he induced the defendant to give him, so unwisely, the note in suit. That L. B. Doty was guilty of a vile fraud in his action with reference to this note is too plain for argument. He had the note discounted very soon after it was given to him, and put the proceeds in his pocket without any right and kept them, never gave the defendant the position he agreed to give him, never assumed any responsibility for any part of the note as he agreed to do, and in short gave nothing to the defendant having any value, in return for the note.</p>

    <p id="b601-3" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[132,568,1159,656]]]'>If the jury believed this testimony, a question would have arisen whether E. S. Doty had acquired his knowledge of the original agreement between L. B. Doty and Stever in the course of the transaction with the bank, to wit, the discounting of the note. If he did we think the bank was chargeable with his knowledge. We held in Bissell v. First National Bank of Franklin, <a href="/pa/69/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="69 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="1026518" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0415-01">69 Pa. 415</a>, that, “ An incorporated bank has a president, cashier and a board of directors, and the cashier is the general executive officer to manage its concerns in all things not peculiarly committed to the directors by the charter, and he is the agent of the corporation and not of the directors.” We decided in that case that the indorsement of a draft by the cashier of a banking firm bound his principals.</p>

Keyes, <a href="/pa/79/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="79 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="438449" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0251-01">79 Pa. 251</a>, we held that the knowledge of a member of an unincorporated banking firm, of the facts relating to the issue of the note held by his firm, was knowledge of his firm and prevented them from being considered as innocent holders.</p>

S. Doty, that the latter was chosen cashier on Jan. 12, 1892, and that prior to that time the cashier was L. B. Doty, the person who procured the original note of Feb. 12, 1892, from the defendant. It was also proved that at that time and afterwards L. B. Doty was one of the stockholders of the plaintiff bank, to a large amount. It was also proved that no certificate of stock in the Bedford Springs Company was ever delivered to the defendant, but such a certifi<a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>cate for 100 shares was in the possession of E. S. Doty who said he got it from his brother L. B. Doty, and that he was holding it for the benefit of his, L. B. Doty’s, indorsement. His testimony is somewhat confusing in regard to this stock and the manner in which it was held, whether as collateral security for the bank, or if not, in what other way. The witness was unable to explain why he asked the defendant to execute an assignment of the stock to the bank, and testified at considerable length upon cross-examination, on this subject. Without commenting now in relation to that matter, we think the whole of the testimony should have been submitted to the jury for their consideration.</p>
