They are good men who could safely be intrusted with the privilege. The license is refused, because I do not think there is a necessity for it. This conclusion is not reached from the proofs presented in open court. It could not be. There is no remonstrance, and the record and proofs are altogether in favor of the applicants. (In addition to the 24 names on the original petition, there has been filed a supplemental petition with 87 signatures.) The gentlemen signing the petition are citizens of high character and standing. They ought to be, and probably are, familiar with the situation. Many of them, by reason of their business relations and their thorough knowledge of the demands of the community, ought to know more than I can of the necessity for this license. Yet under the law, I feel justified in refusing.</p>

It is only too well known to the people of this district. They habitually rely upon the court to act of its own knowledge obtained from ‘ observation of the applicant and acquaintance with the district; ’ that is, knowledge individually obtained. They make no effiort to protect themselves against unfit persons and from unnecessary licenses. They rest that burden upon the court, relying upon the individual knowledge of the judge to overcome the proofs and petitions, no matter how strong, for the license.</p>

That belief has been dissipated, and it can safely be assumed that remonstrances will cease. The burden will rest, as heretofore, upon the judge as an individual, or the court,' just as you please to put it. That burden I must assume.

I try to give it, using every means of knowledge at hand and every effort to treat one section of the county like another, and all fairly. If, under existing conditions, I should make mistakes, and in a measure fail, it is the fault of the law and not of the court.</p>

We are powerless to call in witnesses (for who will pay them), or to take one step in the direction of a proper enlightenment. There is, in the anthracite coal region, but one side to a license case, except the judge interpose such individual information and knowledge as he may be able to command. Possibly the legislature anticipated that the people would take care of themselves in this matter, as they do in private litigation and in public matters,and matters political. This anticipation may be realized elsewhere, not here, nor ever will be so long as the law permits the people to compel the judge to make use upon the bench of what he knows as a citizen, to the end that the community and the court may not be scandalized by an improper grant of licenses.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.7",133,[121,1844,1165,500]]]'>“ It would seem that the legislature, even though deeming it unwise to provide fund or official for supervision of the liquor traffic, might have provided some method whereby a license court could, in a judicial way, come by the information which would enable it to intelligently perform the onerous duties put upon it. It is to be hoped that the successors of the legislators who enacted the Brooks Law, may, in the near future, see their way clear to do this. Such a provision would, to that extent at least, have made the act true to the title, ‘ An act to restrain,’ etc.</p>
