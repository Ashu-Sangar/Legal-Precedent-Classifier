If he had no such estate because of alienage, it was incumbent upon the respondents to so aver in their answer; and if they do not do so, the court is warranted in assuming the pauper’s citizenship without passing upon the question as to whether, as a general rule, it will be presumed or must be made affirmatively to appear.</p>

The petition states, his wife was possessed of an estate in fee simple in seven and one half acres of land; that the husband resided thereon with her .and his family, and thereby gained a settlement in McKean County Poor District. Why ? Obviously, because he was a tenant by the curtesy initiate of his wife’s land, or had a statutory interest under act of 4th May, 1855. If he had no such estate or right because of alienage, it was incumbent on respondents to so aver in their answer. Instead of denying this necessary conclusion from the facts of the petition, respondents content themselves with, in effect, denying that a tenancy by the curtesy initiate is sufficient in law to constitute a settlement. There was, therefore, in substance, an averment of citizenship in the petition, and no denial of it in the answer. As respondents practically assumed the pauper’s citizenship in the pleadings, we are warranted in doing so now, without passing on the question as to whether, as a general rule, citizenship in like eases will be presumed or must be made affirmatively to appear.</p>

So the law stood until the passage of the act of June 8, 1893, the 5th section of which contained the proviso, that nothing in this act shall affect the husband’s right as tenant by the curtesy.</p>
    <p id="b141-3" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[136,774,1170,1006]]]'>Assuming for the present that before the act of 1887, under the act of 1848, the husband’s tenancy by the curtesy had not been stricken down, then, was it destroyed by the later act ? It was denied in Teacle’s Estate, <a href="/pa/132/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="132 Pa. 533" data-case-ids="970642" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0533-01">132 Pa. 533</a>, that the act of 1887 had that effect. In that case, we held, interpreting the 5th section of the act, which is much broader in phraseology than the 1st section, that the husband’s estate as survivor was not affected, this court says: — “ It is contended by appellants, that this section enables a married woman to dispose of her entire estate by will, wholly ignoring any interest of her husband therein, including his right of tenancy by curtesy. ... It does not enable her to disinherit her husband.” To the same effect is Bramberry’s Estate, <a href="/pa/156/0628-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="156 Pa. 628" data-case-ids="844943" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0628-01">156 Pa. 628</a>. Our brother McCollum, in discussing the effect of the act of 1887 on estates created by the unity of person resulting from the marriage relation, says : — “ The act of 1887 was intended to protect the property of the wife from the dominion and control of the husband, but not to change the nature of her estate, or destroy the legal unity of person which characterizes their relations to each other.”</p>

At common law, on birth of a child, the father had a permanent interest in his wife’s land, and was called tenant by the curtesy initiate. He could, to some extent, charge the wife’s lands, but his tenancy was consummate only on the death of his wife: 2 Bl. Com. 127. The interest of the husband in the land was as absolute, however, as the ownership of her chattels, and the husband’s creditors could appropriate his estate in pay<a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>ment of their debts. By the act of 1833, tenancy by the curtesy became initiate by the marriage; the birth of issue was no longer a constituent in the creation of the estate. Then, by act of 1848, it was enacted, that the property of a married woman should be as fully hers after marriage as before, and should not be subject to the debts or liabilities of the husband. Under this act, it was held, that, by it, both her property and possession were protected, and that a purchaser at sheriff’s sale of the husband’s interest could not sustain ejectment against even the husband. Then followed the act of 22d of April, 1850, which enacted, that the husband’s estate by the curtesy should be exempt from even levy and sale during the life of the wife. But notwithstanding this act, it was held in Harris v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/50/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="50 Pa. 341" data-case-ids="425155" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0341-01">50 Pa. 341</a>, that as tenant by the curtesy, he might effect a valid insurance on the buildings on his wife’s land. It was argued in this case, that the husband’s estate by the curtesy no longer existed in this state; that by legislation it had been destroyed, and turned into a mere expectancy depending on the husband surviving the wife. But it was held, the husband had an insurable interest, notwithstanding the act of 1850, which protected it from execution during the wife’s life; the court saying : — “ His interest exists still, and is none the less vital because protected during his wife’s life.” The act of 1850 was followed by that of 4th May, 1855, which enacted, that a married woman’s power to dispose of her property by will, as against her husband, should be restricted the same as the husband’s power is restricted as against the wife, and that any surviving husband might elect to take such share in his wife’s estate, as she could, surviving him, elect to take against his will, or he might otherwise take as tenant by the curtesy. While this act enlarged his privileges, it can hardly be said to have enlarged his estate; but it certainly did not cut down the estate to less than had been decided to be his, in Harris v. Ins. Co., supra, under the act of 1850. This was followed by act of April 1, 1863, which declared the true intent and meaning of the act of 1848 and supplements thereto, to be: — “ that no judgment obtained against the husband of any married woman, before or during marriage, shall bind or be a lien upon her real estate, or upon any interest the husband may be entitled to therein, as tenant by the curtesy.” The next legislation on the <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>subject was the act of 1887, already noticed, and this court again, in Teacle’s Estate, and Bramberry’s Estate, supra, held, notwithstanding the sweeping language of the statute, that by virtue of the marital relation, there still vested in the husband an estate in his wife’s land. The argument, that estates by the curtesy were practically destroyed, or at least suspended during the life of the wife, by operation of the acts of 1848, 1850, 1855 and 1863, is conclusively answered by the opinion of the court, Agnew, J., in Clarke’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/79/0376-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="79 Pa. 376" data-case-ids="438385" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0376-01">79 Pa. 376</a>, where the whole question is fully discussed, and the conclusion in Harrison v. Ins. Co., supra, as to the effect of exempting the husband’s interest from seizure during the life of the wife, is adopted; in the language of that opinion: — “ The upshot is a mere stay of execution, not an annihilation of an estate.” Further, as to the act of 1855, it was pertinently said, the whole effect was to give the husband an alternative election to take the same estate the law would give him as against her will, or take his earlier estate by the curtesy in the whole of her real estate. •</p>
    <p id="b143-3" data-blocks='[["BL_143.4",143,[125,1286,1164,959]]]'>So that it is settled, that neither by these statutes, nor by decisions interpreting them, has the existence of an estate by the curtesy been annihilated; the nature of the estate, whatever now may be its value, is the same as declared by Gibson, C. J., in Bank v. Stauffer, <a href="/pa/10/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="10 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="962689" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0398-01">10 Pa. 398</a>; — -“The husband indeed becomes seized of a freehold by the marriage, but it is the wife’s freehold, not his, insomuch that both must do homage for it. . . . . But after issue born, he has a freehold in his own right . . . . and the wife cannot forfeit it for treason. . . . He is then said to be tenant by the curtesy initiate,'though the new character of the interest is not consummated by anything less than his wife’s death. As then the defendant had an independent estate in his wife’s land, which might have been aliened by his separate act, it was bound as an inchoate one by the judgment against him for his separate debt. Were it necessary to decide whether our statute, which dispenses with the birth of issue as a constituent of curtesy consummate, does not dispense with it also as a constituent of curtesy initiate, there would be little difficulty in maintaining that it does.”</p>

The estate is no longer independent of the wife’s; the husband, by his separate act, cannot alien it; it cannot be bound by the lien of a judgment for his separate debt; cannot be seized on execution by his creditor; nevertheless, it still exists as a freehold estate in the husband, incapable of divestiture during the wife’s life, except by their joint deed. When the unity of person is ended by the wife’s death, then the estate becomes consummate in the husband, only because his control of it is no longer hampered by provisions necessary to the wife’s enjoyment of her estate.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[274,1040,1161,652]]]'>Nor does the estate, as argued by appellee, stand upon the same plane as the wife’s inchoate right of dower; the husband, in a degree, has the present enjoyment of the initiate estate during the life of the wife, which she cannot divest by her deed or mortgage; either, if not joined in by the husband, is an absolute nullity; so that, by no deed of her estate, or mortgage pledge thereof, can she defeat his during her life, or peril his possession. On the other hand, his deed to a purchaser of his own land will support ejectment, and dispossess both during his life; his mortgage sued out to judgment and sale, will divest her dower, so as to bar any claim by her after his death. Hence, the right, of dower and estate by the curtesy are not of the same nature, and are clearly not of the same value.</p>

And the court of quarter sessions of the county wherein was the alleged last legal settlement had jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute. And according to the almost uniform practice for many years, the quarter sessions has adjudged such cases. As is said by Woodward, J., in delivering the opinion of this court, Nippenose Township v. the Borough of Jersey Shore, <a href="/pa/48/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="48 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="422150" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0402-01">48 Pa. 402</a>: — “ Common law actions in pauper cases ought not to be favored ....
