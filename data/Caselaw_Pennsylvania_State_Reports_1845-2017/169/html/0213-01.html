According to this offer, he agreed to furnish to the defendant for a period of one year from Sept. 22,1889, literary articles from the pens of different authors whose names were printed in the said prospectus, at the rate of $100 per week, payable weekly ; the matter furnished to contain on an average 10,000 words weekly. He also alleged that thereafter, and prior to September 29, 1889, the defendant accepted the offer as contained in his letter, and agreed with him to accept for one year from Sept. 29, 1889, at the rate of $100 per week, payable weekly, such articles from any of the authors named in the said prospectus as might be furnished by the plaintiff, and thereupon he did furnish to the defendant each and every week the matter called for. He alleged that the defendant, in disregard of its promise and undertaking, had not complied with its agreement, but had refused on and after the 23d of December, 1889, to pay the plaintiff for different <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>articles furnished to it after said date, and notified the plaintiff that it did not recognize the contract, and that it would not accept or pay for any further literary articles that might thereafter be furnished. The plaintiff further alleged that he was under contract with the authors whose names were printed in the prospectus, and others, by which he was bound to accept from them, and compensate them for the different literary articles which he had before agreed to furnish to the defendant, and that he was and would be unable to sell and dispose of the right to publish the matter which, by the terms of the contract, he had agreed to furnish to the defendant.

Was there a contract? Did the minds of the parties ever meet? If so, upon what terms ? Reviewing the testimony, it is clear that, up to a certain point, there is no conflict.

The department was to consist of all the features announced in the year 1889, and such other features as might be deemed from time to time suitable, and to contain on an average ten thousand words weekly. The prospectus which accompanied this letter was identical in its terms with the prospectus attached to the statement filed.</p>

This correspondence was followed by an interview which took place in New York city, at which no definite understanding was reached, and was followed by a visit of the plaintiff to the office of Mr. McLaughlin, the defendant’s manager, in the city of Philadelphia, at which a long conversation took place', in which the terms-of both parties were discussed at large; the plaintiff insisting upon the terms of his offer contained in the letter of Aug. 31, 1889, and stating his absolute unwillingness to furnish the matter mentioned in said prospectus for a less period than one year at the rate of $100 per week, and Mr. McLaughlin being equally firm in his refusal to accept said matter for any specific length of time. According to the testimony of the plaintiff, corroborated by the testimony of Mr. McLaughlin upon cross-examination, the interview resulted in nothing, and both parties separated, without having reached any definite conclusion. The story of the plaintiff is, that he went West immediately after this interview, which took place in the early part of September (probably during the first week), and after an absence of from nine to thirteen days returned to Philadelphia, and in consequence of what had been told him by Charles Emory Smith, Esq., the editor of The Press, he purchased a copy of The Times, published in Philadelphia upon Saturday morning, Sept. 14, 1889, in which he perceived an announcement for the Sunday edition of the coming season, that prominent writers <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>had been engaged to contribute stories to The Times during 1889 and 1890, followed by a publication of their names in such a manner and by such designation as to lead him to believe that they were all taken from his prospectus, and that The Times had concluded to accept the terms of his offer, which had remained unchanged by any agreement or modification upon his part prior to his parting with Mr. McLaughlin; that he immediately called upon Mr. McLaughlin, on the 16th of September, 1889, and said to him, ‘ I see that you have taken it,’ and received in reply the answer, ‘ Yes.’ The story of the defendant, on the other hand, consists of a denial of the interview subsequent to the publication of the announcement in the columns of The Times of Sept. 14, 1889, and of the further and most material conversation taking place between Mr. McLaughlin of The Times and the plaintiff, in the presence of Mr. Waggoner, the editor of the Youth’s Department of the defendant newspaper, at the interview just prior to the plaintiff’s going West, and, therefore, prior to the publication in The Times of Sept. 14, 1889. The substance of that conversation — as detailed by Mr. McLaughlin and as confirmed by Mr. Waggener — is, that so far from the parties not having come to an <em>agreement, </em>and separating without a definite understanding, there was a yielding on the part of the plaintiff, and an agreement by the defendant, should the 'plaintiff see fit to furnish the matter, to take the matter so furnished for such period of time as should prove satisfactory to the defendant; and inasmuch as the plaintiff was hard pressed for money, that the sum of $500 should be advanced to him, as The Times would take matter for five weeks anyhow. Subsequently, matter was furnished, presumably on this basis.</p>

This testimony is direct and specific as to the request of the plaintiff for an advance of $500, and the agreement by the defendant to pay it, inasmuch as they would take the matter to be supplied by the plaintiff for five weeks anyhow; and it is also distinct and specific upon the point that if the plaintiff sent any matter to the defendant for publication it would be upon the defendant’s terms, and not upon the plaintiff’s. This statement is, in part, corroborated by the written statement of Col. A. K. McClure, which was accepted by counsel in lieu of his sworn testimony, to the effect that the plaintiff was informed by both McLaughlin and Col. McClure that under no circumstances would a contract be made for the publication of the plaintiff’s articles for a year, or a contract entered into to publish them at <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>any time that they might not be satisfactory. It is to be observed, however, that Col. McClure in no way refers to the special features of the contract based upon the advance to the plaintiff of $500, which is specifically mentioned by Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Waggener; so that upon this branch of the case Col. McClure’s testimony is of no avail, except so far as to corroborate the statement acquiesced in by the plaintiff himself, that The Times Publishing Company at no time was willing to make a definite contract with the plaintiff at any interview-held between him and the officers of the defendant company for a specific length of time, as a definite charge per week.</p>

He states with great clearness that at that interview both stood distinctly upon their own positions, refusing to yield one inch to each other; that while he refused to part with his matter, or any portion of it for less than a distinct period of time, at a distinct stipulated price, Mr. McLaughlin on his side was equally firm in declining to accede to the terms of the plaintiff’s offer, but insisted that he should be permitted to buy only such matter as he saw fit to accept, and for such a length of time as he saw fit to prescribe.

It is also to be observed that the plaintiff was not called by his counsel in rebuttal to specifically deny what Mr. <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>McClure and Mi-. Waggener had testified to. The referee cannot but regret that the plaintiff was not cross-examined upon this important point, or that he was not recalled by his counsel in rebuttal. It has proved exceedingly embarrassing to the referee; but his study of the matter has led him to the conclusion that the testimony of the plaintiff — examination in chief and cross-examination — was in effect a contradiction of the testimony of the defendant. His entire failure to recall any reference to the subject when pressed on cross-examination to state whether he remembered anything else other than he had stated, is in effect, in view of his oath to tell the whole truth, a statement which cannot be reconciled with that of the defendant. ... It is to be observed in testing the accuracy of the defendant’s contention, that, while the testimony of Mr. McLaughlin in chief was express and specific upon the question of the $500 consideration in support of the special contract to furnish matter onty at the pleasure of the defendants, yet on cross-examination Mr. McLaughlin makes no ref erence to it at all. When questioned as to why the publication of the 14th of September, 1889, was permitted to be made, he does not reply, ‘ Because there was a special agreement reached between the plaintiff and myself prior to his going West by which I was permitted, in consideration of the advance to him of the sum of $500, to announce that I had made arrangements for the publication of articles to be furnished by the plaintiff for such length of time as might prove agreeable to me,’ but he bases the justification of the publication of Sept. 14, 1889, upon the antecedent receipt of matter by him from the plaintiff, and he states the result of the interview between Mr. McClure, the plaintiff, and himself just prior to the trip to the West in such a manner as to leave both parties free to do as they.pleased. The whole pith of the matter is contained in the two last questions and answers of his cross-examination. He was asked: ‘ Q. Then you printed the prospectus because he sent on the matter, and, as you had told him if he sent the matter it must be on your terms, you concluded, with nothing more, he had accepted your terms, and thereupon printed the prospectus ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Until he had sent the matter you would not have been justified under the announcement of his intentions that he made when he parted with you to have printed it? A. Certainly not.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b241-2" data-blocks='[["BL_241.3",241,[135,355,1166,2027]]]'>
      <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>“ This cross-examination, it is to be observed, makes no reference at all in the slightest degree to any special contract based upon the advance to the plaintiff of the sum of $500, but on the contrary contains a distinct admission of the correctness of the plaintiff’s testimony in testifying that they parted without having reached any definite agreement at all, and it makes the whole case revolve upon the pivotal point as to whether the publication of the prospectus depended upon the receipt of matter furnished by the plaintiff. Here, therefore, is a distinct departure on the part of Mr. McLaughlin on cross-examination from the position to which he had distinctly testified in chief, and to this extent it must be considered as very materially weakening his testimony as a witness. So that we have the result of the plaintiff standing as a witness on one side, corroborated by the cross-examination of the defendant’s manager, and on the other side a witness with a cross-examination at variance with his examination in chief, supported, however, by another witness, Mr. Waggener; so that the result of the analysis would be to pit one whole witness on one side against one whole witness on the other. Without something further to turn the scale in the case, there could, of course, be no conclusion in favor of the plaintiff, for it is his duty to submit a preponderance of proof, and establish his contention beyond doubt or peradventure. Is there anything else in the case to throw light upon this question? The referee turns to the correspondence between the parties, and observes closely the dates at which the various letters were written, and the language of the letters themselves, and he is convinced that Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Waggener, while doubtless acting under the most scrupulous fidelity to their own convictions of truth, are yet seriously mistaken as to the true order of events, and that they have confounded what took place before Sept. 14, 1889, with what took place after that critical date. The important question to be answered at this point is, At what time was the matter furnished by the plaintiff to the defendant ? If before the publication of Sept. 14, 1889, then McLaughlin’s "testimony is to be taken as corroborated beyond the reach of cavil or dispute. If after that date, then the preponderance of proof is on the side of the plaintiff, and Mr. McLaughlin is shown to have fallen into an innocent error as to dates.</p>

      <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>“ The letters of the plaintiff to the defendant of September 18th and September 19th, and the letter of the defendant’s manager to the plaintiff of September 19th are conclusive upon this point. On the 18th of September, the plaintiff sent the first installment of the Youth’s Department in a letter of some length, and on the 19th incloses the articles in the first installment of the Youth’s Department which were not ready the day before. On the 19th of September, the defendant’s manager writes that it will not be possible to set iip the matter sent next week; that they are anxious to see the illustrations, and directs them to be sent along at the earliest moment. These letters show beyond controversy that the first matter sent by the plaintiff to the defendant was after the publication of September 14th and therefore could not have been made the basis of that publication. Was the advance by the defendant to the plaintiff of the sum of $500 the basis of the publication of September 14th? In discussing this question it will be observed that no proof was given by the defendant of the exact time at which this advance was to be made, and although it is referred to as having been agreed upon at the interview with the plaintiff immediately prior to his western trip, yet, inasmuch as it was not shown that it was to be an immediate advance, inuring to his benefit prior to the time when the publication was made, or that he received the money prior to that time, the question would therefore be involved in some doubt as to whether the publication of September 14th rested upon that basis, particularly in view of the discrepancies in the testimony of the various parties which have already been discussed, and need not be repeated. But all doubt upon this question is removed by the letter of the defendant addressed to the plaintiff dated Oct. 4, 1889, in reply to a letter of the plaintiff asking for advance payment for articles in this department on the ground that they had cost him a great deal of money in advance, and in which tjre plaintiff was criticised for poor business management on his part, and good business management on the part of the authors. . . .</p>

None of these courses was pursued in this case. If the plaintiff in that letter alleged as a reason why he should receive $500 in advance, that he had been put to expense in advancing money to the authors whose manuscripts he had secured, and that was deemed by the defendant to be bad business management on his part, and good business management on the part of the authors — a reason distinctly different from the terms of the special agreement contended for by the defendant as having been made prior to the publication of September 14th, at the time when the plaintiff was going West — would it not have been natural for the defendant, in answer to the letter, to have called the plaintiff’s attention to the difference in the basis of the demand, and instead of acquiescing, as it undoubtedly did, in the new reason given by the plaintiff, have corrected him by stating, ‘ We send you check in pajunent of advance as especially arranged for prior to your going West,’ or is it at all likely that it would have criticised as bad business management upon his part an act which it had expressly assented to ?</p>

It is the defendant’s own letter; it must be taken most distinctly and strongly against the interests of the writer. It is in conflict with the special arrangement as contended for, and in this manner breaks the force of the testimony offered by the defendant, and distinctly corroborates the silence of the plaintiff in his failure to mention any such specific terms. In other words, the entire correspondence in this case from first to last is in entire harmony with the theory that the publication of the prospectus in The Times of September 14th was an acceptance of the plaintiff’s terms, while the date of the receipt of the matter first sent under the agreement is also in harmony with this theory, and is still further corroborated by the letter of October 4th, in answer to one of the plaintiff’s, while the defendant’s manager’s testimony and that of Mr. Waggener is weakened by the ad<a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>mission of the defendant’s manager upon cross-examination, in effect stating that the parties separated without coming to terms.</p>

Was it such an acceptance? Does it constitute a contract between the parties upon which an action can be sustained, sufficiently distinct and definite in its terms to support an action, and capable of being reduced to judgment for a specific amount of damages? In the judgment of the referee, such publication was an act of acceptance. What were the terms ? The offer is embodied in the letter of Aug. 31,1889, and attached to that letter, and made a part thereof, is a prospectus printed containing the names of fifty-nine persons distinguished in literature, both in this country and abroad. It is distinctly admitted by Mr. McLaughlin that the names contained in the publication of Sept. 14, 1889, were, as to nine tenths of them, taken from the prospectus published by the plaintiff, and at that time The Times had no arrangement or contract with those authors for furnishing matter. A comparison of the prospectus with the publication in The Times of Sept. 14,1889, reveals this fact;— that there are fifty-nine names contained in The Times’ prospectus, forty-two of which are taken entirely from the prospectus furnished by the plaintiff, and the nine names which are specifically announced under the head of ‘ Our Boys’ and Girls’ Department ’ are all to be found in the prospectus of the plaintiff.</p>

The facts result in a total failure to agree upon terms prior to the plaintiff’s departure for the West, but during that time while he himself was absent, and while the terms of his offer of Aug. 31,1889, were still insisted upon by him, the defendant made the publication of Se.pt. 14, 1889. This is a distinct act, stating an accomplished fact, announcing a fixed engagement with certain authors, and, in view of the distinct testimony of The Times’ manager that at that time they had no contracts of their own with the authors in question, the statement could not possibly be accepted as true except upon the theory of an acceptance of the plaintiff’s terms. The referee can see no escape from this conclusion. It is in harmony with all the testimony in the case, whereas were a contrary result to be reached and the conclusion formed that the publication of Sept. 14, 1889, rested upon an agreement to advance $500, inasmuch as the matter would be taken for five weeks at least, then all the remaining testimony in the case, particularly that relating to the language of the announcement in the columns of The Times of Sept. 14, 1889, as well as of the date of the furnishing of matter, and the various letters passing between the parties, would be out of line, and incapable of proper explanation.

The plaintiff had three interviews in Philadelphia with Mr. McLaughlin — one prior to his going West, one immediately on his return from the West, and one upon Oct. 29, 1889. In his second cross-examination the plaintiff distinctly denied having had any conversation with Mr. McLaughlin prior to his going West about the latter’s advancing him $500, but insisted that what was said about it occurred at the interview after the publication of September 14th, in the columns of the Times. To this conversation he attached but little importance and the events made but little impression on his memory. The letter of Oct. 1,1889, distinctly shows that in the plaintiff’s view there was an assurance of an advance of $500, for which a receipted bill was sent for the first five weeks of the service. The fact that such a conversation did take place is established by indisputable proof. The question is, when did it take place ?</p>

In the second cross-examination of the plaintiff he admits that there was such a conversation, but explicitly denies that it took place at the time alleged, to wit: prior to his going West. The effect previously given to his testimony by the referee is therefore lost. The letter of Oct. 1, 1889, now for the first time before the referee, confirms the existence of such a conversation, but throws no light upon the matter of date. When did that conversation take place ? Mr., McLaughlin and Mr. Waggener both state it as a part of what was said before the plaintiff went West. The plaintiff says it was after his return from the W est. The referee in his first report, upon a full review of the evidence then before him, concluded that Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Waggener were mistaken as to the date.

As to this he was originally silent; now he admits it, both in his second cross-examination, and in the letter of <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>Oct. 1, 1891. Second, his certainty that Mr. Waggener was present at the conversation before he went West, and his repeated statements that he does not remember his presence at the second interview, which was after his return. It is clear that Mr. Waggener must have heard the conversation, or he could not have testified to it. There is no doubt that he did testify to it in specific terms; and it is quite clear that Waggener was present at but one interview. As Waggener and McLaughlin both fix it as before, and the plaintiff insists that he saw Mr. Waggener but once, and that before he went West, it is clear then that the plaintiff himself, in this important particular, confirms the defendant’s position. Third, the third element is that the second cross-examination showed what was not before apparent, that the accuracy of the plaintiff’s memory is not to be relied upon with certainty. The referee does not doubt his integrity. In fact, the plaintiff impressed him as a very earnest man, of strong convictions, and thoroughly grounded in the belief that he was right; but his own account of his mental operations, and his analysis of his method of stating results, convinces the referee that his memory is not to be relied upon at a contested point, when it comes in conflict with that of other men. The remarks of the referee on page 71 of his former report are no longer applicable. While it is still true that Mr. McLaughlin’s testimony is affected by his cross-examination, yet it is now also true that the plaintiff has been broken on the wheel, and Mr. Waggener stands master of the situation. The weight of the testimony is now clearly with the defendant.</p>

On the whole evidence, as it now stands, the referee finds, as a fact, that the conversation in relation to the advance of the $500 took place before the plaintiff’s trip to the West. Mr. McClure asked for the sum of $500, after stating his needs. Mr. McLaughlin replied: ‘I guess we will take it for five weeks, anyhow; I do not object to giving you $500.’ Mr. Waggener testified that Mr. McLaughlin said: ‘ If you want us to take that matter for a year, make it so good that we cannot do without it, and then we will take it for that length of time,’ and they parted with the distinct intimation that the matter might be sent, but if sent, it was to be upon defendant’s terms. This language is <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>not denied by the plaintiff, although he had an opportunity of denying it when on the stand in rebuttal. What effect had this conversation ? It is to be observed the plaintiff did not say: ‘ Well, I will send the matter if you will advance the $500.’ Nor did the defendant’s witness testify that he agreed to send the matter. The whole question was left entirely open. The plaintiff was free to exercise his option or not, and the result oE the whole testimony is, that no agreement whatever was reached. Thus far, there is no contract. What follows ? The act of publication bn the part of the Times in its columns of Sept. 14, 1889. This act the referee held to be an acceptance of the terms of the plaintiff’s letter of Aug. 31, 1889, but at the same time expressed his difficulty in understanding why there should have been, without apparent cause, a complete change of base on the part of the manager of The Times, and a departure from’ their settled policy. At that time the fact now found as to the request for $500, and the willingness on the part of the defendant to send it, did not exist. The request-of the plaintiff for <em>money, the </em>confession of his financial needs, and the willingness of the defendant to meet them, furnish some explanation of the act of publication, not a sufficient or convincing reason, it is true, nor one sufficiently defined, out of which to construct a contx-act for a limited time, but it is an explanation of an act which, without it, was inexplicable. It furnishes some ground for the expectation that ultimately the plaintiff would accede to the defendant’s terms. While it does not justify the publication in terms so positive and express as thedanguage of the advertisement of Sept. 14, 1889, yet it robs the mere act of publication of the full force accorded to it, of constituting an unqualified acceptaixce of the plaintiff’s offer of August 31st. The publication is to be taken in connection, of course, with the words testified to by Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Waggenex’, ‘We will take it for five weeks at least; make it so good that we will have to take it for a longer tixne.’ These words were not denied by Mr. McClure on his re-ei-ossexamination, nor in rebuttal. They must be taken as unchallenged, and as constituting a part of the conversation held prior to McClure’s trip to the West. They cannot be referred to another time.</p>

The letters written subsequently do not clear the matter. They do not state the terms- of the contract except' so far as the letter of October 28th is concerned. There is no written denial of the terms of that letter by the defendant, but an: angry interview took place- the next dajr at the office of The Times, which resulted in such a breach as to bring on the present litigation. It is clear that if the letters were written by each party with-a different basis in mind, then the parties were not meeting at any point upon a common plane. It is necessary, of • course, to constitute a contract, that the minds of the parties should come together at some particular point, upon some definite terms. While the- referee cannot find any distinct contract on the part of the plaintiff to accept, or. the defendant to pay the- sum of $500, which could be made the basis of the publication, of Sept. 14, 1894, yet he cannot find, with that conversation, relating to the advance of the $500 staring him in the face, that- the act of publication was á distinct and unqualified acceptance of the letter of August 31st. The whole matter, as the parties themselves admit, resulted in no contract at all; and if the act of publication of September 14th is affected, as in the judgment of the referee it must be, by the previous conversation in reference to the $500, then that act,qualified as it is, does not, per se, constitute an acceptance of the proposition of August 31st, and therefore, in that respect, there is no contract.</p>

As the evidence stands now, the two are separated by the request of the plaintiff for an advance of $500, and the willingness of the defendant to accede to the request. This phase of the' matter is colored, also, by the expression that if the plaintiff wanted the defendant to take his matter for'a year, he should make it so good as to ensure its doing so. The plaintiff did not bind himself to send the matter, but in behalf of the de<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>fendant it was stated that, if he did so, it must be upon defendant’s terms.

Standing with the request for the advance and the accompanying statements, it does not appear to the referee as intended to constitute an acceptance of the terms of the letter of August 31st. Unless it was so in-, tendéd, a contract cannot be found to exist. Unless the intentions of the parties concur,' there cannot be a contract. It is true its absolute terms were not justified by the request for an advance of 1500, promised on the supposition that the matter would be taken for five weeks at least. It went far beyond-this; but in view of what had gone before, it was based upon the probable expectation that the plaintiff would yield — an expectation growing not improbably or unnaturally out of. the-statement of the plaintiff of his needs, and the thought that he might make the matter acceptable for a year. This seems to the referee to be the natural result of what had taken place, for it must not be forgotten that the defendant’s officers were as fixed in their policy and methods of dealing, and as firm in their refusal to accede to the plaintiff’s terms, as he himself had been towards their propositions. .. . .</p>

He meets Mr. McLaughlin, having, in consequence of what Charles Emory Smith <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>saicl, purchased a copy of The Times, and read the publication of September 14th. He says ‘I see you have taken it.’ These words are ambiguous, but the referee understands them to mean the matter called for in his letter of August 31st, and on the terms there stated. It must be remembered that this statement is part of the testimony as originally taken. But with the new testimony modifying the offer of that letter, the word ‘ it ’ becomes indefinite. Moreover, if the plaintiff’s contention is true that all that was said as to the $500 advance was said at this time, and not before, then all that Mr. McLaughlin said, coi'roborated by Mr. Waggener, is entirely inconsistent with the idea that the publication of September 14th was a contract on the basis of the letter of August 31st. Mr. McLaughlin says : ‘ He ’ (McClure) ‘ said, “ I am pretty hard up for money, ánd I want to know if you will let me have some money.” I said, “I guess so. How much do you want?” He said, “ $500.” I said, “ I guess we will take it for five weeks anyhow. I do not object to giving you $500.’” Mr. Waggener says: ‘Mr. McClure wanted some money, and Mr. McLaughlin asked him how much he wanted. Mr. McClure said about $500 and Mr. McLaughlin agreed to give it to him and. said: “I guess we will take it for five weeks anyhow. We will advance you $500.’” Now if this be so — and let it be observed that the plaintiff nowhere denies it as having been said — he simply contends that it was said <em>after </em>his return from the West — then it would be so clearly inconsistent with the plaintiff’s idea of his rights, that instead of making no impression on him, he would have perceived its inconsistency and argued or protested. It would have reopened the entire discussion. There is nothing of that in the- case, on the showing of anybody. As has been shown, the plaintiff, by fixing Mr. Waggener’s presence at the first meeting only, has given a date to Mr. Waggener’s testimony adverse to his own contention here. Mr. Waggener could not have invented his testimony. He swears to what he heard. The plaintiff shows that it must have been at the first meeting, and thus states himself out of court on this point. The rest of the interview, which the plaintiff asserts was short and made but little impression on him — as he was anxious to get home — related to illustrations.</p>

As the testimony now stands, this is no longer the pivotal point of the ease. The plaintiff was not bound to have furnished it. In the shape in which the whole matter now appears, the defendant could not have insisted upon the matter. If there was doubt in the mind of the plaintiff, he could have guarded himself by letter. He did ask for a contract in the interview of October 29th, that is, he asked for a contract embodying ‘ the terms of our arrangement.’ Did riot this imply uncertainty ? His request was refused, as Mr. McLaughlin said they did not make contracts in that way. Here, then, was a difference between the parties. If the plaintiff furnished the matter with one idea in his mind, and the defendant accepted it with another, in that of their manager, then there was no contract on the basis of the letter of August 31st. The most that the defendant would be liable for would be the value of the matter used by it, — and for everything that it did actually receive and use it has paid in full.</p>

There is no adoption of a specific proposition; there is no mutual understanding. On the contrary, there appears to be a mutual misunderstanding, and the' legal result is no contract. It is the plaintiff’s duty to clear up the doubt. The burden of proof is upon him. He does not convince the referee', as it is his duty to do, that the defendant accepted his matter distinctly on the terms of the letter of August 31st. The result of the introduction of his letter of October 1st, and of his cross-examination, has been to destroy the previous balance of the case, and to render doubtful that which the referee previously considered free from doubt.</p>

It is a question of fact to be decided upon the evidence, and the learned referee, to whom it was submitted under the act of 1874,. having carefully and intelligently considered it, found, that the offer was not so accepted. His finding is like that of a jury, and the familiar rule applicable to it is that it cannot be reversed on appeal if the evidence- fairly warranted it. A <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>patient study of the evidence in connection with the referee’s discussion of it has convinced us that no item of it was overlooked or ignored in reaching the conclusion we are required to review. While there may be room for disagreement concerning the correctness of the finding, there can be none for doubt that it was the result of a conscientious performance of duty. In view of the full and clear statement and discussion of the evidence in the referee’s report, there is no occasion for including it, or for noting the bearing of every detail of it, in this opinion. It is sufficient for our purpose to note the salient features of it, and their legitimate influence in the decision of the question raised by the pleadings. In the first place, it is obvious and undisputed that an acceptance of the plaintiff’s offer by the defendant company would have constituted a plain departure from its well settled policy in matters of this nature and compelled it to pay for literary work which might prove to be wholly unsuited to its needs. It also distinctly appears in the testimony and is conceded by the plaintiff that the company flatly refused to accept his offer, and named the only terms on which it was willing to contract with him in relation to the subject of it. In close connection with this refusal and the indication of a willingness to take the matter offered, on the terms proposed bjr the company, the plaintiff said to McLaughlin, its representative in the negotiations, that he was in need of money and inquired if he could have some. He was asked how much he wanted and he replied, “five hundred dollars.” He was toíd that he could have it, as the company would probablj1- take the proffered matter “ for five weeks anyhow.” He was asked “ when he was going to send it,” and he said: “ I am going to try to get it up right away.” To this, McLaughlin, speaking for the company, said, “ all right.” This conversation was in the company’s office in Philadelphia before the plaintiff went West, and it is not claimed by either party that previous to or at that time there was an express acceptance by him of the company’s offer or an express or implied acceptance by the company of his offer. The plaintiff however says that on his’ return from the West he was shown an announcement in The Times of September 14th, which he construed as an acceptance of his offer of August 31st, and that he said to McLaughlin, “I see you have taken it,” and McLaughlin replied, “ Yes.” It is <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>upon the announcement referred to, and the remark and answer alleged to have been made two days after it, that the plaintiff rests his claim. Referring to the remark the plaintiff says he made on that occasion and to McLaughlin’s alleged answer to it, the latter says, “ nothing of the kind ever occurred.” In view of the fact that the remark, “ I see you have taken it,” is ambiguous, and of the conclusion of the learned referee that the plaintiff’s “ memory is not to be relied upon at a contested point when it comes in conflict with that of other men,” we think that his contradicted and uncorroborated testimony as to what was said in the admittedly brief interview between him and McLaughlin on the 16th of September, cannofbe regarded as an important factor in the decision of the case. In the light afforded by the testimony taken after the case was reopened, it is obvious .that what was said bjr the plaintiff in his letter of October 1st, about the advance of five hundred dollars, referred to his conversation with McLaughlin before he went West, and, as we have already seen, the proposal to advance this sum was connected witb and qualified by the offer the company then made.</p>
    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[273,1366,1158,596]]]'>If it be conceded that the announcement in The Times, of September 14th, would warrant an inference favorable to the plaintiff’s contention, it is certain that there was nothing in it which precluded the company from asserting the truth as a defense to this action. It was at most an item of evidence to be considered with other evidence in the case, in determining whether there was an acceptance by the company of the plaintiff’s offer. The learned referee found against the plaintiff on this pivotal point, and the evidence fairly sustains his finding. This conclusion renders separate consideration of the thirty-nine specifications of error unnecessary. We overrule all of them.</p>
