To remove the bar of the statute of limitations, B. P. Lowry was called as a witness for the plaintiff. His testimony was objected to, the objection overruled and a bill sealed for defendant. Plis testimony was that he was at the house of the decedent six or seven years before the trial (1893) ; that the decedent, her husband and the plaintiff were present. He heard a conversation between them which he did not distinctly remember. The substance of it he said was: “ I know that while I was there Byron (plaintiff) came there, and him and his mother after dinner were talking of some matters that had been transacted previous, and they were talking of money matters and she promised that she would give Byron the money that fall. Q. What money7? A. The money7 that Byron had let her have. Q. Did she say how much it was ? A. It has been a good while ago; I don’t know just exactly but I think that Byron had let her have money two or three different times; Byron went and got some paper and showed her what it was, and she acknowledged that the money7 that was on the paper was all right. Q. What did she say this money was for? A. That Byron had let her have it for purposes, she didn’t say what the money was given for. Q. Do y7ou remember what the amounts that he named in her presence were ? A. Positively I couldn’t tell y7ou. Q. To the best of your remembrance ? A. There was two or three, I didn’t pay7 much attention to it. Q. Two or three amounts? A. Yes, sir; I remember one of $170. Q. Can you remember what any other was ? A. No, sir. Q. Do you know what paper it was he had on which the amounts were mentioned? A. I do not. Q. Do you remember what time she said she had borrowed this money of Mr. Simrell? A. No, I don’t think I do; I think she said Byron ought to have had the money before.</p>

Of course, on the other hand, Mrs. Simrell being dead, and her estate being represented here by an executor, the executor who defends for the estate stands also at a disadvantage, because whateimr Mrs. Simrell would have testified upon this matter is lost by her death.</p>

He remembers that there were two or three amounts given upon it, that one was $170, another $25.00, and he cannot say what the third amount was; [and he further says that Mrs. Simrell at that time said that she owed this moneir, and that Byron, her son, ought to have been paid it before. He says that this money which was spoken of at that time had been advanced quite a number of years before that] ; [4] there is other evidence to show, and the plaintiff admits that this money was advanced, the last of it, as long ago as 1865.</p>

But a party, even though a debt be outlawed in that way, is under a moral obligation to pay it. Even though the law, by reason of the policy which has moved the legislature to make this enactment, will not permit him to recover after six years, still the other owes it if it has not been paid. [So there is a moral obligation in regard to it. And if a debt, in that situation, is more than six years old, and a party promises to pa3r it, or admits that he owes it in such a straightforward and unequivocal way that the law presumes that he means to pay it, then he is liable on that promise, express or implied.] [7]</p>

The testimony, if you believe it, goes that far. These witnesses say that a paper was produced showing the amount; that the amount was mentioned, and that she said that she did owe that amount and that it ought to have been paid before], [8] and that she would try to raise the money and pay it; if she could not pay it that it would come out of the land.

According to him, the decedent said, “ if she couldn’t raise the money why he (the plaintiff) could have it out of the land.” This was at most a conditional promise to pay when able, and the additional statement that if she was not able plaintiff could have it out of the laud, is not a promise but a remission of plaintiff to his legal rights for a recovery. In Lowry v. Robinson, <a href="/pa/141/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="141 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="974849" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0189-01">141 Pa. 189</a>, the promise was to pay “ when he got ready ” and “ he said he didn’t have the money just at present, but he intended to pay it when he had it,” and this court said emphatically that “ a claim twice barred by the statute of limitations should have a better foundation.” See also Linderman v. Pomeroy, <a href="/pa/142/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="142 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="976662" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0168-01">142 Pa. 168</a>.</p>
    <p id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[252,1065,1156,298]]]'>Neither of these witnesses by himself makes out a positive promise to pay an identified debt, and without that plaintiff cannot recover, for even if a clear acknowledgment of the debt were made out, which it is not, the decedent being a married woman at the time of the alleged loan and the alleged promise, would not be bound by it: Kelly v. Eby, <a href="/pa/141/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="141 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="974895" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0176-01">141 Pa. 176</a>.</p>
    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[251,1371,1159,336]]]'>Nor can the testimony of the two witnesses be combined to bring either of them up to the required standard. As our brother McCollum said in Patterson v. Neuer, <a href="/pa/165/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="165 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="862048" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0066-01">165 Pa. 66</a>, if an acknowledgment “ does not appear in either of their conversations it cannot be inferred from both. In other words several insufficient acknowledgments will not constitute a sufficient-one.”</p>
    <p id="b352-7" data-blocks='[["BL_352.6",352,[250,1727,1159,449]]]'>The plaintiff’s claim is brought forward under circumstances that raise every presumption against it. His alleged loan was made to his mother, a married woman at the time, and he waited twenty-five years and until she was dead before taking any steps to get payment. Parties who do this must understand that they will be held to strict proof of every step towards their claim. The plaintiff failed to make out his case, and the request for a binding instruction for the defendant should have been granted.</p>
