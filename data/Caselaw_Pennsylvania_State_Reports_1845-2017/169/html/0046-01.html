You have heard the words he did use. They were a representation, not necessarily a warranty. If you believe the testimony of Mr. Lightuer, however, he did warrant this horse expressly.

Then you will remember the length of time between the sale and the time they saw him, and if the time was so close as to warrant them in saying he was unsound at the time of sale, if you believe that, you have it all before you, it is a question of fact; then if you find the amount of damages sustained, if there was warranty and that the horse was dumb and unsound at the time of the warranty, the time of the sale, then you will have to do as I have told you with reference to the first point: ascertain the amount of damages, and if the amount is greater than the amount of the note and interest, then find simply for the defendant; if it is not so great, deduct it from the amount of the note and interest and return a verdict for'the plaintiff for the difference between them.” [7]</p>
