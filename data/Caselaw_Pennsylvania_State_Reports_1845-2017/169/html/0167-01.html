That in the performance of the written contract sued on in this case, the plaintiff was only bound to bring to its performance such skill and knowledge as men ordinarily skilled in the erection and construction of such work possessed at the time said contract was entered into. And that subject to this degree of skill and knowledge, plaintiff had the right to determine the size and construction of the tank melting furnace, and of the Wellman producers, and the size, mode of construction and inode of connection of the flues or conduits to convey the gas from the producers to the melting tank, blowing furnace, flattening ovens and floater kilns, and all other matters relating to the plan or design of the plant to be constructed under said contract, except where specific provisions in relation thereto were set out in the contract. And said plaintiff, further, was only bound to use in the work, material of the best quality for the work required, and do the work in a thoroughly workmanlike manner. That plaintiff was not bound to furnish more than five Wellman producers under the contract, even if it should be found that more than five were required to furnish the necessary amount of gas. And if the jury find that the plaintiff did construct the plant according to its own plans and specifications, and that in the doing of said work and the <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>designing thereof it had exercised the care and skill which men engaged in that business ordinarily possessed and exercised, then plaintiff is not responsible for the result of the work done, unless the jury find that the flues and producers built or like parts of the work built and furnished by the plaintiff could have been so changed and rearranged as to produce a successful operation of the furnace. <em>Answer: </em>That point, as put, is refused. In the first place plaintiff was not only to erect and construct the plant, but was to prepare its plans and specifications ; that is, it was to be the architect as well as the building contractor, and its skill and care must extend to its conduct in both capacities. You will recollect that is a criticism upon the portion of the point which refers to its exercising proper care in the erection and construction of its work. That should refer also to the planning of it, or, rather, the preparing of the plans and specifications for it. In the second place, whilst the plaintiff was to build only five Wellman producers, and whilst if those producers are of a fixed size and capacity the point would, in this.respect, correctly express the law, defendant maintains that these producers are constructed of all sizes and capacities, and in such cases a contract to supply five producers as part of a plant sufficient to work thirty-six blowers, is a contract to build those furnaces of sufficient size and capacity to do their part of the work of such plant. As I have before said to you, if you find that those producers are of a fixed size and capacity, then the number of them was fixed by the contract, and the plaintiff was only bound to build that number. But if the capacity depended upon the size — that is, if they are built of different sizes and capacities — then the company in contracting to build a certain number for a certain work contracted to build them of sufficient capacity to perform their work. With the qualifications that I have suggested, the point correctly expresses the law. As I have already said, the plaintiff company was not bound to produce perfection in this work, was not bound to bring the highest degree of skill and knowledge to the performance of it, but was bound, ordinarily, to bring to its performance only such skill and knowledge as men ordinarily skilled in such work have and exercise.”</p>

In addition to the work stipulated for in the written contract, by a verbal agreement between them the plaintiff agreed to erect, on the same premises, a “flattening oven ” for $2,125.

    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[274,885,1162,1264]]]'>It will be noticed, the contract was to erect a tank melting furnace designed to work thirty-six blowers in three equal shifts per day; the furnace to be operated with fuel gas manufactured from coal, by what is known as the “ Wellman” producer. As necessary to a proper understanding of the contract, a fact clearly established by the decided weight of the evidence should be stated: viz, that this method of melting’ glass in a tank for blowing, instead of in pots, and operating the furnace with fuel gas, instead of with natural gas, or coal, had hardly passed beyond the stage of experiment; therefore, as both parties had full knowledge and experience in glass manufacture, it may be assumed that the plaintiff did not intend to guarantee, absolutely, a successful result, nor did defendant intend to exact such guaranty. The surroundings of parties at the time of making a contract, and the subject-matter thereof, are always admissible to ascertain their intention, if their expressions be ambiguous or disputable. Having in view this situation of the parties, as an aid to the interpretation of the guaranty clause of the contract, already quoted, we are of opinion, the plaintiff was bound to show: — 1. That the work was done in a thoroughly workmanlike manner, and that the material used was of the best quality for the purpose. 2. That the gas flues had a capacity sufficient to supply the furnaces and ovens. 3. That they had used every endeavor in their power to make them operate successfully.</p>

On this interpretation of the contract, plaintiff offered evidence tending to establish that the work was well done, the material of the best quality, the producers and gas flues were of sufficient capacity, and that they did their best to make the furnaces operate successfully. And if this had been all that appeared in the case, they would have been entitled to a verdict for the balance unpaid on the contract, for they did not undertake that either tank melting or fuel gas should prove a success in glass manufacturing.</p>
    <p id="b201-3" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[135,943,1169,1271]]]'>But it will be noticed, that plaintiff undertook to furnish three “Wellman” producers for the manufacture of natural gas, and to connect them by flues of suitable size to convey the gas from the producer's in sufficient quantity to operate the furnaces. Defendant averred, the producers were not of a size to furnish gas in sufficient quantitjq even if the flues were sufficient; and it adduced evidence tending to show that Wellman producers were of different sizes; that the term itself imported no particular size, and they could be, and often were, made larger than those supplied by plaintiff. In reply to this, plaintiff offered evidence, tending to show that the term “Wellman producer ” meant just such a one as they had constructed, and certainly did not mean a larger one; probably, as it appears to us, the weight of the evidence was with plaintiff as to this fact; nevertheless, it was a disputed fact for the jury. Plaintiff did not undertake that fuel gas should successfully operate the furnace, but it did undertake, if there were producers and flues of sufficient and insufficient size, then it would use “ every endeavor to make the furnaces operate successfully; ” and further, that it would make “ any re-arrangement or changes to the flues and producers, or anything of that kind, found necessary for the successful operation of the furnaces.” If plaintiff did not put in producers of sufficient size according.to plans prepared, which were to be prepared by itself, when it could have done so, it is answerable in damages.</p>

But if the Wellman producer is, as the defendant claims, a producer which can be erected of any size, then an agreement to erect producers, as part of a plant to work thirty-six blowers, is an agreement to build those producers of sufficient size and capacity to do their part of the work of said plant, and plaintiff should have so built them.”</p>

It was not a failure on part of defendant to perform any part of the written contract, or any act of defendant subsequent to it, not intended by it, but the offer was to prove a failure to <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>perform another and a parol agreement, made at the same time as the written one; no fraud or mistake was alleged which would authorize a modification of the writing.

It was not competent for defendant to prove that melting glass in a tank was not a success, but it was competent to prove that this tank was not large enough for three shifts every twenty-four hours, even if the new method would otherwise have been successful.</p>

It was material, theiefore, to defendant to prove when the contract to remedy the defect had been made, if for no other reason than to show the expenditure was subsequent to the notice. There was no error in the admission of the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[268,803,1164,959]]]'>All the other assignments relate to the instruction of the court as to the measure of damages, and the admission of evidence relating thereto. The peculiarity of the contract made it difficult to distinguish whether success in operation failed because of defective performance by plaintiff of its contract, as designer and builder, or because of the adoption of new methods; the same peculiarity, also, made the rules determining the measure of damages somewhat difficult of application to the conflicting evidence. The learned court instructed the jury, if they found plaintiff had not performed its contract, then defendant was entitled to damages in: 1. The amount reasonably and necessarily expended in completing the contract. 2. The expense incurred and material lost, in attempting to operate the plant, so long as it was reasonable to operate it, in order to ascertain whether it would operate successfully. 3. The expense incurred, necessary to preserve the tank and material in it, while making necessary changes in flues and- producers. 4. Fair compensation, on the testimony, for the use of the plant while deprived of its use by failure of plaintiff to fulfil its contract.</p>
    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[264,1772,1160,602]],["BL_205.1",205,[132,349,1161,502]]]'>This was followed, again, by the caution, that if plaintiff had used due skill in its work, but experience demonstrated that the method was at fault, then defendant must bear the <em>loss; </em>that distinction must be made between care and skill and experiment. As is said in McKnight v. Ratcliff, <a href="/pa/44/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="44 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="484304" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0156-01">44 Pa. 156</a> : “ It is often much easier to discover when an assumed rule for damages will lead to erroneous results, than to point out in all cases, in advance, what the true rule should be.” Logically, the rule laid down by the learned judge would possibly lead to an estimate of what profits might have been made while defendant was deprived of the use of its plant. But it did not lead to that result, for he properly controlled the admission and effect <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>of the evidence so as to exclude any estimate based on what speculative profits defendant might have made, and confined the estimate to the actual loss. The court very plainly said to the jury, they were to ascertain “How much it was worth as a plant to a man desiring to use it; how much rent would he pay for it ? .... As I have explained to you, these other items that were admitted in evidence, will not be taken into account as a measure of damages. They are only for the purpose of aiding you to get at the value of the plant; that is, the rental value during the time of the delay.”</p>
    <p id="b205-3" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[132,860,1160,554]]]'>While fair compensation for the use of the plant when idle would, theoretically, be reimbursement for loss of profits, yet the impossibility of determining the amount of profits in this case, as in nearly every case of like character, was recognized by the court; such estimate would have been purely speculative as to what, under the most favorable circumstances, might have been made; therefore, the consideration of the jury was limited strictly to what would have been a fair rental value: Sedgwick on Damages, sec. 170. And on this question, all the evidence complained of had a bearing, and there was no error in not excluding it.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[132,1422,1160,245]]]'>A careful examination of the more than 400 pages of testimony, with the many rulings on objections thereto, as well as a consideration of the very full and clear charge of the court, leads us to the conclusion no error warranting a reversal of the judgment was committed.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[177,1676,656,42]]]'>The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>
