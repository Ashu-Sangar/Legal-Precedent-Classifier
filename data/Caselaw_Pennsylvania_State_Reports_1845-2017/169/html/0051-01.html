If you believe the testimony of the plaintiff, that the expression was used by either one of the defendants, as stated by him, the plaintiff, and the plaintiff had reasonable ground to suppose that the warranty was intended by the defendants, and that he did so suppose, and in making the purchase of the stock relied upon such supposed warranty, then you should find that there was a warranty in fact in this case. No particular words or form of expression is necessary to create a warranty, nor need the word ‘warranty’ be used. If the representation is positive and relates to a matter of fact and not to a matter of opinion, that is, if these men had said that it was their opinion that the cattle were all right, that would not be a warranty; but if the plaintiff received the statement as true, and relied upon it in making the bargain, such representation will constitute a warranty.</p>

I asked him, ‘ What brings that kind of cattle in the market. I asked him if there was anything wrong with these cattle, and he said he would insure them.’ Q. Did you say at the Squire’s office that he said he would insure them? A. Yes. I think so. Q. Give us the German that he used when he said he would insure the cattle. What did he say? A. Longenecker said, ‘I will insure them that they are all right.’</p>

In the absence of either fraud or warranty, the purchaser takes the risk of the defects in soundness, health or condition of stock that he purchases. In this case, however, there is no allegation of fraud made. The plaintiff says in the statement of his demand — and he relies upon it — - that the suit ‘ is founded and based upon a warranty ’ solely, of the soundness and healthy condition of the lot of heifers in question, and which are now under consideration.</p>

Was there a warranty of these cattle? If these defendants did not warrant or insure the health and condition of the cattle, as represented by the plaintiff — in other words, if you do not believe what the plaintiff said in this case, then there can be no recovery, and then it will not be necessary for you to go into any other question; because, as I said before, he relies solely upon the warranty of the stock when he purchased it.] [1] [And it is for you to say in considering all this testL mony, whether this was not a scrub end of a lot of cattle that <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>he purchased. You will take the price and everything else into consideration, and say whether it is likely or not that such a warranty would have been made, under the circumstances of the case.] [4] If you come to the conclusion that the plaintiff has told you the truth here to-day, and that there was such a warranty, as represented by him, then he is entitled to recover such an amount as he has proven to you in this case as the loss sustained bjr him by reason of this purchase under the warranty.</p>

It is almost solely a question of credibility. As I said before, if you believe the plaintiff, that there was such a warranty made, then he is entitled to recover, and the measure of damages will be the difference between what he paid for the cattle and what they were worth at the time the sale was made, as represented by the counsel on the part of the plaintiff.</p>

The character of the plaintiff has been assailed in this case. The only testimony you really have before you on the question of warranty was given on the part of the plaintiff, and, indeed, that alone was presented; but his character for truthfulness has been assailed here. It is a very difficult matter to call neighbors in to prove the bad character of a man, while it is a very easy thing to prove the good character of a man ; and it is for you to say, from the reputation that these witnesses, who are his neighbors and live in his immediate vicinity, quite a number of them, whether from the reputation that they give this man when they say they would not believe him on oath, that he ought to be believed by you. They seem to be reputable people. They knew this man from ten to fifty years. Is it possible that a community or so large a portion of a community would come into a court of justice and swear that he has a very bad reputation for truthfulness and they would not believe him on oath, if it was not true ? It is a question of fact which you are bound to consider, and it is your duty to consider it as evidence in this case. Courts of justice are not established for the purpose of enforcing trumped-up claims. If this is a trumped-up claim you ought <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>to say so promptly, and he ought to be put out of court; but if it is a just claim, he is entitled to recover in this action.] [5]</p>

If you should so find, I ask you to say so specially by writing out your verdict in full to that effect. [I will give you a form which you may use as a guide for that purpose. Should you believe from all the testimony that there was such a warranty, as alleged in the plaintiff’s statement and as sworn to by the plaintiff himself, you should find for the plaintiff. If you believe there was no warranty in this case, you need go no further. Then you ought simply to say, ‘we find for the defendants.’ The form of verdict which I shall hand to you reads as follows: you are not' obliged to use the same language; it is to guide you in framing your verdict in case you find for the plaintiff.

If you should find in favor of the plaintiff, then it is my duty to say whether the magistrate had jurisdiction of this matter, under the testimony submitted by the plaintiff in this case.
