Mohn, the defendant, during his life, for the purpose of preserving the corpus of the estate for his other children in remainder. It is hard to conceive how any other construction could be placed upon it. As there is no ambiguity in the language used by the testator, we must be governed by the plain rule of construction, that the intent of the testator must be gathered from the four corners of the will. Nor can it well be denied that the life interest of such a fund as is here created is liable to attachment by the creditors of the legatee, as is here contended.</p>

To quote from this opinion: ‘ If the trustees had withheld it from him, he could have sued for and received it. Whenever a party has a right of action, his creditors may attach the debt, unless it be for wages.’ See, also, Trust Company v. Chambers, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20Pa.%20486" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="46 Pa. 486">46 Pa. 486</a>.</p>

It was contended by them that as the garnishees never had $300 in their hands at anyone time, they were justified in paying out the semiannual interest, as it had accrued. It will be noticed from the verdict of the jury that sufficient moneys had come into the hands of the garnishees to satisfy both the claim of exemption and the writ of attachment. So long as the attachment remained in force it was undoubtedly the duty of the garnishees to hold the interest moneys, as they were falling due from time to time, over and above the amount of the defendant’s exemption allowed by law, to await the termination of the suit. The general issue in these cases, raised on the trial by the very nature of the attachment proceedings, is whether the garnishees at the time of the attachment or at any time after, had any money or goods of the defendant in his <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>hands: Sheetz v.

The uncontroverted fact in this case is that the executors of the will of William Mohn, deceased, the garnishees, had received since the service of the attachment, the sum of $1,130.64, which was paid over to the defendant as interest as fast as it fell due, semiannually, on the first days of April and October in each year, in installments of $125.70, the principal of the legacy being $4,235.00.
