Cartagena, guaranteed to contain a yield of fifty per cent of iron in the natural state, with a sliding scale at the rate of three pence per unit additional for every unit over fifty per cent, and with a deduction of four pence per unit for every unit under fifty per cent. Plaintiff offered to prove that it was the custom at Cartagena to fix a standard of fifty per cent with a sliding scale to regulate the price according to the result of the assay of the cargo when discharged; that when a sliding scale was thus fixed for the rise or fall of the price of iron or-e, the purchaser was obliged to receive the mineral, provided it did not go below forty-five per cent or forty-six per cent.

The price of the mass thus constituted was claimed to be the proper test by which to measure the difference between the contract price and the market price, and thus fix the measure of damages. It is perfectly plain that the sellers, by their conduct in mixing inferior ore with that which was the subject of the bargain, effectually disqualified themselves from getting a price for the mixture which would enable them to fix any standard by which the measure of damage was to be ascertained.</p>

The custom has always been to fix a standard of 50 per cent, with a sliding scale to regulate the price according to the result of the assay of the cargo when discharged. From the moment that a sliding scale is fixed for the rise or fall of the price of iron, the purchaser is obliged to receive the mineral, always provided that it does not go below 45 per cent or 46 <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>per cent, and we have liquidation in which the mineral has resulted with 46 per cent of iron, for which we have been paid without objection.” And further on, he says: — “ Iron ore not being a manufactured article, it has to be taken as it comes from the mines, and the contents in the natural state vary according to the moisture which it may contain at the time of sampling. For this reason, it is impossible to give an absolute guaranty, so it is, and alwaj^s has been, the custom to adopt a sliding scale.”</p>

The vendors warranted the ore to be of an average purity of fifty per cent; it was not in human power to have each and every ton in its natural state up to this standard; there cannot be an unvarying assay of a crude mineral; while this last fact appears in the rejected testimony, it is also an obvious inference from the terms of the contract. Every mineral varies as to purity with the character of its location in the natural bed; whether, when mined, it will absorb much or little moisture, depends on the character of the impurities inseparable from it, the humidity of the atmosphere, and the length of time exposed. While the variation may not be great, there will be some change incident to mining and shipment. It is a fair presumption in the absence of proof, that both parties knew this, because it is only presuming they had ordinary knowledge of the subject of the contract. Knowing this fact, that the ore would not be in the same condition when assayed at port of discharge, as when mined at the point of shipment, how did they provide that the seller should get six shillings for every ton of ore up to a fixed standard, and the buyer should not pay more than it was worth, because below the standard? By a sliding scale, which provided the vendor should pay three pence per unit when above fifty per cent, and have a deduction of four pence per unit when it fell below. The richer the ore, the less the comparative cost of smelting; the poorer, the greater, and increasing much more rapidly in cost than it lessened in purity; for that reason, the deduction, when it fell <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>below the standard, was greater than the increase when it rose above it; and. it may be conceded, too, that even this sliding scale is to have a reasonable interpretation; ore that did not come up to the standard, was not to fall many units below it; for if it did, the ore was practically worthless for shipment; the cost of getting a ton of .iron out of four tons of ore, yielding in the furnace twentj'-five per cent, compared with the cost of a ton of iron out of two tons of ore, is so much greater, that evidently the parties intended the pui'ity of the leaner ore should approach closely the standard.</p>
    <p id="b490-4" data-blocks='[["BL_490.4",490,[285,887,1164,135]]]'>Here again comes in the evidence as to the trade custom— that ore within four or five units of the standard, is alone merchantable.</p>
    <p id="b490-5" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[285,1039,1162,347]]]'>In view of the evidence offered, we think the parties framed this contract to provide for the very contigency now complained of, a slight falling below the standard. And even if the ore only reached the same standard as that purchased before the contract was made, 48 and 49 per cent of iron, plaintiffs fulfilled their contract when they placed it on the ore wharf, and notified" defendant it was ready for delivery f. o. b. for shipment.</p>
    <p id="b490-6" data-blocks='[["BL_490.6",490,[285,1395,1167,1010]],["BL_491.1",491,[160,375,1158,145]]]'>Nor was it a breach of contract on part of plaintiffs, to sell the ore at the best price obtainable when defendant had not taken away a pound of it for a month after the time stipulated in the contract. Through his agents’ letter of Jan. 21, 1888, to plaintiffs, he says: “ If you have any outlet for the mineral, we should be perfectly willing for you to sell it.” To this, on Jan. 30th, plaintiffs reply: “We beg to thank you for your suggestion to sell the ore elsewhere, but really, as we have collected this special class of ore for Mr. Earnshaw, <em>we </em>should like him to receive it, and if he cannot ship the ore just now, he should authorize us to draw against these stocks. . . . We think this much better than to be obliged to sell the ore elsewhere, perhaps at a great loss.” But defendant neither took the ore, nor authorized plaintiffs to draw for any part of the price. Certainly, he has no right to complain that plaintiffs, months afterwards, sold it in Germany. Nor did he so complain at the trial below; his eminent counsel, Mr. McMurtrie, deceased, made this statement to the court: “I admit the plaintiffs had the quantity of ore, but not the quality of ore. I admit the plaintiffs took the ore to Germany and sold it in the way of <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>which we cannot complain, but the only question is, as to whether they fairly dealt with the ore, so as to make that sale a standard of price.”</p>
    <p id="b491-4" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[153,528,1167,1271]]]'>It will be noticed, from the contract, plaintiffs were to deliver the ore to defendant, not on the wharf, but f. o. b. on board at Cartagena, from time to time, defendant to furnish vessels on advices of quantity ready for shipment. The breach of contract of defendant, was in the neglect to furnish the vessels to receive the ore; it was not his ore, and was not to be in his possession, until loaded. It follows, then, it was at the risk and charge of plaintiffs, while at the wharf; as long as it was in their possession, their damages could not be the contract delivery price, unless the ore became absolutely valueless because of his failure to take it, and this last is not pretended. Then, the plaintiffs having been ready and willing to deliver at the time appointed in the contract, of which defendant had full notice, and the ore still belonging to plaintiffs, they were bound to get the market price at the time and place appointed for delivery. It is said in Fire Works Co. v. Polites, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20Pa.%20537" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="130 Pa. 537">130 Pa. 537</a>, adopting a well established rule, as shown by the text-books and cases there cited: “ The present tendency of the American cases, is to the doctrine, that where the vendor stands in the attitude of complete performance on his part, he is entitled to the contract price as the measure of damages; but on an executory contract, for the sale of goods not specific, the measure of damages for refusal to receive them, is the difference between the contract price and the market price on the day appointed for delivery.”</p>
    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[151,1809,1171,604]],["BL_492.1",492,[248,368,1159,494]]]'>The measure of damage was the actual loss, and they lost the-difference between what defendant had contracted to pay for the ore, and the market price at Cartagena, when they discovered, definitely, he would not receive it. They had a right to sell it at Cartagena, not for any price, but for the market price, to German or any other buyers. In making the sale, they were bound to exercise reasonable and intelligent judgment in ascertaining the market price at that point. It is not important that they mixed one fourth or fifth of inferior ore to further a sale of the whole, unless such mixture resulted in a less price than the market price for this Anisetto ore; if it did, that does not bar their right, it onty compels them to account for the <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>market price of the Anisetto ore. If the price they got for the mixture was less than they could have got for the Anisetto, the price of the mixture does not determine their damages, but the market price of the Anisetto deducted from the contract price. This market price, plaintiffs claim, from the testimony, was only 4s. 6d. per ton, instead of the 6s. contract price. That is a matter of evidence for the consideration of a jury. We only say, plaintiffs were not bound to pay wharfage, and refrain from making a sale of their own ore, after defendant had broken his contract.</p>
    <p id="b492-5" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[250,876,1159,251]]]'>We conclude: 1. That it was error to reject the evidence of the trade custom at the place the contract was to be performed. 2. That the true measure of damages is the difference between the contract price and the market price of the ore at the point of delivery at the date it was sold.</p>
    <p id="b492-6" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[295,1133,1111,47]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>
