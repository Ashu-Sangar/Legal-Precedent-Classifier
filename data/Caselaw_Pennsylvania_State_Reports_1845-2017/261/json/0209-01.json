    "head_matter": "Peiffer\u2019s Estate.\nDecedents\u2019 estates \u2014 Claim for services \u2014 Nursing\u2014Evidence\u2014Insufficiency.\n1. Services for nursing are presumed to be paid for periodically.\n2. A claim against a decedent\u2019s estate presented by the daughter-in-law of decedent for nursing' was properly disallowed where it appeared that for a number of years claimant, her husband and decedent had lived together on the latter\u2019s farm; that the crops and income therefrom were regularly divided between claimant\u2019s husband, who was the tenant, and the decedent; that no express contract for such services was alleged and no demand was shown to have'been made by the claimant in the lifetime of the decedent, and the only testimony in support of the claim were a number of loose and vague declarations on the part of the decedent that the claimant should be paid for her services; and the claim was not presented until after claimant\u2019s husband, who was executor of the estate, had been surcharged with a considerable sum for mismanagement of the estate.\nArgued March 5, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 47, January T., 1918, by Mary Peiffer, from decree of O. C. Berks County, May T., 1916, No. 28, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of Edward Peiffer, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Potter, Mosctizisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that Mary Peiffer, the wife of the executor, and the daughter-in-law of the decedent, presented a claim of $2,400 for nursing decedent.\nThe claimant, her husband and decedent resided together on the latter\u2019s farm for many years. The crops and income from the farm were regularly divided between the claimant\u2019s husband, who was the tenant, and the decedent. There was no evidence to support the claim except testimony as to a number of loose and vague declarations oh the part of the decedent that the claimant should be paid for her services. There was evidence that claimant immediately after the funeral when asked what the estate owed her, replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything; I gave it willingly.\u201d\nThe facts further appear from the following opinion of Schaeffer, P. J.\nWe have carefully examined again, the evidence bearing on this claim, and we do not see how in the light of it we can sustain the exceptions filed here. The testimony shows, that the claimant and her husband, occupied this farm with the decedent for many years, and that they lived together on it as one family, up to the time of his death. In view of this family relation, the testimony\u2014 loose expressions of gratitude and appreciation and of a desire that she should be paid, and the like: Wise v. Martin, 232 Pa. 159 \u2014 is of a character, which is always regarded as insufficient to support \u00e1 claim of this nature. No express contract is even alleged, and no demand is shown to have been made by the claimant in the lifetime of the decedent. Services for nursing are presumed to be periodically paid: Cummiskey\u2019s Est., 224 Pa. 509, and it is almost incredible, that the decedent should receive his share of income of the farm from the claimant\u2019s husband who had the sole control of the same, for this period of two and one-half years, during which she rendered these services, and not some settlement be made for the nursing, if payment was contemplated by the parties. The facts and circumstances surrounding this whole case justify the conclusion that these services were either voluntarily performed by the claimant by reason of the relation existing between her and her father-in-law, the decedent, or were paid for at stated periods when they were due; and that this claim would not have been made, if claimant\u2019s husband, the accountant, to whom the farm was devised had not been charged with the mismanagement of the estate, and finally surcharged with the sum of $1,442.19.\nDespite the earnest and exhaustive argument of counsel for the exceptions, we are constrained to dismiss them, and confirm the distribution absolutely.\nThe lower court dismissed the exceptions to the adjudication. Mary Peiffer appealed.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions, to the adjudication.\nWilliam Eerper Stevens, for appellant.\nW. S. Rothermel and W. E. Sharman, for appellees, . were not heard.\nApril 22, 1918:"
