The order was merely interlocutory, and the appeal must, therefore, be quashed: Snodgrass\u2019s App., 96 Pa. 420. If a sale should be made in pursuance of the said order or decree, an appeal will lie from the final confirmation of it, and the errors now justly, but prematurely, complained of will then be properly here for correction.\nAppeal quashed, without prejudice to the appellant.",
