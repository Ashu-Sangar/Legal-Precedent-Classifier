Armour & Company, Appellant.\nWorkmen\u2019s compensation \u2014 Injury in course of employment\u2014 Motor truck \u2014 Driver\u2019s helper \u2014 Voluntary giving up of seat \u2014 Fall from running hoard \u2014 Award.\nWhere the helper of a driver of a motor truck voluntarily gave up his seat to girls on the way home from work and stood on the running board, and the truck then resumed its jo.urney and struck an obstruction in the road, causing him to fall and sustain fatal injuries, he was injured while engaged in the course of his employment and his widow and children were properly awarded compensation. ,\nArgued Feb. 26, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 12, Jan. T., 1918, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Lackawgmna Co., June T., 1917, No. 265, dismissing appeal from Workmen\u2019s Compensation'Board in case of Louise Siglin, Gertrude Siglin, John Siglin, Francis Siglin and Elizabeth Siglin v. Armour & Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Potter, Stewart, Moschzisker and, Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from award of compensation by Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.\nThe facts appear from the following opinion by New-comb, J.:\nThe referee awarded compensation to tbe widow and children of one Harry Siglin, who came to bis death by accident while in defendant\u2019s employ. Tbe award was affirmed by tbe Board of Compensation and from that decision defendant takes this appeal. Deceased was fatally hurt by a fall from bis employer\u2019s motor truck, on its return from an out-of-town delivery of goods, in . charge of a driver to whom deceased was a helper. He was standing on tbe running board, or at least with one foot on tbe board, and was thrown off- by a jolt occasioned by an obstruction in tbe road. Tbe driver and two girls on tbe seat were not disturbed by tbe jolt. Deceased bad voluntarily given up bis seat and taken to tbe running board, in order to give tbe girls a ride when they were overtaken on tbe road. That circumstance gives rise to tbe question raised by appellant, viz: whether deceased was at that particular time in tbe course of bis employment, to which some color is lent by tbe fact that of bis own volition be bad stopped tbe car, given up what proved to be a place of safety and taken one obviously of less safety, not in furtherance of tbe master\u2019s business but to help tbe girls on tbe way home from their work.\nAppellant takes tbe negative and its contention is supported by a very able argument; but tbe impression remains that it only convicts deceased' of contributory negligence which can avail nothing in cases of this kind. \u2022 Had be suffered an injury while on tbe ground for the purpose of taking on tbe passengers, a different question would be presented. But having resumed bis- appointed journey, he was no doubt in course of bis employment thereafter, no matter in what part of the truck he placed himself. The finding of the referee having been affirmed by the board, the burden must be deemed to be on the appellant to clearly establish the alleged error, and of that we are not c.onvinced.\nThe lower court dismissed the appeal from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in dismissing the appeal from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.\nW. L. Hill, of Knapp, O\u2019Malley, Hill <& Harris, for appellant.\nHarold A. Scragg, for appellee.\nMarch 18, 1918:"
