The Delaware & Hudson Co., Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Animals \u2014 Vicious mule \u2014 Boy on sled \u2014 Kick of mule \u2014 Death\u2014Contributory negligence \u2014 Case for jury \u2014 Excessive verdict \u2014 Reduction of verdict.\n1. In an, action to recover for the death of plaintiff\u2019s fourteen-year-old son resulting from his being kicked in the head by defendant\u2019s mule, the questions of the negligence of the defendant and the contributory negligence of the deceased were for the jury and a verdict for the plaintiffs will be sustained where it appeared that deceased and certain companions were coasting down a hill on a bobsled and crossed the road on which the mul\u00e9 was standing, in charge of defendant\u2019s driver; that as deceased came within four feet of the mule it kicked him on the head inflicting injuries from which his death resulted; that at the time of the occurrence deceased was the fourth boy on the sled, which was being steered by an eighteen-year-old companion; and there was evidence that on previous occasions the mule had shown vicious propensities and had kicked other persons, and that' defendant had knowledge of such fact.\n2. In such case the lower court properly reduced the verdict of $5,013 in favor of the plaintiffs which was grossly excessive to $2,86.4.19, the reduced amount representing the estimated probable earnings of deceased during minority less the cost of his maintenance and education.\nArgued Feb. 26, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 34, Jan. T., 1918, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Lackawanna Co., June T., 1915, No. 532, on verdict for plaintiffs in case of Robert Nevins and Anna Nevins v. The Delaware and Hudson Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Potter, Stewart, Moschzisker and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for the death of plaintiffs\u2019 son. Before Maxwell, P. J., specially presiding.\nFrom the record it appeared that on the afternoon of December 23, 1914, Joseph Nevins, the deceased, and several companions were coasting upon a public road upon a bobsled. They had gone down three times and were going up the hill from their third trip when they passed John Coleman, defendant\u2019s mule driver, coming down the road on his way to the mule barn, riding one mule and leading another by a rope or chain. The boys reached the top of the hill and after waiting three or four minutes for the mules to get out of their way started down the hill again on their fourth trip. After they had gotten part way down they discovered the mules still in the public road. They then called to Coleman who pulled the mules into the opposite gutter so that as the sled passed them the mules were standing diagonally across the road close to the gutter. The hind mule, the one that was being led, was approximately four or four \u00e1nd a half feet from them. As they passed this mule he kicked with his hind feet or foot and struck two of the boys in the head, slightly injuring one and crushing the skull of Joseph Nevins. From the effects of the injury he died on January 3,1915.\nIt appeared that Thomas McGowan, an eighteen-year-old boy, was riding in front of the bobsled and was steering at the time of the accident, and that Joseph Nevins was the fourth on the sled as they came down the hill.\nThere was evidence that the mule which kicked the deceased was of a vicious and bad disposition; that it had been owned by defendant company for some four or five years prior to the accident; and that the defendant company, through its mine bosses or assistant mine bosses or driver, had actual knowledge of the vicious tendencies of the mule as to its kicking and biting. There was proof that the mule had kicked other persons on numerous occasions.\nVerdict for plaintiffs for $5,013 which was subsequently reduced by the court to $2,864.79, representing the estimated probable earnings of the deceased during his minority, less the cost of maintenance and education. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in refusing defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v.\nW. J. Torrey, with him James H. Torrey, for appellant.\nDavid J. Reedy, with him J. E. Brennan, for appellees.\nMarch 18, 1918:"
