    "head_matter": "Wood\u2019s Estate.\nTrusts \u2014 Dry trusts \u2014 Active trusts \u2014 Beneficiaries, sui juris \u2014 Termination.\n1. Where an instrument creating a trust for persons sui juris creates no limitation over of either the income or the principal of the estate and there are no other estates in interest to be preserved and no ultimate purpose of any kind requiring the continuance of the trust is expressed or can be implied from its terms except the mere payment of the income to the cestui que trust, a termination of the trust may be decreed.\n2. A testator bequeathed to trustees certain personal property and the proceeds of certain real estate to be held in trust by them for the use of his two daughters, \u201cthe proceeds to be equally divided between them......and desire said trustees to pay them equally the net proceeds, of the above-named property derived from dividends, rents and interest after payment of taxes and current repairs. And in any case a majority of the said trustees deem it for the interest and safety of the property so bequeathed to (the daughters, naming them) with their consent, to sell any of the mentioned trust property and invest it in the bonds of the United States. I understand that in this devise that the said (daughters, naming them) shall have power to dispose of equal portion's of this estate so held for them in trust by will.\u201d\nOne of the daughters died and the other, who was sui juris, applied for a termination of the,- trust. Held, the court properly declared the trust terminated and awarded one-half of the estate to the petitioner and the other half to the personal representatives of the deceased cestui que trust.\nArgued April 2,1918.\nAppeal, No. 13, Jan. T., 1918, by George Wood, Trustee, and E. Francis Wood, substituted Trustee^ for Mary and Julia Wood, under Will of Richard D. Wood, Deceased, from decree of O. O. Philadelphia Co., Oct. T., 1880, No. 394, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of Richard D. Wood, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Potter, Stewart, Mosohzisker and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.'\nExceptions to adjudication. . Before Gummey, J.\nThe facts appear in the following opinion of Gest, J., sur exceptions to adjudication:\nThe testator by his will gave to his sons certain personal property and the proceeds of certain real estate to be held in trust by them for the use of his daughters, Mary and Julia.\n\u201cthe proceeds to be equally divided between them ..-----and desire said trustees to pay them equally the net proceeds of the above named property derived from dividends, rents and interest after payment of taxes and current repairs. And in case a majority of the said trustees deem it for the interest and safety of the property so bequeathed to Mary and Julia Wood and with their consent to sell any of the above mentioned trust property and invest it in the bonds of the United States, I understand that in this devise that the said Mary and Julia Wood shall have power to dispose of equal portions of this estate so held for them in trust by will.\u201d\nUnder this trust, the accountants took possession of the property and administered it for many years. Testator\u2019s- daughter, Mary, is now deceased. His daughter, Julia, survives. Upon the audit of the trustees\u2019 account, filed because of the death of Mary, the auditing judge awarded one-half of the trust fund to the legal representatives of Mary\u2019s estate, and the other half to Julia under her petition to have the trust terminated,\nThere are two sets of exceptions filed to the adjudication; the first relates to the trust for Julia Wood, and the second to that for Mary Wood. The first exceptions are dismissed by a divided court, the four judges who heard the argument being equally divided in their opinions, but we all agree that the second exceptions should be dismissed.\nAs to the trust for Julia Wood. The auditing judge has concisely and accurately stated his reasons for finding that the cestui que trust is presently entitled to demand and receive the assets held for her. In addition to what has been said, we add that the principles that should govern this case are well set forth in Rodrigue\u2019s App., 22 W. N. C. 358, where there was a devise of real and personal estate to trustees, who were required to apply all the proceeds and profits thereof to the personal use of the testator\u2019s daughter and to her support and benefit from time to time as she may need and require when by her demanded in writing for herself and her children, but not to be applied or used otherwise. The Supreme Court said\n\u201cBut the trustees have no functions except merely to apply all the proceeds and profits of the estate to the personal use of the appellant as she might require it. There is no limitation over of either the income or principal of the estate to any person. There are no other estates or interests to be preserved. It is not a spendthrift trust. It was not a trust for protection during coverture, as the appellant was a widow and not in contemplation of marriage. No ultimate purpose of any kind requiring the continuance of the trust is expressed in the will, or can be implied from its terms except the mere payment of the income to the cestui que trust.\u201d\nRodrigue\u2019s Estate has been followed in Marshall\u2019s Est., 30 W. N. C. 228; Audenried\u2019s Est., 4 D. R. 507; Keyser\u2019s Est., 6 D. R. 181.\nIt is not sufficient to show that the trust according to its terms is active. There must be something else to support the trust, and this is sufficient to distinguish the cases cited to support the contrary opinion. In Hemphill\u2019s Est., 180 Pa. 87; in Eshbach\u2019s Est., 197 Pa. 153; and in Mooney\u2019s Est., 205 Pa. 418, there were remainder interests to be protected. In Shower\u2019s Est., 211 Pa. 297, the Supreme Court pointed out the purpose of the testator that the income should not be liable for the debts of the beneficiaries or subject to anticipation by them. Spring\u2019s Est., 216 Pa. 529, appears to have been decided on the discretionary powers vested in the trustee. '\nThe principle that underlies this case is clearly that of Culbertson\u2019s App., 76 Pa. 145, holding that where all-parties in interest are sui juris, the trust may be ended by their agreement and that Julia Wood is the only party in interest under this will is perfectly clear. The principle of Culbertson\u2019s Estate has been recently affirmed in Stafford\u2019s Est., 258 Pa. 595, where Mr. Justice Moschzisker reviewed the authorities. As therefore Julia Wood is the only person having any^interest in the trust, we are of opinion that she is entitled to terminate the trust and receive it in her own right.\nAs to the trust for Mary Wood, who is now deceased. As we have stated, we are fill of opinion that the award to her personal representatives was correct: Millard\u2019s App., 87 Pa. 457. She was the only person interested, and the mere fact that she was given the power to dispose of the estate by wall is an affirmance of the testator\u2019s intent that she should have control of the estate rather than a restriction upon her interest in it: Shall-cross\u2019s Est., 13 Philadelphia 374.\nThe court dismissed the exceptions. George Wood, trustee, and E. Francis Wood, substituted trustee, appealed.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing the exceptions.\nJames Wilson Bayard, of Prichard, Sanl, Bayard cf-Evans, for appellants.\nOwen J. Roberts, of Roberts, Montgomery & McEeehan, with him Oonlen, Brinton & Acker, for administrators of estate of Mary Wood, deceased.\nW. W. Montgomery, Jr., filed a paper book for Jnlia Wood, appellee.\nJune 3, 1918:"
