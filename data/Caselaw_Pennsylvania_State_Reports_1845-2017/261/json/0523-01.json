L. 1314, Section 8.\nArgued May 6, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 92, Jan. T., 1918, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. Potter Co., Sept. T., 1917, No. 1, in equity, dismissing bill in equity for specific performance in case of Y. & S. Bottle Company v. Mountain t\u00edas Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for specific performance of contract to supply gas and for an injunction. Before Heck, P.

Plaintiff brought this bill in equity to compel the specific performance of its contract of October 30, 1913.\nThe lower court found' that the agreement in question gave, the plaintiff company special privileges forbidden by Section 8, sub-division A and B of the Public Service Act of July 26,1913, P. L. 1374, and that such agreement was rendered inoperative from the time the said act went into effect January 1, 1914, and dismissed the bill.
