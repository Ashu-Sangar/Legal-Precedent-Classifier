    <p class="summary" id="AZBS" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[178,1225,1159,1189]],["BL_232.1",232,[281,352,1147,1289]]]'>There seems to be in this bill no express averment of notice of the alleged agreement or restriction to defendant or any of its predecessors in title under Dunn,— nothing to suggest such notice beyond what may be argued to have been conveyed to them by the facts that the houses already spoken of and several others occupying the remainder of the original tract north of the Dunn property stood a uniform distance back of the city building line and that the first one was built with a party wall on the north side. Neither of these circumstances, however, can be regarded as conclusive in the sense above pointed out. It is virtually decided by Judge King in Scott v. Burton, 2 Ashm. 312, 329-30, that the mere location of the houses is not ordinarily notice to a purchaser of any restrictive agreement such as is here contended for; and the same doctrine may fairly be gathered from Haverstock v. Sipe, <a href="/pa/33/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="33 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="988395" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0368-01">33 Pa. 368</a>, 371; Keats v. Hugo, <a href="/mass/115/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="115 Mass. 204" data-case-ids="717907" data-case-paths="/mass/115/0204-01">115 Mass. 204</a>. As ordinarily, so in the present instance, that location, so far as regards anything to be indicated by it, may have been a mere matter of neighborly accommodation, of personal convenience, of individual taste, without any contractual basis or possibly of an agree<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>ment intended to hold only the immediate parties to it. On the other hand, the existence of the party wall, apparently unused by the adjoiner, affords no reason for believing that the latter might not build out further,— no more than for treating it as evidencing an agreement not to build higher. The object in putting it up may well have been simply to serve the then present convenience of the first builder, and perhaps the supposed future convenience of the adjoiner as far as the wall went. Besides, its erection being the act of one party, not followed by any act of the other making it Ms also, it can hardly be deemed evidence or notice of an agreement between them. To both of the matters in question, the rule appears applicable that a fact or facts equally consistent with two contrary inferences cannot be accepted as the sole basis for either: Breuckmann v. Twibill, <a href="/pa/89/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="89 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="1063216" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0058-01">89 Pa. 58</a>, 59; Mead v. Conroe, <a href="/pa/113/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="113 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="457619" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0220-01">113 Pa. 220</a>, 228; Alexander v. Penna. Water Co., <a href="/pa/201/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="201 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="925690" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0252-01">201 Pa. 252</a>, 256. If the facts averred clearly involved the inference of notice of a restrictive agreement designed to be perpetual, there would be no need for an express allegation of such notice. But in view of their inconclusiveness, the allegation is essential to the completeness of the bill, and it lacks ground for demurrer under the authorities above cited. &lt;</p>
