Where a eotenant sets up adverse possession against another cotenant, he must show distinct notice of his changed attitude concerning his occupancy to the other eotenant followed by twenty-one years of actual, hostile possession.

In an action of ejectment where plaintiffs were entitled to the property claimed by adverse possession, if defendant had not obtained title by possession adverse to plaintiffs, it was admitted that plaintiffs and those under whom they claimed had been in possession from 1868 until 1888 when defendants went into possession. Plaintiffs offered evidence to prove that their possession continued thereafter for a sufficient time to give them title. It appeared that defendant was in possession from the time of his entry for more than twenty-one years, but plaintiffs contended that his <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>possession was not adverse to theirs. It also appeared that plaintiffs and certain others held as cotenants, that defendant had married one of the cotenants, and plaintiffs contended that the defendant entered on the premises in right of his wife as a tenant in common, not in his own right. Defendant contended that he entered in his own right and that plaintiffs had notice that he claimed in his own right. The evidence was conflicting and the trial judge submitted the case to the jury who found a verdict for plaintiffs upon which judgment was entered; Held&gt; no error. ¡</p>

His widow and some of his children continued their residence on the property until the widow’s death, in 1901.

Dougher went upon the land in 1888, and he claimed he had since had adverse possession thereof. However, as he was, at the time of such entry, married to Catherine Dougherty, it became a question of fact whether he entered by virtue of her tenancy in common with her brother and sisters, or adversely to them. Of course, if his entry on the premises was in his wife’s <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>right as tenant in common he could not gain title by adverse possession without first giving distinct notice to the other heirs of his changed attitude concerning his occupancy, and that thenceforth he would claim possession in his own right; and then it was incumbent on him to show actual, hostile possession for twenty-one years following such notice: Cannon v.

Dougher, etc. All such complaints — and they are the principal ones urged — we think are in disregard of the well established rules, (1) that the possession of one tenant in common inures to the benefit of all ■of them, and (2) the one we have adverted to — that when one such tenant sets up adverse possession against his cotenants he must show that at the inception of such claim he gave them clear notice thereof. We did not, however, confine the jury to this view of the case, but distinctly instructed them that if Dougher entered under a claim for himself, in hostility to the heirs, he interrupted the continuity of their possession, preventing a recovery by them; and that if Dougher entered adversely the question of tenancy in common had nothing to do with his rights.</p>

After some argument an agreement was placed of record eliminating the Loftus defendants, whereupon the objection was overruled. No other objection was interposed nor was there afterwards, by reason of developments of the trial, any motion to strike out Mrs. Heap’s testimony.
