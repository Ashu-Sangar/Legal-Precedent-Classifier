The auditing judge has concisely and accurately stated his reasons for finding that the cestui que trust is presently entitled to demand and receive the assets held for her. In addition to what has been said, we add that the principles that should govern this case are well set forth in Rodrigue’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=22%20W.N.C.%20358" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="22 W.N.C. 358">22 W.

The Supreme Court said</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b520-6" data-blocks='[["BL_520.6",520,[279,1486,1146,640]]]'>“But the trustees have no functions except merely to apply all the proceeds and profits of the estate to the personal use of the appellant as she might require it. There is no limitation over of either the income or principal of the estate to any person. There are no other estates or interests to be preserved. It is not a spendthrift trust. It was not a trust for protection during coverture, as the appellant was a widow and not in contemplation of marriage. No ultimate purpose of any kind requiring the continuance of the trust is expressed in the will, or can be implied from its terms except the mere payment of the income to the cestui que trust.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[201,893,1152,588]]]'>The principle that underlies this case is clearly that of Culbertson’s App., <a href="/pa/76/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="76 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1038895" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0145-01">76 Pa. 145</a>, holding that where all-parties in interest are sui juris, the trust may be ended by their agreement and that Julia Wood is the only party in interest under this will is perfectly clear. The principle of Culbertson’s Estate has been recently affirmed in Stafford’s Est., <a href="/pa/258/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="258 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="1035063" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0595-01">258 Pa. 595</a>, where Mr. Justice Moschzisker reviewed the authorities. As therefore Julia Wood is the only person having any^interest in the trust, we are of opinion that she is entitled to terminate the trust and receive it in her own right.</p>

She was the only person interested, and the mere fact that she was given the power to dispose of the estate by wall is an affirmance of the testator’s intent that she should have control of the estate rather than a restriction upon her interest in it: Shall-cross’s Est., 13 Philadelphia 374.</p>
