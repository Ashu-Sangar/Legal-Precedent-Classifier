It appears that the party of the first part to the contract having developed a considerable quantity of gas in what is known as the Beaver Meadow district and already having large quantities of gas from other sources, was willing to sell to the second party such gas from the Beaver Meadow district as they did not desire for use to supply their customers or for the drillings of wells, and the second party was anxious to purchase the gas.</p>
