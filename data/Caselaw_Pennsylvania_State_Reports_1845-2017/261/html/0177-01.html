    <p class="summary" id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.9",216,[250,794,1153,587]]]'>This case comes before us on a rule on the defendant to show cause why judgment should not be entered in favor of the plaintiff, notwithstanding the affidavit of defense to- a portion of the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff maintains a branch' office and warehouse at Shenandoah in this county for the carrying on of its business in that vicinity and the defendant, George D. Young, was employed by it and acted as salesman and collector for it at ■the said place. Acting in such capacity, the affidavit of defense admits that the defendant received...... amounts of money from certain customers......</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b216-9" data-blocks='[["BL_216.10",216,[254,1392,1146,699]]]'>He claims, however, that he should not be charged with these amounts by reason of the fact that he paid them to the plaintiff by applying them to other accounts, that is, the credits were given to people other, than those who actually paid the amounts. Where he received the authority to do this, or whether or not it was done with the knowledge of the plaintiff or the parties whose money was so credited, does not appear in the affidavit of defense. We do not see by what right this defendant collected the money from one man and credited it on the account of another, and we do not feel that this would be a valid defense in the trial of the case. We, therefore, grant judgment for this amount, $2,805.97.</p>

The affidavit of defense replying thereto sets forth that the defendant was under the orders and direction of F. D. Watts, assistant manager for eastern Pennsylvania, Philadelphia branch of the plaintiff company, and that the said F. D. Watts would call on defendant for money and insist on having advances without delay. Whereupon, the deponent would make sales of flour to different customers and others to realize money quickly and in order to do so and to induce immediate purchases so as to provide for the demands of the said F. I). Watts, defendant sold, to the different persons named, flour at less than the prevailing or market price, but, on the books of the company, the persons purchasing at reduced price were charged the prevailing or market price of flour and this course of dealing was carried on for a considerable time and in that way balances against the customers, being the' difference between what they actually paid for the flour and the market price, increased from time to time; and alleges that all moneys received from the customers at less than market price were paid by the defendant to the milling company from time to time and that the balances against such customers, as appear in the fourth paragraph hereinabove set forth, defendant never received and was not and is not personally responsible to the company for the amounts.</p>
