All gasoline shall be conveyed to building by a return drain pump.” The rider also provided that not more than one auto should be kept on the premises.

M. Manheimer. This hotel was located upon a forty-acre tract of land; and, 400 feet distant from the site of the. in'sured building, there was a barn, where Bone <em>&amp; </em>Manheimer kept two automobiles, employed in the conduct of their business; a gasoline tank, with a capacity, of 400 gallons, was located about midway between the barn and hotel; gasoline therefrom was used to supply these automobiles, and, from time to time, small quantities were taken to the hotel building; but neither the location of the tank nor this use of its contents was in any way connected with the fire which caused the loss. Several judgments were entered against plaintiff, and, August 9, 1915, executions were placed in the hands of the sheriff, who, August 10, 1915, levied upon the insured premises and personal property; within a few hours thereafter, a fire was discovered in the linen closet on the third floor of the hotel,- which resulted in the destruction of the building and part of its furnishings.</p>

All gasoline shall be conveyed to building by means of a return draining pump.” Defendant contends the provision just quoted was violated by “keeping more than 100 gallons of gasoline in a tank, <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>above ground, located 200 feet from tbe insured building.”</p>

Cases might be multiplied in favor of the construction that [the term] ‘premises/ as used in the policy, does not include the land included in the farm upon which the hotel stood. ......To adopt the contention of......defendant that the automobiles and gasoline tank......were on the ‘[insured] premises/ would be to hold that any point on the forty-acre farm operated with the hotel would be on the ‘premises/ within the meaning of the policy....... If the insurance company intended the ‘premises’ to include a distance of 200 to 400 feet from the hotel, it could very easily have said so, and very likely would have done so.......The fact that the stipulations concerning the tank and automobiles appear in the rider, which is a printed form intended for ‘dwelling and barn/ and so specifies, accounts in our judgment for the stipulation as to automobiles; naturally, an automobile would be stored or kept in or about a barn, and not......in or about an hotel.”</p>

The fact found by the jury, that at least one of plaintiff’s tenants continued in possession of the insured property after the sheriff came upon the premises, subject, of course, to the latter’s levy, prevents the application of ■the provision of the contract, as to change of possession, sought to be enforced by defendant. Then, again, a fieri facias is not such a writ as, ex necessitate, would immediately oust the tenants from their possession or right of possession.

In disposing of this complaint, the court below states: “Our reply......does not depend upon any refined reasoning as to whether, under the terms of the policy, the market value of the property insured has any relation to the amount of the insurance company’s liability; it would rather depend on whether the plaintiff had not <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>made......[such, value relevant] by introducing it into the case. Suppose plaintiff' had relied entirely upon proof of market value, and offered no evidence as to cost of reproducing the hotel, it certainly would not be contended that defendant could not accept the issue of value......relied upon.......Plaintiff having relied upon two measures of value as fixing defendant’s liability, defendant could meet the case presented only by offering like evidence; hence, in our opinion, defendant was entitled to prove market value: see Morris v. Travis, 7 S. &amp; R. 220 [223].......The evidence tendered by plaintiff was as to offers he had had for the insured property ......, but the effect was to prove market value. We are also of opinion, the bona fides of such offers-being a proper inquiry for the jury, that defendant’s evidence as to......value would assist the jury in determining whether to believe such offers [to buy actually] had been made, and; if so; whether they were in good faith.” See Hamilton v. Hastings, <a href="/pa/172/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="172 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="874092" data-case-paths="/pa/172/0308-01">172 Pa. 308</a>, 317 ; and opinion by Rice, P.
