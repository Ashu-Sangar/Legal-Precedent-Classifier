On the hearing of a compensation claim for death of claimant’s husband it appeared that deceased was a wool sorter in the employ of defendant, and that he died of external anthrax, a disease carried by sheep; that deceased when he left defendant’s plant in the afternoon had a small scratch or abrasion on his neck, although he had no such mark when he left for work in the morning; and that this was the beginning of external anthrax from which he died within three days. The findings showed that professional medical experts testified that if deceased had no marks on his neck on the <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>day in question and sustained an abrasion and the neck immediately began to swell and external anthrax developed, this condition was probably brought' about by the anthrax germ entering through the abrasion. <em>Held, </em>in view oí the character of the employment of the deceased, the findings by the referee to the effect that the scratch upon the neck of deceased occurred during the course of his employment and at. that time the anthrax germ entered his body, causing his death, justified the conclusion that he died as the result of an injury by an accident while acting in the course of his employment, and the claimant was entitled to compensation.</p>

In other words, the defendant employer does not controvert, as matter of fact, that McCauley’s death was due to the cause set up by claimant, but denies there is any legal proof to show •that this causal event, which is alleged as an accident, happened while deceased was engaged in the course of his employment. This contention raises a question of law, which the board had power to determine under section 420, upon a consideration of the legal adequacy of the testimony taken before the referee; had the attack been simply upon the ground that the testimony was insufficient in fact to justify the latter’s findings, and not that there was no legal evidence whatever to warrant them, a question of fact, not of law, would have been raised; and, under section 421, the board would have been obliged either to sustain the referee or grant a new hearing.</p>
