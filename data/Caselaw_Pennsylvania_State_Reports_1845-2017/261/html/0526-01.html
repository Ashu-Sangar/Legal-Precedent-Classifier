The contract contains a provision that at the expiration of the term the customer shall have the privilege of renewal at the same rate for a further period of five years by giving thirty days’ notice in writing of such renewal. Sometime after the contract had been entered into, although the exact date is not given, the defendant took over the property of the South Side Electric &amp; Manufactnring Company and thereafter operated the same and furnished current under the terms and conditions of the contract. On August 13, 1917, the plaintiff, having received notice from the defendant that the contract would be terminated at the expiration of the term on October 13th, notified the defendant in writing that the privilege of renewal was thereby exercised and the contract would be extended for a further period of five years.- The defendant replied that a renewal could not be accepted, because neither the form nor the rate of the old contract were in use and, moreover, the <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>Public Service Company Law required electric companies to furnish all service upon uniform and standard prices and terms. Some further negotiations ensued, when finally the defendant, on September 29th, notified the plaintiff that it would not continue to supply service, of current after October 15th under the terms of the old contract. The plaintiff’s bill was thereupon filed ashing for a preliminary injunction, to be afterwards made final, restraining the defendant from terminating or attempting to terminate the' contract by shutting off the current or doing anything to interfere with the successful operation of the plaintiff’s plant by the use of electricity which the- defendant had agreed to furnish and had theretofore been furnishing. No preliminary injunction issued, the parties having reached an amicable basis of adjustment pending final disposition of the case. The defendant stood ready at all times to furnish the plaintiff with service according to the regular rates as set forth in its posted and published tariffs, which rates it was maintained were fair, just and reasonable.</p>
