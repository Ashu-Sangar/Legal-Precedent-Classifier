On appeal from a judgment on a verdict for plaintiff in an action brought by a husband on the insurance policy of his deceased wife, there was no dispute about the fact of the death of the insured or that satisfactory proofs of death had been furnished; but defendant alleged false representations in the application for the policy by the plaintiff and his wife as to the physical condition of the wife and the fraudulent substitution of another woman in good health for the plaintiff’s wife at the examination made by the defendant’s medical -examiner. A witness testified that he knew the plaintiff’s .wife and saw her undergo examination by the insurance company’s physician. In an affidavit filed by the defendant in support of a motion for a new trial, the witness stated that his testimony in regard to tho examination of deceased was false, and, at a hearing for the purpose of taking depositions, the witness admitted that he stated what was averred in the affidavit, but swore that all his evidence at the trial was true and correct; the evidence of the witness was cumulative and the lower court refused a new trial. <em>Reid, </em>that the lower court had not abused its . discretion.</p>

It was alleged in an affidavit filed by defendant, in support of a motion for a new trial, that, after verdict, this witness had stated his testimony in regard to the examination of deceased was false. A hearing was fixed to take depositions, and Glinsky, while he admitted having stated what was averred in the affidavit, swore all his evidence at the trial was correct and true. We agree with the court below that the man under discussion is “nota very reliable person” <em>; </em>and, considering the trial judge’s belief that “Glinsky was an important witness for the plaintiff,” that tribunal might well have refused to enter judgment on the verdict. However, in view of the fa'ct that the testimony in question is merely cumulative, we are disinclined to hold the refusal of a new trial an abuse of discretion constituting reversible error. The first assignment is overruled.</p>

Have you, so far as you know, ever had any serious illness or disease? A. No.” If believed,' the evidence produced by defendant, professional and otherwise, shows rather conclusively that, when these <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>answers were made, Mrs. Suravitz was, and for some time liad been, suffering from a pronounced form of heart disease, and plaintiff admits that his wife had, a short while previous to the examination, been ill in the hospital with pneumonia; but plaintiff contends, as he did in. his statement of claim and at trial, that, at the time the application was filled out, Mrs. Suravitz was unable to speak, understand, read or write the English language, that his own knowledge thereof was very limited, that he acted as interpreter, that the agent of the insurance company wrote down the answers, and, finally, that, in so doing, the latter “falsely, fraudulently, negligently, mistakenly and carelessly” inscribed answers other than those dictated to him. Por example, plaintiff denies his wife answered “Yes” to the first and “No” to the second of the above recited questions.; to the first, he avers “Mary Suravitz made answer that, in so far as she knew, she was in good health, or words to that effect,” and to the second, “she replied she had not any serious illness that she knew of, [but] that in 1908 she was ill and was in Lackawanna State Hospital [with] what doctors told her was a severe cold, but she understood that she was cured and better.” The defendant, in its pleadings and at trial, denied all allegations of fraud or mistake, on the part of its agent, In connection with the application or otherwise.</p>

As already shown, plaintiff undertook to an<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>swer this defense in part by proof of certain facts tending to show that defendant’s agent mistakenly, fraudulentty and incorrectly filled in the blank application. When plaintiff stood upon this reply, owing to its nature (as involving fraud and, in effect, an attempt to change an integral part of the contract in suit), the burden was upon him to sustain it, not only by preponderating evidence, but by preponderating evidence of a cértain kind, character or quality, which is not over-stated by the phrase “clear and satisfactory evidence”: See opinion by Mr. Justice Walling in Pusic v. Salak, handed down simultaneously herewith.</p>

Answer: This is affirmed, In other words, we say to you, in connection with affirming this point, that, the plaintiff alleging that the answers in these two applications are not correctly written down, the burden is upon the plaintiff to establish that fact by the fair preponderance of the testimony, or weight, as we call it. ■ That is stated in this point and we affirm it.” Thus it will be seen that, while the above request has to do with the quality of evidence required for the purpose therein stated, the answer departs from that field and deals with the subject of the ultimate weight of the evidence, not its kind or character. Not only is the answer guilty of this material departure, but it informs the jury in unmistakable language that the request was in<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>tended to cover the subject of the weight of the evidence, which, as just pointed out, it was not.</p>

On the contrary, the answer, as phrased, practically nullified the whole purpose of the request as drawn; while in form an affirmance, in substance and effect it was almost tantamount to a denial thereof. To say the least, the answer was not responsive to the request (Waynesboro M. F. I. Co. v. Creaton, <a href="/pa/98/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="98 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="496911" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0451-01">98 Pa. 451</a>, 453); and, in a case such as the one before us, this was harmful error; therefore, the second assignment is sustained.</p>

Here, however, it is not contended either that Mary Suravitz was not the person who died or was not the person insured, but that, when the medical examination was made, plaintiff deliberately substituted another woman in her place. This is an affirmative defense of’fraud upon the insurance company,. involving the allegation of- the existence of specific facts, which defendant assumed the burden-of proving by a preponderance of clear and satisfactory evidence.</p>

When the proofs are all in, and the case is ripe for determination, it becomes a matter of weighing the evidence; and this is for the jury, under proper instructions. If there is a conflict on a material matter of fact, and it be decided that the preponderance of the evidence does not lie with the party who alleged the affirmative, then the burden of proof has not been sustained by such party, and, in the performance of its duty, the jury must find against him.</p>

On the other hand, if the proof of impersonation is insufficient in character, or does not carry conviction, then there is no shifting of the burden, in any sense of that term; for a failure to sustain'the burden originally assumed results, and the finding on the point involved should be against defendant. Finally, should the jury find the evidence in equilibrium, its decision ought to be against defendant; for, again, the latter has not sustained the burden of proof (Burford v.

Since defendant stood upon an allegation of fraud, as already pointed out in our consideration of the second assignment, the court might properly have gone further and instructed that the burden was upon it to sustain this charge, not only by a preponderance of evidence, but by evidence “clear and satisfactory” in character.</p>

As the case was tried, the Superior Court held the court below had not erred in telling the jury plaintiff was “bound to show that the man who was examined was the man insured”; but, in connection with this ruling, Rice, P. J., correctly states the general rules on the burden of proof as we have given them above: “When the evidence is all in, and the case is submitted for determination, there can obviously no longer be any question as to the burden of proof, so far as that term is concerned with the order or production of evidence: 5 Am. &amp; Eng.

If at this stage there be conflicting evidence as to an essential matter- of fact in issue, and, in ■ the judgment of the jury, the preponderance is not in favor of the party who alleged the affirmative, they ought to decide that question of fact against him, and it is the duty of the court to so instruct them, if requested.”</p>

    <p id="b443-4" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[177,1354,1152,959]]]'>The sixth assignment complains because the trial judge failed to read and affirm the following request for charge: “Statements of lay witnesses that they knew the insured and that she was apparently in good health, are insufficient to discredit the positive statements of physicians who had treated her for heart disease.” The failure to read and affirm this point might have been error, had it been preceded by some explanatory words, for example, “When the jury consider the question whether or not, at the time of her examination for the insurance, Mrs. Suravitz was suffering from heart disease, I instruct you that,” or “When the jury come to consider the actual condition of health of Mrs. Suravitz, etc.”; but, since the request lacked such essential explanatory words, the court below cannot be held to have erred in failing to affirm it, as drawn. Under the circumstances, we see no merit in the present assignment; it is overruled.</p>

A. McGrinty given at a former trial of this case.” At the trial now under review, this doctor testified that, in 1908, prior to the issuance of the insurance, he told plaintiff the latter’s Atúfe had heart disease. After this testimony was in, counsel for plaintiff asked the witness, “You recall, notv, don’t you, that your testimony today is different from tvhat it tvas at the last trial?” The question was not ansAvered. Counsel then asked if, at the prior trial, the witness had not said, “I simply told him [plaintiff] his wife was very sick and she ought to go to the hospital.” The answer was “Yes”; whereupon counsel for defendant (referring to what occurred at the prior trial, and, apparently, reading from the record thereof) said, “I desire to call the attention of the witness to the next question following the one to which his attention was called,......the question being as follows : ‘What else did you tell him?......Do you remember telling him [the husband] in that conversation what the nature of the trouble Avas?’ [referring to t¿e wife’s ailment].” Counsel for plaintiff immediately objected to these offers of what had occurred at the other trial. After some colloquy, the witness was asked by counsel for defendant, “Was that question asked [at the last trial], and you did not answer, it because of objection and the ruling of the court?” This was .objected to, and the trial judge said, “The record shows that”; whereupon the examination closed. Later, counsel for defendant offered in evidence the record of the former trial, directing attention to particular pages covering the part of the examination of Dr. McGinty which he had attempted to get in evidence when that witness was upon the stand in the present trial, and expressly stating that the offer was made to show the jury the testimony of the witness at the two trials was not inconsistent, and that the latter had not been permitted at the former trial to testify t9 the fact that he had told plaintiff “the nature of the trouble [i. e., heart disease],” from which his wife was suffer<a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>ing.

By tbe ruling complained of, tbe credibility of this most material witness, whose testimony bore either directly or indirectly upon all tbe controlling issues in tbe case, was in effect laid open to substantial attack. In aggravation of this error, it appears that plaintiff, after introducing tbe oral proofs already referred to, was permitted to place in evidence tbe part of tbe record of tbe former trial depended upon by him, showing Dr. McGinty’s testimony as to what be told Mr. Suravitz concerning bis Avife’s health, notwithstanding this was objected to by defendant on the ground that tbe offer did not include tbe question which was asked at that time by tbe latter’s counsel and excluded, as to what else tbe doctor bad told plaintiff about Mrs. Suravitz’s health; under tbe circumstances, tbe one part of tbe record should not have been <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>admitted without the other.

When the suit was here on á former appeal, we stated, “This is clearly a case for the jury”; after reading the four hundred pages of testimony, etc., submitted at the trial now under review, and considering the able argument of counsel on both sides, we see no reason to change the opinion then expressed. The evidence shows defendant has ample grounds for gravely suspecting the good faith of plaintiff’s case; but, technically, it is one for a jury to pass upon. At the same time, it must be kept in mind the defense rests on allegations of fraud, and the insurance comphny depends largely upon circumstantial evidence, or the proof of facts from which inferences must be drawn, to relieve it from liability. Fraud may be established in this manner, when the evidence of the facts relied on for the purpose is “clear and satisfactory,” if the latter “naturally, logically and clearly indicate its existence” (10 R. C. L. 1004) ; but, when one is carrying the burden of such a defense, he should have full opportunity to present it, and is entitled to the protection of every legal right, be it technical or otherwise, so that, in the end, the issues involved may go to the jury on relevant and competent evidence, under proper instructions. In order to secure such rights to the present defendant, we have been obliged to sustain the second and seventh assignments of error; but, for the reason indicated earlier in this paragraph, the two assignments under immediate consideration are overruled.</p>
