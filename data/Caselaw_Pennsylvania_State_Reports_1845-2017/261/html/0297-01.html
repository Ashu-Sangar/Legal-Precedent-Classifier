To this rule an answer was filed alleging, inter alia, that the notice of filing was served on the defendant on July 16,1913, and sworn return of said notice was filed in the office of the prothonotary on July 18, 1913, and that the date of filing of said return of service appearing thereon, namely August 18, 1913, was mistakenly or erroneously placed thereon by the prothonotary. Upon this rule and answer depositions were taken during which the testimony of the prothonotary, R. J. Graeff (the attorney who filed the return of service of the no<a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>tice) and two experts were taken. The filing endorsed on the return of service was made by rubber stamp with movable date, and it is claimed that in the use of this stamp the word “August” slipped around and was imprinted on the paper where it should have been “July,” making the date of filing read August 18th instead of July 18th. The prothonotary testified that it is his belief that this occurred, and that the date of filing is erroneous. The attorney testifies that he placed the return of service in an envelope addressed to the prothonotary, which was mailed by himself, or under his direction, on the 17th of July. The return was not accompanied by any letter. It is manifestly impossible that any one could testify absolutely that the date was an error, because had the error been discovered, it would have, in all probability, been corrected. The expert called in behalf of the plaintiff testifies that the person using the stamp exerted the greatest pressure on the top thereof and that he is of the opinion that this pressure resulted in the gradual drawing of the word “Aug.” into' the face of the stamp and testifies to some measurements that he made relevant thereto'.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[179,1550,1155,851]],["BL_338.1",338,[263,346,1144,414]]]'>An investigation of this matter disclosed that there were three writs filed in- the prothonotary’s office, Nos. 10,11 and 12, September Term, 1913, which were marked filed with the same stamp, August 18,1913, and that this filing is a mistake. It is admitted that the date should have been July 18,1913. An inspection of the stamps on these three writs, together with the impression upon the writ involved in the case at bar, discloses the fact that the word “August” and the figure “1” is not in alignment with the rest of the stamp, being considerably below the line. It seems to us very persuasive evidence that these impressions were made at the same time, as it would be almost impossible that this month and figure should be out of alignment in almost exactly the same way one month later as it was on the date the impression was made on the first three writs. It is contended that the <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>evidence in the case should be at least clear, precise and indubitable, as its purpose is to reform a written instrument. We cannot agree with this contention. This is not a case in which a written instrument is sought to be reformed, but a case in which the court is asked to reform the date of filing of a record to conform to the truth, and it seems to us the measure of proof is quite different.</p>

C. 14</a>, it is said: “The question is only as to the power of the court to amend its records. Of this there can be no doubt, and as it is quite clear from the record that a judgment was rendered which the clerk neglected to enter upon the appearance docket, it is a proper case for the exercise of amendment.” In Sheip &amp; Co. v. Price, Page &amp; Co., 3 Superior Ct. 1, it is said: “Every court of record is the guardian and judge of its own records. It is clothed with full power to control and inquire into them, and to set them right if incorrect. It is much to be deplored that in interlineation, an alteration, or an erasure should ever appear upon a judicial record, but it would be intolerable to hold that a party in no way responsible for the keeping of the records must explain it or be deprived of the rights which the record was intended to give him.”</p>
