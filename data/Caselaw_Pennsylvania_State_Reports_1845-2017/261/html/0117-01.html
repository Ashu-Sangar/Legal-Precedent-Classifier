L. Benedict during the term of his natural life; and, at his death, to pay the principal of said trust fund......to such person or persons or objects as the party of the first part [the settlor] may ap<a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>point by any last will and testament which he may leave at the time of his death. In case he shall leave no snch will, then one-third thereof to his widow, and the remaining two-thirds, or, in case he shall leave no widow, the whole, in equal shares, to such children of the party of the first part as may be living at the time of his death. In case any child or children shall die during the lifetime of the said J. L. Benedict, leaving children to survive who shall be living at the death of the said J. L. Benedict, such children of such deceased child or children shall take their parent’s share. In case the said J. L. Benedict shall leave no- children or issue of such children living to survive him, then the share or part of said trust fund that would go as aforesaid to such children shall be paid to the next of kin.”</p>

June 15, 1917, he executed and delivered to plaintiff a judgment note for $2,500, the debt for which this was given having been contracted after March 24,1915. August 14,1917, judgment was entered on the note, and, on the same day, execution issued against the trust company, as garnishee, attaching any property in its hands belonging to the settlor. In due course, the court below held that the so-called “trust fund” was liable for plaintiff’s claim, and defendants have appealed.</p>

Egbert v. DeSolms is sufficiently distinguished in Rienzi v.

There, as here, the deed, by its terms, is irrevocable, and, at the time of the execution thereof, the indebtedness in controversy had not arisen, nor was it in contemplation; finally; in both instances, at the creation of the trust, the settlor had several children living. In the present case, after reserving an absolute and unrestricted power of appointment in himself, the settlor provides that, upon default of its exercise, the fund in question shall go to his widow and children, or the latter’s issue, in certain proportions, these being in accordance with the shares they would take under the intestate laws, or, if no widow, children or issue, then to his' next of kin.. In Nolan v. Nolan, after reserving a like power of appointment, the settlor provided that, upon default in its exercise, the fund should go to her next of kin. While the phraseology is different, it will be observed that, so far as the question here involved is concerned, both of these provisions are, in effect, the same.</p>
