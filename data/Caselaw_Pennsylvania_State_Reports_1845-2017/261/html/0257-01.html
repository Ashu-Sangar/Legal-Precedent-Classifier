In a, suit on a judgment obtained in New York, in an action instituted by a wife to recover the cost of necessaries purchased by her for herself and children and paid for out of her earnings, it appeared from the affidavit of defense that, in the action on which the judgment was entered, defendant had alleged that his wife had caused his arrest in Schuylkill County, Pa., for desertion and nonsupport, and that the court, after hearing, had made an order on defendant for the payment of $20 per month, but had subsequently revoked its order, that the case was tried before a jury and a verdict for plaintiff was rendered upon which the judgment on which the action was brought was entered. The lower court entered judgment for plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit, of defense. <em>Held, </em>that while the judgment of the court of Schuylkill County in revoking its earlier order was conclusive of the right of the wife to support in desertion proceedings at that time, it was not conclusive of her right at a different time upon a different state of facts' to support, or conclusive of her right to recover in an action of assumpsit for money paid for necessaries; and that as the previous judgment of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Schuylkill County had been interposed as a defense to the proceedings in New York <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>and determined adversely to the defendant, that judgment was conclusive'of the defendant’s right to interpose such defense to an action on the judgment, and the judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense was affirmed.</p>

The answer averred plaintiff deserted defendant and, on February 1,1912, caused his arrest in Schuylkill <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>County, Pennsylvania, on a charge of desertion and nonsupport and that the court of that county, after hearing, found plaintiff was not entitled to support and'maintenance because of misconduct and dismissed her complaint. The case was tried before a jury and a verdict for $3,170 and costs rendered in favor of plaintiff, on which judgment was entered and subsequently assigned to William L. Hunt, the use-plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[163,802,1160,1081]]]'>Defendant contends the judgment obtained in New York is not conclusive because that court was without jurisdiction as the rights of the parties were determined by the courts of Pennsylvania previous to the institution of the New York action. In the desertion proceeding in Schuylkill County the court made an order directing defendant to pay for the support of his wife the sum of $20 a month. This order, however, was revoked in 1914. In the meantime the sum of $330 had been paid the wife under the order, for which sum an allowance was made against plaintiff’s claim. The affidavit of defense in the present case recited the proceeding in Schuylkill County, the making of the order for payment of $20 a month and its subsequent revocation and averred the action of the court was conclusive of the fights of the parties, and, consequently, the New York courts were without jurisdiction of the matter in controversy. On the other hand, plaintiff relies upon the .New York judgment as being conclusive of the matters adjudicated in that jurisdiction.</p>
