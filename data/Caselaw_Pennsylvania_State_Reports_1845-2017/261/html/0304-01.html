    <p class="summary" id="b343-8" data-blocks='[["BL_343.15",343,[164,1716,1151,634]]]'>That the plaintiff insurance company issued a policy of insurance to The Police Beneficiary Association, one of the defendants, in pursuance of an application made therefor, which is attached to the statement of claim; and that Seth H. Whiteley was the agent of the plaintiff company in placing the policy. The statement continues that the premiums were paid and that certain death losses were paid by the plaintiff company to the defendant, The Police Beneficiary Association; but that it is now discovered certain fraudulent statements were made to it, the plaintiff company, at the time the application for insurance was made.</p>

Later and before the receipt of the application he told the president and general agent of the plaintiff company that for a year prior to the time of furnishing said information the total number of deaths occurring among the members of said beneficiary association was sixty-four or an average of about fifteen for each one thousand members of said association. The plaintiff has since learned that during said year the number of deaths had been more than one hundred, being in excess of twenty-five for each one thousand, members of said association, Said Whiteley also told plaintiff that this information was supplied to him by the officers of said Police Beneficiary Association, Inc., and he knew that it was correct because he was the agent who had written for said association the policy which it had in force for some time with the AEtna Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut.”</p>

It is true that Whiteley told the plaintiff that he had received this information from the officers of The Police Beneficiary Association, but no one states that that is true. The plaintiff does not state in his statement of claim that any officer of The Police Beneficiary Association ever said such a thing. It contents itself in saying that Whiteley said so. This, in our judgment, is the fatal error which prevents the plaintiff from recovering on this statement against the defendant, The Police Beneficiary Association, and as they are jointly charged with this wrongdoing, there could be no recovery against either. There is an allegation that Whiteley and the secretary and treasurer of The Police Beneficiary Association conspired together to cheat and defraud the plaintiff; but <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>unless something was done in pursuance of that conspiracy, no right of action accrues.</p>

Within the past few days the plaintiff has learned that neither the Police Beneficiary Association nor its officers have ever paid any such premiums, but that by an arrangement said Sorter and McCay (treasurer and secretary respectively of the said Police Beneficiary Association) had made with said Whiteley they did not intend to pay said premiums. By the terms and conditions of the policy there was to be paid $1,000 to the Police Beneficiary Association (and subsequently this amount was raised to $2,500) upon the death of any member of the said association to the beneficiary of the deceased member of said association, after proper proofs had been furnished. It was understood and stated by the Police Beneficiary Association through its officers and by said Whiteley that members of said association were individually paying their pro rata proportion of the entire premium, and it was supposed that in the event of death the family of the deceased members were to receive the benefits under said policy. Plaintiff now learns for the first time that the individual members did not pay the premiums nor did the association pay it or any part of it, although the said association made proofs of loss and a claim against the plaintiff company whenever a death occurred under the policy. The plaintiff within the •last few days has learned that the payments made by the company for losses incurred under the policy of the Police Beneficiary Association were not paid by the <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>Police Beneficiary Association to the families and relatives or beneficiaries of said deceased members, but nearly the whole of said sum was immediately after its payment by the plaintiff to the Police Beneficiary Association paid by the said association to said Whiteley; that the information furnished to said Whiteley and to the plaintiff as to the deaths occurring or which had occurred, the application for the policy which they made to the company through said Whiteley, the agreement which they now say they made with said Whiteley that he or some one else was to pay the premiums and by which the said Beneficiary Association was permitted to retain and did retain in its treasury only $100 of the death benefit to be paid by the plaintiff was all made as part of a plan and conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff company.</p>

The affidavit further denied that the association through its officers and by Whiteley had stated that the members of <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>the association were individually paying their pro rata proportion- of the entire premium. The affidavit denied any agreement existing with Whiteley except that he was to arrange for the advancement of premium payments for the account of the association, and that the advancements should be paid out of death claims paid by the plaintiff, and it expressly denied that there was any conspiracy or plan to cheat or defraud the plaintiff by Horter, McCay or Whiteley, or any of them. The affidavit further denied that plaintiff has sustained a loss, but on the contrary that plaintiff had made a profit from the transactions totaling $15,264.97.
