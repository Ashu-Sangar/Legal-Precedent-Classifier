The legislature might have entirely abandoned the State policy of exemption, so far as the stockholders of foreign manufacturing companies are concerned, and authorized as<a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>sessments upon resident owners of the shares of such corporations, had it seen fit to do so; but evidently the lawmakers, considering the indirect benefits to be derived, preferred to relinquish the revenue which might be obtained from such taxation. In adopting this course, the legislature no doubt appreciated that, in view of the sole theory upon which a tax on foreign corporate shares, eo nomine, is maintainable (i. e., that, for purposes of the tax, they, in themselves, are a distinct species of property), it could not in any instance attempt an intangible, theoretical division of such shares into two parts, one representing capital invested in manufacturing within our State and the other extra-territorial'assets, and forego the right to tax the first while authorizing an assessment on the second, without thereby admitting the levy on the latter to be an effort to reach property beyond the jurisdiction of the taxing power. In other words, an avowed attempt to assess a tax against only a fraction of each share of the stock ,of a foreign corporation possessed by a resident holder, upon the ground that such undivided portion gains its value from property outside of Pennsylvania, which, for that reason, cannot be taxed by this State or any of its subdivisions, would be utterly inconsistent with the only theory upon which a local assessment on such shares is sustainable, and would, in effect, convert the tax in question from one on shares of stock, eo nomine, to one upon corporate property. All of these good and sufficient reasons for writing the law as we find it, call for due consideration in construing the legislation now before us. Therefore, we cannot agree with appellants’ contention that a desire to avoid double taxation must be accepted as the sole explanation of the exemption clause here in question, nor can we read its language from that standpoint alone; on the contrary, as we have endeavored to show, when the statue was drawn the effective maintenance of an important public policy was involved, and this, no doubt, influenced the phraseology <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>now under discussion. The words of the act must be accepted as written, and, when so read, it is clear that the court below did not err in declaring the shares of stock in controversy wholly exempt from taxation.</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[319,578,1157,1295]]]'>The effect of the exemption in wholly relieving the stock of appellee'from taxation, is by no means unique or unprecedented in the operation of our tax system; as pointed out by counsel for appellee, shareholders of the Pennsylvania Railroad, for example, are relieved from individual taxation on the stock of that company, because the corporation itself pays a state tax on capital. In calculating this latter tax, however, only the assets of the railroad within our borders are considered, and the stockholders go entirely free of either a direct or indirect tax on the Very considerable valpe added to their shares by the extensive extra-territorial possessions of that corporation. In the cáse at bar, while the company involved is a foreign corporation whose Pennsylvania capital stock tax. is comparatively small, yet it has vast assets employed in manufacturing within our State, from which we gain enriching benefits, and this latter fact, for purposes of entitling stockholders to exemption, is treated’ in the statute under consideration as equivalent to the payment of a capital stock tax, hence, as in the example above cited, since there can be no tax of any character, either direct or indirect, on extraterritorial assets, the result is that plaintiff absolutely escapes taxation on his individual shares.</p>

Germania Brewing Co., <a href="/pa/145/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="145 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="825919" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0083-01">145 Pa. 83</a>, where the parts of the Constitution here in question, and their bearing upon exemption provisions ■like those at bar, are ably discussed. As to the indirect classifying effect of these immunity provisions, the selection and classification of subjects for taxation are, gen<a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>erally speaking, exclusively within the control of the legislature, the only restriction being that there must be no discrimination between members of the same class: Com. v. Del. Div. Canal Co., <a href="/pa/123/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="123 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="967114" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0594-01">123 Pa. 594</a>; Com. v. Sharon Coal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=164%20Pa.%20304" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="164 Pa. 304">164 Pa. 304</a>. For purposes of taxation upon shares in the hands of stockholders, the effect of the particular exemption clause now before us is to divide corporations into two distinct groups: (1) Those doing no business, making no official reports, and paying no capital stock tax in Pennsylvania, upon the stock of which resident shareholders must pay a tax; (2) Those which are bona fide engaged in business here, report to the auditor general, and are either liable to a state tax on capital stock or relieved therefrom by the laws of the Commonwealth, the stock of which is exempt in the hands of resident shareholders. When the underlying reasons are kept in mind, as we have endeavored to explain them, it cannot be held that this grouping is unwarranted, and, since there is no want of uniformity within the respective classes, the constitutional validity of the legislation is secure.</p>
    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[160,1500,1152,579]]]'>(c) As to appellants’ last contention: The language employed in the statutory provisions under consideration cannot justifiably be construed to mean that only the stock of corporations either liable to a tax on or exempt as to their entire capital, is to enjoy exemption in the hands of shareholders. The word “entire” does not appear in the act, and we see no warrant for placing it there. Sturges v. Carter, <a href="/us/114/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="114 U.S. 511" data-case-ids="11294978" data-case-paths="/us/114/0511-01">supra,</a> cited by appellants, is not controlling; it involves the construction of an Ohio statute which is essentially different from the one under discussion.</p>
    <p id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[158,2100,1150,316]],["BL_88.1",88,[274,341,1149,1241]]]'>Another aspect of the case may be noticed. Appellants argue that, under a literal reading, the words of the Act of 1913, supra, relieve from taxation, in the hands of the holders thereof, not only stock of corporations here engaged in manufacturing, but also the stock of any corporation that pays a capital stock tax to the State, no <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>matter how small; and appellants express the fear that, unless we put the construction upon the statute for which they contend, foreign corporations, for the benefit of their shareholders, may seek to take an undue or improper advantage of this situation. Why shareholders of foreign corporations liable to a capital stock tax in Pennsylvania, with no apparent regard to the amount of tax paid by their companies, should be put on a par with other shareholders who enjoy tax exemption because their corporations are engaged in manufacturing within our borders, is not so clear; but we deem it unnecessary to the determination of this case to discuss that point, for, while the corporation at bar pays a small capital stock tax, the strength of appellee’s position, and the fact which controls our decision, is that this particular concern comes bona fide within the manufacturing class. Moreover, if there is danger from the act as it now stands, that is for the legislature, not for us, to correct; but it may not be out of place to say that, under the ordinary rules of law, an effort to gain an undue advantage by connivance or fraud cán usually be frustrated. ' It is not contended, however, that any such effort confronts us in the present case.</p>
