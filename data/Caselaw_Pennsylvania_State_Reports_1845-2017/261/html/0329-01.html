    <p id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.9",370,[281,1386,1146,752]]]'>Upon the facts involved, Commissioner Scott says: “This case comes before the board on a petition for determination of compensation due the claimant under agreed facts. The statement of facts precludes any other cause of death than that of heat exhaustion or prostration due to the heated condition of the atmosphere. The claimant’s deceased husband was overcome by heat while working at the defendant’s lunch counter, on a hot August day in 1917, and died within two hours. There is nothing in the statement to show that [the temperature of] the place where the employee was working was hotter than the outside atmosphere, or that he'was affected by different heat conditions than prevailed in the community at large.”</p>

L. 736, supra; for wherever death is mentioned in the statute, it means death resulting only from unforeseen violence to the physical structure of the body and its resultant effects (Section 301, P. L. 738), or, in other words, death from “an accident” happening in the course of the deceased person’s employment, as distinguished from either ordinary or occupational disease developed during the course of such employment, these latter not being within contemplation of the act. This subject is fully discussed in McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., <a href="/pa/261/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="261 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="1042265" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0312-01">261 Pa. 312</a>.</p>

In Ismay, Imrie &amp; Co. v. Williamson, Law Rep. A. C. 1908, 437, 439, Lord Loreburn, speaking for the House of Lords, said: “This man died from an accident. What killed him was a heat stroke coming suddenly and unexpectedly upon him while at work. Such a stroke is an unusual effect of a known cause, often, no doubt, threatened, but generally averted by precautions, which experience, in this instance, had not taught. It was an unlooked for mishap in -the course of <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>his employment. In common language, it was a case of accidental death.” See also Maskery v. Lancashire Shipping Co., decided by the' Court of Appeals, England, and reported in Butterworth’s Workmen’s Compensation Cases, Volume 7, pp. 428, 430, where the engineer on a steamship met his death from a heat stroke while crossing the Red sea. The contention of defendants was that they were not liable “because the Red sea is always very hot, and there was no special heat on that particular day more than people in the engine-room going through the Red sea would ordinarily be exposed to.” In affirming an allowance of compensation, the court held that the Ismay case applied; and the opinion refers to the heat stroke as “an occurrence which was in its nature fortuitous.” Andrew v. Failsworth Industrial Society, 90 Law Times Reports (new series), pp. 611, 612, involves death from a stroke of lightning; Pack v. Prudential Casualty Co., <a href="/ky/170/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="170 Ky. 47" data-case-ids="4444092" data-case-paths="/ky/170/0047-01">170 Ky. 47</a>, 55, death from sunstroke, and McGlinchey et al. v.

W. Commercial Travelers’ Assn. v. London Guarantee &amp; Accident Co., 10 Manitoba Rep. (Queen’s Bench) 537, holds death from frost to be within the terms “bodily injuries effected through external, violent and accidental means.” Finally, N. A. Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Burroughs, <a href="/pa/69/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="69 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1026390" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0043-01">69 Pa. 43</a>, 51, a case where an assured strained himself while loading hay, defines “accident” as “an event that takes place without one’s foresight or expectation ......; an accident signifies happening by chance or unexpectedly,......casual [or] fortuitous.” Of course, neither this last ruling nor any other of the insurance cases mentioned can be looked upon as governing the present compensation claim; but all are illustrative of the liberal views entertained by the courts as to the meaning of the term “accident” in determining liability for death or personal injury.</p>
    <p id="b372-6" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[271,2329,1145,97]],["BL_373.1",373,[162,361,1152,1029]]]'>Section 422 of the Act of 1915, supra (P.

L. 754) provides that, on an appeal to the courts, such agreement shall be included in the transcript, or record, sent up for consideration. In the present instance the agreement itself has not been physically brought before us, as it should be, but the commissioner’s findings are that the statement of facts contained therein “precludes any other cause of death than that of heat exhaustion or prostration, due to the heated condition of the atmosphere” ; hence we must take it no organic weakness or occupational disease can be accounted the proximate cause of the death of claimant’s husband, but the casualty was attributable solely to the unexpected and violent effect of the heat upon the physical structure of deceased’s body; and this was properly held by the compensation board and the court below to be an accidental death within the meaning of the act.</p>
    <p id="b373-3" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[153,1401,1167,1026]],["BL_374.1",374,[277,353,1144,97]]]'>Appellant’s contention that “the whole intent of this legislation [compensation law] is based upon the theory that the employment in which the person is engaged is the proximate cause of the injury,” is without merit.

We sustained an award in favor of the widow, and said, inter alia: “In the compensation acts of some of the states, compensation is allowed only for injuries Arising out of and in the course of his employment,’ thus attaching two conditions to the right to recover. In the Pennsylvania statute, the words Arising out of’ do not appear; and we are, therefore, relieved from the necessity of considering the question whether in this case the accident arose, out of, or was due to the character, of, the employment. Under our statute com<a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>pensation is given for personal injury or death of an employee 'by an accident in the course of bis employment.’ ”</p>
