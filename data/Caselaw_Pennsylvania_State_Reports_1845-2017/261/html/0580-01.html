Finally, suit for $1,000 having been brought on one of the latter obligations, judgment obtained and execution issued, Kennedy was compelled to pay that amount, with interest and costs, such note having been signed by him jointly with defendant corporation, he acting as an accommodation maker ; after its payment, this obligation was duly assigned to plaintiff.</p>

Defendant also averred that the capital stock available for the purpose, which it had sold to time of suit, would not-aggregate sufficient, if applied as stated in the contract, to' pay its obligations held by plaintiff, since the corporation had accepted notes, instead of cash, for a large part of such stock, some of Avhich notes had not been paid.</p>

The agreement in question provides that the proceeds of such cash sales are to be applied, in the manner hereinbefore stated, to the reduction of defendant’s various obligations to plaintiff. In disposing of its stock, upon several occasions defendant accepted notes, which were forthwith discounted for cash. Under the circumstances, it would work grave injustice to permit such a subterfuge to delay the enforcement of this company’s contractual obligations; but it is not necessary to rest upon that ground the affirmance of the present judgment, for there is ample evidence upon the record to prove that, at the time of this action, defendant <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>had sold for actual cash enough stock fully <em>to </em>pay the notes in suit.</p>

Defendant contends, however, that plaintiff was in default in the respect last mentioned, in that he transferred property to such an extent as to impair his financial credit; and it complains because the trial judge refused testimony concerning these alleged transfers. We see no error in the rulings of the court below upon the subject in hand; there is nothing-in the agreement betAveen the parties b&gt; prohibit plaintiff from transferring or disposing of his property, and, in addition, it appears that Kennedy attempted no such assignments or transfers until after the Delaware company’s refusal to pay the note due him in February, 1915, that is, until after defendant’s breach of contract. We have read the authorities cited by appellant as applicable to this branch of the case, but none of them rules the facts at bar.</p>

W. Rothrock individually, which the latter claims, in effect, modified the contract in suit “with reference to the application of money arising from sales of stock.” We see no error in this ruling; if there was any breach of the terms of this collateral agreement, the damages accruing therefrom may, perhaps, be recovered by Rothrock personally, but the court below was right in holding that such breach <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>eo.uld not affect the questions involved in the present suit. - ■</p>
    <p id="b625-3" data-blocks='[["BL_625.4",625,[165,456,1173,1619]]]'>Another assignment complains of an alleged inconsistency between a part of the charge, dealing with plaintiff’s right to regain the amount paid by him on the before-mentioned note of $1,000, and a point covering the ' same item. It appears the trial judge said that, if Kennedy had to pay this note off $1,000, “then he would be put in the position of the bank” and “would have the right to recover the amount the bank collected from him”; but, later on, in answer to the point, the jury was plainly told that plaintiff could not recover “anything” upon the item of $1,000, unless he “proved to the satisfaction of the jury,” by the Aveight of all the evidence in the case, that he had, in all particulars, lived up to his agreement with defendant. It is quite plain this inconsistency could have done defendant no harm. In the first place, plaintiff paid the note for $1,000, and might have had the judgment-thereon marked to his use (Carnegie Nat. Bk. v. Seibel-, <a href="/pa/255/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="255 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="1027680" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0473-01">255 Pa. 473</a>) ; but he preferred to include the item in his present suit. Next, as already indicated, the verdict comprehends a finding that defend-' ant, and not plaintiff, was the party in default; • and the last thing said to the jury? upon the subject of this note, was the affirmance of the point to the effect that there could be no recovery unless plaintiff proved “by the weight of the evidence” that he had not breached his contract. Finally, it was the duty of counsel to call the court’s attention to the alleged inconsistency, Avhen the trial judge, after answering all points, asked, “Is there anything else, gentlemen, you desire me to say to the jury.” We see no merit in this assignment.</p>
    <p id="b625-4" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[162,2086,1157,316]],["BL_626.1",626,[282,351,1152,805]]]'>The assignment most strenuously insisted upon alleges that the. court below erred “in overruling defendant’s motion in arrest of judgment.” • In this connection the complaint is of a misjoinder of actions. The suit was instituted in December, 1915. An affidavit of defense, was filed, a plea in abatement entered, the general issue <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>pleaded, and then- defendant,' by leave of court, filed a special plea of set-off. In none of these, however, did it suggest a misjoinder of actions, or complain because plaintiff was endeavoring to recover one of the items in suit as a use-plaintiff, while he claimed the others as legal plaintiff. After trial, defendant for the first time raised the objection in question. We cannot perceive in what manner the defendant was prejudiced by the so-called misjoinder, and we agree with the learned court below that, after full notice of the cause of action in plaintiff’s statement of claim, defendant having “filed his affidavit of defense, entered a special plea, and had a fair trial, it is now too late [for it] to raise the objection that there was a misjoinder”: Whitney v. Haskell, <a href="/pa/216/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="216 Pa. 622" data-case-ids="950445" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0622-01">216 Pa. 622</a>, 628, and cases there cited.</p>
    <p id="b626-4" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[282,1167,1147,1121]]]'>Another matter calls for notice. Defendant contends that plaintiff recovered too much interest. The declaration asks interest only from December 4,1915; but, as a matter of fact, on the bulk of the claims in suit, it was actually due from December 4,1914, and the special verdict shows an allowance thereof from that date. Under the circumstances, the declaration might be treated as amended to agree with the judgment on the verdict (Passenger C. L. Ins. Co. v. Birnbaum, <a href="/pa/116/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="116 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="554377" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0565-01">116 Pa. 565</a>, 572; Fonder v.
