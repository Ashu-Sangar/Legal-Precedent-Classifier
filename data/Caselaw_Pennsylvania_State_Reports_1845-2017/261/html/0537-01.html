The Commonwealth claims that this tax must be calculated upon the whole estate without deduction of -the sum of $10,733.97 paid to the United States Collector of Internal Revenue. The auditing judge, however, allowed this deduction, and in this we think he was clearly correct. The Act of Congress, 39th U. S. Stat. at Large, <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>Part 1, Chap. 463, Title II, Sec. 201, page 777, provides, that a tax is thereby imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of the act, and the following sections provide for a method of valuation of the gross estate, and the deductions by which the value of the net estate is determined. This tax is in terms a tax imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of a decedent passing to others under the provisions of his will or the intestate laws of the several states. It is denominated an estate tax, not a tax upon the succession or inheritance, and it is charged upon and payable out of the net estate of the decedent. It is imposed without regard to the provisions of the will or the law of the several states, the paramount taxing power of the Federal government takes effect at the moment of the owner’s death upon his entire estate, subject only to the specific deductions mentioned in Section 203, .and an exemption of $50,000, and it requires payment therefrom of a*tax according to a graduated scale regulated by the net amount of the taxable estate.</p>

Obviously the clear value taxable under the law of this State can only be thus ascertained after the payment of- the tax due to the United States.
