The crops and income from the farm were regularly divided between the claimant’s husband, who was the tenant, and the decedent. There was no evidence to support the claim except testimony as to a number of loose and vague declarations oh the part of the decedent that the claimant should be paid for her services.

The testimony shows, that the claimant and her husband, occupied this farm with the decedent for many years, and that they lived together on it as one family, up to the time of his death. In view of this family relation, the testimony— loose expressions of gratitude and appreciation and of a desire that she should be paid, and the like: Wise v. Martin, <a href="/pa/232/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="232 Pa. 159" data-case-ids="977926" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0159-01">232 Pa. 159</a> — is of a character, which is always regarded as insufficient to support á claim of this nature. No express contract is even alleged, and no demand is shown to have been made by the claimant in the lifetime of the decedent. Services for nursing are presumed to be periodically paid: Cummiskey’s Est., <a href="/pa/224/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="224 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="963049" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0509-01">224 Pa. 509</a>, and it is almost incredible, that the decedent should receive his share of income of the farm from the claimant’s husband who had the sole control of the same, for this period of two and one-half years, during which she rendered these services, and not some settlement be made for the nursing, if payment was contemplated by the parties. The facts and circumstances surrounding <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>this whole case justify the conclusion that these services were either voluntarily performed by the claimant by reason of the relation existing between her and her father-in-law, the decedent, or were paid for at stated periods when they were due; and that this claim would not have been made, if claimant’s husband, the accountant, to whom the farm was devised had not been charged with the mismanagement of the estate, and finally surcharged with the sum of $1,442.19.</p>
