    <p class="summary" id="b69-5" data-blocks='[["BL_69.8",69,[160,750,1167,1235]]]'>The referee awarded compensation to tbe widow and children of one Harry Siglin, who came to bis death by accident while in defendant’s employ. Tbe award was affirmed by tbe Board of Compensation and from that decision defendant takes this appeal. Deceased was fatally hurt by a fall from bis employer’s motor truck, on its return from an out-of-town delivery of goods, in . charge of a driver to whom deceased was a helper. He was standing on tbe running board, or at least with one foot on tbe board, and was thrown off- by a jolt occasioned by an obstruction in tbe road. Tbe driver and two girls on tbe seat were not disturbed by tbe jolt. Deceased bad voluntarily given up bis seat and taken to tbe running board, in order to give tbe girls a ride when they were overtaken on tbe road. That circumstance gives rise to tbe question raised by appellant, viz: whether deceased was at that particular time in tbe course of bis employment, to which some color is lent by tbe fact that of bis own volition be bad stopped tbe car, given up what proved to be a place of safety and taken one obviously of less safety, not in furtherance of tbe master’s business but to help tbe girls on tbe way home from their work.</p>

But having resumed bis- appointed journey, he was no doubt in course of bis employment <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>thereafter, no matter in what part of the truck he placed himself. The finding of the referee having been affirmed by the board, the burden must be deemed to be on the appellant to clearly establish the alleged error, and of that we are not c.onvinced.</p>
