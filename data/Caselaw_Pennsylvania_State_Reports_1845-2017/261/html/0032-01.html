In an, action to recover for the death of plaintiff’s fourteen-year-old son resulting from his being kicked in the head by defendant’s mule, the questions of the negligence of the defendant and the contributory negligence of the deceased were for the jury and a verdict for the plaintiffs will be sustained where it appeared that deceased and certain companions were coasting down a hill on a bobsled and crossed the road on which the mulé was standing, in <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>charge of defendant’s driver; that as deceased came within four feet of the mule it kicked him on the head inflicting injuries from which his death resulted; that at the time of the occurrence deceased was the fourth boy on the sled, which was being steered by an eighteen-year-old companion; and there was evidence that on previous occasions the mule had shown vicious propensities and had kicked other persons, and that' defendant had knowledge of such fact.</p>

They had gone down three times and were going up the hill from their third trip when they passed John Coleman, defendant’s mule driver, coming down the road on his way to the mule barn, riding one mule and leading another by a rope or chain. The boys reached the top of the hill and after waiting three or four minutes for the mules to get out of their way started down the hill again on their fourth trip. After they had gotten part way down they discovered the mules still in the public road. They then called to Coleman who pulled the mules into the opposite gutter so that as the sled passed them the mules were standing diagonally across the road close to the gutter. The hind mule, the one that was being led, was approximately four or four <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>ánd a half feet from them. As they passed this mule he kicked with his hind feet or foot and struck two of the boys in the head, slightly injuring one and crushing the skull of Joseph Nevins. From the effects of the injury he died on January 3,1915.</p>
