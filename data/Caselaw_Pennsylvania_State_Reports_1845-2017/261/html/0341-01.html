Án eastbound street car came up behind the truck at a point thirty feet east of Thirty-first street, upon the Spring Garden street bridge over the Schuylkill river; in response to a signal from the motorman of this car, defendant’s chauffeur turned his truck to the left and entered upon the westbound track. At the point in question, there was sufficient space to accommodate the truck on the right, be<a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>tween the eastbound track and the curb, and no necessity existed for turning in the other direction. Just as the eastbound car passed the truck, a cloud of smoke was thrown over the street railway tracks by a locomotive, which at that moment passed under the bridge; the smoke was so dense it completely concealed from the view of defendant’s chauffeur the approach of a westbound trolley car upon which plaintiff was acting as motorman, and, from the vision of the latter, the former’s motor truck. Notwithstanding these conditions, the chauffeur ran directly on, in the westbound track, for a distance of nearly seventy feet from the point where he first turned in, and, just as the truck emerged from the eastern edge - of the smoke-cloud, a collision occurred between it and plaintiff’s car. The truck was still coming head-on, in the westbound track, when only ten feet away from the car; but, judging from the position of the former after the accident, the chauffeur, immediately before the actual collision, must have attempted a quick turn to the right, too late, however, to change the situation of danger which he had created. The trolley car was running not more than four miles an hour, and, immediately upon seeing the automobile in the track, plaintiff threw off his power, apparently doing all he could to avoid the collision, having previously rung his' bell. There was evidence to show that, under ordinary circumstances, the bridge upon which the accident happened was sufficiently illuminated to permit of seeing “a square away.”</p>

On the evidence at bar, the <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>issues involved were for the jury, and tbe court below did not err -in so ruling.</p>
