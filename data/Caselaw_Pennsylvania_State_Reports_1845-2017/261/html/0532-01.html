Whether the building and loan association appropriated the monthly payment on account of the stock in reduction of the mortgage debts owing by the person who owned the property and whether such appropriations were applied as the payments were made or before the sheriff’s sale took place are questions of fact to be determined by a jury. If the stock was not appropriated by defendant there would be no balance coming to the third mortgagee under the first sale.</p>
