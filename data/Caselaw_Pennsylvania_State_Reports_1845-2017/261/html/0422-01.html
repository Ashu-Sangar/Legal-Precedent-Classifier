Defendant operates a double line of tracks on Hunting Park avenue, a thoroughfare 60 feet in width from curb to curb, the distance from each curb to the nearest' car track being 23% feet. Plaintiff testified that while standing on the curb, and as he started to cross the avenue he noticed a car coming westwardly on Hunting Park avenue, on the near track, that seemed to be slowing down, and two hundred and fifty or two hundred and seventy-five feet distant; that he started to cross the street and upon reaching the track the car Avas at least íavo lengths from him. He further testified: “When I got to the first rail I continued to cross, still thinking it was slowing down, and probably going to stop there, which they generally do. Before I got almost over the track, he came on me like a flash, and that was really the last I kneAV......Q. From the vieAv that you had of the car as it bore down on you, could you give any estimate of what speed it Avas coming at? ......A. From Avhat I saw it coming, when I was Avithin two car lengths, until the time it struck me, it certainly must have been going about twenty-five miles an'hour. ......Q. Did you observe that it Avent faster after you attempted to cross the track? A. Yes, sir; I did. I couldn’t get off the track.” Plaintiff has no recollection of what happened subsequently; the evidence, however, is undisputed that he was picked up on the .opposite side of the crossing, a distance of one hundred and sixty-five feet beyond the place at which he stated the accident occurred. The testimony on behalf of defendant tended to show plaintiff was, in fact, struck on the south side of the crossing near the place where he was found, and that the car stopped within its length after hitting plaintiff. By special verdict the jury found the accident did not occur at the place specified by defendant’s witnesses.</p>

Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., <a href="/pa/248/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="248 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1011477" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0174-01">248 Pa. 174</a>; Wagner v.

In applying these principles to cases of collision between pedestrians and street cars at crossings, it has been held a pedestrian is not negligent in attempting to cross a street at a place set apart for that purpose, merely because a car is approaching at a distance, although in plain sight: Bunn v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., <a href="/pa/244/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="244 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1003514" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0176-01">244 Pa. 176</a>. In such case the rights of the pedestrian and the street railway company are mutual and each is bound to exercise the care required by the circumstances. The danger the pedestrian is bound.to foresee and avoid is that of being injured by cars operated in a proper and legal manner. Accepting plaintiff’s account of the accident as true, as we are bound to do in view of the verdict of the jury, he was almost across the track when injured; the case, consequently, is ruled by Young v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., supra.</p>

The facts in those cases, however, distinguish them from the case now before us. In the case first cited the accident occurred in daytime almost immediately as plaintiff stepped upon the track. In the Cunningham case the accident also occurred in daytime and, as was stated in the opinion of the court (pages 196, 197), the only <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>reasonable inference deducible from the undisputed testimony was that plaintiff stepped upon the track directly in front of an approaching car and'was struck instantly. So also, in the Wolf case, the accident occurred in daylight and plaintiff’s testimony was to the effect that the car was coming fast and he saw the motorman was not looking ahead. Under such conditions he could not rely upon the assumption that the motorman saw him and would exercise proper care to avoid an accident.</p>
    <p id="b465-3" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[177,844,1144,313]]]'>It cannot be said in the case now before us that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the circumstances clearly demonstrated that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence; the question accordingly was for the jury: Young v.

    <p id="b465-4" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[168,1170,1153,1242]],["BL_466.1",466,[264,345,1140,151]]]'>Appellant further contends the circumstances of the accident showed plaintiff’s account, in view of the place and position of his body when found, described impossible conditions, hence defendant’s version of the place where the accident occurred was the true one, and conclusively demonstrated no negligence on the part of the motorman. The jury found this question in favor of plaintiff, however, and it cannot be said that plaintiff’s account was so impossible as to warrant setting aside their finding as not being supported by evidence. Under plaintiff’s theory of the case he must have been carried on the fender of the car for a distance of 165 feet. There is nothing so clearly impossible in this as to justify us in holding as matter of law that it could not have occurred. Neither is the fact that plaintiff was found on the right-hand side of the track, rather than on the left, conclusive as to his exact location when struck by the car, since, if carried on the fender for such a distance and around a curve to the left, his position would not necessarily remain the same as that occupied by him immediately following the contact, and a reasonable inference might readily, follow that the momentum and the overhang of the front of the car in rounding the curve to <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>the left would have a tendency to throw plaintiff’s body to the right-hand side of the track. The inferences were necessarily for the jury.</p>
