        "text": "Mr. Justice Gordon\ndelivered the opinion of the court January 2d 1877.\nThe note in suit was drawn by Jenks Budlong, payable to the order of M. H. Collins, at the Citizens\u2019 Bank of Titusville. It was endorsed by Collins to the Citizens\u2019 Bank, and by the bank to the plaintiffs. When due, it was protested for non-payment; the notary certifying, inter alia, that he had, during business hours, presented the said promissory, note at the Citizens\u2019 Bank, and found it closed, and that he had duly notified the endorsers. This was a sufficient demand to charge the endorsers. It was held in Bumgardner v. Reeves, 11 Casey 250, that a visit to the maker\u2019s place of business, for the purpose of making presentment, and finding it closed, is equivalent to an actual presentment and demand, and that a notarial certificate setting forth such facts might be given in evidence to sustain a oiarr. averring actual presentment and demand. When a note is made payable at a particular place, a personal demand is unnecessary: Byles on Bills, 5th Am. ed. 342-3, note. And it would seem, from the same authority (note to page 346), that if a note is made payable at a particular bank, and such bank before maturity, ceases to exist, a demand, in order to bold an endorser, is excused. In like manner it was considered that demand made at the office of an acceptor of a bill, though closed, was sufficient : Wiseman v. Chiappella, 23 How. 366. That the notary, after finding the bank closed, supplemented the matter by demand on one having no connection with or interest in the transaction, is of no significance; it did neither good nor harm, and may be regarded as surplusage. If the oral testimony was in any degree in conflict with the notarial certificate, as to the fact of the bank being closed at the time of the presentation, the only effect thereof 'was to carry the case to the jury, but it did not warrant a compulsory nonsuit.\nJudgment reversed, and a procedendo awarded.",

    "head_matter": "Berg & Co. versus Abbott et al.\n1. In protesting a promissory note the notary certified that during business hours he had called at the bank and found it closed: Held, that this was sufficient demand to charge the endorsers.\n2. The fact that the notary added that he had made demand of the bookkeeper did not affect the conclusiveness of his certificate.\n3. There was oral testimony in conflict with the notarial certificate that the doors of the bank were closed at the time presentment was made, yet, notwithstanding the court directed a compulsory nonsuitHeld, that' the nonsuit was unwarranted, and the case should have gone to the jury.\nNovember 22d 1876.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ. Williams and Mercur, JJ., absent.\nError to the Common Pleas of Qrawford county: Of October and November Term 1876, No. 270.\nAssumpsit by John Berg & Co. against William H. Abbott et al., partners doing business as the Citizens\u2019 Bank.\nJohn Berg & Co., bankers of Butler, were the holders of a promissory note made by Jenks Budlong to the order of M. H. Collins for $2500, dated June 6th 1878, and made payable at the Citizens\u2019 Bank of Titusville four months from date. The note was endorsed by M. H. Collins, the Citizens\u2019 Bank per I. G. Jackson, cashier, and by John Berg & Co.\nAt maturity the note was sent for collection to the Producers\u2019 \u25a0 and Manufacturers\u2019 Bank of Titusville, and being unpaid was placed by them in the hands of a notary for presentment, demand and protest. The Citizens\u2019 Bank failed,' and closed its doors in September 1878. The notary during business hours, on the 18th of October went with the note to the Citizens\u2019 Bank and found the doors closed, whereupon he made \u00a1search and found L. Jackson, who had been book-keeper of the Citizens\u2019 Bank, upon whom he made demand for payment which was refused. Of such demand and non-payment the notary notified the endorsers, and this suit was brought against the parties forming the Citizens\u2019 Bank.\nAt the trial plaintiffs offered the note, the endorsements and the notary\u2019s certificate, and then called Isaac Gr. Jackson, who testified that L. Jackson had been the book-keeper of defendants, but was not a partner or teller, and was not in the employment of defendants on the 18th of October 1873; that the bank was open for business, settling, &c., until February 1874; that it failed near the end of September 1873, and there the plaintiffs rested. Thereupon the defendants moved for a nonsuit, which motion was granted by the court.\nThis action of the court was the error assigned.\nRoger Sherman, for plaintiffs in error.\nThe notary certified that he presented'the bill at the bank and found the same closed. It was a reasonable presumption in favor of the officer that there was no one there of whom to make demand. Presentment at the place of business is sufficient, and if the doors are found closed further search is unnecessary: Bank v. Hunt, 2 Hill 625 : Wiseman v. Chiappella, 23 Howard 368; Byles on Bills, 5 Am. ed., p. star 197.\n. Unless contradicted the notarial certificate was conclusive upon defendants: Bennett v. Young, 6 Harris 261; Jenks v. Doylestown Bank, 4 W. & S. 505; Brittain v. Doylestown Bank, 5 Id. 87.\nGuthrie & Byles, for defendants in error.\nThe notarial certificate cannot avail against positive testimony: Sherer v. Easton Bank, 9 Casey 134."
