Dovey does not need to trace his title through the irregular endorsement of the Safeguard Insurance Company. No question arises in this action between Rand and the insurance company, as to their relations to each other. That relation does not affect Dovey, who takes title by the endorsement of Rand as payee. The latter cannot set up the endorsement of the insurance company as an irregularity to affect Dovey.

    "head_matter": "Rand versus Dovey.\n1. The negotiability of a promissory note is not destroyed by the fact that the endorsement of a corporation thereon was made through its seal.\n2. D., the holder of the note, brought this action against R., the payee and endorser: Held, that D. need not trace his title through this irregular endorsement, as the relation between the corporation and R. cannot affect D., who takes title by the endorsement of R., as payee, and the latter, therefore, cannot set up the irregular endorsement to affect him.\nJanuary 12th 1877.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ. Williams, J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, of Philadelphia county: Of January Term 1876, No. 67.\nThis was assumpsit, brought by John J. Dovey against Abraham W'. Rand, upon the following note:\u2014\n\u201c$3750. Philadelphia, September 14th 1874.\n\u201c Two months after date I promise to pay to the order of A. W. Rand, Esq., thirty-seven hundred and fifty dollars, payable at 432 Walnut street, without defalcation. Value received.\n\u201c George E. Hilt.\u201d\nEndorsed \u2014 \u201cSafeguard Insurance Company of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nSeal of Insurance Company.\n\u201cPer George E. Hilt, Secretary,\n\u201cA. W. Rand.\n\u201c September 28th 1874. Paid on account $1000.\u201d\nThe narr. of plaintiff contained the common counts and the following special count:\u2014\n\u201c Whereas, one George E. Hilt, on the 14th day of September, in the year of our Lord 1874,- at Philadelphia, made his promissory note in writing, and thereby promised to pay to the defendant\u2019s order thirty-seven hundred and fifty dollars, two months after date thereof, which period has now elapsed; and the defendant then and* there endorsed the same to the plaintiff; and the said George E. Hilt did not pay the amount thereof, although the same was there presented to him on the day when it became due; of all which the defendant then and there had notice.\u201d\nThe pleas were the ordinary pleas -in assumpsit. At the trial before Peirce, J., the defendant .objected to the admission of the writing in evidence, first, because it is not a promissory note; is not negotiable as such by endorsement; that its negotiability was destroyed by the endorsement under seal; and second, because it is not the instrument described in the, special count of the narr.\nThe court overruled the objections and admitted the writing in evidence.\nThe verdict was for the plaintiff for $2648.78, upon which judgment was entered.\nThe defendant took this writ and assigned for error the admission of the note in evidence.\nHenry T. King, for plaintiff in error.\nThe sealed endorsement destroyed the negotiability of the instrument as to all parties claiming subsequently thereto, and through that endorsement. The holder did not strike out that endorsement, nor, indeed, could he, and thus make negotiable that which in its inception was not so. There was a fatal variance between the instrument declared on and the writing offered in evidence. It was required that the plaintiff should state in his declaration the endorsement between himself and the party he sues, and on the trial of the cause prove that endorsement or strike it off, neither of which was done in this case.\nA. Sidney Biddle and R. C. McMurtrie, for defendant in error.\nThe holder of a negotiable note may strike out any endorsements which are not stated in the declaration: Merz v. Kaiser, 20 La. Ann. 379. To the same effect see Mayer v. Jadis, 1 M. & Rob. 247.\nNo one has as yet asserted that an endorsement of a note by a corporation makes the note a bond. The drawing does, if it is sealed, but not the transfer. The contract of endorsement may he by deed, though the primary debt be by parol."
