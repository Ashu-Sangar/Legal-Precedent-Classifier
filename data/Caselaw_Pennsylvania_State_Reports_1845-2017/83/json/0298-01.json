The court below thought the omission to pay made the policy absolutely void, and that no valid assessment on the note could be made to pay losses thereafter sustained. The evidence of such assessments was therefore rejected.\nIn an opinion just filed, in another case between these same parties, in regard to another assessment on this identical note, we have fully discussed the question which arises here. The reasons there given rule this case. It is unnecessary to repeat them. They show that the learned judge erred in rejecting the evidence, and that this judgment must be reversed.\nJudgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.",
