      <em>“ </em>The <em>narr. </em>mentioned and referred to in the declaration in this suit was filed July 10th 1857. That declaration shoAvs the entry of a* judgment in favor of Robert Morris against Jacob Moyer, and the use party, plaintiff, contends that the defendant here was the Slaintiff’s attorney who dreAY up and filed that <em>narr., </em>and that in so oing he AYas guilty of negligence, and entered judgment against Jacob Moyer, when the bond was the bond of John Moyer, and Avhen the judgment should have been entered against him instead of Jacob Moyer. The defendant denies this allegation, and that forms the first question for your consideration. If you find from the evidence that this allegation is true, then the defendant becomes liable to Robert Morris for negligence, and for whatever amount of damages he actually sustained by reason of such negligence. <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>The ground of the action is negligence, and damages the result. Robert Morris could recover such damages in his own name as legal plaintiff, and so too if he assigned his damages, if any he sustained, with the cause of action, to E. J. Rupp. In that case the plaintiff could recover by using the name of the legal plaintiff, Robert Morris, for his use, as this suit is brought. But if Robert Morris ever had a cause of action, but did not wish to sue for the same, and did not sue therefor, no outside or other person could bring suit in his name for him, especially when he dissents and refuses to sue, unless, as already remarked, he had assigned his cause of action and damages. There is no evidence in this cause that Robert Morris ever assigned to E- J- Rupp, the use party, his cause of action and damages, if he had any. The cause of action accruing to Robert Morris was founded in tort, and he might waive his rights as to the tort and refuse to assign the same. And I think the law will not infer the assignment of a cause of action for such tort, and therefore instruct you that the written assignment of part of the judgment by Robert Morris, given in evidence, did not convey with it any cause of action or damages Robert Morris may have sustained by reason of the defendant’s negligence, and therefore the use party, plaintiff, cannot recover in this suit. And if you find, from the evidence in the cause, that Robert Morris did not institute this suit, nor authorize it to he brought, and claims no interest in it, then there can be no recovery in this case, and your verdict should be for the defendant.”</p>

It was therefore very irregular to introduce into the trial of the cause a question whether the plaintiff’s right of action passed over to Rupp, the assignee of the judgment. It was an entire departure from the issue. So the introduction of the testimony of the plaintiff and his written disclaimer of his interest in the suit before the jury to defeat the action, was equally irregular. But it would be useless to reverse the judgment and send it back for a new trial, when the right of Rupp to maintain the action cannot be sustained, and when the plaintiff can prevent a trial by a retraxit or a discontinuance. It is not pretended that the plaintiff in fact assigned his right of action against McCulloch for negligence to Rupp. It is only claimed that it passed to Rupp by the effect of the assignment of the judgment against John Moyer. But this assignment carried with it only securities, if any, held to secure payment of the debt. A right of action founded on negligence of the attorney prior to the assignment, was a matter independent of the debt assigned, founded in alleged wrongful conduct, whereby the plaintiff was injured; and <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>was not a security held for the payment of the debt. Collaterals held as security pass in equity by the assignment, though not named; but a party is not bound to enforce a remedy for a wrong or injury done to him, though it relate to the matter assigned. Here the plaintiff in the judgment, Morris, assigned a judgment against John Moyer, to Rupp, when in point of fact he had none, his judgment being against Jacob Moyer. This might raise a question between him and Rupp, but was not an equitable assignment of his right of action against McCulloch.</p>
