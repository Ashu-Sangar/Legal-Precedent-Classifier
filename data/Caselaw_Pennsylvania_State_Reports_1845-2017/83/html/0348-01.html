The heirs and next of kin come into possession of the property, which the • testator expected to devise or bequeath, not as successors in title under the will, but by force of the statute in spite of and against it. They take not by or through the testator’s bounty, but by the written law. The testator’s intentions are annulled, and no inference as to his valid testamentary disposition in other parts of the will can be gathered from them. In this view, all that was'predicated in argument respecting his intention to charge his legacies and annuities upon his residuary realty, as deducible from a gift and application of his real and personal residuary estate blended, loses its force; the statute has swept away the foundation on which the rules of the law construing the testator’s intention thus to charge, must be based, <em>eessante rations, cessat ipsa lex.”</em>

The will and death of the testator work the change, in equity. It requires no act of the executor or trustee to work the conversion. Hence it has been held that a judgment recovered against one of several legatees, among whom the fund, when made from land, was to be distributed, did not bind his interest therein, for he was seised of no estate in the land which could be made the subject of a lien: Allison, Executor, <em>v. </em>Wilson’s Executors, 13 S. &amp; R. 333; Morrow <em>v. </em>Brenizer, <a href="/rawle/2/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Rawle 185" data-case-ids="1820587" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0185-01">2 Rawle 185</a>; Willing v. Peters, 7 Barr 287.</p>
    <p id="b354-7" data-blocks='[["BL_354.7",354,[271,1443,1168,764]]]'>Evans’s Appeal, <em>supra, </em>shows that this rule of conversion does not depend on whether full effect can be given to the intended charity of the testator. There the testator had directed his real estate to be sold and the proceeds to be applied to a charitable use, but died within a month after executing the will. It was held, that although the gift was void, yet the direction to sell was a conversion. So, in the present ease, it is the language of the will which mingles the realty and personalty together and makes them a residuary fund. While the heirs and next of kin now take the property designed for charitable uses, yet they take it with its fixed character stamped upon it. The heir at law, on whom a part of the estate is allowed to descend, would seem to stand precisely in the same condition as if he had taken it as residuary devisee and legatee: McGlaughlin’s Executor <em>v. </em>McGlaughlin, 12 Harris 20. Both take subject to general legacies. It follows, therefore, that the annuity of the appellant is charged on the real estate cast on the heirs of the testator, and the learned judged erred in holding otherwise.</p>

That is, whether an appeal lies from the decision of the court refusing to entertain the petition. The denial is certainly a definitive decree of the Orphans’ Court. It is claimed that no appeal lies under the authority of McCredy’s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 428. It is there <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>said, that no appeal is given by the first section of the Act of 23d February 1853, unless the court has made a decree discharging and exonerating some of the real estate from the lien and charge of the annuity and legacy. We think that case is clearly distinguishable from the present. There the application was made by the executors to take from the annuitants some of their security against their will. Here the annuitants voluntarily offer to release their security on a portion of the real estate. There it was said what is granted to the residuary devisee is a pure matter of grace or favor. The controlling thought expressed is, that the legal rights of the annuitant shall not be infringed upon by diminishing his security. Here the annuitant waives her rights, and offers to relinquish a part of her security. That case, however, appears to be, in part, put on the ground that the legislature designed to leave it to the discretion of the court. The questions of fact had been referred to an auditor to inquire into the circumstances, and to report on the amount and condition of the estate, and upon the expediency and propriety of exempting any part or portion of the residuary real estate, from the lien and charge of the annuity. The auditor had reported. All the facts were before the court. The merits of the case and the propriety of making the order asked for, were duly considered by the court. The application was refused. The presumption is, that it was refused on the merits. There were then strong reasons why this court should not review the discretion exercised by the court below.</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.6",355,[176,1491,1176,437]]]'>The present case is entirely different. &lt; Here there was no ascertainment of the circumstances, no inquiry into the merits of the case, no consideration as to the expediency or propriety of making the order. The petition was dismissed solely on the ground that the annuity was not charged on the residuary real estate, which we have shown to be an error in law. In sending the case back for further action ive do not mean to interfere with the discretion of the court to refuse the application on a hearing of the merits, but we hold that the annuity is a lien on the residuary real estate, and the appellant is entitled to a hearing on the merits of her application.</p>
