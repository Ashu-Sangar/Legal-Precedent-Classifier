The assessment charged by the plaintiff upon defendant’s property was made to defray the expenses of macadamizing and paving a portion of Water street, and consists of an improvement of the street for the general public benefit, the necessity for which was caused by the erection of a freight depot by the railroad company, at or near the south end of Water street, and over which street freight is moved to all parts of the city. This improvement does not confer any special benefit upon the property assessed. A portion of said improvement, of about forty-eight feet in length, at the intersection of Mercer street, an existing, well-made pavement, was removed by the city, and no allowance made to the defendant therefor; that the street in question has been open, and used by the public for more than seventy yeai’s previous to said macadamizing; that the other streets of the city of Meadville,. so_far_as already paved, have all been paved at jgxiblic^expense, and paid for out of moneys assessed upon and collected from the citizens of the city, including the defendant; that the improvement alleged in the plaintiff’s claim as filed, was <em>not </em>done in compliance with the provisions of the Act of Assembly, as claimed by the plaintiff, in that the said plaintiff did not, prior to or at the time of making said improvement by its council, ordain and establish by proper ordinance the macadamizing and paving recited by the plaintiff; that the city council did not adopt any ordinance upon the subject; that <em>‘ </em>the paving of gutters with cobble stone and macadamizing road with broken stone,’ as charged in the plaintiff’s claim, is not paving or repairing contemplated by the Act of Assembly, under which the plaintiff claims to assess the cost of work and materials upon the land abutting on such improvements, and even if the plaintiff’s claim is otherwise valid,' it is for this reason believed to be invalid.”</p>

      <em>“ </em>He has not been singled out in any special way to bear this burden; but it falls on him by a general law of the city applicable to all owners of land therein. Streets are for public purposes; but they are also necessarily local and for local purposes, and it is manifestly impossible to define by a general law when one is so purely local as to be properly a subject of local taxation, or when so general or public as to be a subject only of general charges. And no matter how general a law for such cases may be, it must operate very unequally in its administration, because of the undefinable differences in the ground over which a road.passes, and of the uses demanded of it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b158-7" data-blocks='[["BL_158.7",158,[281,1006,1168,260]]]'>“ It is not then the law that is unequal, but the circumstances of place, population, business and ownership to which it is to be adapted.

If there are to be roads at all, the advantage of them must be unequal accordingly as they furnish more or less convenient access to the property of individuals ; and road officers must have a large discretion in the expenditure of the public money for the maintenance of them. The city authorities did this work in pursuance of a very plain Act of Assembly, and a general ordinance for all such cases, and of a special resolution passed for the improvement of this particular street; and they have charged defendant’s ground with its proper share of the exp'ense, and in a form not complained of. Paving the gutters with cobble stone and the cartway with broken stone (macadamizing), is a paving within the meaning of the Act of Assembly.</p>

      <em>“ </em>But the defendant had already paid a general city tax for the same year, being in part for the general improvement of streets; and that no allowance is made for the old pavement taken away; and complains that other streets in former times had- been paid by general taxation, and not by special charges. These all seem to us to be only a mode of stating how many ways the law is felt to be a grievance, rather than arguments against the authority to pass such a law.”</p>

Section 1st, article 9th of the new Constitution declares that “all taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax.” Two methods of obtaining this uniformity in taxation for the maintenance of streets are common. In large, and for the most part compactly built cities, all streets are made and maintained at the expense of the adjacent property; in others they are made and maintained from a common fund, the proceeds of a general tax. In Meadville all the streets have heretofore been, and a large majority if not all must, hereafter, under the provisions of the present charter, be made and maintained out of a common fund (now styled city levy), to which the property now specially assessed has heretofore contributed and must hereafter contribute its full proportion.</p>
