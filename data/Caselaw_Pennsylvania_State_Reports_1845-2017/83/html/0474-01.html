The firm articles bound the appellant “to superintend the working of the colliery,” and the appellee “to sell or dispose of the product thereof.” Neither partner contributed any money as capital, but the appellee loaned to the firm the money which constituted its cash capital, and that loan has been repaid with interest. The articles also provided that the firm profits should be equally divided. As the equivalent for his phare in the profits, the appellee was bound to sell the coal. Instead of doing that, he employed his other firm of Blakiston, Graeff &amp; Co. to perform that duty, and he compelled J. M. Freck &amp; Co. to pay that firm three per cent, commissions on the sales, and two and a half per cent, guarantee commission. The guarantee* commission is, in any possible view, unauthorized, for the articles obviously imply that the business experience and skill of the appellee should be so applied as to make sales to paying customers, and that the firm should be its own insurers as against bad debts. Nor is there better warrant for the commission on sales. The appellee was entitled to charge office rent, clerks’ salaries, &amp;c., if he sold the coal; but he had no right to wholly neglect to perform the one duty imposed on him by the articles, and then to charge the firm with the cost of having his duty performed by Blakiston, Graeff &amp; Co., part of which cost went into his own pockets as a partner in the the latter firm.</p>

The ground of that decision was that the defendant sold his firm’s coal, and claimed the right to keep all the profits. Here all the profits on the sale were accounted for. If the profits on the sale by the purchaser must be accounted for, the rule must be that firms having common partners can never deal with each other. And really it comes to this, that firm property can never become separate property of one of the partners. The absurdity of this argument was exposed in Ex parte Ruffin, 6 Vesey 119, 127, 128, where it is said, if that were law a firm could never wind up, for that was only done by giving each a separate ownership in part of the common property.
