On May 11th 1875 the defendant pleaded, among other things, payment. Afterwards, on October 6th, he added a plea of set-off. At the trial he offered in evidence under this plea an account of items running from 1860 to 1871. The court below (A. E. Will-son, P. J.) refused to admit items of an earlier date than October 6th 1869, and so charged the jury. After a verdict for the plaintiff, in which a set-off was allowed the defendant for items later than October 6th 1869, and judgment thereon, Wisecarver, who had become the assignee of Hook, took this writ of error, assigning for error the charge of the court.</p>

F. Smith 462, rule this case. By the statute a set-off may be given in evidence under the plea of payment merely. But it is not <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>a logical conclusion thence that the Statute of Limitations, as affecting the set-off, may be avoided at any period of time after the bringing of the action, at the election of the defendant. In order to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of the statute, he, defendant, must give notice of his intention to use the set-off, before the six years have terminated, otherwise they run on until the time the set-off is given in evidence. He must therefore either plead the set-off or give notice of it as special matter in due season.</p>
