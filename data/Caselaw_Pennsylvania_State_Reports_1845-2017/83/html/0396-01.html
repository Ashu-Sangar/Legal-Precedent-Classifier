A contract of re-insurance is a contract of indemnity. The re-insured may go into equity as soon as the claim arises upon him, without waiting to pay the original insured.

But he maintains that it is not applicable to this ease, because, by the express terms of the contract, <em>‘ </em>the losses, if any, are to be payable pro rata to the Enterprise Insurance. Company, at such time and in such manner as the latter company may pay.’ This clause must have such an interpretation as will not entirely defeat the contract. It can evidently have no application where, as in this case, the Enterprise Company have made a general assignment for the benefit of their creditors. If the assignee can only recover from the defendants when and' as he pays dividends on the assigned estate to the original insured, it is plain an endless number of suits must be the consequence; and if it had so happened that there was no assigned estate, there could be no recovery at all. I would construe the words, ‘ as the latter company may pay,’ to mean, ‘ as the latter company may be liable to pay.’ It meant that the Fame company should have all the advantages of the Enterprise company as to the times and manner of payment; that they should not be called on to pay on the immediate happening of the loss, but whatever conditions as to the time and manner of payment might be annexed to the original policy should be extended to them.”</p>

Thus, for example, if a risk so assumed by the Enterprise Insurance Company be six thousand dollars, the Fame Insurance Company hereby re-insures one thousand dollars, and if the risk be nine thousand dollars, the Fame Insurance Company hereby re-insures four thousand dollars, and so of other sums on such risks over five thousand dollars. On all risks denominated in the policies of the Enterprise Insurance Company “ extra hazardous” or “ specially hazardous” over twenty-five hundred dollars and not exceeding five thousand dollars, which the latter company may assume, and which shall not have been divided or apportioned in the policies issued by that company therefor in the manner hereinafter referred to, the Fame Insurance Company hereby re-insures the sum which shall exceed twenty-five hundred dollars. Thus, for example, if such a risk so denominated be three thousand dollars, and no division or apportionment be made in the policy issued by the Enterprise Insurance Company therefor, the Fame Insurance Company hereby re-insures five hundred dollars, and if such a risk be five thousand dollars, the Fame Insurance Company hereby re-insures twenty-five hundred dollars, and so of such other risks over twenty-five hundred dollars. In no case, however, is the Fame Insurance Company to be liable under this agreement for a greater sum than twenty-five hundred dollars upon any single risk taken on property so denominated “extra hazardous” or “specially hazardous,” except where the interests insured in any one policy are therein so divided or apportioned as in the judgment of the respective officers of said companies not to subject either of them to a greater loss than twenty-five hundred dollars by any one fire, in which case the Fame Insurance Company shall not be liable under this agreement for a greater sum than five thousand dollars on any one policy on such property. But when the risk so assumed by the ■Enterprise Insurance Company shall exceed five thousand dollars, then each of the said companies shall be liable for an equal amount. Nor shall the Fame Insurance Company be liable under this agreement for a greater sum than five thousand dollars on any single risk taken on any and all other property except on dwelling-houses and their contents. On all risks on dwelling-houses and their con<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>tents over five thousand dollars and under ten thousand dollars which the Enterprise Insurance Company may assume, the Fame Insurance Company hereby re-insures the sum which shall exceed five thousand dollars; but when the risk so assumed by the Enterprise Insurance Company shall exceed ten thousand dollars, then each of the said ■ companies shall be liable for an equal amount. Thus, for example, if such a risk on dwelling-houses and their contents, or on a single dwelling and its contents, be for fifteen thousand dollar’s, then each of the said companies shall be liable for seventy-five hundred dollars; but the Fame Insurance Company shall not in any case be liable under this agreement for a greater sum than seventy-five hundred dollars ($7500) on any single risk taken on dwelling-houses and their contents, or on a dwelling-house and its contents. The said re-insurances are to attach simultaneously with the insurances so assumed by the Enterprise Insurance Company, at the same rate of premium, and to be subject to the same risks, valuations, conditions and modes of settlement as are or may be adopted by the said Enterprise Insurance Company. The losses, if any, are to be payable pro rata to the Enterprise Insurance Company at such times and in such manner as'the latter company may pay. Other re-insurances by the said Enterprise Insurance Company of the same risks are hereby permitted, but notice thereof is to be given to the said Fame Insurance Company, upon receiving which notice the said Fame Insurance Company may terminate its re-insurances upon such particular risk or risks, as the Enterprise Insurance Company may have effected other re-insurances upon by giving three days’ written notice to the said Enterprise Insurance Company of its desire to do so. The reports of all risks hereby re-insured by the Fame Insurance Company shall be made to the said company within three secular days after the Enterprise Insurance Company shall have received from its agents notice thereof, and the premium thereon (after deducting thirty per cent, therefrom for expenses and commission) shall be paid by the Enterprise Insurance Company to the Fame Insurance Company on or before the fifteenth day of every month on all risks thus re-insured during the preceding month. The Fame Insurance Company shall have the right at any time to examine, at the office of the Enterprise Insurance Company, the agents’ returns of such risks as are provided for in this contract.

Dig. 792), and that it should be ‘limited to the risks designated in the first class in the 7th section of said act’ (Purd. Dig. 792, pi. 7).

E. Railroad Co., 3 Casey 351) ‘laws must be executed according to the sense and meaning which they imported at the time of their passage,’ this agreement, being of a species which could not have been known to the legislature when the acts before referred to were passed, cannot be warranted by their provisions. But, in the opinion of the master, this argument is fallacious. The power conferred by the act is to take risks, not to issue policies, and nothing is said in this section as to the form in which risks shall be taken. If the legislature had intended to restrict the power they conferred, so that it should be exercised only in the mode then in use, they would have said so. That they did not so intend, it is reasonable to infer; for otherwise, it would be necessary to examine the policies of any company organized under the General Insurance Act, whenever it might be desired to determine its power to issue them, to ascertain whether they were the same as those or some of those which had been in use in 1856. Did the legislature mean, in passing an insurance act for the general government of that business, to prohibit every change which time and experience might suggest in the manner of conducting it ?</p>

But there the line of road and its termini were' the subjects of legislation; here, not the form of policy (the mode of contract), but taking risks (the thing to be contracted about) Avas the matter of legislative contemplation. That the contract now involved was, though not in form a policy, still an agreement to take risks against fire on ‘property,’ Avill appear in considering the next branch of this subject.</p>

Again the master is unable to adopt the reasoning or conclusion of defendant’s counsel. The definition of re-insurance, as given by Phillips (Phil, on Ins., par. 374) — and it is described in ’ substantially the same language in the authorities generally — is that it is a contract Avhereby one party, called the re-insurer, in consideration of a premium paid to him, agrees to indemnify the other against the risk insured by the latter, by a policy in favor of a third party. Clearly, re-insurance is the assumption of a risk of destruction of property by fire, AArhereby the re-insurer may assume all or any part of the risk of the original underAA’riter. It is but a modification of the contract of insurance, in which the thing insured is the same as in the original policy; but the'subject of indemnity is the risk assumed by the first insurer. It is very similar to the common case of simple insurance in favor of a mortgagee, who becomes insured against loss of the property mortgaged, which, in such case, is the subject of risk, whilst the subject of indemnity is the mortgage debt. In granting the poAver to take risks generally, and AYithout limitation as to its mode of exercise, the 7th section conferred the privilege of taking them by re-insurance as well as by original contract; and this conclusion is not, in the master’s opin<a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>ion, affected by the addition of the words ‘ and to re-insure themselves,’ for they are cumulative, and are inserted in extension and not in limitation of the grant. The power <em>to insure, </em>in <em>every </em>lawful mode had, by the previous language, been already given, and by these words the right to <em>he insured </em>was added. By the charter of the State Mutual Insurance Company, Pamph. L. 1853, p. 83 — and ¶ there are probably many others which are like it — that company was empowered ‘to insure all kinds of property against loss or damage by fire,’ * * * ‘and to cause themselves to be insured against any loss, damage or risk in the course of their business.’ The word re-insure was not used, but it cannot be doubted that power to do so was included in that to insure generally, and the privilege of being in turn insured is <em>added. </em>The same purpose was in view when the 7th section of the Act of 1856 was drafted, and it expresses it precisely, although in fewer words.</p>

That such surrender and delegation are unlawful, was claimed, both upon general principles of law relating to corporations, and under the fourth section of the general insurance act (Purd. Dig. 791, pi. 4), which latter provides that ‘the affairs of said company shall be managed by twelve directors,’ * * * ‘and the directors’ <em>* * </em>* ‘ shall appoint a president and vice-president of the company, and such other officers and agents as they may deem necessary for conducting the business of the corporation ; who shall perform the duties of the respective offices until they shall be reelected, removed from office, or their successors shall be chosen,’ &amp;c.</p>

It will be found that all these objections are dependent upon the right of the Fame company to make and contract for re-insurances; for the matters here objected appear to be necessarily incident to the taking of a risk in that form. In Philadelphia Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Washington Ins. Co., before cited, the language of the policy of re-insurance was, so far as this question is concerned, the same as in this agreement, viz.: ‘subject to such risks, valuations, conditions and mode of settlement as are <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>or may be assumed or adopted by them;’ yet neither the very able counsel who argued that case, nor the eminent judge who delivered the opinion of the court upon it, suggested any doubt of the power to make the contract.</p>

An insurance corporation has undoubted power to employ agents to examine and report the number and nature of risks to be taken by it, and to rely upon the discretion of those agents; and no reason is perceived why, with equal propriety, the same questions might not be determined by reliance upon another company whose interest is the same, or why a re-insuring company may not lawfully agree that its premiums and amounts of insurance shall be ascertainable by reference to those of the company to be re-insured, instead of stating those particulars specifically in each instance.</p>

In the first place, the agreement, as before stated, is not in itself a policy, and is by no means within the mischief just mentioned ; for it was made between two insurance companies, each, presumably, equally well acquainted with the business about which they were contracting, and neither of them making any representations to the other, as that word is generally applied; and, although it is true, according to the master’s finding, that the Fame company were not informed of the acts of the Enterprise which are now complained of, yet the right, and therefore, perhaps, the <em>duty </em>to inform themselves were theirs, under the agreement ; which provided, not that the Fame company might examine the agent’s reports only as to the risks which were' reported by the Enterprise to the Fame, but as to ‘ such risks <em>as are provided for in this contract.’ </em>It is hardly possible that the officers of the respective companies would have replied in the affirmative if, at the time of the execution of this agreement, they had been asked whether they understood and intended that in case the Enterprise company (with this power of complete examination in the Fame) should fail to give all, or happen to give more risks to the latter than provided by "their contract, the right of the Enterprise to recover for losses upon other risks, which had been actually given and accepted, and the premiums thereon paid, in accordance with the agreement, would be absolutely <em>forfeited, </em>as in the case of false representation*touching premises to be insured,' and amounting to warranty in an ordinary policy. And yet the cardinal point to be reached in the construction of every contract, is the intention of the parties at the time they made it.</p>

It was simply a covenant or undertaking to be performed in the future — a promise, not even a representation.

Under the authority last cited, this stipulation could not be, in strictness, a warranty; and, as already shown, the agreement is not a policy. But a contract which is not a policy may contain a covenant, the non-performance of which will practically work a forfeiture, although that covenant be not technically a warranty; for ‘ it seems to be -well settled that when there is a stipulation amounting to a <em>condition </em>precedent, the failure of one party to perform such condition will excuse the other party from all further performance of stipulations depending upon such prior performance ; but a failure to perform an independent stipulation, not amounting to a condition precedent, though it subject the party failing to damages, does not excuse the party on the other side from the performance of all stipulations on his part:’ Shaw, C. J., in Milldam Foundry Co. <em>v. </em>Hovey, <em>infra. </em>In the master’s opinion, the real question upon this branch of the present case arises under the principle of law just stated; and the solution of that question involves the inquiry whether the covenant, as to the class and limitation of the risks to. be taken by the Fame company, was one upon which the obligations of that company under the agreement <em>depended, </em>or, in other words, whether it was or was not a <em>condition precedent. </em>On behalf of defendants, it was contended that it went to the whole consideration, for the Fame company might well have been willing to make a contract for all, and no more, of certain described risks, but still wholly unwilling to take either'less or more than precisely -what they had in view, and stipulated for, as a safe or profitable number, amount or proportion. This argument is not AYithout Aveight; but if it should prevail, the injustice Avhieh would result to plaintiffs AYOuld be greater than that which it is urged will be done to the defendants by disregarding it; for, if the plaintiffs were not permitted to recover upon the re-insurances which were actually perfected in accordance Avith the agreement, then would they fail to obtain the indemnity for which they had actually and in good faith contracted and paid; Avhilst in requiring the defendants to indemnify the plaintiffs in those cases, the right of the former to full compensation for any loss or injury to them arising from the plaintiff’s failure to perform their covenants, is in no Avise impinged.

Substantial equity has been done, and the interests of justice require the decree to stand.</p>
