Gr. Minehart &amp; Sons, and that the personal property levied upon and sold was the exclusive property of A. Gr. Minehart. "Whether he was right in this finding of fact it will be unnecessary to consider, as we are clearly of the opinion that it was not a question properly involved in the distribution. ITe was evidently misled by a cursory examination of the cases he cites, without observing -a marked distinction between them and that which was before him for determination : Appeal of the York County Bank, 8 Casey 446 ; Vandike’s Appeal, 5 Harris 271; Cope’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20284" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Wright 284">3 Wright 284</a>. These were all contests between separate and partnership execution-creditors, in which the sheriff had levied and sold under all the writs, and so made, return. Neither party was concluded by the return made upon any execution except his own, and his own was in his favor. It followed that there were contradictory returns — as to whether the'goods from which the money had been made was separate or partnership property — and it was held in those cases that the court were bound of necessity to inquire and determine the fact, in order to enable them to distribute the fund. But the facts here were entirely different. Upon the execution of Brown, Kunkle &amp; Co. the sheriff made return that he had “ levied on all the interest of A. Gr. Minehart in the business of A. G. Minehart &amp; Sons, said partnership ¡property consisting of ready-made clothing, &amp;c., and subsequently sold said property as that of A. G. Minehart &amp; Sons, as per return to fi. fa. Nos. 144 and 150, of June 7th 1875.” The fi. fa. No. 144, to which the sheriff refers in this return, was one in favor of Stein &amp; Co. against A. G. Minehart &amp; Sons, and No. 150 a similar execution in favor of Henry Bogue &amp; Son. To No. 144 the sheriff made return that he had levied on all the following described personal property belonging to the defendants A. G. Minehart &amp; Sons, to wit: a lot of ready-made clothing, &amp;c. “ After due and legal notice given, as required by law, I sold the same for the sum of $2404.07, which money, on leave given, I paid into court for distribution according to law.” Upon the other partnership executions he returned severally that he had “ levied on personal property of defendants, and sold the same as per return to fi. fa. No. 144.”</p>
