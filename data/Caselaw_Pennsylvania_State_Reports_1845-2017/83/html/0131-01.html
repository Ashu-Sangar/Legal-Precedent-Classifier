Neither party seemed to have been in anger, and the matter appeared to have been dropped finally, when Meyers ceased talking about it.</p>

Dorn, it appeared, went out several times through the day, evidently, as his condition indicated, for the purpose of getting more liquor; but Meyers remained in his room, coming out once to get a drink, until about 3 o’clock in the afternoon, when he .came into the saloon, and sat down at a table to play “ casino,” for the drinks, with one of the women, Meyers winning the game, and taking whiskey for his drink. While engaged in the game, Dorn sat down by the table and took up the woman’s cards, when Meyers told him to lay them down, and upon his refusal to comply, threw the water in his glass, but seemingly not in anger, in Dorn’s face, who in turn betrayed no anger, said nothing, and quietly remained sitting in his chair.</p>

Meyers then yent to the stove, and picking up the fireqDoker, stuck it in a hole in the lower part of the stove, where he let it remain until the point was heated to a white heat, when, drawing it forth and flourishing it around, and, in the words of one witness, “ fooling around and laughing,” he advanced towards Dorn and made a thrust at him, with the fatal effects above mentioned. Dorn made no resistance nor outcry, and sat still on the bench, no one apparently thinking he was seriously hurt, until a few minutes afterwards, when one of the women hearing something, as she told it, “ like a hydrant running;” upon examination it was discovered to .be the blood of Dorn dripping through his pantaloons upon the floor. Meyers, after the thrust at Dorn, laid the poker down in the. coal-box, took another drink, and went back to bed. Shortly thereafter he returned to the saloon, when one of the women said, “Fred, we had better go for a doctor,” and he replied, “It is of no use,” but afterwards gave her money to buy a plaster to staunch the blood. He then helped to carry Dorn into an adjoining room, and laid him on the floor, and once more returned to his bed. Dorn was removed to the homeopathic hospital, where he died on the 16th of March 1876. The physician of the hospital testified that the poker had penetrated about two inches, and had it not been bent it would have “gone more downward and not upward,” and not have penetrated the abdominal cavity, and the injury inflicted would have been less severe.</p>

If that intention is wanting, therefore, there can be no conviction of murder of the first degree. All murder, therefore, which is not of the first degree, as suggested and defined by the statute, is <em>necessarily </em>of the second degree, and includes all unlawful killing under circumstances of depravity of heart, and a disposition of mind regardless of social duty, and fatally bent on mischief; but where no <em>intention to hill </em>exists, or can be reasonably and fully inferred.

Manslaughter is defined to be the unlawful killing of another without malice, express or implied; which may be voluntarily, in a sudden heat, or involuntarily, but in the commission of an unlawful act. Yoluntary manslaughter often so nearly approaches murder that it is necessary to distinguish it clearly. The difference is this: manslaughter is never attended by legal malice or' depravity of heart — that condition or frame of mind before spoken of, exhibiting wickedness of disposition and recklessness of consequence or ‘ cruelty. Being sometimes a wilful act (as the term voluntary denotes) it is necessary that the circumstances should take away every evidence of cool depravity of heart or wanton cruelty. Therefore, to reduce an intentional blow, stroke or wounding, resulting in death, to voluntary manslaughter, there must be sufficient cause of provocation, and a state of rage or passion, without time to cool, placing the prisoner beyond the control of his reason, and suddenly impelling him to the deed. If any of these be wanting — if there be provocation without passion, or passion without a sufficient, provocation, or there be time to cool, and reason has resumed its sway, the killing will be murder.</p>

It is claimed further, as I gathered it as I listened to the argument of the learned district attorney, as I Avas preparing these instructions, that upon the Saturday previous the defendant was attending to his business as usual; he had mind to send for a barber to come and shave him by the man he aftenvards killed; that the barber came on the Tuesday following and shaved him; that he directed the barber to shave his barkeeper ; that upon the afternoon of that day he sat down with the girl ‘ Jennie’ to play a game of casino ; that he was sufficiently himself — sufficiently up in his game to play his cards successfully, and to accomplish her defeat; and to join her in taking a drink ; and this, too, a short time previous to the killing; that he had sense enough, in order to perpetrate this offence, to put the poker into the hole of the stove, to heat it by the fire to a ‘ Avhite heat,’ <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>and to thrust it into the groin or person of the deceased; that he • was sane enough when called upon by the officers, in the first place, to demand a warrant, and then to declare that he would not go unless he was taken and carried, and then to declare that he would not go at all; and to declare that he would shoot the ‘ son of a bitch’ that would arrest him ; and then when brought to his notice that he must go — previously being in his stocking feet — he had sense enough to put on his slippers and go, &amp;c. From all these circumstances it is insisted that the defendant Avas sane at the time of the perpetration of the act. To this the defendant ansAvers, through the mouth of his witnesses, and it is urged upon you Avith great zeal and ability by his accomplished counsel, that he had, prior to this thing, been drinking to excess : that for months before that, from the time that he separated from his wife, he had given himself up to bad habits ; that from the time he came out of the workhouse he was drinking to excess ; that some íayo or three days previously he had taken poison, and from the effects of this and the drinks he had taken afterAvards, he had not recovered; and that he Avas not in a condition to know Avhat he was doing at the time. And as further evidence in that regard, they put these girls upon the stand, not as experts, but as giving their views of his mental condition. They call men who Avere in the cell with him, and they call other men to testify to his conduct and his- manner; from all of Avhich they ask you to infer that at the time of the perpetration of the act this man Avas insane. As to his conduct in the cell, it will be for you to say whether it Avas simulated or whether it was real. It will be remembered by you that Leigh detailed his conduct in the cell to you, how he sat down and told him about his troubles; the story about how he Avas committed, and cried about it. [These things Avill all enter into your deliberations in making up your minds as to his sanity, bearing in mind that the killing by the prisoner being admitted, the duty devolves Upon him to clear himself of the killing, <em>to satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt that he was insane at the time the act was com</em>mitted,.] And in deciding upon this case, or upon any material pai't of it, such as the alleged insanity of the prisoner — which is the most material part of it — it is your duty to give the prisoner the benefit of any reasonable doubt arising out of the evidence which might prevent you from coming to a satisfactory conclusion. But this doubt — I call your attention to this — must fairly arise out of the evidence, and not be merely conjured up as a figment of the imagination. Jurors greatly mistake their duty Avhen they go in search of a doubt outside of the evidence in the case. They have no right to raise a mere fanciful or ingenious doubt, to escape the consequences of an unpleasant or painful verdict. It must be an honest, it must be a conscientious doubt; such a doubt as Avould cause an ordinary, prudent man to hesitate ; such a doubt as would <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>fairly strike a conscientious mind and cloud the judgment. When the law supposes a reasonable doubt, it does not mean that you are to speculate as to whether a matter is established by the evidence to your satisfaction, and might not have been otherwise; it means that you are to take nothing for granted upon mere assertion; and it means further, that when you honestly hesitate' upon a question whether certain evidence establishes certain propositions when at the truth, and cannot come to a satisfactory conclusion as to the existence of a certain fact or not, as to its effect, then the doubt belongs to the prisoner at the bar. The difficulty, the reasonable doubt, as we have said, must be suggested by the cause itself, by the evidence incident to it, and not by the imagination of the jury.

If he has so satisfied you, if he has so convinced you beyond a reasonable doubt, such doubt being of the kind and of the character we have already discussed and defined to you, then the prisoner is not responsible for anything that he might have done] and is entitled to a verdict of acquittal at youv hands; but if, upon the other hand, he has not so convinced you and satisfied you, he should be convicted in such form, and in such degree as you, in the exercise of your best judgment and most conscientious deliberation, think just and right under all the evidence which has been submitted to you. With the consequences of your verdict you have nothing to do. Those who take up the sword, as we have it upon high authority, must perish by the sword, and he who sows the wind need not be surprised if he should reap the whirlwind. The defendant, and not the Commonwealth, has made the bed upon which he lies to-day; and if the bed is so short that he cannot stretch himself, or if it is so long he cannot cover it, it is the fault of the prisoner, and not of the Commonwealth. Should you be of the opinion that the man is not insane, that he was sane at the time of the perpetration of the act; but if you should be of opinion that he had no intent to kill, which is the essence, which is the very heart of murder, if he was not guilty of wilful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, and still sane, then you can find him guily of murder in the second degree, if you think it right under the evidence.

As, for example, if you have a reasonable doubt that he had an intention to kill; that his conduct did not evidence wilfulness, deliberation, and premeditation, then you should find him guilty of murder in the second degree. If, coming still further down, you find his conduct did not indicate such a degree of crime, and you have a reasonable doubt about it, then you should find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter ; and [if, as I have already stated, you find him wholly irresponsible, <em>if he has satisfied you beyond a reasonable </em>doubt, a conscientious doubt arising out of the case, that he had no moral sense, that he was, in plain phrase, a madman at the time of the perpetration of the offence, then he should be acquitted of all crime, and you should so note the fact, and acquit him upon the ground of insanity].”</p>

It appears in several parts of the charge, leaving no doubt as to the meaning of the learned judge who presided at the trial. It must, therefore, have impressed the minds of the jurors. Without specifying each instance, it may be summed up in a single statement, that the judge instructed the jury, that they must be satisfied <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>that the' prisoner was insane at the time the act was committed. This statement is too stringent and throws the prisoner upon a degree of proof beyond the legal measure of his defence. That measure is simply proof which is satisfactory — such as flows fairly from a preponderance of the evidence. It need not be beyond doubt. A reasonable doubt of the fact of insanity, on the other hand, is not sufficient to acquit upon a defence of insanity. This has been held in several cases : Ortwein <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 26 P. F. Smith 414; Lynch <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 27 <a href="/ohio-st/10/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Ohio St. 598" data-case-ids="516116" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/10/0486-01">Id.</a> 205 ; Brown <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 28 Id. 122. Sanity being the normal condition of men, and insanity a defence set up to an act which otherwise would be a crime, the burthen rests upon the prisoner of proving his abnormal condition. But the evidence of this need be only satisfactory — and the conclusion such as fairly results from the evidence. Where the evidence raises a balancing question, and the mind is brought to determine its preponderance, there may be a doubt still existing in the mind, yet the actual <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>weight may be with the prisoner; and this proof should be considered satisfactory. In cases of conflicting evidence the preponderance must govern, there being no other rational means of decision. But if we say in such a case it must be satisfactory <em>beyond </em>a reasonable doubt, it is evident the expression implies more than a mere preponderance. It is difficult to define the precise difference between the two measures, yet we are conscious in our own minds that to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt is a severer test of belief than to be satisfied that the preponderance falls on that side. Probably the true reason of the difficulty in defining the difference lies in the inability to define a reasonable doubt. A reasonable doubt must be an honest and conscientious difficulty in believing, one not merely subtle or ingenious — it must arise out of the evidence, and not be fanciful, or be conjured up to escape consequences. It must strike the mind with such force as to compel it to pause in yielding belief. These are characteristics, but do not define the measure of belief, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge stated well all these characteristics, and yet in conclusion said, by way of illustration of his meaning, <em>“ </em>If the beam Ayaver, then the doubt is throAvn into the defendant’s scale; but the jury must not so hold the beam as to cause it to tremble either in ’favor of the Commonwealth or the defendant.” Now, if we apply this illustration of the reasonable doubt which operates to acquit a prisoner, to the evidence of his insanity, and say that his proof of the fact shall be beyond a reasonable doubt, and if the beam wavers, it is to be found against his defence, we discover that it implies a -higher degree of proof to establish the defence of insanity than the laAv warrants. It must be not only satisfactory, but be satisfactory beyond a rear sonable doubt. The beam must not waver when preponderating to the defendant’s scale, but it must go down quickly. It seems to us, therefore, that this expression, so often repeated to the jury, must have impressed them with a belief that a high measure of proof of the insanity of the prisoner Avas required. The distinction may appear nice, yet we must not overlook the effect of language upon common minds, Avhen the stake is life. Justice cannot suffer it to be imperilled beyond a just measure of belief in those Avho are the triers. Common minds do not analyze accurately the degrees of belief, or the nature of the doubts which affect it. We think, therefore, there was error in stating the degree of belief in regard to the defence of insanity too strongly. .</p>

We have held, in <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>the case of Grant <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 21 P. F. Smith 495, that when the ingredients of murder in the first degree are proved to exist, the power of this court to grant a new trial ceases. But there may be cases — and perhaps this is one of them — where the facts, from which the intention to kill (the principal ingredient in murcler of the first degree) may be inferred, are so doubtful that different views of their operation may be taken. Where a jury, who hear the witnesses and observe their conduct, take the darker view, and believe the intent to kill existed, and in this view are sustained by the court below, it is a nice question how far our views of the evidence should prevail to grant a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b143-6" data-blocks='[["BL_143.6",143,[177,883,1171,638]]]'>We abstain from indicating any opinion on this question ; yet it is not amiss to suggest, as there must be a new trial, that a careful inquiry should be made how far the facts disclose any intent to take life. The intent to do grievous bodily harm was clear, and the prisoner’s frame of mind was undoubtedly malicious, and hence the case was one of murder. But whether the prisoner intended to take the life of the deceased is not so clear. The place at which he aimed the heated poker, viz., the groin, and not at a vital organ, and the direction the poker would have taken, to wit, downwards, instead of into the abdomen, had not the end of the poker been bent, and the entire conduct and demeanor of the prisoner before and after the occurrence, altogether are circumstances which may not convince the mind of an actual intention to take life, while they lead to a conclusive belief of an intent to do great bodily harm.</p>

I hold it to be the duty of a judge trying a man for his life to charge fully upon the law as applicable to the facts. And this without regard to the points presented by counsel. The rule that a judge is not to be convicted of error for what he omits to say, unless his attention is called to the subject by a point or request to charge, is well enough in civil cases, but ought not, in my judgment, to be applied to a capital case. The prisoner has a right to have the jury properly instructed upon every question of law legitimately raised by the evidence. This right he cannot waive, nor can his counsel do so for him. In this case the charge was wholly inadequate. This was probably owing to the fact that the prisoner’s counsel mistook their line of defence. They relied to a great extent upon the ground of insanity. Upon this point there was no evidence worth submitting to the jury. There was nothing to show that general insanity which dethrones reason and relieves from legal and moral responsibility. But there was abundant evidence of that condition of partial insanity produced by <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>excessive drinking, which, Avhile it is no excuse for crime, is nevertheless sufficient to prevent the formation in the mind of that deliberate intent to kill, which is of the essence of murder of the first degree. In other words, the defence Avas insanity instead of intoxication. Of the former there was no evidence: of the latter there was abundant. The points put by the prisoner’s counsel referred to insanity, and the learned judge charged elaborately upon this branch of the case. His rulings, Avhether correct or otherwise, had-no application to the facts. The defence set up having utterly failed, I am not surprised that the jury convicted of the capital offence. Had the laAV, as applicable to intoxication, been properly submitted to them, it is possible they Avould have comdcted the prisoner only of murder of the second degree. It is not necessary to elaborate. I concur cheerfully in the judgment.</p>
