In an action by a mutual insurance company to recover assessments made on a premium-note of defendants, the record of a former suit between the same parties for other assessments, where it did not disclose the particular facts for which it was oifered, was properly rejected.</p>

The fact that no other suits had been brought to recover losses was wholly irrelevant, and the court was not bound to separate the offer and admit a part. Whether the latter part of the offer by itself would be evidence it is difficult to determine. The offer should have been made in more clear and specific terms to show that the company did not sustain the alleged losses for the payment of which the assessments in controversy were made; or, if so sustained, that they had been paid by assessments made and collected prior to the assessments now in question. If the insured can show fraud or clear mistake in making the assessments it will constitute a defence: Jones <em>v. </em>

The eighth section of the act of incorporation declares, when an action is brought for the recovery of the assessment on a premium-note, “ the certificate of the secretary specifying the assessment and the amount due on such note by means thereof, shall be taken and received as primá facie evidence thereof in all courts Of this Commonwealth.” That is, as evidence of “ the assessment and the amount due” by reason of the assessment. The manifest design of the statute is to make the certificate of the secretary primá facie evidence; that the necessities of the company justified the assessment, and that it was duly and legally made.' No evidence having been given to rebut this presumption this assignment is not sustained.</p>

The case of Thornton <em>et al. v. </em>The Western Reserve Farmers’ Ins. Co., 7 Casey 529, is cited to show that the want of notice can be plead in abatement only. There is a <em>dictum </em>to that effect in the opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Loavrie ; but the report of the case shows that notice of the assessment was averred in the claim filed, and proved on the trial. The question in that case appears to have arisen on the language of a statute of Ohio, Avhich prescribed the averments to be set set forth in the declaration, and that it should therein be averred that notice had been given thirty days before the commencement of the suit. The omission of that averment was interposed as a defence; but the fact of notice was not controverted. That case was ruled on the pleadings. In the present case no question Avas raised in the court below in regard to the pleadings. The company appears to have recognised the necessity of its proving notice. It gave some evidence tending to shoAV it, but not sufficient to say it Ayas conclusively proved. The witness testified, “ Notices of these assessments Avere sent out by the officers of the company.” When or Iioav sent, or to whom, is not stated. The insured plaintiffs in error deny having received any notice. It may be that the jury would have found the evidence of notice sufficient; but the question should have been submitted to it, and its sufficiency not decided by the court.</p>
