An investigation disclosed the fact that the entire capital stock of the company had been lost, and that its assets were insufficient to pay its creditors, and these actions were brought by plaintiffs to recover damages for the losses they had sustained, as they alleged, through the negligence of the directors in the discharge of their duties.</p>

This is a common-law action for negligence against the directors of the bank. The negligence charged is a neglect of duty by which the entire capital of the company was lost and the institution became insolvent. The plaintiff charges no act of negligence by which she was specially injured. The acts charged affect alike the defendants and all other stockholders, and all the creditors of the institution. The principle which' would allow a common-law action against the directors by each stockholder for a total loss of his stock, would sustain such an action for a partial loss or for a depreciation in the market price.

Yet, if each stockholder can maintain his individual action against the directors, a few of them might bankrupt the directors and leave nothing for the creditors or the other stockholders.</p>

The plaintiffs have sustained no loss that is not common to all the other stockholders, nor have they special ground of complaint against the defendants. That the corporation itself may maintain an action against the board of directors, in a proper case, for their gross negligence whereby the capital or assets of the corporation are lost or impaired, would seem to be indisputable. In such an action, would not the recovery be the amount of the loss ? And is it possible that every individual stockholder can have his action ? Suppose there be one hundred stockholders, and ninety-nine of them having brought separate actions, had recovered, would' the judgments in these cases bar an action by the corporation ? or would such recoveries affect the measure of damages in a suit brought by the corporation ? It seems not, because the corporation would recover primarily for its creditors. Such grievance can only be properly redressed so as to do justice to all parties in interest, to wit, the creditors, the corporation and the individual stockholders, in one of the two modes already suggested — a bill in equity, or a common-law action by the corporation.</p>
