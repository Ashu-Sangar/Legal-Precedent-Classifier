On the same day Collins said to Jamison &amp; Co. that he must have money on these acceptances, as he was going to Virginia. . Jamison &amp; Co. agreed, and Collins thereupon drew his check upon his individual account for $5000, which was cashed by Jamison &amp; Co. the same day.

Collins, who was at this time in Virginia, was informed by Jamison &amp; Co. of the refusal of the bank to discount the acceptances without his endorsement, went to Harrisburg and saw Mr. Mackey, the vice-president of the bank, made an arrangement by which his written guarantee was agreed to be accepted as equivalent to his endorsement, returned to Philadelphia,'and gave the guarantee to Jamison &amp; Co., with instructions to send it and the acceptances again to the bank at Pittsburgh, and when a letter should come from the bank to him to open it, sign his name to the <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>paper, and place the proceeds to his credit. Accordingly, the acceptances were again forwarded by Jamison &amp; Co., with the guarantee of Collins, to the Allegheny National Bank, in a letter dated August 16th 1871.

He had drawn his check for $5000 on the proceeds of the discount by anticipation, and it had been paid by Jamison &amp; Co.; he had conducted the negotiations with the Allegheny Bank in his own name; the bank, according to Mr. Mackey’s testimony, recognised no one else in the transaction, and it had remitted the proceeds of the discount by a cheek to his order, inclosed in a letter directed to him, in care of Jamison &amp; Co. In all of his dealings with Jamison &amp; Co., Collins had treated the acceptances as his property ; had directed the application of the proceeds on the ordinary basis of a depositor dealing with a bank as his agents, and Jamison &amp; Co. had, by acquiescence in that basis of dealing — by honoring his check for what would have been otherwise an overdrawing of his account to the extent of $2000, by charging the costs of the stamps to his account, and by their letters to the Allegheny Bank in reference to the discount — recognised the title of Collins, and their position as his agents.</p>

Jamison &amp; Co., for Collins, and the proceeds, $14,602,50, passed to his credit in his account with them as bankers. The note, however, was discounted without the endorsement of Collins, and so far as appears without any right of recourse to him. He had, however, informed them that he did not intend to draw the proceeds for some time, as he was already in advance to the Improvement Company, and did not intend to get any deeper.

He was not their debtor in any way Avhen the acceptances were delivered to them, except for the overdraft, by reason of his check for $5000, drawn on the same day, and that was drawn by him and paid by them, on the basis that the acceptances were his, and the money raised by their discount was virtually already to the credit of his individual account. Even if he was their debtor, it was upon this individual account, and his delivery of the acceptances to them, with positive instructions to place the proceeds to his credit, was an appropriation which it was his right to make, which he did make by that act, and which they conclusively assented to by receiving the acceptances without notice to him of any contrary claim or intention.</p>

Scott, amounting to $25,000. The actions are between Collins and B. EY Jamison &amp; Co. as bankers, and not between Collins and the Central Improvement Co., or B. K. Jamison, its treasurer. The right of the Improvement Co. to call Collins to ah account for the funds raised upon these drafts is therefore not in issue, but it is a question whether Jamison &amp; Co., bankers, who came to the possession of the proceeds for and on account of Collins, can through the act of Jamison, treasurer, divert these proceeds into a different channel, in order to pay themselves a debt ($15,000) for which Collins was not responsible to them. For these reasons the fact that the Improvement Co. raised the funds for their own benefit is aside from the present inquiry. Now the judge below has found, and so far as we can determine justifiably, the fact that Collins, as the superintendent, was intrusted with and had the lawful possession of the drafts, as the means of obtaining money, which was to go into his own hands for expenditure. He gave them to Jamison &amp; Co., as bankers, for his own account and credit. The money was in fact raised through his means, and the check which represented the proceeds, was payable to himself, and went into the <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>hands of Jamison &amp; Co., bankers, as his agents in the transaction of the negotiation. It is just here where the interposition of B. K. Jamison, treasurer, became improper. He had no right to divert tile proceeds of the check in the hands of Jamison &amp; Co., bankers, the agents of Collins, from his account with them; and place them to his own credit as treasurer of the Improvement Co., and then debit that account with the $515,000 note, which was no debt of Collins. The effect of this transaction was to take the proceeds of the drafts on Scott out of the very hands to which the Improvement Co. had entrusted them, and thus to disable Collins as their superintendent and proper agent, from disbursing them for the benefit of the company. The confusion of names as to the capacity of Jamison makes it a little difficult to state the transaction clearly, but if these drafts had been left Avith Drexel &amp; Co. as bankers, we should perceive at once that Jamison as treasurer could not have intervened to change the destination of the proceeds.</p>
