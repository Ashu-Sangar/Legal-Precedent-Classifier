She was directed to divide the estate of her testator amongst £ such’ of his and her £ relations’ as she might deem most worthy. The use of the word £ such’ implied a power of selection: Huntley <em>v. </em>Gregson, 1 Term R. 432; Spring <em>v. </em>Biles, 2d (note). It follows that the beneficiaries named in the will of Alcy Beggs, deceased, were well appointed, whether within or without the statute of distribution. In what shares or proportions are these beneficiaries to stand ? Andrew Beggs directed that his estate should <em>‘ </em>be equally divided’ between <em>‘ </em>such of his wife’s and his relations as she might deem most worthy.’ Whatever of difficulty there may be, appears on the face of the will, and may be solved by the application of the ordinary rules of construction in such cases: Best <em>v. </em>Hammond, 5 P. F. Smith 412. How then shall division be made ? The authorities agree that where a testator designates the objects of his bequest or devise by their relationship to living ancestors, such legatees or devisees take not by representation, but <em>immediately </em>of the testator and <em>per capita. </em>The reference to living ancestors is merely descriptive of the objects of bounty, and excludes the <em>per stirpes </em>rule: Witmer <em>v. </em>Ebersole, 5 Barr 458.</p>

There as here the testator had given his estate to his wife for life, and directed that at her decease said estate should £ be divided between her and my poor relations equally.’ The same question was raised and discussed there as here with respect to the proper mode of distribution. The bequest was construed as though the word £ poor’ had not been used, so that the two cases, so far as the question of distribution is concerned, are in <em>quatuor pedibus </em>with each other.</p>

It is well settled that the execution of a power may be good as to part: Hegarty’s Appeal, 25 P. F.

After the expiration of the life estate of his wife, he directs the property to “be equally divided between her relations and mine.” He and his wife were childless. There was no issue of either to whom the property could be transmitted. It may have been the joint product of their industry and economy. This or some other moving cause prompted him to direct that the property be “ equally divided ” between families of different blood. The language clearly points to one general division, one separation of the fund. Two classes were in his mind. One class was his relations, the other class was his wife’s relations. The property was to be equally divided “ between” these two classes, and each class to take one half. His relations one half, his wife’s relations the other half. Neither the language nor the spirit of the will indicates that each relation should have an equal share. To reach such a result would require all the relations of each, the testator and his wife, to be thrown together in one class, regardless of their relative number. So, if the wife had twenty and the testator two, her relations would take ten times as much as his relations. That would be a most manifest disregard of the direction for an equal division between the two families.</p>
