    <p class="summary" id="b234-6" data-blocks='[["BL_234.6",234,[249,488,1166,561]]]'>“ But even if * * * there were reasons sufficient to authorize an injunction to issue in ordinary cases, which I do not say is the case, the first and only section of the Act of 8th of April 1846 deprives me, I think, of jurisdiction to grant an injunction in this case. It provides ‘ that no courts within the city and county of Philadelphia shall exercise the power of a court of chancery, in granting or continuing injunctions against the erection or use of any public works of any kind, erected or in progress of erection, under the authority of an act of the legislature, until the question of title and damages shall be submitted and finally decided by a common-law court; and in such cases the courts shall have authority to issue a venire for the summoning of a jury to the sheriff of an adjoining county.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b234-7" data-blocks='[["BL_234.7",234,[248,1049,1164,601]]]'>“ It is admitted, as already remarked, in the plaintiffs’ bill, that the work towards the erection of these buildings had been begun before filing the bill, and that fully accords with the affidavits of the defendants. It matters not that comparatively little had been done. The first stroke of the axe or the pick, with a view to the erection of the buildings, brings their case within the provisions of the act which forbids an injunction in the first instance. It is obviously not the amount of the work done or progress made in the erection of the buildings which ousts the jurisdiction in chancery. It is, as the act plainly shows, the fact of being in progress of erection which is to have that effect: Wolbert <em>v. </em>The City, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20439" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Wright 439">12 Wright 439</a>; Flanagan <em>v. </em>The City, a recent case before Sharswood, J., at <em>nisi prim, </em>arising out of the Penrose Ferry bridge over the Schuylkill.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b234-8" data-blocks='[["BL_234.8",234,[248,1650,1162,303]]]'>“ The fact being found that work had been commenced towards the erection of the buildings authorized by the Act of 1870, before this bill was filed, it follows that no injunction can be granted to stop its progress until a resort has been had to a common-law court, as provided by the Act of 1846. Till then jurisdiction in chancery is suspended, at least. What may be done after that resort I am not prepared to say.</p>

I confess myself at a loss to understand the purpose for which the Act of 1846 was passed, unless to prevent injunctions in every case of public buildings. If it should turn out in any case, as it probably would in this, that no dispute about title or damages to be assessed would arise, would the proceedings fall or. revert to equity jurisdiction ? This is one of the problems connected with the act which I am not able to solve, but which will not for that reason allow me to disregard the positive prohibition that ‘ no court in the city and county of Philadelphia shall exercise the power of a court of chan<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>eery in granting injunctions against the erection of public works of any kind * * * until the questions of title and damages shall be submitted and finally decided by a common-law court.’ This strikes down the power in chancery in this case. I can make nothing else of it. But I need not enlarge. I regard either of the foregoing reasons sufficient to prevent me from granting the preliminary injunction asked for in this case.”</p>
