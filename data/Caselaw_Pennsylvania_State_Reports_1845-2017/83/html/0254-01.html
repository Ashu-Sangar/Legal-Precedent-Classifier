Wattson and another against the Chester and Delaware River Railroad Co., to recover the amount due for land taken and occupied by the company for railroad purposes. The action was originally brought in Delaware county and was removed to Philadelphia county by the plaintiffs in September 1874, under the Acts of 14th April 1834 (Pamph. L. 395), and 28th April 1870 (Pamph. L. 1292). The <em>narr., </em>which was filed in Philadelphia county, set forth as a cause of action the taking by the defend ant of the plaintiffs’ land in Chester county for railroad jrarposes. The plea set forth that the cause of action, if any, arose in Chester county, and therefore the Common Pleas of Philadelphia had no jurisdiction. The plaintiffs demurred to the plea on the ground that it showed no reason why the jurisdiction should be ousted.</p>

Cases may arise wherein the old statute and the new Constitution may be made to harmonize; but this is not one of them, for it relates to the existence of the power itself. It was argued that the legislar ture had not yet designated the method by which the courts could act; in some eases that argument might have weight. There are, however, no legal reasons, and no reasons of public policy, which will permit the courts to strain the construction of this section in the new Constitution, and thus mould the organic law of the state.”</p>

By the second section of the schedule, “ All laws in force in this Commonwealth at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, not inconsistent therewith, and all rights, actions, prosecutions and contracts shall continue as if this Constitution had not been adopted.” The effect of this saving section, intended to bridge over the chasm betAveen the íavo frames of government, and make the transition from one to the other easy and Avithout unnatural disturbances of the affairs of the people, it has been held by us, is to preserve the laws in existence, whenever legislation is necessary to carry the provisions of the neAY Constitution into proper effect. If the effect AYere held to be immediate, the consequence Avould be, that there AYOuld be no laAY Avhatever to regulate the poAver ; for in this case the power of the court to change the venue is “ to be exercised in such manner as shall be provided by law.” Until the manner of its exercise is prescribed by a suitable laAY, it is evident the court can have- no guide as to the cases, the grounds, or the mode of making the change. The power of changing the venue is not inherent in our county courts, as it is in those whose jurisdiction extends over greater areas.
