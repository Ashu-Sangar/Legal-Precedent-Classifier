    <p class="headnotes" id="b293-4" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[204,521,1164,341]]]'>1. One of the conditions of the policy of a mutual fire insurance company declared that if the amount assessed upon the premium-note given on the policy was not paid within thirty days after demand, then the policy should be void. One assessment was made upon the premium-note of a member insured for five years, on the 10th of May 1873, and another .on the 12th of January 1874; due notice of each assessment was given and demand of payment made. Before the court below, it was contended that the non-payment of the first assessment, within thirty days after demand, avoided the policy, and the second assessment could not be lawfully made, which contention the court sustained. <em>Held </em>to be error.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.6",293,[202,866,1165,282]]]'>2. Although a condition be attached to a policy, declaring it void on a failure to pay an assessment upon a premium-note within a specified time, yet the policy does not thereby become <em>ipso facto </em>void. The company may, at its option, declare the policy cancelled, and notify the delinquent, or may waive its right of avoidance. In the former ease the premium-note is not liable to assessment for the payment of future losses. In the latter the contract relation is not wholly dissolved, but the protection of the policy is suspended until the default of non-payment is removed.</p>

    <p id="b295-9" data-blocks='[["BL_295.11",295,[207,1187,1168,259]]]'>This was a ease stated. The plaintiff is a mutual fire insurance company. The insurance was taken for five years from the 9th of September 1871. The claim was for two assessments on the premium-note. One was made on the 10th of May 1873, the other on the 12th of January 1874. Due notice of each assessment had immediately been given, and demand of payment made.</p>
    <p id="b295-10" data-blocks='[["BL_295.12",295,[203,1447,1169,519]]]'>One of the conditions of the policy declared, “whenever an assessment has been made by the directors of this company, on the premium-notes of its members, if tbe amount assessed on the premium-note given on this policy is not paid within thirty days from the time the same is demanded by said company, then this policy shall be void. But the said company shall have a right to collect the amount due on said assessment.” Section second of the act of incorporation provides that, “all persons who shall hereafter insure with the said corporation, and their executors, administrators and assigns, continuing to be insured therein, shall thereby become members thereof during the period they shall remain insured by said corporation and no longer.”</p>
    <p id="b295-11" data-blocks='[["BL_295.13",295,[204,1966,1166,172]]]'>The question now presented is whether the non-payment of the first assessment within thirty days after demand made the policy absolutely void as against the plaintiff, so that the second assessment could not be lawfully made on the premium-note.</p>
    <p id="b295-12" data-blocks='[["BL_295.14",295,[202,2138,1168,266]],["BL_296.1",296,[241,417,1167,294]]]'>In a mutual insurance company each person insured becomes a member of the body corporate. He is clothed with the rights and subject to the liabilities of a stockholder. He is both insurer and insured. The premium-notes usually constitute the principal fund or capital of the company. They are also a part of each contract of insurance. Every person who procures an insurance and gives <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>his premium-note acquires a contingent interest in every other such note then held by the company, or which it obtains during the life of his policy. They are liable to assessment for the paym'ent of losses. To secure a more prompt payment of the assessments, most companies have inserted a clause in their policies, declaring the same shall be void unless the assessment be paid within a specified time after notice.</p>
    <p id="ABh7" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[241,722,1167,214]]]'>The word void, in a contract, has often been held to mean <em>voidable </em>only, and at the election of the party wronged. The cases recognising and affirming this rule of interpretation as applied to contracts generally, are very fully collected by Mr. Chief Justice Lowrie, in Pearsoll <em>v. </em>Chapin, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%209" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 Wright 9">8 Wright 9</a>.</p>
    <p id="b296-7" data-blocks='[["BL_296.7",296,[240,935,1168,1294]]]'>Although a condition be attached'to the policy declaring it shall be void on a failure to pay an assessment within a specified time, yet the policy does not thereby become <em>ipso facto </em>void. The company may at its option declare the policy cancelled, and notify the delinquent, or may waive its right of avoidance and continue to assess the premium-note. In the former case the premium-note is not liable to assessment for the payment of future losses. In the latter case the contract relation is not wholly dissolved, but the protection of the policy is suspended until the default of non-payment is removed. On the payment of the assessments the policy revives in its full vigor. The delinquent holder of the policy cannot sustain an action for a loss sustained while he is thus in default. It; is said in May on Insurance, § 553, that the acts of policy-holders which may entitle the corporation to defend against claims for losses do not necessarily release such parties from liability to assessments as members. Although the policy may provide that the person becoming a member shall continue a member so long as he is insured and no longer, yet if it stipulates that in case of forfeiture by the act of the insured, he shall not be released from the obligations of the premium-note until he has complied with the conditions of the policy and charter, requiring the payment of his proportion of all losses and expenses that may have accrued prior to the surrender of the policy or alienation of the property, the insured will still remain liable on his deposit or premium-note, for losses occurring after, as well as before, the alienation or act working the forfeiture, until all assessments are paid and the policy surrendered. The same principle is declared in Flanders on Insurance, p. 28, § 8; p. 147, § 5; Atlantic Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Goodall, <a href="/nh/35/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="35 N.H. 328" data-case-ids="8711684" data-case-paths="/nh/35/0328-01">35 N.

Thus, in Wilson <em>v. </em>Trumbull Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 7 Harris 372, one of the by-laws provided that the <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>alienation of any property insured should, <em>ipso facto, </em>make the policy void, unless notice thereof was given to the secretary and an assignment of the policy made to the purchaser within sixty days thereafter. The insured sold the property, but did not give the stipulated notice of his sale, nor did he assign the policy to the purchaser. It was held, that his premium-note ivas not liable to assessment to pay losses which accrued eight months after the sale. It was there said, he that sells his insured property excludes himself from membership and from all its liabilities thereafter accruing. He is no longer insurer or insured. He can claim no benefits nor be bound for any subsequent losses. Interest in the property insured is an essential link in the relation of insurance. The same principle is declared in' Finley <em>et al. v. </em>Lycoming County Mutual Ins. Co., 6 Casey 311.</p>
