Its lands were represented by shares of stock. Greenleaf sold his shares in the company to Morris and Nicholson, and received their obligations in payment of the same, the shares to be retained by Greenleaf to secure the payment of these obligations. Before their maturity, Greenleaf by deed conveyed certain property to Simpson, in trust, to secure the payment of these obligations that he had passed to different parties, and later assigned the shares to Pratt <em>et al., </em>successors of Simpson, in this trust; subsequently a deed was made by Greenleaf of the first part, Fox of the second part, Morris and Nicholson of the third part, and Pratt <em>et al. </em>of the fourth part. In this it is recited that Pratt <em>et al. </em>hold notes of Morris and Nicholson, i.n trust, for the creditors of Greenleaf, and that certain trusts were created to secure the same, and that the deed is made to better secure those debts, and conveys certain property to form an aggregate fund for the payment of certain obligations. The trustees in this deed became the holders of obligations referred to in the first deed. The fund for distribution is the amount that the shares transferred to Pratt <em>et al. </em>were entitled to from the sale of the lands of the land company: <em>Held, </em>that Pratt <em>et al., </em>trustees in the Aggregate Fund Deed, wore entitled to the fund.</p>

The capital stock of the company is described by the articles as consisting of 6,000,000 of acres of land, situate in the states above named, which were represented by 30,000 shares of 200 acres each. Every owner of a share was to become and be a member of the company during the period of his ownership of the shares, to all intents and purposes as if he had signed and sealed the articles of association. In the 23d section of the articles, Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf agree that the dividend or dividends of the company shall not be less then six per cent, per annum in every year, and in case the cash arising from sales of the land does not amount to that sum, they promise and bind themselves, their heirs, executors and administrators to advance and lend to the board of managers of the company such sum as may be necessary in addition to what they have in hand of the company’s money, to enable them to pay $6 on each share, and to secure this undertaking, Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf agree each to deposit in the hands of the trustees 3000 shares, making 9000 shares in all. It seems, however, that only 4,479,317J acres of land were conveyed by Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf to the trustees, which, in the proportion of one share for every 200 acres, were represented by 22,365 shares, which was the whole number issued. These shares were issued in equal proportions to each of the three founders, being 7455 shares to each.

The last two notes in said list, for United States Bank shares, valued at $52,000 each, total $104,000, were also produced, thus making the entire amount of original notes and drafts produced $676,500. Mr. Tilghman, the counsel, stated that he had no recollection of having ever seen, and had been unable to find among the papers of the Aggregate Fund Trust, the missing notes for $129,500, and that of those produced, $145,000 had been found by him on the 9th of June 1848, by mere accident, among the papers of the late Edward Tilghman, Esq., the original counsel [in 1797] of the trustees of the Aggregate Fund. He contended before the auditor, however, that sufficient proof of the title of the Aggregate Fund Trust to the whole $806,500 of notes, above mentioned, was furnished by the deed of June 26th 1797, creating that trust, and that the admission of that fact therein made by Morris and Nicholson,- as well as by Green-leaf, was at least primá facie evidence of such title at the present time, and rendered the production of the notes unnecessary.</p>

On this subject it appears to be established, that of the 6119 shares in question, 4970 shares appertain exclusively to schedule G. That schedule embraced the whole of Greenleaf’s original interest in the land company, which consisted nominally of 10,000 shares. Of these, however, 2545 shares were never issued, the land which they were to represent never having been conveyed to the company, and 2485 shares were at the time of issue deposited as security for dividends, and by a decree of this court, affirmed by the Supreme Court, are to be regarded as the property of the company, and therefore as merged.

They consist of the 791 transferred by G. Simpson, and 500 transferred by W. T. Franklin, the 1130 transferred by Bird, Savage &amp; Bird, 500 of the 1700 transferred by S. Bourne, and the 948 by assignment by transfer, No. 15 of those dated March 8th 1797, from Greenleaf — total 3869. The remaining 1101 shares of the 4970 are derived from 1200, the balance of the 1700 above mentioned as transferred by S. Bourne. It appears from page 16 of the North American Land Company’s journal, that of the entire 1800 shares, which on March 10th 1795 had been issued to Bourne, 600 each by Morris, Nicholson and Greenleaf, respectively, to hold in trust for them, Morris and Nicholson had equitably assigned their 1200 to Greenleaf, and recognised them as his property. From the nature of the transaction it is probable that this may be regarded as an exchange or loan of shares, and hence that so many of those shares as are needed for the purpose, to wit, 1101 shares, should be regarded as having <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>taken the place of Greenleaf’s original shares.

In regard to the other schedules, D., E. and F., the effort made to identify the particular shares embraced by them, respectively, has not been successful, and under such circumstances the auditor accordingly proposes to divide the 1149 shares among them, in the proportion of the amount of notes embraced by each to the whole amount embraced by all.

This claim was opposed by the appellants (the representatives of Robert Morris and John Nicholson, respectively), who claimed that the shares above mentioned, which stood in the name of the ‘ 381 trust,’ in reality belonged to them, the appellants. It is stated by the court that ‘ the appellants rest their title upon articles of agreement made on the 28th day of May 1796, between Greenleaf of the one part, and Morris and Nicholson of the other. By these articles it was agreed that Greenleaf should sell to Morris and Nicholson his whole interest in the North American Land Company, consisting of 10,000 shares, for the sum of fl,150,000, payable one-half in drafts of Morris on Nicholson, accepted by him, and the other half in drafts drawn by Nicholson on Morris, and accepted. The drafts were made payable in one, two, three, and four years from date.

The court in construing those articles decide expressly that they do not amount to a legal transfer of the shares, but that they constituted, at most, an executory agreement, of which the appellants were in effect asking a decree for specific performance. After thus stating the general nature and character of the appellant’s claim, the court say, that as the agreement of Greenleaf' to transfer the stock was executory, the only equitable right which Morris and Nicholson could have to demand the stock, must have arisen out of the payment of the drafts, and that nothing less could have entitled them to specific performance. Thereupon it is expressly said by the court that it is not pretended that they did pay, unless indirectly through what is called the Aggregate Eund Deed. The conclusion stated by the court is, that after a careful investigation they have been unable to discover any evidence that the drafts were ever actually paid, or in any manner satisfied, and that evidence of actual payment of the acceptances utterly fails. This is the ground upon which the decision of this part of the case is based by the court, and it will be seen that it contains no reference whatever to the six per cent, covenant, and that said covenant does not in any way appear to constitute an <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>element in the adjudication of the court. It is true, that after this statement of facts and expression of opinion, the court ask what it would avail Morris and Nicholson, even if it were conceded that they were in a position to ask specific performance in their favor ? In connection with this inquiry, the opinion of the court proceeds to say : ‘ the entire dividend on the 6119 shares would be absorbed in the debts due by them to the company, and in the claims of the other shareholders under the six per cent, guaranty, and still these debts and claims would be far from satisfied; in no aspect of the case, therefore, can a dividend upon those shares be made to the appellants. ’</p>

That there has been a change in the view taken by the Supreme Court touching the six per cent, covenant, does not seem to be seriously disputed by any of the counsel. But the auditor is of opinion, as respects this part of the case, that such change of view does not affect the construction of the agreement of May 28th 1796, or the deductions from the evidence, in pursuance of which the Supreme Court, in <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%2023" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="7 Wright 23">7 Wright 23</a>, established the title of the ‘381 trust’ to the shares in question, as against the claims of title made in behalf of the representatives of Morris and Nicholson, and that consequently that title and those claims should stand in the position in which they were placed by the case in <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%2023" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="7 Wright 23">7 Wright 23</a>, notwithstanding the subsequent decision in 10 P.

It is no more than declaring that the property set apart in the Aggregate Fund Deed, for certain specified objects, Avholly separate and distinct from those which the ‘ 381 trust’ was created to secure, shall not be applied to the ‘ 381 trust.’ The mistake of the exceptants, under this head of objection, is in supposing that such is the effect of the award of the auditor, which is founded solely on the fact that the trustees under the Aggregate Fund Trust are the legal holders of the notes and acceptances produced by them, to secure the payment of which the 6119 shares of stock Avere set apart by Greenleaf. For whose benefit they hold is another question, which can hereafter be raised at the proper time and in the proper forum. No presumption of payment of these notes arises from the fact that they are in the hands of the present accountants, who are trustees of the Aggregate Fund Trust. This position is fully answered by the restatement of the fact that when the Aggregate Fund Deed was executed, Morris <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>and Nicholson recognised the existence of the notes as well as their entire obligation to pay the same, and that they were, as to, the holders, the predecessors of the present accountants, wholly without defence.</p>

No one who reads the lengthy and well-considered opinion in that cáse can doubt that it was considered in the court upon its merits; it is decided on no technical ground, but on the broad principle that the present exceptants are without merit, that they have no standing as claimants for proceeds of 6119 shares of stock until they prove actual payment of the notes, and this the Supreme Court say they have not done. The contract of May 28th 1796 is held to be not a sale absolute for notes, with a pledge of the shares as security, but an executory contract to sell, and is incapable of any other construction. The power of the Supreme Court to go into the merits of the questions as to which the auditor and court below had decided they were without jurisdiction, is denied; and all that that court have said, under this head, in Halsey’s Appeal, is characterized as mere <em>obiter dictum. </em>We are invited, in the argument submitted, to hold that the Supreme Court having no jurisdiction, its decision of the £ 381 trust’ is neither conclusive in law nor in fact, and is <em>coram non judice. </em>To sustain this doctrine, counsel has cited Frantz <em>v. </em>Brown, 17 S. &amp; R. 292; Schuylkill County’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20459" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Wright 459">2 Wright 459</a>; Jones <em>v. </em>Jones, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%20355" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Jones 355">2 Jones 355</a>. But we do not feel free to adopt this suggestion, and thus disregard the decision of the Supreme Court, and hold that it £ can have no judicial weight with this court in now deciding the question.’ We prefer that the tribunal which decided Halsey’s Appeal should themselves first adopt this view, if the reasoning pressed upon our consideration be well grounded.</p>

Greenleaf, represented by the accountants, must make good to Morris and Nicholson the 10,000 shares which he sold to them, or restore to them their drafts. 2. He must pay them the $25,000 which he agreed to pay by the articles of May 28th 1796, the same under which he agreed to sell all his interest to Morris and Nicholson in the land company for $1,150,000, less $4738/ 3. The <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>trustee must account for the difference between 6119 and 10,000 shares. The auditor does not in his report reply in detail to these several positions taken in behalf of the administrator of John Nicholson, deceased, but says the various views pressed on behalf of Morris and Nicholson seem to begin and terminate in what substantially amounts to a claim of performance by them of the terms of the articles of agreement of sale between them and Greenleaf. Rut that there had not been performance was settled in Halsey’s Appeal, and there has been no attempt to show the contrary in point of fact up to this time; all subsequent effort, if such has been made, has brought no fact to the front which even tends to show actual payment, and the Supreme Court have said that to set up a presumption of payment will not suffice. In further support of the views of this exceptant, an equitable ground is assumed ; that Greenleaf, having taken to himself the benefit of the $1,150,000 of notes, those claiming under him should be postponed to the claim of Morris and Nicholson, who have never derived one cent of profit from what they thus bought and paid for. Rut what did they pay ? Promises which they never fulfilled; worth up to this hour to the holders just the value of the several pieces of paper on Avhich they are written.</p>

There can be no enforcement of specific performance till the party asking relief shows performance, or the tender of it, on his part. This is what the Supreme Court has already settled in this case as applicable to this very demand ; recognising the justice of this decision, we have neither the disposition nor the power to dispute or overthrow it. It stands in the way of this exceptant, so that he cannot advance a single step in furtherance of either of his propositions until he removes this barrier. To every demand which he may make, until this is done, the conclusive answer is, that as a condition precedent to the enforcement of a transfer of stock to you, you promised to pay your notes and engagements, and this you have not done; and the express agreement further was, that James Greenleaf was not to transfer until you did pay. Neither does the resulting trust, in favor of Morris and Nicholson, become effective until the notes which the stock was assigned to protect have been paid.</p>

Collins, Esq., auditor appointed to distribute the balance appearing on the second account of James Dundas, surviving trustee of the North American Land Company. It was agreed to by counsel, that the exceptions should stand over until the decision of the Supreme Court should be made. After that decision had been announced, which is reported in Ingersoll’s and Dales’s Appeal, 10 P. F. Smith 247, the following order was made: ‘ It is ordered that this report (upon which wre have just remarked) be remitted to the auditor, to enable parties supposed to be affected by the decision of the Supreme Court, to be heard, &amp;c., without the court expressing any opinion upon the question whether the rights of the exceptants are affected by said decision.’ The whole case then went back to the present auditor, which opened before him for argument the questions upon which he had originally passed. The auditor, however, upon the making up of his second report, correctly construes the order of reference as raising before him the question intended by the court, namely, to inquire and de<a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>termine whether or not, if the decision in 10 P. F. Smith 247 had been made before the conclusion of the audit, or the filing of his report, it would have had such legal bearing upon the subject before the auditor as to require a modification of the conclusions as stated, or the award as made by him. Resting on this conclusion, the auditor proceeded to examine Ingersoll’s and Dales’s Appeal, in order to ascertain what it is that is therein adjudicated, so as to reach a conclusion as to the effect of that decision upon the award which he had made in his first report.</p>

In Ingersoll’s and Dales’s Appeal, the court held that the agreement organizing the company provided for a change in the articles, which was afterwards duly and properly made, and that the pledgors were not bound unless it clearly appeared that they had agreed to do so, to transfer or. carry over into the organization as changed their original guarantee.</p>

An examination of <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>the report fully sustained this assertion.

Until payment was shown, the resulting interest of Morris and Nicholson could not be made available to them, and indeed that they had no right or interest in the shares which they had agreed to purchase from Greenleaf until they paid their notes.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[149,878,1191,1297]]]'>“ The agreement was but executory, with no right to call upon Greenleaf to transfer his interest in the company until they had complied with their obligation, and paid the notes and acceptances, which were the consideration for the agreement on the part of Greenleaf to transfer his stock. The court add to this statement the conclusion that if the difficulty of which they had treated was out of the way, and upon which the decision rests, namely, an entire want of equitable or legal right, growing out of the fact that the notes still remained unpaid to the assignees of Greenleaf, it still would not avail to carry the stock to Morris and Nicholson, because the entire dividend on the 6119 shares would be absorbed by debts due by them to the company, and in the claims of other shareholders under the six per cent, guarantee. This was but the statement of a fact which the court held would arise to defeat the claim of Morris and Nicholson, if the ground on which the decision is based was out of the way. It becomes unimportant, therefore, to this cause that the original six per cent, covenant would no longer avail to defeat the claim of Morris and Nicholson, unless the first and more material objection, non-payment-of the notes, be also shown to be a mistake in fact or in law. If payment can even now be shown this difficulty will disappear, and Morris and Nicholson, resurrected in the persons of their legal representatives, will take the fund in controversy, but they cannot be allowed to take it on the mere presumption of pay'ment, growing out of the lapse of time ; for to allow this would be, as the court say in Halsey’s Appeal, to present the case of a chancellor, moved to decree specific performance of one who had not complied with his engagements, but had remained quiescent until he had been discharged by lapse of time.

The fund to be distributed arises from the proceeds of 6119 shares of stock of the North American Land Company. This fund it is net disputed has been raised under the trusts of a certain deed of September 30th 1796, James Greenleaf to George Simpson, recorded at Philadelphia in Deed Book No. 55, p. 381, and therefore called the “ 381 trust,” to distinguish it from another trust under a deed of the same date between the same parties recorded in the same book at page 391. The first mentioned, or “ 381 deed,” recites several conveyances by Robert Morris and John Nicholson to George Simpson, to secure the payment of orders drawn by them and endorsed by James Greenleaf in several classes, and recites also that James Greenleaf was desirous “that all persons holding or interested in said orders, notes or engagements should have the full benefit of the securities mentioned.” The trust is, “ that any of the said orders, notes or engagements, being due and unsatisfied,” the trustee., on the request of thje holder or James Greenleaf, should make sale of the property conveyed, and that as soon as all the said notes, orders and engagements shall be paid and satisfied, then to reconvey to James Greenleaf. It is clear that the holders of said notes and engagements are the <em>eestuis que trustent </em>to whom the fund is to be distributed.</p>

George Simpson, the grantee in the “ 391 deed,” on the 23d of March 1797, conveyed to the same persons, the trustees of the Aggregate Fund, all the real estate, notes and acceptances, held by him under that deed, in trust, to secure Edward Fox. Attached to the Aggregate Fund Deed is a schedule containing a list of notes and acceptances of Robert Morris and John Nicholson, amounting to $831,500. Morris and Nicholson were to give their obligations for the payment of these notes and acceptances, payable one-half on the 26th of December 1798, and the other half on the 26th of December 1799.

The question — and it is really the only question— presented on these appeals, is whether they have entitled themselves as boná fide holders under the trusts of the “ 38T deed.” The holders of these notes are certainly within the terms of that trust, and unless something has been shown to impeach the primá facie title arising from mere possession, are entitled to the benefit of it. It was earnestly contended that the appellees could not' have rightful possession of them under that deed as trustees, as it contained no words conveying anything but the lands and real estate described in it. This is undoubtedly true. Indeed, that deed expressly recognises the fact that these notes were all then in the possession of these trustees, or of other persons for their use. It is clear that the shares of North American Land Company stock, the proceeds of which constitute the fund in court, did not pass by that deed. They were already vested in the trustee under the “ 381 deed.” The trustee under that deed was no party to the Aggregate Fund <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>Deed, and to preclude all question, it expressly declares that the “ 881 deed” and “property therein mentioned is not included herein, nor influenced in any degree, nor forms any part of this indenture.” It will be observed that all the property which was conveyed by Greenleaf to Simpson by the “ 381 deed” was property of Morris and Nicholson, pledged by them to Greenleaf for the security of his acceptances, as specified in the several schedules attached to that deed. On the other hand, the property conveyed by the “ 391 deed” to Simpson was exclusively property of Greenleaf. Morris and Nicholson were no parties to that deed. All that property, as we have seen, had been conveyed by Simpson to the same gentlemen, who were made trustees under the Aggregate Fund Deed, and as that deed rvas a conveyance of a large amount of property belonging to Morris and Nicholson, this, with the 'property of Greenleaf, already transferred to them, constituted w£at was properly called an “Aggregate Fund,” intended more especially for the security of Edward Fox. Hence the Aggregate Fund Deed provides that “ the whole property hereby conveyed by the said Robert Morris and John Nicholson, either jointly or severally, together with all the real estates and the legal and equitable interests and titles thereto heretofore conveyed and assigned to the said Henry Pratt <em>et al. </em>by any or all of the hereinbefore mentioned indentures, shall form and be considered as one aggregate fund.”</p>

Yet these very notes seem included in the general words of the covenant before referred to, “the several notes and acceptances hereinbefore mentioned, endorsed by James Greenleaf, and now held as aforesaid by them or any other persons for their use.” No list of the notes thus purchased was in evidence, and the counsel on both sides say that they are not aware of the existence of any such list, nor of evidence from which such a list could be made out. I conjectured at one time that the $145,000 found by mere accident among the papers of Edward Tilghman, the original counsel of the trustees of the Aggregate Fund, might have been these notes, but the conclusive answer to this or the suggestion that having been cancelled (as it would certainly seem that they ought to have been), <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>they were the $129,500 not produced, is that all these notes are in the schedule and recognised as existing debts of Morris and Nicholson.</p>

With such a construction of the covenant it would be entirely congruous to hold, that the notes were paid and extinguished as claims against Morris and Nicholson, their bonds and the Aggregate Fund being appropriated to their payment, and the trustees, as holders, and those who surrendered to them and took certificates agreeing to look only to the bonds and the fund. A creditor may undoubtedly accept a collateral wdthout giving up his original claim, but if he surrenders the evidence of that claim and takes a new security, the presumption is the other way. It is impossible, however, to give such a restricted construction to the covenant in question. Its language is too broad and comprehensive, and there is no reason why full effect should not be given to it as against Morris and Nicholson or those claiming under them. “All securities of every kind heretofore given by them, or either of them, for the securing the payment of the said notes and acceptances, or any of them, are hereby confirmed and made good and valid to all intents and purposes,' so far as the same relates to the said notes and acceptances and no further.” This certainly was not the language of men whose intention was to limit the security of the notes to the bonds and the Aggregate Fund. That there were other securities then existing, particularly the shares of North American Land Company stock, which had been pledged by Morris and Nicholson for the payment of these and other liabilities, and which were then held under the “ 381 trust” for that purpose, is a position beyond all controversy. Why then shall not these notes, thus recognised distinctly as secured, be entitled to the proceeds of these land shares ? It is maintained with great zeal and earnestness by the able counsel of the appellants, that they are precluded by that clause of the Aggregate Fund Deed before adverted to, which declares that the “ 381 deed” and property therein mentioned is not included therein, nor influenced in any degree, nor forms any part of that indenture. These words seem to have been inserted <em>ex majori cautela. </em>The property vested in the “ 381 trust” could not, if they- had wished to do so, been made a part of the Aggregate Fund. The trusts of the “ 381 deed” were for all holders of notes and acceptances of Morris and Nicholson which had been endorsed by Greenleaf, as well those upon which Fox had become liable as others. George Simpson, the grantee of that deed, or any assignee from him, was no party to the Aggregate Fund Deed. Undoubtedly the holders of the $617,500 <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>notes, not scheduled in that deed, would be entitled to come in <em>pro rata </em>with the $532,500 on the 4970 shares which the auditor finds to appertain to schedule G. — the $1,150,000 for which the interest of Greenleaf was purchased by Morris and Nicholson- — and to secure the payment of which the legal title remained in him by the agreement of May 28th 1796, and which he transferred to George Simp: son by the “ 381 deed.” Morris and Nicholson would not have been estopped by their covenant from contesting the validity of those $617,500 notes, or the bona fides of the holders, as they are as to the scheduled notes. But surely there is nothing in all this to shut out the $532,500 notes from their right to claim. Nor can it be pretended that the non-production of the $617,500 gives the representatives of Morris and Nicholson any right in law or equity to stand in the shoes of the holders, much less to insist upon the exclusion of the scheduled notes as to which they had expressly covenanted that all securities of every kind theretofore given should be good and valid.</p>
    <p id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[276,1156,1174,606]]]'>The great aim of Morris and Nicholson evidently was, as honest and honorable men, to appropriate their property for the payment of their notes and acceptances in the hands of bond fide holders. Whatever may have been their defence as .against Greenleaf, they surrendered it as far'as the scheduled notes were concerned as to the trustees, whom they recognised to be bond, fide holders. It is evident that at this late day we cannot understand all the circumstances of the case so as to feel sure of doing entire justice between the parties. It is not improbable that many of these notes were bought in the market for merely nominal sums. Three cents on the dollar is reported by the auditor to have been about their market price in 1797. It is better for us to rest on the conclusion that the parties understood their case much better than we can now do, and to give effect to their agreement according to its plain language.</p>
    <p id="b516-7" data-blocks='[["BL_516.7",516,[451,1761,999,173]]]'>Decree affirmed; the costs of this appeal, including the printing of the paper-books of all parties, and a fee of one hundred dollars to each of the counsel of the appellants, to be paid from the fund.</p>
