The court below thought the omission to pay made the policy absolutely void, and that no valid assessment on the note could be made to pay losses thereafter sustained. The evidence of such assessments was therefore rejected.</p>

The reasons there given rule this case. It is unnecessary to repeat them. They show that the learned judge erred in rejecting the evidence, and that this judgment must be reversed.</p>
