The defendant offered in evidence the Act of August 5th 1870 (Pamph. L. 1871, 1548), entitled “An Act to provide for the erection of all the public buildings,” and certain city ordinances relating to the same subject. The only question was as to the validity of the tax. The court directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff took this writ of error and ’assigned this direction of the court for error.</p>

There is no good reason to doubt the constitutionality of so much of the Act of 5th August 1870, as provides for the erection of public buildings upon the Penn squares, after their selection as the site by a vote of the people. The raising of taxes for the purpose is an <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>evident and germane consequence of the lawful erection of these buildings.
