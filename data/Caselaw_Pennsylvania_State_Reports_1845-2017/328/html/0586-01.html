Nalevanko, a coal miner, fifty-nine years of age, while walking toward Greensburg along State Highway Route No. 119, known as the New Alexandria Road, was struck and instantly killed by a Ford sedan operated by Tony Marie, one of the defendants. The automobile was proceeding eastwardly upon the highway in the direction of Luxor. It was owned by Louis Marie, codefendant herein, and used by him in his business of carrying passengers for hire upon a regular schedule between Luxor and Greensburg. He held <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>a license from the Public Service Commission for this service and similar licenses for service between Kecksburg and Greensburg, and for a call and demand service out of Luxor and vicinity.</p>
    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[267,567,1148,422]]]'>This action of trespass was instituted by plaintiff on behalf of herself and a minor child against Tony Marie, the driver of the car, and Louis Marie its owner. An affidavit of defense was filed by Louis Marie denying liability for the death of Nalevanko, alleging that on the evening in question the automobile was not operated upon his business, and that Tony Marie was not in his employ.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[267,1002,1147,256]]]'>The jury found for the plaintiff against both defendants, rendering a verdict for $7,318.88, which the court in banc reduced to $5,650. From the refusal of their motions for judgment non obstante veredicto and for a new trial, the defendants have taken this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[267,1268,1148,208]]]'>There were three witnesses to the accident who testified at the trial, viz., the defendant, Tony Marie, Pauline Mayemick, who was riding with him at the time, and James Bollinger, a pedestrian upon the highway.</p>
    <p id="b622-7" data-blocks='[["BL_622.7",622,[267,1486,1148,473]]]'>Tony Marie testified that he was driving at a speed of between 35 and 40 miles an hour, and when he first saw the decedent, he was directly in the path of his automobile, walking westwardly in the center of the road about fifty feet away. He stated that although he “put on the brakes and swerved to the left” as far as he could, the right front fender struck Nalevanko. He said “I went about one hundred yards and almost made a dead stop to go back, but I became excited and went on home.”</p>

Her testimony is substantially similar to that of Tony Marie, except her recollection was that Nalevanko was walking about one yard from the south side of the road. James Bollinger at the time in question was walking eastwardly along the south side of Route 119 to his home in Crow’s Nest from his place of employment at the <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>Penn Albert Hotel in Greensburg. According to this witness, he noticed Nalevanko approaching on the north side of the road, and that immediately prior to the occurrence the decedent walked diagonally across the road from the north to the south side until within about a yard of the witness, when he was struck by the automobile.</p>
    <p id="b623-3" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[180,723,1150,423]]]'>G. E. Gunderson, a highway patrolman, who arrived at the scene shortly after the accident happened, said there were skid marks beginning about one hundred feet to the east of the place where the body was found, and they extended from the south side of the road up to the center and beyond. The damage to the car indicated that Nalevanko was struck by the right front fender and headlight.</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[179,1159,1152,747]]]'>Referring now to defendants’ motions for judgment non obstante veredicto, we are confronted by the following facts. According to the record, the night was clear and the visibility excellent. There were no turns in the highway at the place where the accident occurred. It is not contended that the deceased stepped suddenly from the side of the road, or from behind some object directly into the path of his automobile. Defendant concedes that when he first saw Nalevanko, he was walking in the middle of the highway, still some distance from the automobile. There is no question that decedent had the right to be walking along the road in the manner described. His right was at least equal to that of the defendants to operate a vehicle thereon.</p>

It is no excuse for him to say that he had insufficient time to stop the car, or avoid striking the decedent after he first observed him walking in the highway. It would indicate either that the car was being driven at such a speed that it could not be stopped within the assured clear distance ahead, or that Tony Marie was not sufficiently observant of conditions upon the highway. The <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>skid marks found on the highway, and the severe injuries received by the decedent afford evidence of fast driving, and the inability of the driver to control the car or bring it to a stop.

Tony Marie testifies that another brother, Joe Marie, asked him to drive the scheduled trip from Luxor to Greensburg, and after he had completed that run, he started back to Luxor upon his own mission of pleasure. Both defendants admit that on other occasions Tony Marie had served as a driver in his brother Louis’ business.

An application for the withdrawal of a juror is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the refusal of a motion to that effect, because of objectionable remarks to the jury by counsel, is reviewable for abuse of discretion only: <em>Dan</em>
