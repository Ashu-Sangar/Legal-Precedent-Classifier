Nine reasons were assigned for holding the taxing sections of the School Code and its amendments unconstitutional. The preliminary objections to the bill were that it was too late to raise the constitutionality of the School Code, as amended, and that the present bill was barred by the principle of stare decisis as the constitutional objections had been adversely decided in <em>Minsinger v. Rau, </em><a href="/pa/236/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="236 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="986701" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0327-01">236 Pa. 327</a>.</p>

It held that the Act of March 12,1929, P. L. 20, amending the School Code of May 18, 1911, P.

In conjunction therewith we consider the right of the legislature to delegate to any appointive commission the power to levy taxes. If it be found the Act of 1929 was a lawful grant of power, our inquiry need go no further, but if we should find that the act was an unlawful delegation of power, or such delegation was in violation of Article III, Section 20 of the Constitution as conferring on a special commission the right to levy taxes, there would remain further questions of delay in instituting this proceeding and our power over the decree of the court below.</p>

The taxing power, one of the highest prerogatives, if not the highest, of the legislature, must be exercised through representatives chosen by the people. It is clearly within the interdiction of this principle of constitutional government against delegation. True, in this state, and in many others, the power to tax has been delegated to and exercised by smaller units of state government, such as municipal bodies chosen by the people. See <em>Sharpless v. Philadelphia, </em>supra. For, while the principle of non-delegation of taxing power is the general rule, delegation to municipal authorities has been recognized as lawful: <em>Butler’s Appeal </em>and <em>City of Erie v. Reed, </em><a href="/pa/113/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="113 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="457576" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0468-01">supra;</a> <em>Durach’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/62/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="62 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="1017234" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0491-01">62 Pa. 491</a>; 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th ed.), 235, 389; 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th ed.), sections 1375-1376. This is an exception to the general rule, but such delegation is kept within defined lines, with supervisory control always vested in elective bodies. There are reasons for this exception, at least in this state. Justice Sharswood in <em>Durach’s Appeal, </em>supra, at pp. 493, 494, said: “Mu<a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>nicipalities, such as counties, cities and boroughs, are public corporations created by the government for political purposes. They are invested with subordinate legislative powers for local purposes connected with the public good. ... To carry out these objects [of local government] there must be money, and hence the necessity of taxation for the purpose.” These local units of government possess a legislative body chosen by the people, and delegation of power to them does not actually remove this important subject from the control of the people. Justice Sharswood stated that the great principle which lies at the base of our tax institution is popular representation. And see <em>Thomas v. Gay, </em><a href="/us/169/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="169 U.S. 264" data-case-ids="3597411" data-case-paths="/us/169/0264-01">169 U. S. 264</a>, 276. It was the reliance on this principle that induced the framers of our Constitution to plant in the legislature the taxing power without stint or reservation. As popular representation is one of the attributes of our lesser units of government, it would seem that the theory he speaks of is maintained by delegation to them.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[245,1359,1152,642]]]'>There is another historical reason which supports the right of the legislature to entrust local taxation to municipal governments. Local governmental units, in many instances, antedated federal or state governments and before their inception levied taxes. In this state this is particularly true. Our earliest taxes were levied by the townships under the laws of the Duke of York for poor relief and governmental expenses. Under the proprietary government the county was the taxing unit. When the legislature authorized cities, townships, boroughs and counties to levy taxes, it merely carried on a system that had been historically in existence.</p>

Our common school system was not adopted in this state as it exists today until many years after the Revolution, though the Constitutions of 1776, 1790 and 1838, and the laws recognized its vitally important part in our existence.

The Act of March 3,1818, P. L. 124, provided for the appointment of the first school controllers. It was followed by many acts, the Act of January 23, 1821, P. L. 13; the Act of February 2, 1854, P. L. 21, and the Act of March 15, 1870, P. L. 437, changing the name of the board to the Board of Public Education.

The Act of June 21, 1919, P. L. 555, changed the maximum limit to eight mills and the minimum to six, with an additional half mill for funding of bonded indebtedness. The Acts of April 28, 1921, P. L. 328, and March 12, 1929, P. L. 20, which followed, will be later discussed. In <em>Minsinger v. </em>Rau, <a href="/pa/236/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="236 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="986701" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0327-01">supra,</a> the delegation of taxing power under the Act of 1911 was challenged. We there held that the legislature had the power to designate agencies -for the maintenance of the common school system, and had the power to confer on them the <em>right to collect a taw. </em>The opinion of the court in considering the question of delegation to an appointive board, stated that as <em>the legislature had fiwed the mawimum </em>limitthere was no unlawful delegation of taxing power to an unrepresentative body. In a later case we said that was a legislative act. See <em>Duff v. Perry Twp. School Dist., </em>supra, involving an elective board of the third district. It was contended, however, that a discretion existed in the board to choose between five and six mills. This was the first case to consider the limitation upon the legislature in regard to delegating the power of taxation, and it was argued that it was a dangerous practice to confer upon a board, which the people have no power to choose, or over which their power is remote and indirect, the authority to tax. But in the Act of 1911 there was no real delegation of <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>taxing power; the legislature had in effect fixed the tax. We cannot now hold the instant question was decided by this court in the <em>Minsinger </em>case. It was pointed out, however, that if an appointive board were given the power to levy a tax to meet its requirements, without legislative restriction, it would usurp the deliberative powers of the people. This consideration becomes intensely important in view of the holding there that “the school district is but the agency of the Commonwealth, and there is no inherent right in the electors of any particular locality to vote for directors; . . . ” That statement is correct. There is nothing to prevent the legislature from making all school boards appointive, as it could create commissions to administer the highways in the state, the police forces and other strictly state activities, and give them the power to tax, if there is no limitation on the right of the legislature to delegate that power. Thus it could set up a metropolitan police district, comprising Philadelphia and the adjoining counties, and administered by a board empowered to levy a tax on the citizens of the several counties. To give these bodies the unrestricted right to levy a tax is unthinkable in a free country under our constitution. We have enough illustrations abroad to know what could happen. It is for the courts to enforce the constitutional mandate.</p>

That is left to the judgment and discretion of the school directors. The School Code provides that the board shall employ the necessary qualified teachers. What would be “necessary” under this provision is a matter wholly within the administrative discretion of the board. The uncertainty of the tax rate comes from the uncertainty of the amount that is necessary to pay the teaching staff, which may be increased without outside interference. It would impose too great a burden on the courts to require them to investigate the many factors which enter into the number of “necessary qualified teachers.” It is argued that the legislature itself has limited the number of teachers to those necessary “to keep the public schools open in their respective districts.” But this still makes the necessary number of teachers dependent not only upon the number of schools in the district but upon the type of schools and upon the determination of the board of education as to the proper number of children to be placed in each class. It certainly could not be contended that the legislature desired to fix by this broad clause the number of schools in the district and the number of pupils to be instructed by one teacher. That remains a matter to be determined by the school directors. The Teachers Tenure Act of April 6, 1937, P. L. 213, while it serves to protect the teaching personnel from arbitrary dismissal, does not in any way impose a barrier to the employment of additional teachers in the future, and consequently has no bearing upon the ordinary discretion of the school board to determine its policy in this regard. The courts are in no position to exercise control over schools and determine the policy of school administration; the judges ordinarily are not equipped for this immense task. The divergent views of the modern educational trends, the different systems advanced for the education of children, the number of students that should be placed in each class so that the advantages of individual attention and instruction might be had, the different grades of instruc<a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>tion based upon mental aptitudes of students, — all these present serious questions which the school board alone can determine, and the employment of an indefinite number of additional instructors would be in their keeping. One factor alone, that of vocational training, with all the expensive equipment accompanying it, necessitates a large number of teachers. All this, being purely administrative, must be left to persons of experience who have made a life study of it, and certainly is not to be subjected to the consideration of jurists who have little or no training to appraise school systems or their necessities. It need not be stated that the salaries of teachers and staff members should be adequately provided for, and this comprises one of the most expensive items of maintenance. If unlimited taxing power is delegated to appointive school officials, a practice could readily grow up that would be tremendously burdensome to the taxpayers. An increase in the instructional staff would have a very material effect on the tax rate.</p>

But so long as the factor provided by subsection (a) is left entirely to the discretion of the school board, the entire rate equation is variable without limitation. The legislature has not under such circumstances enacted a rate, but has empowered the school board to fix it. Such was not true in the <em>Minsinger </em>case, and it is our considered judgment that here there is in fact an unconstitutional delegation of taxing power to an appointive board.</p>

Many criticisms have been voiced by large groups of taxpayers in Philadelphia, and elsewhere throughout the State, against the increasing burden of taxes for educational purposes. The feeling has been expressed that school officials, in attempting expensive innovations, erecting elaborate and ornate buildings, and in other ways, have departed from their fundamental duty to maintain an economical and adequate system of schools, with a sufficient number of well-paid teachers. It is charged that school boards have acted at times without considering the great burden the taxpayers must assume in paying for these palatial structures. While these matters are purely questions of policy over which this court has no control, we cannot help but notice the growing discontent springing from these criticisms. Costly edifices built at the tremendous expense of many, many millions, under a plan or scheme over which school directors or members of boards have little or no voice, are not productive of an efficient, well-paid teaching staff, nor do they advance one iota either the education or the educational advantages of the children. Less expensive and less burdensome structures, well built, will accomplish the same results, and taxpayers will not be made to suffer so much. In places where the boards are elective, liable to be called to account at the polls, the school directors are subject at least to some restraining influence in the expenditure of public funds, which does not exist where the school directors are appointed.</p>

Phila., </em><a href="/pa/312/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="312 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1150642" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0311-01">312 Pa. 311</a>, is important. The appointment of the officers to guard a baseball park cannot be considered on the same plane as the determination of a teaching policy or system and the necessary persons to accomplish the result. The selection <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>of police officers was a mere matter of detail, entrusted to the police official by the city and not the surrender of an important power by the General Assembly. We have always held where the constitutional question of delegation of power is raised, that the delegation merely of details of administration is not in violation of the fundamental law. It was pointed out in that case that, if the power to select the number of policemen was abused by the officer, the courts would correct the abuse of discretion. The power delegated to the police officer by city council was very different from that which the legislature has attempted to delegate to the school board. In that case the rate was fixed, but its application was left to depend upon extraneous facts to be found by the administrative official. It was only necessary for him to determine the capacity of the stadium, the probable attendance, and the number of police who would ordinarily be required to preserve the public safety at such a gathering. The determination of these facts was a simple administrative function of minor importance and one which could be easily subjected to judicial review. The power conferred upon the school board is vastly different, as pointed out above. It was emphasized in <em>Hibbs v. Arensberg, </em><a href="/pa/276/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="276 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1077542" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0024-01">276 Pa. 24</a>, that the exercise of discretion by the school authorities will be interfered with only when there is a <em>clear abuse </em>of it, and the burden of showing such an abuse is a <em>heavy one. </em>In those few instances where the court has interfered with the administrative power of school boards, the interference was based on the school boards’ manifestly illegal action in violating the express words of statutes defining their powers or on facts clearly indicating bad faith and violation of their public duty.

This section prohibits the delegation to any special commission of the legislature’s power to tax. The purpose of the provision was to protect against the exercise of the taxing power by officials not subject to the control of the people. This prohibition is not limited solely to municipal taxation. The words “to levy taxes” are not modified by the word “municipal,” whereas the remaining clauses in this section are specifically so modified. This demonstrates the intention of the framers that no taxing power whatever, state or municipal, be delegated to any special, appointive commission. The section becomes an express and emphatic limitation on the power of the legislature to delegate to a non-elective board or commission the power to tax. But it is urged the school board is not a “special commission” because at the time the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>legislature invested it with taxing power, it was an existing governmental body or agency, regularly constituted and exercising general administrative powers in connection with the public school system of the State. It is quite true it was such a body or agency and could lawfully exercise all the legitimate powers granted to it, whether or not it is a special commission for such purposes. It is the established governmental agency for the administration of the educational system. But when the taxing power was lodged in it, it was <em>quoad </em>that power a special, appointive commission. It must be remembered that the taxing power is a separate special power, and is not a component part of the power to educate. When an appointive school board, which is a board of education, is empowered to levy taxes, it is a special commission to levy taxes. The case in this respect is analogous to <em>Perkins v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/156/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="156 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="844956" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0554-01">156 Pa. 554</a>, where a like objection had been urged. There, an attempt having been made to transfer municipal powers to the head of the existing department of public works in Philadelphia, a general agency of government, in violation of this section, we unequivocally said at p. 559: “The fact is not material that the new commissioner was already by general law an officer of the city; the special and unusual power given him, to be exercised in a special manner, . . . constituted the special commission delegated to him.”</p>

We have not been able to discover any case which holds that laches will bar an attack upon the constitutionality of a statute as to its future operation, especially where the legislation involves a fundamental question going to the very roots of our representative form of government and concerning one of its highest prerogatives. To so hold would establish a dangerous precedent, the evil effect of which might reach far beyond present expectations. While dictum in <em>McGuire v. Phila.

This is nothing more than the equitable doctrine of estoppel applied in the realm of constitutional law and is uniformly upheld in cases where the constitutional provision is solely protective of property rights. See 1 Cooley’s Constitutional Limitations (8th ed.), p. 368 et seq.; <em>Pierce v. Somerset Ry., </em><a href="/us/171/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="171 U.S. 641" data-case-ids="3600699" data-case-paths="/us/171/0641-01">171 U. S. 641</a>, 648.</p>

City of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/85/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="85 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="440530" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0412-01">85 Pa. 412</a>. This court there held that the constitutional right against unjust taxation is for the protection of the taxpayer’s private property; it is stated at p. 418: “He may waive that protection and consent to such action in regard to it as would otherwise be invalid.” In <em>Shepard v. Barron, </em><a href="/us/194/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="194 U.S. 553" data-case-ids="3631640" data-case-paths="/us/194/0553-01">194 U. S. 553</a>, it is pointed out at p. 567, that a “course of conduct which renders it unjust and inequitable to others that he [the taxpayer] should be allowed to complain of the illegality” may amount to a waiver; and that some courts have held that “a mere failure to give notice of objections to one who, with the knowledge of the person taxed, as contractor or otherwise, is expending money in reliance upon payment from the taxes, may have the same effect.” While in most cases where a waiver has been found, the conduct of the party has consisted in the invocation of the act which he later seeks to attack and the acceptance of benefits therefrom, nevertheless, mere inaction may constitute a waiver, where the party knows that others are go<a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>ing ahead and making expenditures on the faith of the&gt; validity of the claim against him, and the circumstances are such as to make it inequitable to permit subsequent invocation of a constitutional right which he has failed to assert seasonably and within a reasonable time after the claim arose. See <em>City of Sebring v. </em>Wolf, <a href="/fla/105/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="141 So. 736" data-case-ids="1223380" data-case-paths="/fla/105/0516-01">141 So. 736</a>. In the case at bar it is undisputed that each year the school board has merely levied a tax to provide sufficient revenue to meet the expenses which the budget indicates would be incurred by the operation of the school system during the year. Large investments and commitments were entered into upon the strength of the validity of these past tax levies. Debts have been incurred and bond issues floated which would be put in jeopardy if the delinquent taxes are now immune from collection. Furthermore, it would be unjust and inequitable to deny recovery to those who made prompt payment in compliance with the assessments and levies, and at the same time to hold immune those who did not meet their tax obligations as they fell due.</p>

At the time the now delinquent school taxes were levied, the property owners who became liable for the payment thereof realized that the revenues to be derived from their payment would be counted on to supply the funds necessary to meet the obligations incurred in the administration of the public school system. In order to avail themselves of the right to attack the validity of the tax levies, it was incumbent upon them to make known their intention to resist payment. They could not sit by and permit the school board to rely upon payment of their taxes to its detriment and to the detriment of other taxpayers. To permit a delinquent taxpayer to raise a constitutional objection to the validity of the claim against him, after expenses have been incurred in <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>reliance on his future payment, would be for the court to completely shut its eyes to equity and place an unjust burden on future generations. Once a taxpayer has omitted to voice his objection within a reasonable time after the levy has been made and with knowledge that his claim will be made the basis of expenditures to be incurred, and the expenditures have been made, it is too late for him to attempt to impeach the validity of the tax levy. Under such circumstances he must be deemed to have waived all right to assert any constitutional objection which might have afforded him protection had he chosen to invoke it at the proper time. Any other course would imperil all governmental agencies under similar circumstances.</p>

In this connection we may say the constitution gives the school board the right and power to create an indebtedness and issue bonds or notes. All its implications must be upheld and enforced.</p>

[and] harass and embarrass school boards throughout the Commonwealth in floating new issues as well as in meeting past and current obligations.” They prophesy that this will result “in temporary disruption and paralysis of the common school system to no good purpose” and that the damaging and disrupting effect will be immediate and direct.</p>

Such a curtailment would bring about a state of confusion which would operate adversely to the common good of the citizens and their children. While these disconcerting factors cannot permit this court to avoid the unpleasant duty of declaring unconstitutional a statute which violates one of the most fundamental principles of the state constitution, yet they must be taken into consideration in determining whether the threatened emergency of serious proportions compels this court to invoke its general power to suspend or stay the operation of an injunction decree, on a modified basis, until the legislature convenes in regular session, when it may pass the necessary enabling statute, so that in the interim the schools may have ample means to function without an injurious curtailment of revenue.</p>

The circumstances here demanding relief are even weightier than in other cases where relief has been afforded, and this court will do everything in its power to bring about an equitable solution of the difficulties presented, so that the debt service charge and the salaries of all teachers may be paid without diminution. The school board must have some means of securing the necessary sums for school purposes for the years 1938 and 1939; in the latter year the legislature will be in regular session and may, if it sees fit to do so, pass an enabling act that will provide for ensuing years. Under these circumstances, it will not be necessary to call the legislature in special session to secure relief. Considering the situation of the taxpayers and the maintenance of public schools, and the delay of plaintiff in instituting these proceedings until a time when the legislature was not in session, we will modify the decree of the court below and permit a tax levy not to exceed the rate levied by the board itself for the year 1937. This was the last rate; it was not contested by anyone and was accepted as fair by all the citizens taxed. It was the basis on which public obligations have been incurred for benefit of every taxpayer and resident in the city. A careful administration of this tax return with the proposed bond issue to make up the deficiencies for past years will enable all schools to function as usual, until such time as the legislature deems it necessary to consider the subject.</p>

The school district has no police power. It has no power to legislate. It cannot construct highways, bridges and subways. It cannot provide for the relief of the poor. Although the school district possesses power of eminent domain, this is not exclusively a municipal power but is possessed by numerous public utilities conducted for private gain. Like such corporations the school board must post a bond to exercise the power. No such restriction has been placed upon the right of a municipality to take property.
