He avers that he received “relief benefits due up to May 11, 1932” but none thereafter, and seeks to recover them from the railroad company in this action of assumpsit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Certainly the pleading, unverified by oath, did not comply with the statute which requires an affidavit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The plaintiff did not move to strike off the pleading for want of conformity with the statute, nor did he ask for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit. Defendant’s pleading was defective as plaintiff now points out, but the defect does not help him. It is settled that judgment will not be entered in favor of a plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, if, in his statement of claim, he has not averred a good cause of action: <em>Parry v.

It is unnecessary to quote these; some of them may be seen in a recent opinion of the Superior Court <em>(Cimprich v.

On his application, plaintiff received a “Certificate of Membership in the Relief Fund” and agreed “to be bound by the Regulations of the Relief Department of the” defendant.

      <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>The statement of claim shows that the employer assumed certain obligations but the plaintiff has averred no breach of any obligation assumed by defendant. It agreed to make up any deficit in the contributions to the Relief Fund and agreed to take general charge of the Department and guaranteed the fulfillment of the obligations assumed by it in conformity with the regulations. It agreed to supply the necessary facilities for conducting the business of the department, to pay the operating expenses, to take charge of the funds and to be responsible for their safe-keeping. No facts are averred which establish an unsatisfied default of the beneficial association and consequent failure by the defendant to comply with its guaranty; there is nothing to show a breach of trust in the safe-keeping of the funds of the Department, or other omission to do what defendant had agreed to do.</p>

The regulations quoted in Exhibit No. 32 made provision for such appeal. If plaintiff has not exhausted the remedy provided by the regulations which he agreed to accept as final, he is barred from further proceeding: <em>Maloney v. U. M. W. A., </em><a href="/pa/308/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="308 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="1140264" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0251-01">308 Pa. 251</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20225" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="162 A. 225">162 A. 225</a>; <em>Cimprich v.

He appears to concede the effect of failure to appeal to the committee, but contends that his statement of claim should not be interpreted, in this respect, as the learned court below construed it; he argues that while he averred that the Superintendent had informed him by letter that his “case was properly terminated under Regulation 45,” he added an averment that the Superintendent, in the same letter, “suggested <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>that the plaintiff call at his office for further examination.” He contends that the Superintendent’s suggestion for further examination continued his relationship to the Relief Fund; that while, in the words of the statement, he “was physically unable to call at the said Superintendent’s Office, or to do anything further in regard to procuring the benefits he was entitled to receive” until in the spring of 1933, he then “again attempted to have his case considered by the defendant’s Relief Department” ; that he learned for the first time on May 31, 1933, that he would receive no further benefits, whereupon, on June 9th, he appealed to the Advisory Committee, but that no hearing was ever held. Without now saying that the construction put upon the averment by the learned court below was erroneous, assuming the averment to be relevant, it is obvious that until the plaintiff brings his proceeding against the unincorporated beneficial association (see Act of 1836, P.
