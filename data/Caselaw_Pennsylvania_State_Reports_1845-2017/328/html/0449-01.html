This action was brought to recover the resulting damages. A verdict was rendered in her favor for $10,000 and in her father’s favor for $2,500.</p>

The court below states as its reasons for so directing that under no possible construction of the evidence could the verdict of $2,500 for the father be justified, and that the sum awarded to the daughter is grossly excessive. It is further stated that the medical testimony offered by plaintiffs is untenable in the face of all the other evidence and that another trial should be had in order that X-rays of the girl’s injured spine may be taken by a disinterested expert to settle the controversy between the doctors.</p>
