    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.7",228,[259,430,1151,521]]]'>We are here to decide whether the two executrices of the Estate of Julian Kennedy are entitled to an allowance out of the assets of the estate for the amount paid by them for counsel fees in successfully resisting large claims amounting to $185,874.83 made against the estate by the two sons of the decedent, who were executors. The litigation involving the claims was determined by us adversely to them in affirming the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County in <em>Kennedy’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/321/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="321 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1165875" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0225-01">321 Pa. 225</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=183%20A.%20798" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="183 A. 798">183 A. 798</a>.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.8",228,[258,973,1152,740]]]'>The counter-statement of “Questions Involved” in appellees’ brief correctly and succinctly summarizes the controversy. It reads: “Where the two daughters and the two sons of a decedent are executors of his estate, and the sons make individual claims against the estate for large amounts, which are disallowed by the orphans’ court, have not the daughters as executrices the right to employ counsel to resist the claims in appeals to this Court, and are not their counsel entitled to payment from the estate for their services, particularly where the assets in the hands of the executors were then insufficient to pay all of the pending claims against the estate, if allowed in full, and also the sons’ claims?” Our answer must be in the affirmative.</p>
    <p id="b228-6" data-blocks='[["BL_228.9",228,[258,1734,1148,357]]]'>The sons, appealing from the decree below which allowed a fee of $10,000, argue that the allowance should not be made, because the benefit from the defeat of their claims inured to their sisters individually, and not to the estate, as they and their sisters were the only persons interested in it, and the rejection of the claims increased the sisters’ ultimate shares in distribution.</p>
    <p id="b228-7" data-blocks='[["BL_228.10",228,[257,2111,1147,263]]]'>We think this position untenable. The sisters in their representative character as executrices were entitled to employ counsel to represent them and to charge the estate with the cost thereof: <em>Ammon’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/31/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="31 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="985015" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0311-01">31 Pa. 311</a>; <em>Groff’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/215/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="215 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="948453" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0586-01">215 Pa. 586</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.%20783" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="64 A. 783">64 A. 783</a>.</p>
