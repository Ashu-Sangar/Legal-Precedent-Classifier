It was alleged that they had been appointed by the judges of the Court of Common Pleas; their services had been performed, bills presented according to law, and their approval refused. The county commissioners answered that they were not required to act until the controller had countersigned the bills; this defense was sustained. The controller’s return raised the following defenses: that one of the relators is not a freeholder of the county and therefore not entitled to payment; that the relators charged more for the services than they were entitled to for the time they had spent, and failed to recognize fractions of a day in computing the.time spent; and that the three members of the board owed more money to the county in taxes than the county owed them for their services. The court below rejected these defenses and, without taking testimony or allowing a jury trial, directed the controller to approve the bills. The controller appeals.</p>

When the claim of the viewer was presented he was entitled to a presumption that he was a de jure officer. The controller is not entrusted with the duty of determining the legal qualification of every county officer and employee who presents a claim for compensation. The right to pass on the qualifications of employees and officers is, in most cases, entrusted to officers or boards or to a court who appoint them, and the question as to whether such bodies or tribunals have heeded statutory direction in deciding qualifications is a judicial one to be determined generally by quo warranto <em>(Brinton v. Kerr, </em><a href="/pa/320/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="320 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1163617" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0062-01">320 Pa. 62</a>; <em>Sewickley Township School District’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/327/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="327 Pa. 396" data-case-ids="1176714" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0396-01">327 Pa. 396</a>), and cannot be raised by the county controller in a proceeding of this nature, especially where the right to review the appointment is expressly entrusted to some other body.</p>

Thus in <em>Com. ex rel. Bowman v.

This has been held in this State despite the fact claimant performed the services and no other person asserts a claim to the office <em>(Riddle v. County of Bedford; Jones v.

Luzerne County, </em>all supra); <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>other jurisdictions have reached a contrary result. But in none of these cases was the question as to the proper procedure raised by the parties or considered by this Court. We adhere to our long established ruling that unless another remedy is provided for by statute, quo warranto is the exclusive and proper one to determine title to public office. Here, Section 173 of Art. Ill of the Act of May 2, 1929, as amended, gives the court the power to appoint and determine the qualifications of appointees both before and after appointment. The court is empowered to determine “summarily” the facts, and, as it is not conceded that any ground for disqualification exists, the viewer was entitled to the presumption that the court obeyed the law and his holding was that of a de jure officer. The controller could not review the act of the court, which has summary jurisdiction to declare vacancies by reason of subsequent disqualification. Here was a court, part of whose function was to determine the qualifications of the appointees. This viewer may have been qualified Avhen appointed and lost his qualification thereafter. Freeholder is not a fixed, determined status. It has a number of incidents. The question of his qualifications may not properly be raised in a mandamus proceeding. The statute grants to the court the power of appointment, and the provision for determining vacancies is an all-inclusive power by which the qualifications named in the act may be determined, except by quo warranto, the historically recognized method of testing title to public office.</p>

The court should have heard this objection; it could not be summarily disposed of. This does not m,ean that the controller has, in every case, the power to determine the validity of a claim. When the legislature designates officials or other bodies to determine whether services of employees or of contractors have been performed, and such a power has been exer<a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>cised, a controller can attack such, a finding only for fraud or mistake. Thus a city council allowed the claim of an attorney, and the controller refused to approve it without an itemized bill; this court on mandamus held that, since the amount had been adjusted by a city council having jurisdiction, the controller could not refuse payment: <em>Com. ex rel. v.

The same is true as to municipal contracts where officials have exercised legislative authority to decide whether a contract has been properly performed. In <em>Com. ex rel. v.

L. 1278, Article III, section 171, as amended by the Act of June 9, 1931, P. L. 401, Section 1. The estab<a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>lished rule is that where a public officer is paid on a per diem basis, fractions of a day are not recognized. While the question seems never to have arisen in this State, it is practically the universal rule. In <em>United States v. Erwin, </em><a href="/us/147/0685-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="147 U.S. 685" data-case-ids="3565778" data-case-paths="/us/147/0685-01">147 U.

The court said: “If his attendance before the court be necessary, he is entitled to his per diem, though it may only be necessary to remain” a short time. And in <em>Stetler v. McFarlane, </em><a href="/ny/230/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="230 N.Y. 400" data-case-ids="294455" data-case-paths="/ny/230/0400-01">230 N. Y. 400</a>, 409, where the objection was that the official had performed services for only a part of a day, the Court of Appeals of New York, speaking through Judge Cardozo, said: “We think the statute means that a supervisor acting in good faith, shall be paid for every day upon which service is rendered in the performance of delegated duties,” rejecting the theory that the pay might be apportioned and making the test whether the official <em>acted in good faith and did not charge for trivialities. </em>The authorities supporting this view are collected in 1 A. L. E. 274. See <em>Albright v.

If there is evidence of abuse on the part of the official, the result may be otherwise, but there must be more than a mere conjecture that the work could have been done in one day or a few days, or in a shorter time than was charged for.
