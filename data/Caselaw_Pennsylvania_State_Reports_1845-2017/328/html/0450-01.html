No facts are in dispute. Both corporations are taxable under the Corporate Net Income Tax Act of May 16, 1935, P. L. 208, 72 PS section 3420a et seq.

Apart from the text itself, which we consider sufficient, the record contains additional evidence that the legislature did not intend to confer discretionary power on the Secretary. It was shown that when first introduced, section 5 contained the word “may”, but that, before the bill was passed and approved, “may” was stricken out and “shall” was substituted.

This contention he derives, as we understand his argument, from part of the definition of “net income” contained in section 2. This section entitled “Definitions”, as amended Aug. 7, 1936, P. L. 127, provides, inter alia: “ ‘Net income.’ 1. In case the entire business of the corporation is transacted within this Commonwealth, net income for the calendar year or fiscal year as returned to, and ascertained by the Federal Government, subject, however, to any corree<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>fcions thereof, for fraud, evasion, or error as finally ascertained by tbe Federal Government; Provided, That additional deductions shall be allowed from net income on account of any taxes paid to tbe Government of tbe United States; . . .” It is said that, as by tbe Federal Act of June 22, 1936, c. 690, section 141, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20Stat.%201698" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="49 Stat. 1698">49 Stat. 1698</a>, amending the Act of May 10, 1934, c. 277, section 141, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%20720" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="48 Stat. 720">48 Stat. 720</a>, 26 USCA section 141, consolidated returns may be filed by an “affiliated group of corporations”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> engaged as common carriers, plaintiff corporations, not being common carriers, are therefore not within tbe class allowed by tbe Act of Congress to file a consolidated return for federal purposes. But a reading of the act shows that tbe word income has a wider meaning than that attributed by tbe Secretary. Section 2 provides that tbe definition of income is not limited to what has already been quoted, if tbe text of tbe act indicates a different meaning. From section 4 of tbe act, we take tbe following: “. . .it shall be tbe duty of every corporation, liable to pay tax under this act . . . to transmit to tbe department, upon a form prescribed, prepared, and furnished by tbe department, a report under oath or affirmation ... of net income taxable under tbe provisions of this act. Such report shall set forth: (a) A true copy of its return to tbe Federal Government of tbe annual net income arising or accru<a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>ing in the calendar or fiscal year next preceding, or such part or portions of said return, as the department may designate, (b) If no return was filed with the Federal Government, the report made to the department shall show such information as would have been contained in a return to the Federal Government, had one been made, and (c) Such other information as the department may require.”</p>

The contention is without merit. In reviewing the wisdom of the classification, the court cannot say that the General Assembly acted unreasonably in determining if a domestic corporation owned or controlled another, they might combine their accounts for the purposes of income taxation. The reasonableness of classification is for the legislature in the first instance; unless there is no rational basis for it, the court will not interfere. In <em>Com. v. Delaware Division Canal Co., </em><a href="/pa/123/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="123 Pa. 594" data-case-ids="967114" data-case-paths="/pa/123/0594-01">123 Pa. 594</a>, 621, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.%20584" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="16 A. 584">16 A. 584</a>, Clark, J., said, “Nor is classification necessarily based upon any essential differences in the nature or, indeed, the condition of the various subjects; it may be based as well upon the want of adaptability to the same methods of taxation, or upon the impracticability of applying to the various subjects the same methods, so as to produce just and reasonably uniform results, or it may be based upon well-grounded considerations of public policy.” <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>See also <em>Com. v.
