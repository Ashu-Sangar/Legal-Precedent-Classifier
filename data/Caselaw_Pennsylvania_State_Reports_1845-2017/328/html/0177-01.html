The trustees were directed to divide “any and all remainder of the net income arising from such trust fund” in equal shares among his widow and four children for life, with gifts over of each share except that of his son Hugh. Upon the termination of the trust the corpus is to be distributed per stirpes among the living issue of testator’s daughter and two of his sons, and, there being no issue, to his heirs at law.</p>

The corporation, organized in 1915, owns and operates mining properties in Peru, South America. It acquired its mining assets through funds obtained by the issuance of “no par value shares”; the value in excess of the price at which the shares sold was allocated to “capital surplus.” Its principal business is the production and marketing of copper and other metals; the operation has caused a gradual depletion of its original assets through the extraction and sale of its products. To make up for this consumption of ore the corporation set up an item designated “depletion,” which is supposed to represent the value of the ore extracted. As each unit is mined, its valuation fixed at a given sum is credited to the depletion reserve account, and this naturally increases as mining operations continue. The mining properties of the corporation through purchase increase are at the present time substantially the same as they were prior to 1920, with exceptions of minor importance, and throughout that entire period they have been in continuous operation.</p>

The dividends have averaged about one dollar per share, sometimes more, and at other times less or omitted entirely. From the inception of the trust through 1927, the trustees distributed all the dividends from this stock to the life tenants as income, but since then have retained as corpus the portion of the dividends reported by the corporation to have been paid from the depletion reserve account, and which are charged on its books to “capital distributions,” in turn offset against “capital surplus.” In some instances the trustees have allotted the entire dividend to principal, and in others they have held it pending a determination of its source.</p>

See <em>Robinson’s Trust, </em><a href="/pa/218/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="218 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="999595" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0481-01">218 Pa. 481</a>, 486; <em>Boyer’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/224/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="224 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="963123" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0144-01">224 Pa. 144</a>, 153. In considering these cases this basic rule must guide and control, and it is then that many cases, which on their surface appear difficult of solution, become easy to solve. Apply it to the instant case. The testator owned the stock during his lifetime and received dividends regularly over a period of approximately four years. He was a lawyer of eminent standing and was fully conversant with rules of property in force in this state, and with the practices and power of corporations engaged in the exploitation of mines or other wasting assets to declare dividends from net profits without making any deduction for depletion of assets by lapse of time, exploitation or otherwise: Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, Art. VII, Sec. 701, Subd. C, as amended by Act of July 17,1935, P. L. 1123, Sec. 1. In Fletcher on Corporations, Volume II, Section 5347, p. 868, it is stated: “The justification usually ad<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>vanced for the rule is that as the business of a wasting asset corporation is to exploit and exhaust its assets, no one expects that its capital will be kept intact; and that to require a sum to be set aside for depletion would eventually turn a mining company, for example, into an investment trust.” One who invests money in a corporation, which must necessarily exploit and consume its assets to operate, should anticipate that eventually his investment may become worthless upon exhaustion of the assets of the company, if the company chooses to avail itself of its right to pay out as dividends all net receipts above the ordinary charges, without setting aside a fund to take care of assets extracted and consumed. The owner of the stock cannot complain, as he is being paid pro tanto for his capital investment with its natural earnings, if any. It is reasonable to suppose that where one invests in such a stock, and later it becomes part of the res of a trust, as here, he intends those who are to receive the “income” of the trust to have the benefit of all dividends paid out of profits from mines opened during his lifetime, whether from depletion reserves set up out of earnings or ordinary earnings above such reserves. These corporations may distribute these earnings without deduction for a reserve for depletion, and the withholding of reserve funds does not alter the rights of the life tenant to them. It is difficult to conceive how in the measurement of value of these stocks there could be any accurate accounting for tax purposes when they are sold.</p>

If he meant otherwise, he should have said so; not having said so, this is the legal influence of his intention. . . . The most obvious inference would seem to be that, when a man devises land with an open mine upon it, to a person for life, he intended the devisee to derive profit from the mine, as well as from the surface of the land.” This rule has been affirmed in many subsequent cases: <em>Irwin v.

The origin of the dividends in the instant case is not disputed. They came from profits made by the corporation in carrying out the purpose for which it was formed. The execution of that purpose necessitates consumption of capital assets, and the corporation has full freedom to distribute such earnings without deduction for depletion. The corporate mask cannot deprive the life beneficiaries of the right to all the profits distributed by the mining corporation in the form of dividends, to which, admittedly, they would have had a right had the testator had a direct interest in the mining properties of the corporation which were opened and operated during his lifetime.

Here the property is substantially the same today as it was in 1920. It is undisputed that the amount charged to capital surplus in fact represented a distribution of surplus earnings allocated to depletion reserve.

      <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[261,1631,1149,721]]]'> Judge Gest stated at p. 6J2, after pointing out that if the deceased had owned the mines himself, or an undivided interest in them, whether the gift was in trust or otherwise, the life tenant would have received the entire income derived from the coal royalties: “This being so, the fact that her interest was represented by shares of stock in the mine-owning companies is really immaterial, especially in view of the fact that she empowered her trustee to retain the investment. Equity regards the substance and not the form, or, to use a homely metaphor, will crack the shell to get at the kernel, and the fact that the owners of these coal properties put them in corporate form is merely a matter of administrative detail. . . . There is no reason apparent to us why we should not determine here that these dividends, being derived exclusively from royalties on coal taken from mines open at the death of the testatrix, belonged, as such, to the life tenants, under the doctrine of <em>Neel v. Neel!"</em>
