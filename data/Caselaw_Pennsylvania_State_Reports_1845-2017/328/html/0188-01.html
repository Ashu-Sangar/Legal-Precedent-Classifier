After a number of legacies, he gave the residue to trustees “to hold the same for and during the lifetime of my wife, Lillie S. Knox and my children, and the lifetime of any grandchild or grandchildren who may be living at the time of my death, and for twenty-one years after the death of the longest surviving grandchild living at my decease, for the following uses and purposes”: to pay one-fifth of the net income (after certain annuities) to each of the following for life: his widow, his daughter Rebekah, his sons Reed, Hugh and Philander. The trustees were directed, on the death of his widow, to “divide the portion of said income theretofore paid to her into four equal parts, and thereafter pay an equal one-fourth part of the same to each of my four children,” naming them, for life. He provided that on the death of his daughter or of his sons Reed or Philander, “leav<a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>ing issue them surviving, I direct that my trustees shall pay in the same manner to such issue until the termination of the trust . . . <em>per stirpes </em>...” but if the daughter or Reed or Philander died without surviving issue, “their share of said income shall go to the other said surviving child or children named in this clause, the issue of any child deceased taking by representation.” Upon the termination of the trust he directed that the trustees pay and transfer the estate to the living issue of his daughter and his sons Reed and Philander, per stirpes, and in default of issue to his heirs at law.</p>
    <p id="b224-5" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[268,940,1150,208]]]'>He gave to his granddaughter Kathleen Knox, daughter of his son Hugh, the sum of $50,000 “when and at the time she shall have reached the age of twenty-five years” and directed the trustees then to pay it to her.</p>
    <p id="b224-6" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[269,1160,1147,310]]]'>Testator was survived by his widow and the four children named. His widow died in 1930 and his son Hugh in 1936. After the widow’s death the income was divided equally among the four children until Hugh’s death. Hugh left a will giving his estate to his widow and appointing her executrix.</p>
    <p id="b224-7" data-blocks='[["BL_224.6",224,[266,1483,1151,806]]]'>The appeal comes from the audit of the third and partial account of the trustees, and the question for decision is who, since Hugh’s death, is entitled to the share of the income theretofore received by him. While testator specifically designated what should become of the shares of income given to his wife, daughter, and sons Reed and Philander, he did not provide to whom, after Hugh’s death, the trustees should pay the share of the income theretofore payable to him. The learned court below held testator died intestate of that part of the income and ordered distribution according to the intestate law, i. e., one-third to the executrix of Lillie S. Knox, testator’s widow, one-sixth to the executrix of Hugh Knox, testator’s son, and one-sixth each to Rebekah, Reed and Philander.</p>

On behalf of Kathleen Knox, Hugh’s daughter, the contention is “that there was no intestacy in the strict sense”; that having given his property to his trustees “to hold” for the purposes of the trust, “no property of any kind remained in the testator”; that the only interest remaining in him was a possibility of reverter; that on Hugh’s death, a resulting trust arose in favor of the persons who at that time were the testator’s heirs, and that she, therefore, was entitled to share with testator’s three surviving children.</p>
    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[241,939,1157,1136]]]'>All parties, therefore, agree that the will named no distributee to receive the % share of the income accruing from the time of Hugh’s death until the trust ends. At death, property passes under the Intestate Acts unless a testator provides otherwise by will proved and construed as the law requires. It is well settled that “the heir or statutory distributee will not be disinherited except by express words or necessary intendment”: <em>DeSilver’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/142/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="142 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="976762" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0074-01">142 Pa. 74</a>, 76, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.%20882" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="21 A. 882">21 A. 882</a>. The will is to be read as though testator had written in it that on Hugh’s death the trustees should pay the income to the distributees designated by the intestate law. The question presented was so thoroughly considered in the cases in which DeSilver’s will was before this court that nothing can be added to the opinion of Judge Penkose, which was adopted when the case came up the third time: <em>DeSilver’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/142/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="142 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="976762" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0074-01">142 Pa. 74</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.%20882" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="21 A. 882">21 A. 882</a>; <em>Getz’s Appeal, DeSilver’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/125/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="125 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="563984" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0611-01">125 Pa. 611</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.%20480" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="17 A. 480">17 A. 480</a>; <em>Aubert’s Appeal, DeSilver’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/119/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="119 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="558100" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0048-01">119 Pa. 48</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.%20810" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="12 A. 810">12 A. 810</a>; see also <em>Grothe’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/229/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="229 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="971815" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0186-01">229 Pa. 186</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20A.%2088" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="78 A. 88">78 A. 88</a>; <em>Milliken’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/227/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="227 Pa. 597" data-case-ids="1008515" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0597-01">227 Pa. 597</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.%20749" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="76 A. 749">76 A. 749</a>.</p>
