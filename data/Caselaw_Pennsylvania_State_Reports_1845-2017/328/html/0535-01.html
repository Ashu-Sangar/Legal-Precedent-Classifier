This opinion is written so that onr reasons for the conclusión reached may be stated. Urgency of decision in order that the election count might proceed prevented preparation of an opinion when our order was made.</p>
    <p id="b571-3" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[204,618,1150,532]]]'>Appellants’ counsel state the question involved thus: Where, in proceedings instituted under section 1701 of the Pennsylvania Election Code, a ballot box is opened and the ballots contained therein are counted by the court, shall a ballot, marked with a cross (x) mark opposite the name of one of the political parties in the party column and also with one or more cross (x) marks opposite the name or names of individual candidates of the same or another party, be counted <em>only </em>for the candidates so individually marked?</p>

    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[272,461,1152,1122]]]'>We do not construe this section of the act as appellants would have its meaning declared. Its proper construction is, in those instances in which an elector has marked in the party square, and has also marked in an office block, for less than the full number of candidates for which he is entitled to vote, as for instance, where three judges of a court are to be elected and the voter has marked in the party square, and then marks one of the individual candidates for judge of that or any other party, notwithstanding his mark in the party square, his vote shall not be counted for all the judicial candidates, but only for the one individually marked. For all other candidates of the party, except those in that office block his vote shall be counted. While the language of the section is not as clear as it might be, we think the construction we have given it necessarily follows from the language used. The phrase “in which case” refers to the antecedent word “in any office block” and the words should be read “in any office block the ballot shall be counted only for the candidates thus individually marked.”</p>
    <p id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[273,1595,1150,314]]]'>When other sections are read the meaning of this one becomes clear beyond peradventure.

Furthermore he is told for an office where more than one candidate is to be voted for, after marking in the party square he may divide his vote by marking a cross to the right of each candidate for whom he desires to vote, but his party square vote will not be counted, so far as that office is concerned, for candidates not individually marked, implying that it will be counted for all others.</p>

If he desires to vote for every candidate of a political party or political body, except its candidates for offices as to which he votes for individual candidates in the manner hereinafter provided, he may make a cross (x) mark in the square opposite the name of the party or political body of his choice in the party column on the left of the ballot, and every such cross (x) mark shall be equivalent to and be counted as a vote for every candidate of a party or political <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>body so marked, including its candidates for presidential electors, except for those offices as to which he has indicated a choice for individual candidates of the same or another party or political body, by marking a cross (x) mark opposite their names in the manner herein-above provided, as to which offices his ballot shall be counted only for the candidates which he has thus individually marked, notwithstanding the fact that he made a mark in the party column, and even though in the case of an office for which more than one candidate is to be voted for, he has not individually marked for such office the full number of candidates for which he is entitled to vote.”</p>
