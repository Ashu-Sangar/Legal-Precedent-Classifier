As has been said: section 3 of Article XV requires a sinking fund “which shall be inviolably pledged for the payment of its funded debt”; section 8 of Article IX, permitting Philadelphia to “issue its obligations maturing not later than fifty (50) years from the date thereof,” requires them to provide “for a sinking-fund sufficient to retire said obligations at maturity, the payment to such sinking-fund to be in equal or graded annual or other periodical installments”; section 10 requires provision “for the col<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>lection of an annual tax sufficient to pay the interest and also the principal thereof within thirty years,” the thirty year period being modified as to Philadelphia by section 8 as subsequently amended. Although these provisions are self-executing, the Charter Act, quoted above, also required that “the proceeds of the taxes levied for the payment of the principal and interest of such debt and all other money pledged or appropriated for the payment of the principal and interest of such debt shall be paid into the sinking-fund of such city and shall be inviolably reserved for, and applied exclusively to, the payment of the principal and interest of such debt ...” A sinking fund is one “instituted and invested in such a manner that its gradual accumulations will enable it to meet and wipe out a debt at maturity,” (New Standard Dictionary) it is a fund “specially earmarked for the extinction of a debt.” Opinions, among them, that filed in <em>Brooke v.

It is obvious that the payments, so made from time to time, on account of the debt, constitute a positive benefit to holders of bonds of the particular issue so protected, and that they would not continue to enjoy the stipulated protection, if the credits resulting from the required payments on that particular debt were now diverted from their original purpose and the bondholders were relegated for their only security to the general taxing power of the City, as the City now in effect contends. If these funds are consolidated, the benefit of what has been so contributed to the older funds, must be shared by, and will enure to the benefit of, the holders of more recently issued bonds. This switching of benefits cannot be accomplished unless the City has reserved the right to compel the bondholders to submit to the change; but, as has been seen, instead of having the power to make such reservation, the right to issue bonds was expressly limited by the law as already stated. The City contends that no impairment of the contract will result because there was no pledge of specific property; that all the bondholder’s contract gives him is the City’s promise to pay at maturity with the right, on default, to have a court, in a proper proceeding, require the City to levy a tax then sufficient to pay its existing debts.</p>

The sinking funds established for the <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>older or earlier loans, having been accumulating credits for a longer time, would therefore have larger deposits of cash than sinking funds established for later loans. If, when the earliest loan matures, there should be a default and it should become necessary to levy a special tax to pay the amount due in excess of wTiat had been accumulated in the sinking fund for the purpose of paying at maturity, the amount then to be raised by taxes would be merely the face of the loan less the cash in the particular sinking fund. On the other hand, if, instead of paying the agreed amount into each sinking fund, that amount is now reduced by diversion to other sinking funds (for example, the proposed redistribution of the credits in the sinking funds for the bridge bonds) a larger tax would be required at maturity of the older loan because the amount to be raised wrnuld be larger. This would be a violation of the contract. The loan holder has the right to insist that his contract shall not be changed so that the tax to be levied at maturity will be larger than would have been required if the contract had been performed as made; that is a valuable right and the vicissitudes of city budget-making and the difficulty of finding subjects of taxation afford some idea of its value to the bondholders. The practical effect on his right further appears in figures that may be referred to. The manner in which past administration of the sinking funds has affected the total of the outstanding indebtedness on any particular loan appears to be stated in the account entitled “EXHIBIT ‘A’ Schedule No. 50”, in the brief of one of the intervening parties, and apparently taken from the published Annual Report of the City Controller to City Council for the year 1936. It is entitled: “Receipts, Disbursements and Balances of the Several Sinking Funds, with the Amount of Securities on Hand” as of December 31,1936. For purposes of illustration, we abstract the following, selecting out of the 44 loans, three which differ in face value as little as the Exhibit allows. The $4,000,000.00 <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>loan of 1906, with only $3,275,000.00 par value, outstanding, had to its credit in cash and securities $2,632,-467.20 or 80.38%, leaving only $642,532.80 (with interest) to be raised by special taxation if an order for that purpose had then become necessary. In the case of the $4,000,000.00 loan of 1920, a more recent loan, with $4,000,000.00 outstanding, the cash and securities on hand were $2,724,860.22 or 68.12% with $1,275,139.78 and interest to be raised in case of default. The still more recent $4,500,000.00 loan of 1929, with $4,500,-000. 00, par value, outstanding, had $758,582.57 in cash and securities on hand or 16.85% with $3,741,417.43 and interest to be raised. Those figures,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> taken at random from the account, state the City’s construction of what the contracts with the bondholders required as heretofore administered, and also show the practical value of the loanholder’s right to insist that the separate sinking fund be kept as agreed.</p>

Would the City continue to make payment at the rate heretofore paid in accord with its former recognition of the obligation of its contracts? Not at all; the annual payments would be less, and to the extent that they would be less, the contract would not be performed. We are left in no doubt about this, because we have the certificate of the three sinking fund commissioners that the payments will be less. In their official communication to City Council August 12, 1937, the Mayor, the City Controller and Mr. Goodall, in “transmitting herewith our [their] certification of the total requirements for the year 1938 for Sinking Fund purposes,” said: “At the time of the approval of this <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>act by the Governor it was agreed that the act should be reviewed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. If the Supreme Court holds the act to be constitutional, it will be unnecessary to appropriate any money to the Sinking Fund for the retirement of bonds for the year 1938. If, however, the court decides the act to be unconstitutional, it will be necessary for the Council to appropriate the sum of $7,343,536.” In other words, it was proposed to discharge the City’s admitted obligation to appropriate $7,343,536 for 1938, by redistributing the amount heretofore credited to the bridge bond sinking funds, notwithstanding the former decision of this court in <em>Corporation for the Relief of Widows, etc. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/317/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="317 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="8845302" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0076-01">317 Pa. 76</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.%20727" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="176 A. 727">176 A. 727</a> (1935), expressly deciding that the obligation of the City’s contract required that particular sum to be credited to those sinking funds.</p>

If released from making that payment now, how can it be said that the obligation of the contracts has not been impaired? The contention of the City is thus stated in its brief: “In other words, since the Sinking Fund Commissioners have not only the right but the duty to invest the money in City bonds, it follows that the only effect of the sinking fund is to reduce the total outstanding indebtedness of the City represented by these bonds but as to each bondholder who retains his bonds, the face amount of his bond is still due. No default, however great, on the part of the City under these facts, could result in the bondholder being entitled to participate in a distribution of the funds since there are no funds in the hands of the Sinking Fund Commissioners, but only bonds, which, under the case of <em>Brooke v. Philadelphia, </em>[<a href="/pa/162/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="162 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="856764" data-case-paths="/pa/162/0123-01">162 Pa. 123</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.%20387" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="29 A. 387">29 A. 387</a>] are not again assertable against the City. For that, he has the general credit of the City as his primary <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>obligation. It, therefore, seems plain that the right of the bondholder extends to compelling the payment into the fund of the necessary amount but that once the amount is paid in and so long as the amounts themselves are not withdrawn from the fund, the handling of the funds is purely a matter of administration.</p>

      <em>“Brooke v. Philadelphia, </em>and other cases, above cited, established as law what was or should have been actually the principle with regard to the Sinking Fund.”</p>

A general answer to that question appears in the constitutional provisions, the statute and ordinances referred to; for 1938 the amount certified as payable is $7,343,536, but which, the commissioners say, need not be paid if the contracts may be changed as proposed; a more specific answer to the question, as applied to the sum received for the Delaware River Bridge, was made in the decision of <em>Corporation for the Relief of Widows, etc. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/317/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="317 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="8845302" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0076-01">317 Pa. 76</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.%20727" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="176 A. 727">176 A. 727</a>. In the argument quoted, the City concedes the bondholders’ right to compel payment of the necessary amounts into the sinking fund; the administrative “handling of the funds” (to use the words of the argument) is as completely governed by the contract as the right to compel payment. It would come as a great surprise, if the court adopted the City’s contention that the loan contracts gave the bondholder no more than a mere right to call on the City to levy a tax when his bond matured, and that the contract requirement of annual payment for interest and amortization could be taken from him. The bondholder is entitled to the benefits of what the City, in the loan contracts, agreed to perform; to deprive him of this right is to impair the obligation of the contract.
