It was raised at the audit of the account of a surviving trustee under a deed of trust made April 13, 1880, by S. Alice McCreary, then residing in Philadelphia. She provided that the income should be paid to her for life subject to separate use and spendthrift trust provisions. The trustees were directed, at her death, to transfer <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>the trust property “to such person or persons, in such proportions, for such estates and for such uses and purposes, as I may by my last Will and Testament or writing in the nature thereof, . . . direct, limit and appoint.

She left surviving two daughters, Mabel and Dorothy, both married, Mabel having one child and Dorothy three. In the 19th paragraph of her will, she appointed as follows: that the “property held in trust under said deed at the time of my death shall be conveyed, assigned, transferred, paid over and delivered unto said Tilghman G. Pitts and Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore, Trustees, and the survivor of them, and the successors of them, the same to be added to and for the purposes of this my Will considered as though it constituted part of the rest, residue and remainder of my own personal estate, and I do hereby give, devise and bequeath the same unto the said Tilghman G.

As those interests were vested, the learned auditing judge, on the authority of the cases cited above, held it would be premature to pass on the validity of the subsequent remainders. On exceptions by the daughter Mabel, the majority of the learned judges of the court below, in an opinion by Stearns, J., were of the same opinion. The amount for distribution was awarded to the trustees named in the will on filing a bond: see section 57(a) Fiduciaries Act 1917, P. L. 447, 524, 20 PS section 991. The daughter Mabel appeals.</p>

Appellant contends, in the brief, that “By the express provisions of the Will the life estate in trust is <em>changed </em>by the Settlor herself, on the conditions which have arisen, into a fee simple, absolute and ‘free from further trusts.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b553-5" data-blocks='[["BL_553.4",553,[209,777,1152,1624]]]'>In dealing with the alternative provision it is desirable, in ascertaining intention, to consider it with the similar provision quoted above, from the deed of trust: “in default of such appointment, or as to any part of said estate as to which the appointment may for any reason fail to take effect, then upon the further trust to pay over. ...” There is no difficulty in separating the two trusts for the daughters for life from the subsequent limitations. The words in the deed “as to any part of said estate as to which the appointment may for any reason fail to take effect,” show that the settlor had recognized severability and dealt with the contingency resulting from possible illegality in part and designated what should be done with the part or parts that could not take effect as appointed. She again recognized it in the 19th paragraph of the will where the appointment was qualified by the words “so far as the law permits, to make the same disposition thereof [of the trust property] as I have hereinbefore made of my residuary individual property.” She appointed the trust property into her residuary estate and created what she called the ‘ ‘two trusts hereby created of my own residuary estate.” We have two classes of cases: (1) those in which prior vested interests can be separated from those that are ineffective <em>(Whitman’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/248/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="248 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="1011486" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0285-01">248 Pa. 285</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20A.%201062" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="93 A. 1062">93 A. 1062</a>; <em>Ewalt v.

      <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>The majority of the learned judges in the court below thought that the words “this portion,” in the alternative provision in the will, were intended to mean the same thing as the words in the deed “any part of said estate as to which the appointment may for any reason fail to take effect.” Both expressions relate to the same contingency. By “this portion” she did not, in all circumstances, mean the whole of the appointed interests, as appellant contends; she meant “any part of said [appointed] estate as to which the appointment may for any reason fail to take effect.” And this view accords with the dominant purpose of the will. If we consider the general intention of the testatrix, as already described, her language leaves us in no doubt that she intended, as a separate and distinct step in the appointment, to create spendthrift and separate use trusts for both daughters for their respective lives; that, next, she provided for her daughters’ children, desiring them, if Mabel died first, to share equally, and that the alternative provision relied on by appellant was intended to cure possible defects in limitations following the daughters’ life estates. It is as if she had said: in exercising my right of appointment I have first designated, by name, certain persons to take certain future interests in the trust property; and, second, by description, I have designated other classes of persons to take such other interests as I have power to create within the permissible limits of the rule against perpetuities; but, if I have misunderstood how the application of the rule will affect the appointments, and thus have created interests not vesting in time, so much as cannot vest in time shall go absolutely to the “person or persons as may at the time this trust shall be decided void as aforesaid, be entitled to receive the net income thereof, and in the same proportions, absolutely and free from further trusts.” By the word “trust” in the sentence just quoted, she did not mean the total of interests created by the appointment because in her will she said she was creating two <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>trusts, one for each daughter; the word “trusts” in the phrase “free from further trusts” was used in still another sense. By her designation of such persons “as may at the time this trust shall be decided void as aforesaid, be entitled to receive the net income thereof” she meant those entitled by her scheme of distribution to receive the income if the trusts were valid, but if the future interests then attacked were held invalid, those to whom she had given the income should take the principal instead. Indeed, it is by means of testatrix’s designation, so understood, that appellant, as a party entitled to income under the trust for her life, contends that invalidity of subsequent estates now give her a fee in the trust of one-half of the property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
