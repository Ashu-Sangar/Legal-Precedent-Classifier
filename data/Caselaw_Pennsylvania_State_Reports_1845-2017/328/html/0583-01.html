    <p id="b618-10" data-blocks='[["BL_618.12",618,[273,1170,1151,314]]]'>Defendant appeals from judgment on a verdict for the death of plaintiff’s husband, found lying on defendant’s tracks about 3:30 a. m., May 6, 1934, so fatally injured that he died without regaining consciousness. No eye witnesses appeared. The manner of his injury is purely conjectural.</p>
    <p id="b618-11" data-blocks='[["BL_618.13",618,[274,1496,1148,257]]]'>Defendant asserts there is no evidence of negligence and that the record clearly shows decedent’s contributory negligence. As we all agree with the second contention, we need not consider the first. Defendant’s motion for judgment n. o. v. should have been granted.</p>
    <p id="b618-12" data-blocks='[["BL_618.14",618,[273,1765,1150,697]],["BL_619.1",619,[202,350,1154,1623]]]'>Decedent lived in the borough of St. Clair, composed of two collections of houses, one located on the east side of defendant’s railway tracks, which extend north and south. The other collection of houses, known as Arnot’s Addition, was on the west side of the tracks either on the high bank along the railroad or beyond the bank, the record does not show which. Hancock Street leads from the village on the east side to Arnot’s Addition, passes under the defendant’s tracks and furnishes a safe way to go from one to the other. Decedent lived on the east side of the tracks and when last seen was on that side at about midnight. The only train that moved on the tracks during the night passed the village <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>at 2: 00 a. m.; it is this train which must have injured him. A small station is maintained by defendant at or near the point where Hancock Street passes under the tracks. Decedent was found at a point about 200 feet north of the station. To reach the station and the tracks in front of it, decedent must have left Hancock Street and ascended to the level of the railroad tracks. He was not an intending passenger; was not employed by defendant, and, so far as appears, sustained no relation whatever to the defendant. While it is suggested in appellee’s argument that decedent may have been on his way across the tracks on what is alleged to have been a permissive crossing, no one knows what his intention was. If it be assumed that he left Hancock Street and went up to the tracks to cross them on his way to or from Arnot’s Addition, a necessary assumption to account on any rational basis for his presence on the tracks, we are at once confronted with the well settled rule of law that one is guilty of contributory negligence in rejecting a safe way, in this case Hancock Street, and, instead, voluntarily choosing one known to be dangerous: <em>Gara v.
