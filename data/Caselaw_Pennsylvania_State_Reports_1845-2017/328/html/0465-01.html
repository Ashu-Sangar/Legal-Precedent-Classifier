L. 289, as amended, 15 PS Sec. 2851-1, to <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>be known as Philadelphia Labor’s Non-Partisan League Club.</p>
    <p id="b501-3" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[237,463,1149,477]]]'>The purposes of the proposed corporation are thus set forth in the articles: “The proposed corporation is being formed for the purpose of uniting its members in an organization to encourage and promote acquaintanceship and understanding among its members, and to enjoy the interchange of social, civic and political ideas, to promote a better understanding of the political and social phases of citizenship and to otherwise enjoy social intercourse among its members.”</p>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[234,952,1151,469]]]'>Upon presentation of the application, it was referred by the court to a master who held a hearing and took testimony from those interested in the grant of the charter. The master filed his report and recommended the charter be granted. Thereafter without any further hearing the court in an opinion disapproved the report of the master and dismissed the application. Exceptions were filed by the applicants to the opinion and the order.</p>
    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.6",501,[230,1442,1154,967]],["BL_502.1",502,[265,357,1148,966]]]'>In its opinion the court stated it had been testified before the master that the proposed corporation intended to have ten thousand members, which prompted the court to have an independent investigation made. Accordingly the judge asked for a report from the police department of Philadelphia. The opinion recites that this report disclosed that a number of the incorporators have police records, that one of them had been arrested in Chicago during a strike charged with inciting to riot, another had been arrested charged with illegal picketing and arrested again for disorderly conduct during an election, a third had been arrested eight times on various charges and is a constant source of trouble to the police, and the proposed president of the organization is an associate of racketeers and gunmen and of Chicago gangsters. The court concluded the incorporators and the proposed president are undesirable iitizens and not the type of men who should be vested <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>with power to guide or influence the interests and purposes of ten thousand persons and that their social status would not be improved by reason of their membership in the proposed corporation. The court also stated that in view of what is heretofore recited, the purposes set forth in the application are not the bona fide intentions of the organization if a charter was granted, but such alleged purpose could be used as a cloak to carry on activities in other fields. The opinion goes on to say that if a charter should be granted, the corporation could have no such power as set forth in its articles, to organize and grant the same privileges conferred upon it to other subordinate organizations with a separate set up of officers, holding that this would be a usurpation of the power of the courts where such authority is alone vested. Finally, the court determined that the granting of a charter to such an organization is against public policy.</p>

At least the applicants should have the chance to show that those matters alleged against them are untrue or mistaken or susceptible of another interpretation.

The applicants must satisfy the court as to the propriety of its certificate, “otherwise”, in the language of the act “the court shall refuse the application.” It should always be borne in mind that in charter applications the applicants are asking the court for a special privilege as to the propriety of granting which, its conscience must be satisfied.

The Board of Directors shall have the authority to establish and terminate such units, branches, clubs or chapters, but each unit, branch, club or chapter may be a local self-governing organization, a part, however, of the proposed Philadelphia Labor’s Non-Partisan League Club and <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>subject, moreover, to these Articles of Incorporation, the By-laws and any amendments thereto, and enjoying the benefits and advantages of the Non-Profit Corporation Law of 1933.”</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[262,572,1154,1559]]]'>There is no warrant in the law for such a provision in the charter. Section 305 of the act (15 PS Sec. 2851-305) under the subhead “Members of Nonprofit Corporations Grouped in Local Units” provides: “ The articles and by-laws of a nonprofit corporation may provide that the members of the corporation, and those who thereafter become members, shall be grouped in local units formed upon the basis of territorial area, or such other basis as may be determined in the articles or by-laws, <em>for the purpose of election of delegates or representatives to represent the members of such local units at any annual or special meeting of such corporation. </em>The articles or by-laws may provide the territorial limits or other basis from or upon which each local unit is drawn or formed, to do all things necessary to insure the representation of the local unit at meetings of the corporation, and to provide the basis of representation and number of delegates to which the local unit is entitled, but each local unit shall be entitled to at least one delegate, and a delegate or delegates representing a local unit shall not have a greater number of votes than the total membership of the local unit. <em>The local units </em>designated by the articles or bylaws of any such corporation <em>may be incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth </em>by the members thereof, and shall have power to do all things necessary to give effect to this section.” The language of the articles is a wide departure from this section of the act and that of the by-laws, which need not be quoted, is even wider.</p>
