    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.6",580,[268,397,1151,854]]]'>Plaintiff, as mortgagee-purchaser at foreclosure, sued defendant, alleging that he was “the registered owner or the real and equitable owner” from September 20, 1928, when he took title, until the sheriff’s sale on March 2, 1931, at which plaintiff purchased at a nominal bid; that defendant failed to pay the city and school taxes due to the City of Philadelphia for the years 1929, 1930 and 1931, and that plaintiff was required to pay them and became entitled to restitution. Defendant filed an affidavit of defense with averments of new matter. Plaintiff replied and also took a rule for judgment “for amount insufficiently denied by the affidavit of defense and new matter.” Plaintiff asserted that no defense was stated as to the taxes for the year 1929, amounting to $7,791.85 with interest from March 18, 1931, the date when plaintiff paid them.</p>

The learned court also held that as the statute of limitations began to run from the time the plaintiff paid the taxes <em>(Presbyterian Ministers’ Fund v. Folz, </em><a href="/pa-super/41/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="41 Pa. Super. 303" data-case-ids="884167" data-case-paths="/pa-super/41/0303-01">41 Pa. Super.

Judgment was accordingly entered for the amount of the taxes and interest assessed in 1929 during which (until January 15th) he was the registered owner.</p>
