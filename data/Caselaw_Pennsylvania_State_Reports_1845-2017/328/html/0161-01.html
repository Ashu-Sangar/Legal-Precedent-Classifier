L. 389, providing that oral leases exceeding the term of three years shall have the effect of estates at will only, prevents a parol modification of a written lease exceeding that period. As this question was not raised in the court below, and appellants refrained from pressing it seriously on the first appeal, it was not discussed when the case was here before. We might dismiss the question by observing our usual rule, that the case on the first appeal having been decided on the issues presented, returned to the court below for trial under the legal principles set forth, and tried under the law as there stated, it is too late on the second appeal to raise a new theory or objection that should have been presented at the first trial.

The same is true in the present appeal. They failed to amend their answer to include the statute of frauds, and again they did not object to the admission of testimony for this reason. Is then section one of the Act of 1772, supra, a rule of substantive law, which must be applied by the trial court in spite of the fact it is not called to the court’s attention in any manner, or is the failure to invoke the statute at some stage of the proceedings prior to appeal an irrevocable waiver of it by the party who would derive advantage from its application?</p>

The reason for the rule was that section 4 of the Sales Act expressly provides that contracts within its inhibition shall be “unenforceable,” and thereby constitutes a “limitation on the power of the judiciary to afford a remedy,” as distinguished from a “mere rule of evidence.” Since all remedy for the enforcement of the contract was taken away, it was wholly outlawed by section 4, which could not be treated as a personal defense. The opinion, in commenting on the effect of the Act of 1772, supra, states at p. 335: “It is true certain personal defenses must be affirmatively set up and established, otherwise they are treated as waived; so, a failure to expressly aver the fact that the suit is barred by the statute of limitations prevents objection on this ground <em>(Barclay v. </em>Barclay, <a href="/pa/206/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="206 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="931937" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0307-01">206 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/206/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="206 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="931937" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0307-01">307</a>; Murphy v. </em>Taylor, <a href="/pa-super/63/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="63 Pa.

The Act reads: “All trusts ... of any lands . . ., and all grants and assignments thereof shall be manifested by writing, . . ., or else to be void: ...” This language, though strong, does not outlaw all trust instruments which do not meet the required form, but they may be enforced providing those who would benefit do not choose to invoke the statute. It is well settled that this statute does not defeat the desire of a trustee to honestly perform an oral trust of an interest in land, but merely voids the trust at his option: <em>Faunce v. </em>McCorkle, <a href="/pa/321/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="321 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1165857" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0116-01">321 Pa. 116</a>.

The majority view is that a party will be deemed to have renounced his rights under the statute of frauds if he does not in some way make known to the court his intention to invoke it either by pleading specially or interposing a timely objection to testimony in support of the oral agreement, or by claiming its protection in some other manner that gives the opposition opportunity to meet the objection. This is the most equitable rule and need not be applied as a rule of substantive law irrespective of the circumstances. To permit a party to invoke the statute of frauds for the first time on appeal would be manifestly unfair. A party seeking to enforce his oral contract would be misled and refrain from proving facts by way of part performance, or otherwise, which would automatically take the contract out of the statute of frauds. It does not do to say, “You know what the law is, bring your contract within it.” The facts are pleaded as they exist. Thus A orally sells land to B, who goes into possession and makes improvements. A refuses to convey. B pleads his contract. A must set up in some way the statute to put B on notice so he may be prepared to meet the objection. This was recognized in <em>Am. Products Co. v. Refining Company, </em>supra. In this way the defendant is given a warning that he must develop facts which will take his case out of the statute of frauds if he is to prevail, and it will not be enough for him to convince the jury of the existence of a parol contract.</p>

As pointed out in appellants’ previous appeal, the evidence of a subsequent parol modification of a written contract must be <em>convincing </em>to sustain a finding of its existence. The burden of proof imposed upon the party asserting the parol modification would not be satisfied by his word alone. Nor would evidence of part performance by payments of amounts less than those provided for by the contract be of sufficient corroborative force to carry the question to the jury. Such evidence, without more, does not weigh the scales one way or the other, and is entirely compatible with a finding that the landlord through indulgence and out of consideration for the tenant, who is financially embarrassed, allowed him a period of grace in which to make full payment, in the meantime accepting whatever he could pay on account of the rent due. If the law should definitely attribute to the receipt of an amount less than that due under a contract an intention to modify the provision of the written instrument to correspond to the amount received, it would make it extremely dangerous for landlords and others to adopt a lenient attitude toward their obligors and discourage indulgence and leniency in times of hardship. But here the evidence reaches beyond the word of Slanicus and the receipt of less than the amount due, and meets the burden placed upon appellee.</p>

Otherwise it would have been vain to compute each week the amount due based on a certain percentage of the gross receipts. Some of these payments were made in cash and others by check, bearing the notation that they were for rent due during a particular week. The records kept by the Sierras of the weekly rental payments received from appellee did not indicate that there was any arrearage or that the payments were merely accepted on account of the rent due under the written lease. The payments in amounts different from the rent provided for by the written lease were accepted by the lessors without protest or demand for more. Some of the payments made by appellee after business conditions improved <em>exceeded the amount called for by the lease. </em>The evidence shows that for a period of over four years, up to appellants’ attempt to eject appellee, he faithfully performed and executed the terms of the parol agreement substituting payment of rent on a percentage basis of the gross receipts for payment of a fixed amount. Now that the motion picture business has picked up and profits are being reaped, appellants cannot hold appellee responsible for rent, as stipulated by the written lease, at least for the period during which the oral modification has been executed by periodic payments in accordance with its terms.</p>

No discussion is necessary of the possibility of waiver of such a condition by the conduct of the lessor.

It may well be that Urling has released appellee of this obligation, or has given him an extension of time in which to perform. However this may be, there was sufficient evidence to show that appellee did take over the lease as the assignee of Urling, and his compliance or noncompliance with the provision of the assignment respecting the consideration due Urling has no material bearing in this case.

We need not consider the evidence in this respect, since this is not an attempt to enforce the agreement. It may be that because no percentage was fixed, it could not be accorded legal recognition as an executory contract, but in so far as the parties have executed it, the question whether its terms are sufficiently certain to meet the requirements of law drops out of sight. What is to be done in the future may be another question.</p>

Their conduct in accepting appellee as tenant and receiving rent on a modified basis over a period of years has effectively waived their right to eject him for this default; and, even if enforceable, at least reasonable <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>notice of their intention to compel its payment would be required.

In other words, a defense based on the statute of frauds may be waived, and if waived, a judgment, based upon a contract which is prohibited by the statute of frauds is not fundamentally erroneous by reason of that fact. The defense of the statute of frauds may he urged in the defendant’s pleadings either by special exception or by special plea or by objection to testimony.” See also <em>Central National Bank of </em>

        <em> </em>In reaching the conclusion that section 1 of the Act of 1772, supra, and the Act of 1856, supra, do not void absolutely all contracts contrary to their mandates, full notice has been taken of the decisions of this court intimating that these statutes prescribe rules of substantive law and not mere rules of evidence. In <em>S. Dep. and T. Co. v. Coal &amp; Coke Company, </em><a href="/pa/234/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="234 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="982492" data-case-paths="/pa/234/0100-01">234 Pa. 100</a>, this court, in an opinion by Justice Mestrezat, stated at p. 112: “The statute is not a mere rule of evidence, but a limitation of judicial authority to afford a remedy.” If the rule laid down is to be interpreted literally, it would seem to banish from the reports many cases which have sustained oral contracts under the statute by reason of their admission by those who are in a position to assert it. Certainly a void contract could not be given life by the mere admission of its existence, if the law absolutely forbids the contract to be made orally. In <em>Mott v. Kaldes, </em><a href="/pa/288/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="288 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1100799" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0264-01">288 Pa. 264</a>, Chief Justice Moschzisker said at p. 276: “It often happens that those who, under the circumstances present in a particular case, seem not to be equitably entitled, are nevertheless allowed the support of the statute of frauds; since to hold otherwise would void the statute which must be followed as a declaration of public policy.” Then following the statement that the lease was “illegal,” it is stated at p. 277: <em>ue. . . </em>this interest has never ripened into a right and cannot ripen into a right by ratification based on subsequent conduct or by estoppel based on prior or subsequent conduct; for the courts to permit it to do so would be tantamount to . . . setting aside the Act of March 21, 1772.’ ” Admittedly this is strong language, but it cannot be accepted literally. In speaking of the contract as illegal it could not have been meant that it was entirely void, since under the specific terms of the statute it at least operated as an estate at will.</p>
