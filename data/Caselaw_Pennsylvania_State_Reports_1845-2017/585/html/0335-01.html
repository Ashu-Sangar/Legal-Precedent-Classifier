Fleming while attempting to sell him candy as part of a school fundraiser. Parents first brought an action (the federal case) in federal district court (the district court) against the Punxsutawney Area School District and its superintendent (the School District defendants) seeking liability under <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a> on a “state-created danger” theory, as discussed fully herein. The district court granted the School District defendants’ Motion to Dismiss holding that, <em>inter alia, </em>as a matter of law, the harm befalling L.W. was not foreseeable by the School District defendants or fairly directly related to their conduct. Parents then brought a negligence action against Scott Manzek (Manzek), 84 Services, Cookbook Publishers, Inc. (Cookbook), and Giftco, Inc. (Giftco) (collectively, the Fundraising Entities) in state court. The state trial court granted the Fundraising Entities’ preliminary objections relying on the district court’s analysis dismissing the federal case against the School District defendants. The Superior Court affirmed. For the reasons fully explained herein, we now reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>

In response, Fleming indicated that his mother would be home shortly and asked to look through the brochures. He invited L.W. into his house, where she sat on a chair while he looked at the brochures. When L.W. asked if she could use the bathroom, Fleming showed her where it was. Shortly thereafter, while L.W. was in the bathroom, Fleming entered and proceeded violently to assault L.W. physically and sexually.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The late Dean <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>Prosser expressed this view as follows: “These are shifting sands, and no fit foundation. There is a duty if the court says there is a duty; the law, like the Constitution, is what we make it. Duty is only a word with which we state our conclusion that there is or is not to be liability; it necessarily begs the essential question. When we find a duty, breach and damage, everything has been said. The word serves a useful purpose in directing attention to the obligation to be imposed upon the defendant, rather than the causal sequence of events; beyond that it serves none. In the decision whether or not there is a duty, many factors interplay: The hand of history, our ideas of morals and justice, the convenience of administration of the rule, and our social ideas as to where the loss should fall. In the end the court will decide whether there is a duty on the basis of the mores of the community, ‘always keeping in mind the fact that we endeavor to make a rule in each case that will be practical and in keeping with the general understanding of mankind.’ ”</blockquote>

Parents argue that when their well-pleaded facts are assessed in light of the noted and oft-stated standard for determination of the merits of preliminary objections and distinct from the shadow of the federal case, which Parents rightfully point out was against different defendants, they clearly establish such duty and therefore set forth a cause of action.</p>

From this well-pleaded and therefore accepted fact, the Superior Court presumed, and the Fundraising Entities argue, that the School District must have solicited the Fund-raising Entities’ services and been familiar with their efforts. Moreover, again premised on the same factual foundation, the Fundraising Entities, once more following the Superior Court’s lead, argue that there is a necessary inference in this case that the School District defendants maintained a closer relationship with L.W. than did they. Thus, the argument concludes, assuming the School District’s superior familiarity with the fundraising activities and with L.W. personally, if her attack was not foreseeable to the School District defendants, it surely could not have been foreseeable to the more removed and unfamiliar Fundraising Entities.</p>

Moreover, Par<a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>ents assert that these inherent dangers were exasperated by the Fundraising Entities when they enticed the children, including L.W., into dangerous activity by offering prizes and classrooms parties; whetting the children’s appetite and thereby encouraging dangerous activity by showing the prizes and handing out gel pens to each student. Accepting these facts and all inferences drawn therefrom, as we must, we believe it evident, and indeed obvious, that Parents have stated a cause of action against the Fundraising Entities.

What is before us is whether the facts contained in the instant complaint set forth a cause of action for negligence against the Fundraising Entities pursuant to Pennsylvania law.

Although this issue has not been raised before this court, in my opinion, it is apparent that Appellants’ complaint has tacitly conceded that there is no causation in <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>this matter. In a failure to warn case, a defendant will not be held liable, even in the absence of making a warning, when the plaintiff already knew of the danger which the missing warning allegedly should have cautioned and engaged in the dangerous activity anyway. <em>See Phillips v. A-Best, </em><a href="/pa/542/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="542 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="458972" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0124-01">542 Pa. 124</a>, <a href="/pa/542/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="665 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="458972,7880612" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0124-01,/a2d/665/1167-01">665 A.2d 1167</a>, 1171 (1995). In the instant matter, the complaint admits that Appellants had specifically warned L.W. against approaching strangers in her fundraising. <em>See </em>Complaint at ¶¶ 15 and 18. In essence, Appellants had already given the warning that they claim Appellees negligently failed to convey. Thus, it cannot be said that Appellees’ failure to provide a warning in any fashion caused L.W.’s tragic injuries.</p>

Philadelphia Center for Human Development, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/554/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="554 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="765940" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0209-01">554 Pa. 209</a>, <a href="/a2d/720/1032-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="720 A.2d 1032" data-case-ids="11811681,765940" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/1032-01,/pa/554/0209-01">720 A.2d 1032</a> (1998). In <em>Emerich, </em>a psychiatric patient informed his psychiatrist that he intended to kill his girlfriend. In light of there being such a specific threat posed by a particular individual, this court held that the psychiatrist had a duty to warn the girlfriend of the boyfriend-patient’s threat to murder her. In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>however, there is no allegation that Appellees had knowledge that Fleming posed such a threat.</p>
