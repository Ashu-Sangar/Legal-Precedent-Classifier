Trial counsel’s first line of reasoning in support of his failure to object to Dr. Hume’s testimony was that he did not want to undermine either his credibility or line of communication with the jury by raising objections which would not be fruitful. N.T., 11/18/2004, at <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>81-82. Counsel pointed out that he repeatedly challenged the admissibility of Dr. Hume’s testimony both before trial and before the penalty phase, and the trial court overruled each of these objections. <em>Id. </em>at 48-50, 52-53, 54. Additionally, counsel argued that he raised numerous objections to Dr. Hume’s testimony, which were similarly overruled. <em>Id. </em>at 60. Therefore, according to counsel, he did not want to object to Dr. Hume’s testimony and was afraid of undermining his credibility in front of the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 81-82. In response, PCRA counsel challenged trial counsel’s testimony by asking him whether a specific constitutional objection would have been better than a general objection to Dr. Hume’s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 57. PCRA counsel also pointed out that after Dr. Hume’s testimony regarding Appellant’s silence, trial counsel raised additional specific objections to Dr. Hume’s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 87-91, 93-95. PCRA counsel therefore attempted to weaken trial counsel’s testimony by demonstrating that trial counsel did not have a good reason not to object to Dr. Hume’s testimony. The PCRA court, however, credited trial counsel’s testimony that he did not object to Dr. Hume’s testimony so as not to undermine his credibility with the jury and to maintain his line of communication with the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Accordingly, as to this point, the PCRA court concluded that “it is the opinion of the court that a strategy where counsel attempts to maintain credibility with a jury in a death penalty case ... has ‘some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interest.’ ” PCRA court opinion at 5.</p>

Specifically, he testified that he was going to offer that Appellant had a limited mental capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 66, 71-72. Trial counsel believed Dr. Hume’s testimony regarding Appellant’s silence was consistent with his argument that Appellant had limited mental capabilities, since he intended to show that Dr. Hume’s testimony demonstrated that Appellant was not capable of answering the questions. <em>Id. </em>at 66-68, 72-73. PCRA counsel then challenged trial counsel’s testimony by pointing out that he did not, in fact, pursue this line of cross-examination with Dr. Hume. <em>Id. </em>at 84-85. In response, trial counsel testified that “[Dr. Hume] was a very matter of fact positive witness. After having felt him out for a little while, I did not think I was going to get much out of him at all, okay.” <em>Id. </em>at 69; <em>see also id. </em>at 85-6. The PCRA court credited trial counsel’s testimony, finding that trial counsel “limited his cross-examination of Dr. Hume because he was a trained medical doctor and a lawyer. He believed that Dr. Hume would have been able to turn his answers to his questioning in such a way that it would result in a net positive for the prosecution.” PCRA court opinion at 5. Again, the PCRA court credited counsel’s testimony, making a legal determination that counsel had a reasonable basis for the strategy he pursued regarding Dr. Hume’s testimony.</p>

PCRA counsel also pointed out that trial counsel raised numerous objections during closing arguments, but none to the reference to Dr. Hume’s testimony. N.T., 11/18/2004, at 98-99. Counsel responded, “When I say I was concerned about my credibility with Hume, I didn’t want to give the impression of hiding anything. There was nothing to hide. In the closing argument that you just referenced, my recollection is tenor or emotional aspects of it or such that I probably felt it wise to object to just get a break or to tone it down a little bit.” <em>Id. </em>at 100. Once again, the PCRA court credited trial counsel’s reasoning that trial counsel “wished to draw the jury’s atten<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>tion away from Dr. Hume’s testimony to that of his own witnesses.” PCRA court opinion at 5.</p>

The footnote in <em>Hughes </em>which the Majority invokes in support of this rather simplistic view was written as a responsive repudiation of a point I made in my separate opinion in that case. <em>See <a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="865 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="1140661,9035570" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01,/a2d/865/0761-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="865 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="1140661,9035570" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01,/a2d/865/0761-01">at 818-19</a> (Castille, J., joined by Eakin, J., concurring and dissenting). <em>Hughes, </em>however, does not stand for the broad proposition that counsel <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>may always be faulted for failing to anticipate any and all future judicial interpretations of a statute. Even accepting <em>Hughes </em>’ responsive proposition as a starting point, the analysis in any particular case must depend upon considerations including the clarity and lack of ambiguity in the statutory provision; previous interpretations (if any) of the provision; and the mode of analysis set forth in the subsequent opinion/interpretation the defendant <em>invokes </em>— i.e. a first interpretation, unanimous plain language reading is more likely to provide a basis for finding an ineffective “failure to vindicate” than is a reading which is bottomed upon statutory construction, over a dissenting opinion, and disapproving a prior construction. In short, whether counsel can be deemed ineffective in such an instance depends upon the circumstances; it is not an absolute.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[267,1107,1163,1233]]]'>As an example of the necessity for judicial construction of a statute before its proper interpretation may be deemed knowable and enforceable, one need only consider the Third Circuit’s refusal to honor the state procedural default arising from the plain language of the PCRA’s jurisdictional time-bar provision. The time-bar was adopted by the General Assembly in 1995 (taking effect in January 1996) and in the very first case in which this Court considered the new bar, we held that the plain language of the statute made clear that it was jurisdictional. <em>See Commonwealth v. Peterkin, </em><a href="/pa/554/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="554 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="765982" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0547-01">554 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d 638</a> (1998). However, despite recognizing that the time-bar appeared “on its face to impose a one-year deadline in all cases except those falling within three categories,” the Third Circuit subsequently found that the statute could not be deemed to mean what it plainly said (for purposes of deferring to the time-bar as an adequate and independent state procedural default) until this Court had passed upon it a few more times and made clear that we would enforce its plain terms. <em>See Bronshtein v. Horn, </em><a href="/f3d/404/0700-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="404 F.3d 700" data-case-ids="9015116" data-case-paths="/f3d/404/0700-01">404 F.3d 700</a>, 708 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(applying Fahy v.

      <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>Third, with respect to appellant’s claim of defective proportionality review on direct appeal, I write separately to make some additional points. At the outset, it is important to emphasize that this is not a claim rising to either federal or state constitutional dimension. Indeed, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Pulley v. Harris, </em><a href="/us/465/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="465 U.S. 37" data-case-ids="11334651" data-case-paths="/us/465/0037-01">465 U.S. 37</a>, 49-51, <a href="/us/465/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="465 U.S. 37" data-case-ids="11334651" data-case-paths="/us/465/0037-01">104 S.Ct. 871</a>, <a href="/us/465/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="465 U.S. 37" data-case-ids="11334651" data-case-paths="/us/465/0037-01">79 L.Ed.2d 29</a> (1984), it has been clear that proportionality review was not a constitutional requirement, but instead was a “constitutionally superfluous” exercise deriving from a statute which was drafted by the General Assembly in understandable concern that such review might be constitutionally required by the U.S. Supreme Court in its mercurial capital jurisprudence. Unfortunately, proportionality review was not timely removed from the Pennsylvania death penalty statute following the decision in <em>Pulley. </em>Thus, assuming that a claim of defective proportionality review has not been waived or previously litigated, it is cognizable under the version of the PCRA which governs this appeal only as a state-law claim deriving from a statute. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2) (subsequently amended and replaced).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[197,1341,1154,626]],["BL_662.1",662,[255,280,1164,467]]]'>It is also unclear whether this claim has been waived. The predicate for the claim is that this Court’s opinion on direct appeal misapprehended the facts relevant to proportionality review. Under the version of the PCRA which governs here, an issue was deemed waived “if the petitioner failed to raise it and if it could have been raised before the trial, at the trial, on appeal, in a habeas corpus proceeding or other proceeding actually conducted or in a prior [PCRA] proceeding.” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b) (subsequently amended and replaced). If this Court misapprehended the governing facts for purposes of proportionality review, appellant had an opportunity to seek timely relief, and accurate proportionality review, via a rear<a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>gument petition. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 2543 (setting forth considerations governing allowance of reargument; and specifically included as an example of “the character of the reasons which will be considered: ... Where the court has overlooked or misapprehended a fact of record material to the outcome of the case.”). That appellant did not do so suggests, at a minimum, that his appeal counsel, who was in the best position to assess the accuracy of this Court’s review, was satisfied with the result.</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[255,781,1162,1007]]]'>Finally, and on a related note, to the extent that the record is unclear these many years later concerning whether this Court relied upon erroneous information in conducting its proportionality review, that ambiguity weighs against appellant, as he bears the burden under the PCRA. In addition, appellant must show that the supposed factual error on direct review “so undermined the truth determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place” and that the sentence of death “resulted from” this error. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)®. Thus, the PCRA rationally presumes the validity of concluded proceedings, and it rightly places the burden squarely upon the petitioner to demonstrate his entitlement to relief, which includes a prejudice component. Because appellant has not proven that his sentence was in fact disproportionate, and would have been found so upon the facts he prefers, he is entitled to no relief. Given these circumstances, I believe that the supplemental proportionality review engaged in by the Majority affords appellant more than his due.</p>

It seems to me that, before accepting counsel’s <em>logic </em>that his making of unmeritorious objections foreclosed ones necessary to prevent prejudice that is reasonably likely to have affected the imposition of a sentence of death, <em>see Duffey, </em><a href="/pa/579/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="579 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1370902" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0186-01">579 Pa. at 204</a>, 855 A.2d at 775 (finding that Appellant was prejudiced by the commentary concerning his post-arrest silence), a reviewing court would be duty bound to make some evaluation along these lines to distinguish between truly reasonable strategic choice and serious miscalculation.

This position, however, fails to take into account that this specific constitutional error was all that was before the PCRA court at the remand hearing. <em>See Duffey, </em><a href="/pa/579/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="579 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1370902" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0186-01">579 Pa. 186</a>, 205, <a href="/a2d/855/0764-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="855 A.2d 764" data-case-ids="12254857,1370902" data-case-paths="/a2d/855/0764-01,/pa/579/0186-01">855 A.2d 764</a>, 776 (2004)(remanding for an evidentiary hearing solely with respect to the issue of the stewardship of counsel relative to the prejudicial testimony concerning post-arrest silence). It therefore appears reasonably clear to me that the PCRA court was expressing the position that the general objections obviated the specific, relevant ones.
