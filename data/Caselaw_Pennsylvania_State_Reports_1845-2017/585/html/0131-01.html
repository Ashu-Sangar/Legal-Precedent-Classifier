The contracts between the District and the contractors assigned the District the right to any refund of sales and use tax <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>paid by the contractors, and required the contractors to maintain records of purchases and payments, including sales and use tax paid. At the conclusion of the project, the contractors remitted sales and use tax to the Commonwealth in the amount of at least $36,697.44, based on their purchase or use of property used to build the new facility. The District then attempted to assert its assigned right to obtain a tax refund; it filed a petition, alleging the overpayment of sales and use tax with the Board of Appeals, Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. The Board of Appeals held a hearing and denied the petition in its entirety. The Board of Appeals found the District failed to prove it paid the relevant taxes, and, even if it did, many items were subject to tax when purchased by the contractors.</p>

The Board granted the District a partial refund of $10,621.08 on transactions involving electrical, air conditioning, and plumbing equipment. The Board concluded those items were building and machinery equipment transferred by a construction contractor to the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities or political subdivisions; Section 204 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, <em>see </em>72 P.S. § 7204(57)(ii), as amended July 1, 1998, provides a tax exemption for “[t]he sale at retail to or use by a construction contractor of building machinery and equipment and services thereto that are: ...

It was also stipulated that the contractors installed the disputed items in the new school building, but each item could be removed without damage to itself or to the real estate, and each item could be reused if <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>removed. It was agreed that the contracts were entered July 1,1998, the same date Act 45 of 1998, which amended portions of the Tax Code, became effective. The parties also agreed that if the Commonwealth Court ruled in the District’s favor, the District would receive an additional refund of $9,650.14 plus interest for tax paid; if the Commonwealth prevailed, the District would receive an additional refund of $467.02 plus interest.</p>

The issue before us is whether a government entity, acting as an assignee of a contractor’s rights, is exempt from sales and use tax on tangible personal property the contractor purchased and installed in the government entity’s building. This issue in turn depends upon whether the contractors possessed a right to receive a refund of all sales and use tax; if the answer is yes, then the District is entitled to a refund as assignee.</p>

The question is whether the contractors, as assignors, met the tangible personal property exemption under § 7204(12). The contractors cannot be considered the United States, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or its instrumentalities or political subdivisions. The District stands in the shoes of the assignors, but the assignors do not stand in the shoes of the assignee.

The District argues the contractors purchased the tangible personal property at issue for resale to the District; thus, the District could claim a resale tax exemption.</p>

Under this language, the contractors here certainly did “use” the tangible personal property at issue.

Consequently, for the contractors, a <em>sales and use </em>tax exemption exists in § 7204, which clearly exempts from taxation only building machinery and equipment transferred to exempt entities. All parties agree the disputed items are not building machinery and equipment. The statutory language clearly excuses only tax on building machinery and equipment, and its transfer or use by the contractor. <em>Beck Electric Construction, Inc. </em>no longer controls in such instances because the statutory language is clear — an exemption does not exist when personal property is transferred to an exempt entity and is easily removable.</p>

Section 7204(12) remains in full effect; it provides sales and use tax exemptions for government entities. Section 7204(57) now specifically governs sales and use tax exemptions for construction contractors. The District would likely be eligible for a tax exemption under § 7204(12) if it directly paid sales and use taxes; however, it did not. It assumed the contractors’ tax status as the contractors’ assignee, which eliminated its ability to receive an additional refund under § 7204(12).</p>
