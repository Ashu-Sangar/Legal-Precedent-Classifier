      <em>See id. </em>Over the next five years, St. James did not send any clerical or lay representatives to the Diocesan Convention. <em>See id. </em>During this same time period, St. James sent a letter to the Diocesan Bishop, the Right Reverend Lyman C.

For this as well as other reasons, St. James’ vestry began considering whether it was necessary for St. James to separate from the Diocese and the National Episcopal Church. <em>See </em>N/T, 10/16/2002 at 203. However, the vestry knew that it would be difficult for St. James to separate while retaining its property because of the Diocesan and the National Episcopal Church’s canons which placed St. James’ property in trust for those entities. <em>See id. </em>at 252-53, Exhs.

After a majority of the members present at the meeting voted in favor of the plan, the vestry filed the appropriate documents with the Department of State to merge St. James into the CSJL Foundation. <em>See </em>N/T. 10/16/2002 at 212-13, Exh. P-54. Once the merger was complete, the vestry changed the name of the CSJL Foundation to the Church of St. James the Less so that the only difference between the new and old churches was that the new church’s corporate charter did not recognize a relationship with the Diocese or the National Episcopal Church. <em>See </em>Exh.

Moreover, they argue that the Dennis Canon cannot be applied to St. James simply by virtue of its membership in the National Episcopal Church because a member of a voluntary association cannot be bound by amendments to the association’s rules that deprive the member of a vested property right. <em>See Marshall v.

The National Episcopal Church’s canons, however, did not require that proposed amendments be circulated to local Episcopal churches or parish members to be present during the adoption of amendments. Rather, according to the National Episcopal Church’s 1964 canons, to which St. James acceded when it amended its Charter in 1967, the National Episcopal Church could amend its canons based on “a concurrent resolution” by the two major branches of that church, the House of Bishops and the House of Deputies. <em>See </em>Exh. P-43 at canon 66, § 1. Moreover, according to the record evidence, it seems that just such a resolution was adopted with regard to the Dennis <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>Canon during the September 1979 General Convention. <em>See </em>Exh.

However, this argument is also unavailing because even though the National Episcopal Church may have typically enacted canons in the January following their adoption, its canons did not require that it do so. <em>See </em>Exh. P-43 (“[A]ll amendments and repeals of Canons ... <em>unless otherwise expressly ordered, </em>shall take effect on the first day of January following the adjournment of the General Convention at which they were enacted or made”) (emphasis added). Accordingly, as the National Episcopal Church was entitled under its canons to order the immediate enactment of a newly adopted canon and the evidence otherwise indicates that the National Episcopal Church adhered to its rules in enacting the Dennis Canon, we find no merit in St. James’ arguments that the Dennis Canon was not properly enacted.</p>

However, we disagree with Appellants that St. James had a vested interest in its property prior to the enactment of the Dennis Canon because St. James’ Charter makes clear that St. James had already agreed to hold its property in trust for the Diocese prior to the enactment of the Dennis Canon. In this regard, we initially note that St. James’ Charter declares that St. James’ purpose is to serve as a place to worship God <em>“according to the faith and discipline of the [National Episcopal Church].” </em>Exh. P-9 (emphasis added). More importantly, the Charter ensures that St. James will <em>always </em>be used for this purpose as it (1) states that any person who disclaims the authority of the National Episcopal Church or the Diocese can no longer be a member of St. James; and (2) requires St. James to obtain the Diocese’s <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>consent for amendments to its Charter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_28" id="ref_footnote_1_28">28</a>

As such, it plainly held its property for the benefit of the National Episcopal Church and the Diocese, <em>ie., </em>in trust for those entities. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 2 (defining trust as “a fiduciary relationship with respect to property, subjecting the person by whom the title to the property is held to equitable duties to deal with the property for the benefit of another person”); Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed.2004) (defining trust as “[t]he right, enforceable solely in equity, to the beneficial enjoyment of property to which another person holds the legal title”); <em>see also In re: Evans’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/372/0284-02" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="372 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1237997,1238050" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0284-02,/pa/372/0284-01">372 Pa. 284</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20A.2d%20683" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="93 A.2d 683">93 A.2d 683</a>, 685 (1953) (no special form of terminology is necessary to create a trust, “nor is the absence of the word ‘trust’ controlling”).</p>

For example, when it acceded to the Diocesan canons in effect when it last amended its Charter, St. James specifically agreed to take and hold its property “for the work of the [Diocese].” Exh. P-51 at canon XII, § II. Further, by acceding to the National Episcopal Church’s canons, St. James agreed not to alienate or encumber its property without the Diocese’s consent. <em>See </em>Exh. P-43 at canons 6.3 (“No Vestry, Trustee, or other body, authorized ... to hold, manage, or administer [parish property] shall encumber or alienate the same or any part thereof without the written consent of the Bishop and Standing Committee of the Diocese.... ”), 25.2 (“It shall not be lawful for any Vestry, Trustees, or other body authorized by laws of any State or <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>Territory to hold property for any [Parish] to encumber or alienate any consecrated Church or Chapel ... without the previous consent of the Bishop, acting with the advice and consent of the Standing Committee of the Diocese.... ”). Finally, St. James declared in its Charter that if it ever dissolves, its property will be placed in trust for the Diocese. <em>See </em>P-16. Through these provisions, St. James not only explicitly pledged that its property would always be used for Diocesan purposes, but by giving the Diocese the ultimate authority over decisions affecting its property, it acknowledged its obligation to the Diocese to always do so. Accordingly, these provisions, like the ones discussed earlier, are clear evidence that St. James intended to create a trust over its property in favor of the Diocese.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_29" id="ref_footnote_1_29">29</a> Furthermore, the evidence indicates that St. James’ vestry were well aware that St. James had granted the Diocese such a trust interest because (1) the Bishop’s attorney informed them in 1978 that the Diocese had a trust interest in St. James’ property; and (2) they purposefully sought to merge into the CSJL Foundation to void the Diocese’s trust interest in the property. <em>See </em>Exh.

These principles include three that are codified in the charter of St. James (“Local Charter” or “Charter”) and two that derive from canons of the National Church (National Canons).

First, according to the Majority, St. James “agreed to hold its property in trust for the Diocese” when it declared in its Charter that its purpose was “to serve as a place to worship God ‘according to the faith and discipline of the [National Episcopal Church].’ ” (Majority Op. at 448-50, 888 A.2d at 808 (quoting Charter)).

Nevertheless, the fact that these provisions fail even to mention the <em>res </em>of the supposed trust precludes the possibility that St. James intended by including this language in its Charter to create a trust with respect to its property for the benefit of the Diocese. <em>See Bair, </em><a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.%20274" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="171 A. 274">171 A. at 275-76</a>.</p>

Moreover, not only must the settlor clearly intend to create a trust; the statute of frauds requires that he must also affix his signature to the trust instrument to memorialize that intent. 33 P.S. § 2 (“All declarations or creations of trusts or confidences of any lands, tenements or hereditaments, and all grants and assignments thereof, shall be manifested by writing, signed by the party holding the title thereof....”). As we ourselves confirmed in <em>Beaver-Butler, </em>“the primary focus must be on the intent of the settlor at the time of the creation of the alleged trust.” <em>Beaver-Butler, </em><a href="/pa/507/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="489 A.2d 1317" data-case-ids="1792337,1792371" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0254-01,/pa/507/0255-01">489 A.2d at 1324</a> (emphasis added).</p>

The Majority, however, fails to cite any evidence from the record to support its contention that St. James thereby specifically agreed to <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>hold its property for the sole benefit of the Diocese. Rather, by the 1967 “accession” of St. James to the Diocesan Canons, nothing more is meant than the republication of the Charter subsequent in time — twenty-six years to be precise — to the amendments that the Diocese, in 1941, made to its Canons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

    <p id="b595-4" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[194,591,1156,1123]]]'>As the trial court noted, the 1967 Charter amendments left intact the following provision from the Local Charter: “[St. James] adopts the constitution, canons, doctrine and worship of the Episcopal Church and the Diocese.” <em>St. James, </em><a href="/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022053337" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="2003 WL 22053337">2003 WL 22053337</a>, at *2 (quoting “intrinsic provisions” of the Charter). I can understand how one could make the inference that, by declining in 1967 to repeal this provision from its Charter, St. James intended to recognize the 1941 Amendment as having created a trust with respect to its property for the benefit of the Diocese. Nevertheless, “[t]he intention to create a trust must be definite and particular.” <em>In re Evans’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/372/0284-02" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="372 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1237997,1238050" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0284-02,/pa/372/0284-01">372 Pa. 284</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20A.2d%20683" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="93 A.2d 683">93 A.2d 683</a>, 685 (1953). The act of St. James in amending its Charter in 1967 falls far short of constituting the clear and unequivocal evidence that we require to find that a trust has been created. In any event, in finding that a trust was thereby created, the Majority relies not upon any words of the 1967 amendments but, rather, upon the act of amending. Therefore, because only a writing can create trusts as to land, 33 P.S. § 2, the 1967 amendments could, at most, affect interests in the personal property of St. James.</p>

When viewed in the light of objective, well-established concepts of the law of trusts in Pennsylvania, neither the Local Charter, nor the National Canons, nor, least of all, the deeds to the property in dispute in this case provide any clear and unambiguous evidence of an <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>intent on the part of St. James to create a trust for the benefit of the Diocese.</p>

Initially, I note the similarly grassroots origins of Middlesex Church, which, as we mentioned in <em>Beaver-Butler, </em>“was not a creation or offshoot of the central denomination. Rather, the record established] that the Middlesex [C]hurch was created and incorporated on the local level by members of the parish; and that all property was retained in the corporate name of the local church.” <em>Beaver-Butler, </em><a href="/pa/507/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="489 A.2d 1317" data-case-ids="1792337,1792371" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0254-01,/pa/507/0255-01">489 A.2d at 1324</a>.</p>
