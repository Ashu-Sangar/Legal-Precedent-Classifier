In <em>Williams II, </em>we held that the sanctions constituted an increased penalty as a consequence of a party’s SVP status. That status under the Act, however, does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt as found by a jury. Instead, under Megan’s Law II, SVP status is determined by a judge upon a showing by the Commonwealth by clear and convincing evidence that the offender is, in fact, an SVP. Thus, the sanctions specifically targeting SVP offenders for enhanced punishment, insofar as they depended on that underlying finding by a diminished standard of proof, violated <em>Apprendi. </em>It is true <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>that we couched our ruling in that case in terms of “manifest excessiveness,” and that the sanction faced by the offender in that case far exceeded the sanction presented in this case insofar as, at a minimum, it entailed a sentence of lifetime probation.

In severing the offending provisions, we noted that statutes that do not contain a provision concerning severability are presumed severable. <em>Williams II, </em><a href="/a2d/832/0962-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="832 A.2d 962" data-case-ids="9088607" data-case-paths="/a2d/832/0962-01">832 A.2d at </a>986 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. § 1925). Severance is precluded only where, upon excision of the void provisions, the remaining statute can no longer be executed consistently with legislative intent. We found that the sanction provision constituted an "add-on" to the larger legislative scheme, and observed that enforcement would be possible even without the provision through civil contempt proceedings. Accordingly, we concluded that "it cannot reasonably be contended that the valid provisions of Megan's Law II are so dependent upon the penalty provisions that the General Assembly would not have enacted the former without the latter." <em><a href="/a2d/832/0962-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="832 A.2d 962" data-case-ids="9088607" data-case-paths="/a2d/832/0962-01">Id.</a></em>

The Commonwealth appears to treat this case as an opportunity not only to address the matter directly at <em>hand </em>— i.e., the constitutionality of the Act’s sanctions for non-SVP offenders who fail to comply with the Act’s requirements — but also to clarify our prior ruling with regard to its precise effect on the remedial scheme applicable to non-compliant SVP offenders. For the reasons stated in note 15, <em>infra, </em>we decline the Commonwealth's invitation.</p>

The Commonwealth notes that SVP offenders are subject to the lifetime registration, notification, and counseling requirements we found constitutional in <em>Williams II, </em>and argues, in effect, that SVP offenders, as <em>a fortiori </em>non-SVP offenders, are at least subject to the sanctions imposed upon non-SVP offenders for non-compliance — under the circumstances of this case, the third-degree felony sanction imposed by § 9795(d)(1). Appellee, however, correctly observes that SVP offenders are not among those specifically identified in subsection (d)(1), and thus contends that they necessarily are excluded from the subsection (d)(1) sanction. This presents an interesting question, but one clearly outside the ambit of the issue before us in the instant case. Furthermore, insofar as these provisions have since been repealed, there is no guarantee that the question will ever arise. In any event, we leave consideration of this question for an appropriate case.</p>
