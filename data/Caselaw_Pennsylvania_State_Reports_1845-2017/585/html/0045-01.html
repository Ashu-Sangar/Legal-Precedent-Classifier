    <p id="b189-6" data-blocks='[["BL_189.7",189,[182,783,1153,1164]]]'>Appellant’s general argument is simply that an interpretation of “previously litigated” that has the effect of precluding claims of ineffectiveness, which have not been raised previously, does not give adequate consideration to rights granted in the federal and state constitutions or to the nature of ineffectiveness claims. In support of his argument, Appellant contends that the statutory language is clear and merely prohibits a defendant from presenting an “identical” issue. Appellant then argues that this court’s interpretation of “previously litigated” as encompassing claims of counsel’s ineffectiveness ignores that the discrete issue of counsel’s ineffectiveness has not been litigated. Appellant points out that a defendant has a right to effective assistance of counsel at trial and on direct appeal under both the federal and Pennsylvania Constitutions. <em>Evitts v. Lucey, </em><a href="/us/469/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="469 U.S. 387" data-case-ids="11959535" data-case-paths="/us/469/0387-01">469 U.S. 387</a>, <a href="/us/469/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="469 U.S. 387" data-case-ids="11959535" data-case-paths="/us/469/0387-01">105 S.Ct. 830</a>, <a href="/us/469/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="469 U.S. 387" data-case-ids="11959535" data-case-paths="/us/469/0387-01">83 L.Ed.2d 821</a> (1985) (interpreting the U.S. Constitution amend. VI as including the right to effective assistance of direct appeal counsel); Pa. Const, art. 1, § 9 and art. V, § 9. Thus, Appellant concludes that this court’s interpretation of “previously litigated” to include claims attacking counsel’s effectiveness undermines the constitutional right to counsel by precluding a defendant from attacking counsel’s performance.</p>

Appellant also points out that the reason for the statutory provision — the concern with finality and the prevention of repetitive and vexatious filings — is of less moment today than it was 35 years ago, since this court has strictly interpreted the one-year time limitations of the PCRA, which by itself prevents repetitive and vexatious filings. For these reasons, Appellant offers that this court should interpret § 9544(a)(2) literally, as limiting only those filings which raise claims of trial court error or ineffectiveness that were actually presented to and decided on direct appeal.</p>
    <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[254,884,1166,1443]],["BL_191.1",191,[181,284,1153,191]]]'>The Commonwealth responds that the PCRA’s previous litigation provision does not infringe upon a defendant’s constitutional right to counsel. Rather, the provision simply precludes a previously rejected claim of trial court error from serving as the basis of an allegation of counsel’s ineffectiveness. Such a result is consonant -with the PCRA’s bedrock principles of finality. <em>See Commonwealth v. Peterkin, </em><a href="/pa/554/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="554 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="765982" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0547-01">554 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d 638</a>, 642 (1998); <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, the PCRA’s unambiguous provision should continue to be interpreted to foreclose repetitive claims that were litigated on direct appeal and to ensure finality in judgments. The Commonwealth asserts that the “previous litigation” bar is merely the codification of the “law of the case” doctrine, which provides that later phases of a litigated matter should not reopen issues decided by another judge of the same court or by a higher court involved in the earlier phases of the matter. Furthermore, in the interest of <em>stare decisis, </em>this court should uphold its numerous cases interpreting the PCRA’s previous litigation provision. The Commonwealth points out that this court has consistently interpreted the previous litigation doctrine to preclude reconsideration of a claim that serves as the basis for an allegation of ineffectiveness if the underlying issue was rejected on direct appeal.

There is nothing in this subsection defining “issue”. That term, as used in “pleading and practice,” is understood to mean “a single, certain, and material point, deduced by the allegations and pleadings of the parties, which is affirmed on the one side and denied on the other.” Black’s Law Dictionary, 6th ed. 831.

The theories or allegations in support of the ground are simply a subset of the issue presented. Stated another way, there can be many theories or allegations in support of a single issue, but ultimately, § 9544(a)(2) refers to the discrete legal ground raised and decided on direct review. Thus, at the most basic level, this section prevents the relitigation of the same legal ground under alternative theories or allegations. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Based upon our understanding of the term “issue” for purposes of § 9544(a)(2), the question before us today is simply whether a claim of ineffectiveness is a discrete legal ground or merely an alternative theory in support of the same underlying issue that was raised on direct appeal.</p>

Furthermore, in support of the remaining findings, the PCRA court relied on the fact that counsel failed to secure relevant school and mental health records, which would have demonstrated that Appellant was diagnosed with serious emotional problems from an early age and that such problems were compounded by a head injury he sustained in 1990. Dr. Tepper testified that had he been presented with the documents he now had in his possession, he would have advised trial counsel to obtain a neurological examination and neuropsychological testing. At the PCRA hearing, Appellant presented two other experts corroborating Dr. Tepper’s testimony. All three experts testified that given Appellant’s cognitive defects and his emotional problems, Appellant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2), and his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(3).

First, it must be recognized that each time an appellant raises a colorable claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present sufficienl mitigation evidence during the penalty phase, the case must be analyzed considering the unique facts presented. No two capital defendants will have the same life histories and no two counsel will proceed in the identical manner. Thus, what is considered reasonable in one case will not necessarily be considered reasonable in another. Second, we are not overruling <em>Fears, </em>but rather find it distinguishable from the case at bar. In <em>Fears, </em>the trial court discounted the appellant's expert testimony establishing that the appellant suffered from severe mental impairments and concluded that trial counsel’s performance in failing 1o present such evidence was reasonable. <a href="/pa/575/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="190" data-cite="836 A.2d 52" data-case-ids="630415,9295629" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0281-01,/a2d/836/0052-01">836 A.2d at 53, n. 23</a>.

Such performance indicates a lack of preparation on counsel's part, rather than a failure of family members to come forth with relevant information. In addition to the failure of counsel to uncover "social history” information and information regarding Appellant's head injury, we have the additional fact that counsel admittedly did not procure relevant school and mental health records.</blockquote>

Nevertheless, the Court also recognizes that layered ineffectiveness claims are not wholly distinct from the underlying claims but are, in fact, derivative from those claims. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gribble, </em><a href="/pa/580/0647-01" class="citation" data-index="194" data-cite="580 Pa. 647" data-case-ids="1100645" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0647-01">580 Pa. 647</a>, 675, <a href="/pa/580/0647-01" class="citation" data-index="195" data-cite="863 A.2d 455" data-case-ids="1100645,9167596" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0647-01,/a2d/863/0455-01">863 A.2d 455</a>, 471-72 (2004). Since proof of the underlying claim is an essential element of the derivative ineffectiveness claim, I believe that the previous litigation doctrine should apply where the underlying claim has been fully and fairly litigated and deemed meritless, and a petitioner seeks nothing more on post-conviction review than a different and more favorable resolution of precisely the same claim that was previously rejected on direct appeal, albeit via an ineffectiveness overlay.</p>

From my perspective, the primary difficulty that has arisen in the previous litigation context is that occasionally courts have not confined the doctrine’s application to situations in which an essential element of the ineffectiveness claim has been fully and fairly addressed. Rather, courts have sometimes extended it to situations in which petitioners have sought to demonstrate that the underlying claim was not fully and fairly litigated on account of some dereliction by counsel, <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>such as a failure to raise or preserve the asserted error, present essential facts, or pursue a relevant and controlling legal theory before the initial reviewing courts.</p>

I also believe that the Court should recognize a manifest error exception to the application of the doctrine, particularly in capital cases, such that if a petitioner is able to demonstrate clear and manifest error on the part of the court in the initial review, relief should not be foreclosed by virtue of that review. Such exception would be consistent with the prudential character of the previous litigation doctrine, <em>see supra </em>note 1, and in furtherance of the interests of justice; moreover, I do not believe that it would unduly burden reviewing courts, particularly as the one-year limitation on the filing of post-conviction petitions has effectively limited most petitioners to a single state collateral challenge. <em>See Commonwealth v.

With respect to the latter circumstance, it has too often been the case that this Court has been presented with a mere boilerplate assertion of counsel ineffectiveness attached to a new theory involving a record-based ruling which was already challenged and denied at trial or on direct review. Such undeveloped claims should always fail, and it may be a matter of semantics whether the failure is attributed to previous litigation or lack of (demonstrated) Sixth Amendment arguable merit. In addition, there are other instances where the manner of disposition on direct review (such as a finding that any alleged error was harmless) effectively operates to preclude relief upon any alternative theory advanced under the guise of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gribble, </em><a href="/pa/580/0647-01" class="citation" data-index="205" data-cite="580 Pa. 647" data-case-ids="1100645" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0647-01">580 Pa. 647</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0647-01" class="citation" data-index="206" data-cite="863 A.2d 455" data-case-ids="1100645,9167596" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0647-01,/a2d/863/0455-01">863 A.2d 455</a>, 462 (2004); <em>see also </em>Majority op. at 61-65, 888 A.2d at 574-75 (rejecting ineffectiveness claim respecting severance/due process “for the reasons discussed on direct appeal”). <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>There obviously is an element of issue preclusion at work in such an instance.

Temin (who was not the trial judge) that appellant’s trial counsel was ineffective in 1994 for failing to uncover and present a different and supplemental case in mitigation focusing on appellant’s supposedly abusive childhood, an alleged brain injury, and his cognitive dysfunctions. In granting a new penalty hearing, the PCRA court discussed none of the many cases from this Court which have considered similar issues, but instead, relied almost exclusively upon a select, non-binding Third Circuit panel decision, <em>Jermyn v.

    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[176,399,1156,940]]]'>Trial counsel, John T. Drost, Esquire, testified at the PCRA hearing. Counsel noted that, by the time of appellant’s trial, he had had considerable criminal trial experience, both as a prosecutor and as a defense attorney, experience which included over 100 murder cases defended and six prior capital trials. Counsel further noted that he was appointed to represent appellant in two other murder cases contemporaneously with the double murder at issue here; in one of those cases, counsel secured an acquittal and in the other the prosecution was dropped. Counsel then testified as to his penalty phase strategy and investigation into appellant’s background. Counsel’s overall strategy was to develop and present any mitigation evidence that he could muster. To that end, counsel retained Dr. Allan M. Tepper, who is both a licensed psychologist and an attorney, and a recognized expert witness in forensic psychology. Dr. Tepper, who also testified at the PCRA hearing, understood his task to be to evaluate appellant to determine if any mitigating circumstances existed.</p>
    <p id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.6",219,[175,1365,1155,519]]]'>In addition to retaining Dr. Tepper, counsel interviewed appellant, appellant’s mother, appellant’s fiancée, and other members of appellant’s family. These family meetings were fruitful, as they revealed information which was positive about appellant, <em>i.e., </em>that he had a loving relationship with family members and had performed numerous good works for family members and others in his community. Counsel presented this positive evidence at the penalty phase along with evidence from Dr. Tepper and, in point of fact, the jury found the “catchall” mitigator.</p>

Counsel also met numerous times with appellant, not only in connection with this case but in connection with appellant’s other pending cases as well, <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>and thus counsel had an opportunity to observe and form his own opinion concerning appellant’s mental functioning. Counsel noted that appellant was able to provide him with relevant information and consult with him in preparing the defense. Counsel noted that “only in hindsight” could he say so much as that appellant’s “affect was extremely flat” which might have been an indication of some brain injury. Counsel noted, however, that he “absolutely” was aware that a flat affect could result from other causes and that, over the course of the two years he represented appellant, the idea of connecting his affect to organic brain damage simply “did not occur to me.”</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[267,887,1158,1113]]]'>Counsel also noted that Dr. Tepper, who interviewed, examined and tested appellant, detected no evidence of organic brain damage or mental disease. Dr. Tepper’s testimony confirmed this fact; in addition, Dr. Tepper noted that he had detected nothing that would warrant neuropsychological testing of appellant. As the Majority concedes, the doctor’s failure to diagnose brain injury or impairment no doubt resulted at least in part from the fact that appellant had specifically denied suffering any head injuries. Indeed, it was Dr. Tepper’s practice to ask his subjects whether they had ever been stabbed, shot, run over, been in a car accident, or hit in the head. Appellant disclosed no such medical/physical injury to the doctor. Further, appellant never informed Dr. Tepper that he had been the victim of any physical abuse. Whatever brain damage or impairment appellant had, obviously it was mild enough so as not to be apparent to counsel or to a trained mental health professional who spent hours interviewing and evaluating appellant. Surely, counsel cannot be faulted for assuming that the experienced mental health expert he retained specifically for mitigation purposes would uncover any such mental health mitigation evidence.</p>

Although counsel could not specifically recall if he had asked appellant <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>and his family questions concerning appellant’s medical and “social” history and whether he had suffered any head injuries (counsel said that in all likelihood he did not specifically ask about prior head injuries or social history), counsel did note that if such information had been forthcoming by appellant or his family members he would have acted upon it and followed it up. In this regard, counsel noted that he certainly was aware at the time of trial that evidence of a prior significant head injury was an area that could be pursued in developing a defense case in mitigation.</p>

Similarly, the fact that counsel did not produce additional negative information concerning appellant’s childhood, background, and mental state does not mean that counsel failed to develop and present a case in mitigation. To the contrary, counsel presented a cogent mitigation case consisting of the testimony of appellant, members of appellant’s family, and Dr. Tepper, which served to personalize appellant and present him in a sympathetic light. Dr. Tepper thus told the sentencing jury that appellant’s father had left the family home when appellant was nine or ten years old and that appellant subsequently lacked a stable male role model or “father figure,” a circumstance which led him to develop behavioral problems in school. Continuing with this personalized social history, Dr. Tepper also informed the jury that appellant had slightly lower than average intelligence, that he had completed the tenth grade, and he opined that with some more effort and focus, appellant could succeed in academics or in his vocation. The doctor also noted that appellant had owned up to an “extensive drug and alcohol history or problem” that began with the very early use of marijuana and alcohol while in seventh grade, and then escalated into the frequent abuse of cocaine, cough syrup, and Valium. In addition to this expert psychological testimony, trial counsel presented testimony from several family members, including appellant’s fiancée, three aunts, and two cous<a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>ins. These witnesses stated that appellant was an intelligent, sweet, loving, caring, and good man, who acted as an older brother to his younger cousins, was helpful to his aunts and grandmother, and had three children of his own. Significantly, none of those witnesses described the injury or abuse which forms the basis for the Majority’s grant of a new penalty phase hearing.</p>

Fears later alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation, one which would have uncovered additional evidence relating to his mental health and what might be called “social background,” evidence which was similar in material respects to the undiscovered evidence at issue here. Thus, according to Fears, an adequate investigation would have revealed that he was prematurely born to a twelve-year old girl and suffered from cardiac arrest within an hour of birth, causing severe lack of oxygen to his brain; he was placed in foster care a few months later; and he suffered from a serious mental illness (including a diagnosis of “severe psychopathology including schizoid personality disorder and schizoaffective disorder”). <em>Fears, </em><a href="/pa/575/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="836 A.2d 52" data-case-ids="630415,9295629" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0281-01,/a2d/836/0052-01">836 A.2d at 72-73</a>.

Beard, </em><a href="/us/545/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="221" data-cite="545 U.S. 374" data-case-ids="8209271" data-case-paths="/us/545/0374-01">545 U.S. 374</a>, <a href="/us/545/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="222" data-cite="545 U.S. 374" data-case-ids="8209271" data-case-paths="/us/545/0374-01">125 S.Ct. 2456</a>, <a href="/us/545/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="223" data-cite="545 U.S. 374" data-case-ids="8209271" data-case-paths="/us/545/0374-01">162 L.Ed.2d 360</a> (2005). As Mr. Justice Nigro’s opinion on Rompilla’s PCRA appeal noted, the PCRA court in that case held a hearing on the question of ineffectiveness respecting undiscovered additional mitigation evidence, determined that the claim had arguable merit, but then found that counsel’s actions were reasonably based. This Court affirmed. <em>Commonwealth v.

The U.S. Supreme Court granted federal habeas corpus relief, by a narrow 5-4 margin, by simply rejecting the conclusions of the PCRA court respecting the reasonableness of counsel’s performance, while finding this Court’s application of <em>Strickland </em>in our reviewing capacity “objectively” unreasonable. Does the Majority mean to suggest that deference is due to the PCRA judge only when she rules in favor of the defendant concerning constitutional reasonableness?</p>

Of course, the law matures and evolves. But, the <em>Strickland </em>inquiry requires an assessment of trial counsel’s performance under the standards that existed when counsel tried the matter.

      <em>Fears </em>was <em>later, </em>in February 1995. The law would have had to <em>de-evolve </em>in order to fault counsel for failing to do what counsel in <em>Fears </em>also failed to do, while being deemed effective. As principled precedent, I fear, <em>Fears </em>simply is no more.</p>

The Majority concedes that this case is “a step removed from <em>Malloy,” </em>but nevertheless concludes that appellant, like Malloy, is entitled to relief. Majority op. at 75-76, 888 A.2d at 582. But this case is more like a quantum leap removed from <em>Malloy. Malloy </em>involved a near total failure to undertake any effort to prepare or present a case in mitigation; indeed, counsel did not do so much as sit down -with Malloy and discuss having family members testify on his behalf. Counsel conducted little investigation and presented no testimonial evidence at the penalty phase. Although counsel argued for two mitigating circumstances from the trial record, the jury found neither and it returned a sentence of death after finding the existence of a single aggravating circumstance. Counsel’s penalty phase performance in <em>Malloy </em>was so remarkably inadequate that, on appeal, the Commonwealth conceded that counsel was ineffective, arguing only an absence of prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b226-6" data-blocks='[["BL_226.6",226,[252,1796,1163,414]]]'>In contrast, counsel in this case did undertake an investigation and it was a reasonable one, as it included retaining a mental health professional, meeting with appellant and his family and presenting an actual case in mitigation, which resulted in the jury finding the existence of a mitigating circumstance. This case is more like <em>Brown, Hall, Fears </em>and such cases than it is like <em>Malloy, </em>a case occupying the outer limits of deficient performance.</p>

    <blockquote id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[222,554,1115,1119]]]'>Although we recognize that the unpursued evidence in this case is not the strongest, we further note that trial counsel’s presentation at the penalty phase included no affirmative evidence at all, but only a brief argument and a stipulation. Such a performance, which was not motivated by any strategic decision, left the jury with a dry assessment of appellant’s individual circumstances. In short, it is not just the failure to present evidence of appellant’s background which concerns us, but the fact that the failure occurred in a case where there was little effort to personalize appellant for the jury. Indeed, personalizing appellant’s background may have made one or more of the jurors more likely to accept the other mitigating circumstances which were pursued. We are satisfied that it is probable that at least one juror would have accepted at least one mitigating circumstance and found that it outweighed the Commonwealth’s single aggravating circumstance. Thus, had the jury heard testimony and been able to consider all of the mitigation evidence and argument together, there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance and voted not to impose the death penalty.</blockquote>

Moreover, I am unconvinced that there is a reasonable probability that the introduction of this somehow belatedly discovered evidence of appellant’s childhood abuse and his head injury would have swayed a jury into returning a life sentence for both murders. This is a case where appellant shot one victim five times over an argument about a woman, shot at another person because appellant suspected she stole his money, and <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>five days later shot and killed two other victims. The jury found appellant guilty of two counts of murder and returned a sentence of death on each count. One of the aggravators found, as to each death penalty, was the multiple murder aggravator. As this author recently noted in <em>Commonwealth v. Zook, </em><a href="/pa/585/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="233" data-cite="585 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="2471929" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0011-01">585 Pa. 11</a>, <a href="/pa/585/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="234" data-cite="887 A.2d 1218" data-case-ids="2471929,9005026" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0011-01,/a2d/887/1218-01">887 A.2d 1218</a>, 1236 (Pa.2005) (Castille, J., concurring), <a href="/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203160270" class="citation" data-index="235" data-cite="2005 WL 3160270">2005 WL 3160270</a>, *11: “I think that it is unrealistic in the extreme ever to discount the difficult uphill battle any capital defense lawyer faces where, as here, one of the aggravating circumstances involves the fact that his client elected to commit multiple first degree murders. This is a mark of distinction that seems different in kind from other statutory aggravators.” Even if I could fault counsel for failing to discover what appellant, appellant’s family, and the mental health expert failed to discover/disclose until appellant found himself on death row, I am unconvinced that evidence of childhood abuse and brain damage would have resulted in a different weighing and different penalty verdict in a case such as this. Therefore, I dissent.</p>
