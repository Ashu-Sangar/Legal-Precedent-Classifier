Barbara Gardner (“Gardner”) sustained a compensable work injury on October 2, 1996. As of October 2, 1998, she had received temporary total disability benefits for a total of 104 weeks. On June 13, 2001, Gardner’s employer, Genesis Health Ventures (“Genesis”), requested that she submit to an IRE. Gardner objected to this request, claiming that the request was impermissible under 77 P.S. § 511.2(1), as it was not made within sixty days of her receipt of 104 weeks of temporary total disability benefits. Genesis, subsequent to Gardner’s objection, filed a Petition for Physical Examination on August 10, 2001, requesting that a Workers’ Compensation Judge (“WCJ”) order Gardner to submit to an IRE. The WCJ, on November 2, 2001, denied the Petition based on Section 511.2(1),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which the WCJ found to require the insurer to request the IRE within the sixty-day period of Gardner’s receipt of 104 weeks of temporary total benefits, which had commenced October 2, 1998. Genesis appealed the WCJ’s decision to the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (“WCAB”). On August 1, 2002, the WCAB reversed, based on its conclusion that 511.2(1) was ambiguous and that <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20123.102" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="34 Pa.

Code § 123.102</a>(f) properly interpreted that provision not as a statute of limitations, but rather as a “window in which the insurer must act for the ‘adjustment of benefit status’ ‘to <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>relate back to the expiration of the employee receipt of 104 weeks of total disability benefits.’ ” <em>See </em>WCAB Op. at p. 3. Gardner, in turn, appealed the WCAB’s decision to the Commonwealth Court. In a published opinion, the Commonwealth Court <em>en banc </em>reversed the WCAB order, holding that the language of Section 511.2(1) is clear and free from ambiguity. As such, the Commonwealth Court held that an insurer must request that the claimant submit to a medical examination within sixty days of the claimant’s receipt of 104 weeks of total disability benefits or be forever precluded from modifying the claimant’s benefits based on the procedure set forth in 77 P.S. § 511.2. The Commonwealth Court specifically noted in <em>Gardner, </em>however, that an employer may, at any time, request that a claimant submit to a medical examination under 77 P.S. § 651 in order to modify a claimant’s benefits based on a change in medical condition and earning power. <em>Gardner, </em><a href="/a2d/814/0884-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="814 A.2d 884" data-case-ids="9345895" data-case-paths="/a2d/814/0884-01">814 A.2d at </a>887 n. 9.

(“Wal-Mart”) had employed Leroy Rider (“Rider”) as a truck driver since 1993. On July 31, 1998, Rider sustained a neck injury while in the course and scope of his employment. He underwent chiropractic therapy and treatment through his family physician. This course showed promise but was short-lived, as he was diagnosed with a ruptured cervical disc. Rider stopped working for Wal-Mart on October 21, 1998. He filed a Claim Petition on November 1, 1998, alleging total disability from October 21, 1998, and underwent corrective surgery on November 20, 1998. A WCJ, on December 16, 1999, found Rider’s injuries to be work-related and awarded temporary total disability benefits from October 21, 1998. Wal-Mart appealed this decision to the WCAB and also requested a supersedeas order. On January 12, 2000, the WCAB granted Wal-Mart’s supersedeas request <em>only </em>as to the payment of attorneys’ fees for unreasonable contest and as to Rider’s claim for disfiguring scarring. This order was unequivocal that “Supersedeas is denied in all other respects.” <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>(WCAB Order of January 12, 2000) The WCAB remanded the case to the WCJ and, on November 20, 2001, the WCJ again found for Rider, awarding him total disability benefits from October 21, 1998. Wal-Mart did not contest this decision.</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[193,538,1158,1641]]]'>On December 10, 2001, 163 weeks after the date when disability benefits began, but within sixty days of the final adjudication of Rider’s claim, Wal-Mart requested Rider submit to an IRE. On January 11, 2002, Wal-Mart informed Rider that his disability status, following the IRE,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> changed from total to partial. Rider responded with a petition to reinstate his total disability status, alleging that Wal-Mart’s IRE request was untimely under Section 511.2(1). The WCJ agreed with Rider, granting his reinstatement petition on June 28, 2002, on grounds that Wal-Mart’s IRE request did not comply with the statute, as it was requested beyond the sixty days following Rider’s receipt of 104 weeks of benefits. The 104-week period began, according to the WCJ, on the date of Rider’s injury, October 21,1998, and ended October 21, 2000. Wal-Mart thus had until December 20, 2000, to request that Rider submit to the IRE. Moreover, the WCJ concluded that the pertinent language of Section 511.2(1) is mandatory in requiring the insurer to request the IRE within sixty days upon expiration of the 104 weeks. Wal-Mart appealed that decision to the WCAB, which affirmed on May 12, 2003. A three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court reversed the WCAB in a published decision. The <em>Rider </em>court distinguished itself from <em>Gardner </em>on the grounds that, unlike <em>Gardner, </em>the employer disputed Rider’s entitlement to benefits. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em><a href="/a2d/837/0661-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="837 A.2d 661" data-case-ids="9300349" data-case-paths="/a2d/837/0661-01">837 A.2d at 664</a>. Because Wal-Mart litigated Rider’s claim, regardless of the amount of benefits Rider accrued, the <em>Rider </em>court held that he did not “receive” 104 weeks of total disability benefits until the WCJ rendered its decision on November 21, 2001. <em><a href="/a2d/837/0661-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="837 A.2d 661" data-case-ids="9300349" data-case-paths="/a2d/837/0661-01">Id.</a> </em>Rider sought allowance of appeal, which we granted.</p>

The term “received,” according to its common and approved usage, means acquisition or having come into possession.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Wal-Mart suggests a meaning for “received” that is not common and approved and on that basis, its position cannot stand. Thus, under the procedure for obtaining an automatic reduction in benefits in 77 P.S. § 511.2(2), the sixty-day window for an insurer to request an IRE under Section 511.2(1) begins once the employee has received, that is, acquired or comes into possession of 104 weeks of total disability benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> For these reasons, we must reverse the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Rider.</em>

Genesis, naturally, advocates that “shall” as it is used in Section 511.2(1) is permissive or directory. The foundation for Genesis’ conclusion rests almost exclusively on the premise that Section 511.2(1) is ambiguous, as Genesis contends that “shall” can be mandatory only when the statute is unambiguous. Genesis makes these assertions despite its explicit concession that Section 511.2(1), “appears to state a hard and fast rule requiring insurers to request an IRE only within a specific sixty-day period.” (Genesis’ brief at p. 12). Genesis argues, however, that ambiguity obscures the otherwise clear words of Section 511.2(1) when that statute is read in conjunction with other subsections of Section 511.2 and other portions of the Act. For example, Genesis cites 77 P.S. § 511.2(6) as an instance in which the time for requesting the IRE is not defined, as is the case in Section 511.2(1), but rather, open-ended. Genesis submits that, given the ambiguity as to when an insurer can request an IRE, there is no way that the General Assembly intended the insui*er to be required to request the claimant submit to an IRE under 77 P.S. § 511.2 within sixty days of the claimant’s receipt of 104 weeks of <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>benefits. Genesis further argues that the General Assembly did not impose any sanction for failure of an insurer to comply with the sixty-day requirement in Section 511.2(1) and that this omission conveys the General Assembly’s intent that “shall” is permissive or directory. Genesis also asserts that “shall” only is mandatory when the time and manner of something is of the essence, and that, with respect to Section 511.2(1), there is nothing suggestive of such urgency. Genesis urges us to defer to regulations promulgated by the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation which resolve what Genesis terms is the “inherent ambiguity” of Section 511.2(1). Finally, Genesis avers that resort to legislative history and public policy considerations is necessary to resolve the quandary presented by Section 511.2(l)’s ambiguity. In sum, Genesis’ view of the statute is that an insurer is entitled to make an IRE request beyond the time constraints set forth in Section 511.2(1), and still be entitled to the automatic relief under Section 511.2(2).</p>

Given that this court has found “shall” to be susceptible to diametrically opposed interpretations, we cannot conclude that the term “shall,” as it is used in Section 511.2(1), is so clear and free from all ambiguity that we can attach one or the other meaning without reservation. Fortunately, the General Assembly provided us with the necessary guidance to address <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>such a situation. When confronted with a statute whose terms are not explicit, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c) permits us to ascertain the General Assembly’s intent in drafting Section 511.2(1) by considering any one of a list of enumerated factors set forth in that statutory provision.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[247,563,1163,1764]],["BL_515.1",515,[194,285,1155,800]]]'>In our view, the General Assembly’s intent in drafting Section 511.2(1) becomes manifest in consideration of the consequences of a contrary interpretation. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(6). In this manner, we find it remarkable as a measure of the General Assembly’s care and consideration in drafting Section 511.2(1) that the legislature chose to utilize the term “shall” no less than three times. Still more significant is that, in each of these three instances, the term “shall” correlates to an obligation imposed upon one of the three parties pertinent to the IRE process: first, the statute declares that the employee <em>“shall </em>be required submit to the IRE”; second, “a medical examination ... <em>shall </em>be requested by the insurer” within a specified time; and third, “[t]he degree of impairment <em>shall </em>be determined ... by a physician” according to specific criteria. Thus, the General Assembly addresses and imposes affirmative obligations upon not just one, but all three parties possessing indispensable roles in the IRE process. The obligations so imposed cannot be viewed in any other way but mandatory, as the success of the IRE process as a cost-containment measure depends on such. To construe the obligations imposed by Section 511.2(1) as merely directory, as opposed to mandatory, threatens to render the obligations, and, by extension, the process, meaningless. <em>See Canvass, </em><a href="/pa/577/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="843 A.2d 1223" data-case-ids="91693,91700,91718,9281180,9281209,9281281" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0230-01,/pa/577/0230-02,/pa/577/0231-01,/a2d/843/1223-01,/a2d/843/1223-02,/a2d/843/1223-03">843 A.2d at 1232</a>. To adopt Genesis’ approach, that is, to say “shall,” as it relates to the insurer’s obligation to request the IRE in the dictated manner is directory or permissive, frustrates the obligations which the very same statute, indeed, the very same sentence, imposes upon the employee and the physician. Stated another way, if we were to hold that the timeline for the insurer to request an employee submit to an IRE for the purpose of obtaining the relief afforded by Section 511.2(2) was merely directory, it is not unforeseeable that a claimant who has been requested to <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>submit to an IRE might be justified in declining to attend on the grounds that his or her obligation was but a mere suggestion. That scenario is not improbable either, as the results of an IRE could affect how long a claimant may receive benefits. The result of such a construction is absurd and would frustrate the cost-containment objectives of Section 511.2. Therefore, we cannot accept that one party’s obligation is merely directory or permissive when the very same statute imposes corresponding obligations on others. In conclusion, the term “shall,” as it is used in Section 511.2(1), imposes mandatory, and not directory or permissive, obligations when an insurer is seeking to obtain the automatic relief set forth in Section 511.2(2), i.e., a reduction from total to partial disability benefits pending notice based upon the outcome of the impairment rating evaluation.</p>

Consequently, we are not required to defer to the Bureau’s interpretive rules and the arguments of Genesis and the Amici must fail. Rules 123.102(f), however, may be read to support our view that, under Section 511.2(6) an insurer may request an employee submit to an IRE beyond the sixty-day window; the consequences of such examination however, cannot operate to automatically reduce the claimant’s benefits.</p>

An insurer’s failure to request an employee submit to an IRE within the proscribed time frames of Subsection 1, however, does not preclude an insurer from requesting that an employee submit to an IRE at a later time.

If such a determination results in an impairment rating that is equal to or greater than fifty percent impairment, the employee will be presumed to be totally disabled and will continue to receive total disability compensation benefits.

The Dissent fails to reconcile its interpretation of Subsection 7, 77 P.S. § 511.2(7) with Subsection 5, 77 P.S. § 511.2(5). Under its interpretation, Subsection 7 sets a strict and artificial limitation on the receipt of total disability benefits, whereas the clear and unambiguous terms of Subsection 5 mandate that total disability benefits shall continue until it is adjudicated or agreed that total disability has ceased or the claimant's impairment rating is less than fifty percent. The Dissent’s view of Subsection 7 injects the mere passage of time as one of the triggers for the cessation of total disability benefits. Moreover, a crucial premise of the Dissent relies upon a factual determination, namely, the employers’ "implicit agreement” to extend benefits in these matters, with no record citation to support such a finding. A finding of an agreement between an employer and claimant to extend benefits arguably would alter an employer’s status, as an employer who has not made such an agreement would not have the benefit, under the Dissent’s view, of the self-executing process for reducing benefits. To conclude, as the Dissent does, that the absence of an explicit agreement is tantamount to an implicit agreement could provide license to an employer to miss the deadlines of Subsection 1 and later claim an implicit agreement to extend benefits beyond 104 weeks which would allow the employer the benefit of the self-executing process for reducing benefits. Third, the Dissent fails to explain adequately how an agreement to extend benefits under its view of Subsection 7 translates into an agreement to extend the deadlines set forth in Subsection 1.</p>

Once the favorable opinion was obtained from the physician, the employer then had the burden of producing evidence of a referral to at least one open job in an occupation that the employee was medically cleared to perform. This became the standard and “[t]he resulting return-to-work scenarios devolved into fact-based challenges as to whether a claimant had received medical clearance; whether a claimant had, in good faith, followed up on the employer’s referrals; and whether the employer met the technical requirements of a proper referral, such as age, education, training, experience, distance, medical restrictions, etc.” <em>Caso v.

A claimant may submit to an IRE voluntarily before the expiration of one hundred four weeks, but must submit to an IRE request made within sixty days of the one hundred four-week expiration. Where an employer fails to seek an IRE within the allotted timeframe, the employer has implicitly agreed that claimant’s degree of impairment exceeds 50% and the claimant can continue to receive total disability benefits.

      <blockquote id="b522-8" data-blocks='[["BL_522.9",522,[315,2214,1096,114]],["BL_523.2",523,[259,1866,1086,113]]]'>When an employe has received total disability compensation ... for a period of one hundred four weeks (2 years), unless otherwise agreed to, the employe shall be required to submit to a medical examination <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>which shall be requested by the insurer within sixty days upon the expiration of the one hundred four weeks to determine the degree of impairment due to the compensable injury, if any.</blockquote>

The “unless otherwise agreed to” language, where the only limitation on the timing of any agreement is that it must occur before the expiration of one hundred four weeks, means that the parties can agree to have the IRE performed prior to or after the expiration of the one hundred four-week period and the employer still receives the benefit of the automatic modification provision. Claimants also benefit by an agreement in that they may continue to receive total disability benefits after the expiration of one hundred four weeks. 77 P.S. § 511.2(7).</p>
