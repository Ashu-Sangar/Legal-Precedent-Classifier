In connection -with airport operations, the Authority owns and maintains various parcels of real property having a variety of uses, including, <em>inter alia, </em>aircraft hangars, public aircraft parking aprons, air cargo processing centers, United States Customs facilities, United States Postal Service facilities, air courier facilities, helicopter training areas, airplane maintenance areas, areas for the storage of runway snow removal equipment, facilities for package sorting <a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>and ground operations, areas for the storage of construction materials, areas for the training of firefighters, and a storm water detention basin.</p>

Appellees indicated that, because all of the members of the Authority’s governing board are appointed by Lehigh County or Northampton County, the same result should obtain here as in <em>Penn State. </em>It further argued that, although authorities <a id="p664" href="#p664" data-label="664" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*664</a>created pursuant to the Act are considered Commonwealth entities for some purposes, the Authority should nonetheless not be deemed a Commonwealth entity for purposes of property tax immunity.</p>

Exempt status was denied, however, for hangar and apron space used by private entities that did not serve the citizens of the Lehigh Valley, as well as certain vacant land and land used for the storage of various construction materials. In making these determinations, the court examined such things as the individual uses of office and hangar space by each tenant, as well as whether the aircraft housed in the hangars were utilized specifically to provide air service to the residents of Lehigh Valley.

At the time of the appeal, 296 acres were not essential either to the waste disposal area or as part of the minimum required buffer zone around the disposal site. Nevertheless, this Court determined that all 544 acres were immune because the authority had acted within its authorized governmental purposes in acquiring all of the property. As to the excess land that was not essential to the operation of the landfill, the Court observed that such property provided extra buffer space between the landfill and other adjacent properties, and additionally, was unusable for any other purpose under the relevant zoning ordinance. The Court noted that the scope of immunity is not “limited to the absolute minimum of property necessary to operate” the facility, and suggested that a different result would obtain if the authority had leased the excess land to unrelated organizations or otherwise had acquired or used it for some purpose not related to the operation of the facility. <em>See Delaware County, </em><a href="/pa/534/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="534 Pa. 81" data-case-ids="1839631" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0081-01">534 Pa. at 88-89</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="626 A.2d 528" data-case-ids="1839631,1839701" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0081-01,/pa/534/0080-01">626 A.2d at 532</a>.</p>

      <a id="p674" href="#p674" data-label="674" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*674</a>Ten years later, this Court was called upon to review a scope-of-immunity dispute when SEPTA purchased a 20-story office building in Philadelphia, used a portion of the property as its headquarters, and leased other areas of the building to governmental, non-profit, and commercial entities. Philadelphia’s taxing authority imposed taxes solely upon the portion of the property used by commercial tenants, an action that was upheld by the Commonwealth Court. On appeal to this Court, SEPTA argued that the entire building should be deemed tax-immune as the statute under which SEPTA was created expressly authorized it to enter into such leases as a means of raising revenue and reducing expenses, thereby benefiting the public as a whole. <em>See </em>74 Pa.C.S. § 1741(a)(24). Resolving this issue, the Court reiterated the distinction between tax exemption and tax immunity, and relied upon <em>Delaware County </em>as setting forth the applicable test for determining the scope of SEPTA’s immunity relative to the office building: namely, although immunity is not limited to the absolute minimum of property necessary for it to carry out SEPTA’s operations, nevertheless such immunity does not extend beyond that portion of the building acquired and used in furtherance of SEPTA’s authorized governmental purposes. Although SEPTA was statutorily authorized to act as a commercial landlord, these actions were not sufficiently related to the agency’s governmental purpose of operating a metropolitan transportation system. Accordingly, the Court affirmed the Commonwealth Court’s determination that the portion of the office building leased to commercial tenants fell outside of SEPTA’s tax immunity. <em>See SEPTA, </em><a href="/pa/574/0707-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="574 Pa. 707" data-case-ids="587949" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0707-01">574 Pa. at 720</a>, <a href="/pa/574/0707-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="833 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="587949,9084239" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0707-01,/a2d/833/0710-01">833 A.2d at 717</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

First, as discussed above, <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>unlike in the tax-exemption arena, property owned by a Commonwealth governmental agency is presumed immune, and the taxing body bears the burden of proving any limitation of the scope of the agency’s immunity relative to an individual parcel of property that it wishes to tax. This is particularly important here, as the trial court decided the immunity question against the Authority as a matter of law, and proceeded to trial only on the exemption issue, assigning the burden of proof to the Authority and construing any potential exemption strictly against the Authority. Indeed, as noted, exemption was ultimately denied in some instances because the Authority failed to forward sufficient evidence to carry its burden, and not upon any affirmative proof that the property was being used for a non-public purpose.</p>

Because exemptions are statutory in nature, the relevant statute supplies the governing standard. Presently, as noted, the trial court focused upon the “public purpose” test embodied in the General County Assessment Law (see text accompanying supra note 4). On the other hand, under <em>Delaware County </em>and <em>SEPTA, </em>immunity is assumed unless the agency acts outside of its authorized governmental purposes. This aligns with Section 5620, which affirms that authorities need not pay taxes on property acquired or used for “authorized purposes” relating to the “performfance of] essential governmental functions.” 53 Pa.C.S. § 5620; <em>see supra </em>note 6. Here, in applying the public purpose test for exemption purposes, the trial court relied upon Judge Young’s definition from the 1989 litigation, and constrained the concept of public use to those instances where the use directly benefited residents of Lehigh Valley. The court, for example, found that hangar space used by airlines transporting individuals between destinations outside of the valley was non-public and, thus, non-exempt. Regardless of the validity of such a narrow construct for purposes of exemption, under the immunity standard such a use is clearly within the Authority’s author<a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>ized governmental purpose to operate an airport, <em>see supra </em>note 1, and is, moreover, qualitatively different from SEPTA’s leasing of office space to commercial tenants solely to raise revenue and reduce costs.</p>
    <p id="b812-4" data-blocks='[["BL_812.5",812,[270,565,1158,799]]]'>As noted, the trial court decided the immunity question as a matter of law without taking any evidence, and then proceeded to trial on the question of tax exemption; during such proceedings, the Authority bore the burden of proof, the standard applied was public use, and the parties structured their presentations and arguments accordingly. Therefore, we find that the appropriate action at this juncture is to remand the matter to the common pleas court for application of the correct legal standard as delineated above. Any parcel — or part thereof — which is ultimately adjudged to be outside of the scope of the Authority’s tax immunity will then be subject to local real estate taxes for the tax years in question only if it was deemed non-exempt in the bifurcated trial which has already occurred, for, as noted, the Authority has elected not to challenge those determinations in the present appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
