He explained that in July 1995, he suffered a heart attack and underwent a triple bypass. Shortly after the surgery, he returned to work and he did not miss any additional work days until May of 1996, when he was out for two days due to chest pains. Over six months later, in January of 1997, Claimant missed another two days because of chest pains. According to Claimant, other than the above four absences, he had a good attendance record.</p>

He was upset about having to attend the meeting because he felt that he had a good attendance record. Later that afternoon, Claimant and his union steward met with Egan and Egan told them that Claimant had incurred four “occurrences,” meaning that he had missed four days of work when he was scheduled to be at work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Egan informed Claimant that if he incurred another “occurrence,” he would be placed on level one, which was a type of disciplinary status.</p>

At that point, Claimant felt chest pains. Egan suggested that Claimant take a walk and come back once he had calmed down, but Claimant refused. Egan then offered Claimant a Family Leave Plan, pursuant to which Claimant could incur “occurrences” due to his heart problems without disciplinary repercussions.

Claimant stated that he later informed this same administrator that he needed to take off thirty days due to his heart attack, and at that time, she again told him that his attack was not covered by workers’ compensation. In July or August 1997, one of Claimant’s co-workers gave him a book about workers’ compensation. After reading the section on heart attacks, Claimant realized that his heart attack may have been related to his meeting with Egan and thereby covered by workers’ compensation. Therefore, in August 1997, Claimant went to see Egan to file a work injury report.</p>

The WCJ then found that the notification period for Claimant’s heart attack did not begin to run until July 1997 because “[Claimant] clearly and unequivocally testified that he was not aware of such a possible connection until he read the workers’ compensation handbook in July of 1997.” <em>Id. </em>Moreover, given that start date, the WCJ concluded that Claimant properly notified U.S. Airways of his injury in August 1997.</p>

The WCJ then awarded Claimant counsel fees, finding that U.S. Airways did not have a reasonable basis for contesting Claimant’s petition as it had not produced any evidence to rebut Claimant’s assertions that his heart attack was related to the attendance meeting.</p>

According to Claimant, the <em>Davis </em>court only held that a claimant must satisfy the abnormal working conditions test where the claimant suffered from a <em>“psychic </em>” injury with related physical symptoms. Moreover, Claimant asserts that the Commonwealth Court’s application of the abnormal working conditions test to cases where a claimant suffers a purely physical injury is an unfair expansion of the Workers’ Compensation Act, 77 P.S. §§ 1-1041.1 (the “Act”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> as it defeats the humanitarian purposes of the Act.

There are four categories of injuries: (1) physical stimulus causing physical injury (physical/physical); (2) psychological stimulus causing physical injury (mental/physical); (3) physical stimulus causing psychic injury (physical/mental); and (4) psychological stimulus causing psychic injury (mental/mental).

Although the Majority attempts to define the instant matter solely in terms of the physical injury, the mental element, which supplies the causation that is required by the Act, should not be swept aside as insignificant. It makes no sense to evaluate psychic insult on different planes depending on whether the resulting injury is mental or physical. I remain convinced that all psychic insults should be evaluated in the same manner. I cannot agree with the position of the Majority that, in “mental/physical” cases, the claimant must only show distinct identifiable physical injuries and present unequivocal medical testimony that connects the physical disability to the workplace in order to receive benefits. The flaw in this reasoning is that it circumvents the causative link between the physical injury and employment that the Act requires. Pursuant to this theory, any employee who gets sick at work will be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits. For example, an employee who gets a migraine headache because a work deadline is approaching can claim a work-related injury. One who has a stroke at his or her work desk can claim a work-related injury. Finally, one who has a heart attack after a routine, nondisciplinary meeting at work can claim a work-related injury.</p>

The only question before the WCJ was whether Claimant’s heart attack was work related. Within that context, there is no evidence that Claimant experienced a period of employment with stress either greater than that experienced by his peers or the general public, or greater than that <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>experienced within his normal employment. In fact, the evidence established that he was subjected to the same routine, non-disciplinary meeting as at least five other people that day. Claimant’s subjective reaction began more than an hour before the meeting actually took place when his supervisor informed him that he was required to meet with the attendance control manager. As the testimony of his supervisor demonstrated, Claimant “turned red all over, his entire body just clenched, [and] he was like a coiled spring.” (R.R. at 291a.) This meeting was both routine and non-disciplinary and cannot justifiably be seen as a psychic insult of such magnitude as to cause Claimant’s heart attack. We have previously observed that “the work environment is a microcosm of society. It is not a shelter from rude behavior, obscene language, incivility, or stress.” <em>Phila. Newspapers, </em><a href="/pa/544/0202-02" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="675 A.2d 1213" data-case-ids="463564,463592,7875378,7875467" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0202-02,/pa/544/0203-01,/a2d/675/1213-01,/a2d/675/1213-02">675 A.2d at 1219</a>. Hence, if there were any outside stimulus that can be said to have caused Claimant’s injury, it was his subjective reaction to a routine event, if anything, which caused his injury. Accordingly, I believe that the WCJ properly concluded that Claimant suffered a “subjective reaction to normal working conditions” and therefore, the decision of the WCJ should be reinstated. In this case, Claimant did not suffer a work-related heart attack; he suffered a heart attack at work.</p>
