The dispositive question is whether prejudice should be presumed in the evaluation of a defense attorney’s stewardship in undertaking a strategy of conceding his client’s guilt of voluntary manslaughter in order to gain credibility in the eyes of the fact-finder and avoid a conviction of a higher degree of criminal homicide.</p>

On the evening of August 9, 1998, Appellant Khatib Cousin approached Pedro Torres on Jasper Street in Philadelphia to inquire as to an incident the prior night and the whereabouts of George Dascenzo. Torres directed Appellant to the home of Dascenzo’s uncle, Charles Ertell. Some time after Appellant entered the home, he and Dascenzo left the house together, while Ertell followed. A verbal argument ensued and turned physical when Dascenzo swung at Appellant, but failed to hit him. Appellant struck back and Dascenzo fell to the ground. Appellant then repeatedly punched and kicked Dascenzo in the head, neck, and chest as he lay on the ground. Ertell and Torres intervened and pushed Appellant away. Appellant then walked away from the fight scene to the steps of a nearby house and retrieved a handgun from inside of a folded baseball cap. Loading the gun, he walked back to the scene <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>and fired several shots in the direction of Dascenzo, Ertell, and Torres, killing Dascenzo and wounding Ertell. Appellant then waved the gun at the crowd on the street and stated, “Who wants it?,” before leaving the area a few moments later. The police eventually found Appellant hiding under the porch of a nearby house, with the weapon a short distance away.</p>

After privately retaining Attorney Louis T. Savino, Jr., to represent him, Appellant pleaded not guilty to all charges and waived his right to a jury trial. Thereafter, he was tried before the Honorable Renee C. Hughes in Philadelphia common pleas court. During the May 1999 bench trial, Appellant did not testify in his defense; instead, he offered character witnesses, and the prosecution stipulated that those individuals would testify that Appellant had a reputation in the community as a peaceful and law-abiding citizen. During his closing argument, Attorney Savino conceded Petitioner’s guilt as to criminal homicide, but argued that he was not guilty of murder. He stated, “Your Honor, if it please the Court, I won’t stand here and tell you that [Appellant] after this trial should be acquitted of all charges. I don’t suggest that that’s an appropriate verdict given the circumstances of this case.” N.T. May 27, 1999, at 105. Thereafter, counsel highlighted the evidence tending to show that the homicide occurred in the heat of the emotions stemming from the physical confrontation, and argued that malice was absent. Counsel closed his argument by stating, “I suggest that this is a case of voluntary manslaughter for the reasons that I have enunciated and it fits so clearly within that scope that I submit that that’s an appropriate verdict.” <em>Id. </em>at 146.</p>

The PCRA court ultimately concluded that counsel’s concession of guilt in his closing statement was qualitatively different from an open guilty plea or a concession at the beginning of trial, because counsel’s closing argument did not entail a waiver of Appellant’s procedural safeguards which remained in effect throughout the trial. On that basis, the PCRA court held that Appellant’s underlying issue lacked arguable merit and, accordingly, that he was not entitled to relief on his ineffectiveness claim.</p>

Initially, the court expressed its discomfort with applying a prejudice requirement in this situation because it perceived counsel’s actions to be “inconsistent with the mainstays of our criminal justice system,” primarily, the defendant’s presumption of innocence and the Commonwealth’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As an intermediate appellate court, however, the Superior Court deemed itself without authority to “alter established rules of procedure adopted by the Pennsylvania Su<a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>preme Court” by instituting a <em>per se </em>ineffectiveness standard in this context. Superior Court Op. at 5-6. The court ultimately affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief on the basis that Appellant failed to demonstrate that counsel’s actions resulted in actual prejudice. The court observed, in this regard, that it was undisputed that Appellant retrieved the gun, walked back to the scene of the fight, and intentionally shot the unarmed victims. Further, Appellant never proffered a self-defense argument at trial or challenged the sufficiency of the evidence for voluntary manslaughter or aggravated assault. <em>See id. </em>at 8-9.</p>

In order to have the benefit of a full and complete record, in a <em>per curiam </em>order dated December 22, 2004, this Court also remanded the matter to the PCRA court for a limited hearing on whether counsel acted without Appellant’s consent in conceding guilt on the charge of voluntary manslaughter. The PCRA court, again per Judge Hughes, held the required hearing on January 18, 2005. Trial counsel (Attorney Savino) testified at the hearing and admitted that he never specifically discussed his closing argument with Appellant, <em>see </em>N.T. Jan. 18, 2005, at 20, 23, although he maintained that he and Appellant both understood that there was no basis for a self-defense claim and, after hearing the Commonwealth’s evidence at trial, that there was no possibility of acquittal. <em>See id. </em>at 32, 37. Appellant, for his part, testified that he had wanted to “beat this case on self defense.” <em>Id. </em>at 65. However, he conceded that he never discussed that possibility with Attorney Savino; moreover, he was unable to identify any harm that might have befallen him had he not fired at the unarmed victims. <em>See id. </em>at 48, 59-72.</p>

And Lou Savino did a masterful job of chipping away at the Commonwealth’s evidence to bring this down to manslaughter. So I don’t see that there are further questions necessary to elucidate me on the credibility of [Appellant] continuing to say that he did not understand what he confronted at this proceeding. He understood fully that he faced death and he walked out of there with his life. He just doesn’t like the sentence and that’s the bottom line.</blockquote>

On one hand, admitting guilt almost always results in a guilty verdict to at least some charge; at the same time, however, it may be difficult to conceive of how anything but a guilty verdict could result from the evidence presented, and counsel’s strategy may appear to have been the best way to avoid a worst-case scenario under the circumstances.</p>

We disagree, as <em>Lantzy </em>involved the absence of any action by counsel at a critical stage (the filing of a direct appeal as of right), whereas here counsel was undoubtedly present and advocating on behalf of his client; it is the nature of that advocacy that is at issue, namely, whether it amounted to a compete failure to subject the prosecution's case to adversarial testing.

There is no Rule 802 notice of aggravating circumstances, <em>see </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 802, but the district attorney's charging document reflects two aggravating circumstances delineated by the capital sentencing statute, and the jury waiver sheet shows Appellant’s acknowledgment that he was charged with first-degree murder carrying a maximum sentence of "life/death."

Appellant argues in the alternative that, even if Attorney Savino’s performance does not constitute a structural defect under federal law, this Court should expand the <em>Cronic </em>doctrine for purposes of Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution (see <em>supra </em>note 5), to include the present case. Appellant suggests that this Court may expand on federal guarantees pursuant to <em>Commonwealth v. Edmunds, </em><a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="172" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">526 Pa. 374</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="173" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d 887</a> (1991), and notes specifically that the state charter, like the federal one, safeguards to criminal defendants the right to due process, the right to remain silent, and the privilege against self-incrimination, all of which, he maintains, are implicated here. Appellant's presentation to this Court is not adequately developed. He acknowledges his burden under <em>Edmunds </em>to analyze the text and history of the state provision, as well as case law from other states and policy considerations of state and local concern within modern Pennsylvania jurisprudence, <em>see Edmunds, </em><a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="174" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">526 Pa. at 390</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="175" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d at 895</a>, but fails to provide analysis along these lines other than to state that the Pennsylvania Constitution was adopted prior to the federal Constitution, and that some of its language was derived from the Magna Charta. As this is an insufficient basis to analyze whether the <em>Cronic </em>exception should be applied more expansively under the state charter than the federal one, the issue must be deemed waived in this Court. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/557/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="176" data-cite="557 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="56907" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0207-01">557 Pa. 207</a>, 223, <a href="/a2d/732/1167-01" class="citation" data-index="177" data-cite="732 A.2d 1167" data-case-ids="11553069,56907" data-case-paths="/a2d/732/1167-01,/pa/557/0207-01">732 A.2d 1167</a>, 1175 (1999).</p>
