A divided panel of the Commonwealth Court held that Section 10 — 1089(c) had no application at all because it governs only written employment agreements and appellant in the case <em>sub judice </em>did not have such a written agreement. This Court disagrees with that broad holding and, for the reasons set forth below, we vacate the order below and remand the matter to the Commonwealth Court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[254,776,1162,838]]]'>The parties stipulated to the following facts: On September 15, 1987, appellant became the business manager of the Susquenita School District in Perry County (“School District” or “District”), a position that the parties agreed falls within the Code’s definition of “business administrator.” On March 16, 1988, the District’s Board of School Directors (“Board” or “appellee”) formally notified appellant by letter that he had been elected to a three-year term of employment, commencing the prior September 15, and running to September 15, 1990. Appellant was advised to sign and return an attachment to the letter, but neither party was able to locate such a document and appellant could not recall if he had signed it. At the end of the original three-year term of employment, the Board took no further action to define the term of appellant’s position, or the conditions of renewal, but appellant continued to serve as the District’s business manager.</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[252,1638,1162,519]]]'>Some seven years later, on June 10, 1997, the Board passed a resolution stating that appellant’s term of employment would expire on June 30, 1997, and that the Board would not extend or renew appellant’s term of employment beyond that date. The resolution directed the School Superintendent to notify appellant of the decision and also announced that the Board would seek a new business manager. On June 11, 1997, Susquenita School Superintendent Mark T. Dietz sent a Memo to appellant advising him of the Board’s determination “that your term of employment will expire as of June 30, 1997.”</p>

The Board refused to provide a hearing or a bill of particulars. In the meantime, on or about June 20, 1997, appellant applied to the Public School Employees Retirement System for a lump sum retirement payment. Thereafter, in May of 1998, the School District formally abolished the position of business manager; from July 1, 1997 until September of 2000, the duties of the business manager were performed by an outside consultant.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[189,742,1156,419]]]'>On July 9, 1997, appellant filed a petition for review of the School Board’s job termination action in the Court of Common Pleas. Following a hearing on September 18, 2000, the trial court filed an order and memorandum opinion in which it concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant had a property interest in his job as business manager in light of Section 10-1089 of the Code. Section 10-1089, which is entitled simply, “Business Administrator,” provides as follows:</p>

    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.7",312,[263,790,1157,469]]]'>24 P.S. § 10-1089. The trial court determined from the stipulated facts that appellant was a business administrator as defined in the statute, and that even though there was no written employment agreement in effect at the time of his termination, the due process protections governing “removal” which are set forth in Section 10-1089(c) were applicable. Accordingly, the trial court ordered that the Board, “schedule a hearing ... and make a determination as to whether or not the business manager should be dismissed for cause.”</p>
    <p id="AI" data-blocks='[["BL_312.8",312,[262,1280,1159,1059]],["BL_313.1",313,[192,281,1153,463]]]'>Thereafter, the parties filed a joint request for reconsideration, asking that the court issue a final order, and suggesting four issues to be addressed in that final order: (1) whether appellant had a term of employment which expired on June 30, 1997; (2) whether appellant had a property interest in continued employment under Section 10-1089; (3) whether appellant’s retirement barred his claim; and (4) whether the Board’s subsequent determination on May 8, 1998 to abolish the business manager position barred any remedy to appellant for periods after that date. On December 11, 2001, the trial court issued a final order in which it concluded that: appellant’s term of employment did not expire on June 30, 1997; appellant had a property interest in continued employment by virtue of Section 10-1089; and appellant’s retirement did not bar his claim because he had only applied for retirement because of the sudden termination of his job, and he needed the money. With respect to the fourth question, the trial court found that appellant’s property interest in the business manager position ended when the District formally abolished it on May 4, 1998. Addressing the possible scope of damages, <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>the trial court noted that appellant was theoretically entitled to back pay from June 30, 1997 to either September 15, 1997 or September 15, 1999, depending upon whether his continuing appointment was deemed to extend for a one-year or a three-year term. Rather than resolve this employment duration issue, the court determined that a “fair resolution” was to deem appellant’s entitlement to benefits to have expired as of May 4, 1998, when the business manager position was formally abolished.</p>
    <p id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[193,774,1151,357]]]'>The parties cross-appealed. Appellant challenged the trial court’s conclusion that any remedy was limited to the period from June 30, 1997 through May 4, 1998, and the Board challenged whether, under Section 10~1089(c), appellant had a cognizable property interest in continued employment at all after June 30, 1997 and whether, in any event, his retirement barred his claim.</p>
    <p id="b313-5" data-blocks='[["BL_313.6",313,[192,1161,1153,1172]],["BL_314.1",314,[255,290,1162,626]]]'>On appeal, a divided panel of the Commonwealth Court reversed in an unpublished decision. The panel majority framed the controlling issue as whether, under the statute, a school district business administrator who does not have a written employment agreement has a property right in continued employment. The majority rejected appellant’s argument that the statute mandates that a business administrator without an employment contract may only be removed from the position for the specific causes stated in Section 10-1089(c). To the contrary, the majority found that the statute grants school boards the option of entering into employment agreements with business administrators, thereby creating a property right via written contract, but that no such property right exists in circumstances where the business administrator and the school board have not entered into a written employment agreement. Section 10 — 1089(c), the majority reasoned, only addresses the process required when a school board seeks to remove from office a business administrator who has a written employment agreement; but, if there is no written employment agreement, the administrator is an employee at-will who is subject to dismissal at any time and for any reason. The majority further reasoned that the General Assembly’s failure <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>expressly to include business administrators without written employment agreements in Section 10-1089(c) indicates that it did not intend to establish an expectation of continued employment for such school employees. Because there was no evidence that the Board here chose to enter into a formal, written employment agreement with appellant beyond the first three years he was actually employed, the panel majority held that appellant was an at-will employee subject to summary dismissal. In light of its conclusion in this regard, the majority did not address the Board’s alternate argument respecting the effect of appellant’s retirement, nor did it address appellant’s scope-of-remedy claim on his cross-appeal.</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[253,940,1160,460]]]'>Judge Friedman dissented, opining that the plain language of Section 10-1089(c) compels a contrary conclusion. Because the General Assembly used the indefinite article “a” before the term “business administrator” in the statute, rather than employing a limiting descriptive phrase such as “a business administrator with a written employment agreement,” the dissent concluded that the legislative intent was to afford every school business administrator the protections against removal set forth in Section 10-1089(c).</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.6",314,[252,1427,1160,245]]]'>The dissent further analogized Section 10-1089(c) to Section 5-514 of the Public School Code, which sets forth removal protections identical to those in Section 10-1089(c) for the benefit of “officers, employes and appointees” of school districts:</p>

Thus, appellant, who did not have a current, written employment agreement with the Board, claims he was entitled to the default protections afforded by Section 10-1089(c), and his employment could be terminated only for the causes specified in that subsection. Appellant argues that because the Board unilaterally declared that his term of employment had expired, never afforded him a hearing, and never proffered any of the specific statutory grounds as supportive reasons for appellant’s removal, then that removal was in violation of the statute. Appellant argues that the Commonwealth Court ignored the plain language of the stat<a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>ute to pursue what it believed to be the spirit of the enactment, and thereby erred.</p>

Appellant views the 1989 enactment of Section 10-1089 as a legislative response to the Commonwealth Court’s 1981 decision in <em>Bedeski </em>designed to afford all school business administrators the same basic protections afforded to other employees under Section 5-514 of the Public School Code. As support for this construction, appellant notes that Sections 10-1089(d) (prohibiting school business administrators from serving as members of the school board) and (e) (permitting school business administrators to serve as secretary or treasurer of the school board), like (c), are not expressly limited to business administrators with written employment agreements, yet these provisions logically should apply to all business administrators, not just those with written employment agreements. Appellant contends that subsection (c) should also be deemed to apply to all school business administrators, irrespective of whether they are subject to a written employment agreement.</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[191,1539,1154,791]],["BL_318.1",318,[255,283,1156,95]]]'>Appellant also notes that it is illogical, if not absurd, to conclude that the General Assembly intended only to address school business administrators who had written employment agreements because those are the employment relationships least in need of legislative oversight or qualification. This is so because a written employment agreement would likely set forth the terms and conditions of employment and the manner in which the contractual employment could be terminated. Thus, in such instances, there would be less need for the default removal protections provided by Section 10-1089(c) since the contract would control. Conversely, employment relationships where no written contract exists with the business administrator are more likely and logically in need of legislative attention. For all of these reasons, appellant requests that this Court reverse and remand to the Common<a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>wealth Court to address the scope of damages issue he raised, and which the panel did not address given its disposition.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[251,403,1165,1646]]]'>In response, the Board does not directly dispute appellant’s argument that Section 10-1089(c) applies to the removal of all business administrators, irrespective of whether they operate pursuant to a written contract. Instead, the Board urges that Section 10-1089(c) is of no avail to appellant because that provision governs the “removal” of business administrators and the Board did not “remove” appellant, it simply did not rehire him for another term of employment. Thus, the Board views the issue in this case not as a question of the “applicability” of the statutory removal provision, but as a question of whether appellant can be said to have been granted, via the statute, “a property interest in continued employment” such that the Board was obliged to “renew” his work arrangement. The Board notes that, as this Court held in <em>Pipkin v. Pennsylvania State Police, </em><a href="/pa/548/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="548 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="960556" data-case-paths="/pa/548/0001-01">548 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/a2d/693/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="693 A.2d 190" data-case-ids="11984665,960556" data-case-paths="/a2d/693/0190-01,/pa/548/0001-01">693 A.2d 190</a> (1997), a government employee only has a property right in his employment where he can establish a legitimate expectation of continued employment conferred either by agreement or by statute. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Board argues, appellant is attempting to convert the mere procedural mechanism set forth in Section 10-1089(c) for removing a business administrator from office into a grant of an expectation of continuing future employment. The statute, according to the Board, simply does not warrant such an interpretation. Where the General Assembly intends to create such tenure in an employee, the Board submits, it has explicitly done so. In this case, however, the General Assembly has not expressly created a property interest in future employment for school business administrators. Therefore, in the Board’s view, such administrators are public officers whose continued employment depends entirely upon the will of the hiring party.</p>

The Association echoes appellant’s argument that both the plain language of Section 10-1089(c), and the perceived statutory purpose — to protect business administrators <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>from summary dismissal because such employees, as part of their job function, often make difficult and unpopular economic decisions — make clear that it is designed to apply to all school business administrators, and not just those with written employment contracts. These protections are especially necessary because, according to the Association, forty-seven (47%) percent of the school business administrators who responded to a 2001 Association survey were not protected by a written employment agreement. By the Association’s calculation, under the Commonwealth Court’s decision in this case, more than 200 school business administrators in Pennsylvania have now become subject to summary dismissal. Further, the Association asserts that the entire public school community, including school boards, superintendents and school district advisors, have historically viewed Section 10-1089(c) as applying to all school business administrators, including those working without written employment agreements.</p>

The statute does not purport to confer any extra-contractual right to continued employment or tenure beyond what the parties may have agreed to— in writing, orally, or as a matter of history and experience. Thus, Section 10-1089(c) does not provide a school business administrator with employment for life absent misconduct falling into one of the enumerated statutory circumstances.

Those without contracts need not be addressed by Section 1089 because they are covered by Article VI, Section 7. The class of business administrators with contracts falls into two subsets — those whose contracts have termination provisions and those who do not have termination provisions.

Within that context, Section 1089(c) can only govern those business administrators who have employment agreements with their respective school districts. Were we to broaden that section, as the Majority does, to include all business administrators, we are in conflict with Article VI, Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and previous holdings of this Court. Thus, where the agreement contains termination provisions, those provisions govern. Where the agreement does not contain termination provisions, then Section 1089(c) governs.

      <em>Board of School Directors of Susquenita School District v. Knox, </em>Nos. 70 and 83 CD 2002, unpublished memorandum at 6-7, <a href="/citations/?q=809%20A.2d%201096" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="809 A.2d 1096">809 A.2d 1096</a> (Pa.Cmwlth. filed Oct. 7, 2002).</p>
    <p id="b331-5" data-blocks='[["BL_331.6",331,[192,769,1156,710]]]'>Indeed, the Code section at issue speaks to the ability of a Board to employ, set duties, enter and renew written employment contracts, and to remove business administrators. It does not confer rights on the person the Board hires. It gives the Board the right to remove “at any time” rather than at the end of a specific term of employment, but if such “any time” removal is sought, the procedure and reasons are limited to those set forth. This does not say that only these most fundamental reasons — incompetence, intemperance, neglect of duty, violation of the law — will permit removal. It does not give the non-contract employee “job removal protections” or any “right” to continue employment no matter the desire of the Board to make a change.</p>
    <p id="b331-6" data-blocks='[["BL_331.7",331,[188,1523,1156,262]]]'>This section, dealing with the authority of the Board, does not give appellant any rights or expectations, nor in my judgment does it change his status as an at-will employee. Hence, my respectful dissent from the result reached by my colleagues.</p>
