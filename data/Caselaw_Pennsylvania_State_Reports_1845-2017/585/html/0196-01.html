The Gaming Act was passed in July 2004. The Act amends the regulation of gaming in the Commonwealth and, <em>inter alia, </em>specifically authorizes and regulates the licensed operation of slot machines. This legislation also created the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (“Board”) to regulate slots gaming. The Board is authorized to, among other matters, oversee the issuance of three categories of licenses for slot machine gaming. Upon issuance of a license, the license recipient is permitted to locate and operate slot machines at its licensed facility. The Gaming Act permits up to seven Category 1 licenses to qualified horse race track facilities, up to five Category 2 licenses to stand-alone slot machine <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>locations, and up to two Category 8 licenses to hotel-resort slot machine facilities. 4 Pa.C.S. §§ 1302-1307. Relevant for purposes of this matter, the holders of Category 1 and Category 2 licenses must pay the Commonwealth a one-time fee of fifty million dollars. Category 3 license holders must pay a one-time fee of five million dollars. The procedure by which the Gaming Act was enacted was challenged by numerous groups and legislators; after review, our Court in June 2005 concluded that the challengers failed to establish that the Act was passed in a manner that offended our Constitution. <em>Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion Fund, Inc. et al. v.

First, regarding whether their interest is substantial, we cannot discern how Petitioners have suggested, let alone established, any peculiar, individualized interest in the outcome of finding Section 1209 to be unconstitutional that is greater than that of any other citizen. Therefore, we find that Petitioners’ interest is not substantial. <em>In re Hickson, </em><a href="/pa/573/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="821 A.2d 1238" data-case-ids="197205,9141182" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0127-01,/a2d/821/1238-01">821 A.2d at 1248</a>. Moreover, Petitioners fails to allege that Section 1209 harms them, or will harm them, personally in any way; thus, Petitioners cannot establish a direct interest in the matter. <em><a href="/pa/573/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="821 A.2d 1238" data-case-ids="197205,9141182" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0127-01,/a2d/821/1238-01">Id.</a> </em>Indeed, rather than disadvantaging Petitioners, it would appear that the legislation at issue would only benefit them if they succeed in obtaining a gaming license in that they would receive their fee in return for any future change in legislation regarding the Gaming Board. Finally, as Petitioners do not offer that Section 1209 has harmed them or will harm them in any way that is not remote or speculative, they fail to demonstrate that they have an immediate interest. <em>City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/575/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="838 A.2d 566" data-case-ids="630377,630455,9298628,9298712" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0541-01,/pa/575/0542-01,/a2d/838/0566-01,/a2d/838/0566-02">838 A.2d at 577</a>. Indeed, not only do Petitioners themselves strongly suggest that Section 1209 would only work to their benefit in terms of a refund if the Board was changed, but also at this juncture they have not been issued a gaming license and there have been no allegations that legislators have been “handcuffed” by the prospect of returning gaming fees. Thus, any possible harm to Petitioners is wholly contingent on future events. As such, they have no immediate interest in this constitutional challenge. As Petitioners have no direct, substantial, or immediate interest in challenging the constitutionality of the Gaming Act, we find that they lack standing to bring this challenge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

These legislators, it would appear, are not benefited by and would be inclined to raise a constitutional challenge to Section 1209.

Thus, as parties that do not stand to benefit from Section 1209, who have the potential interest in challenging Section 1209, and who appear to be better situated to assert a challenge exist, we find that Petitioners have failed to fall within the <em>Biester </em>exception and do not have standing in this constitutional challenge as taxpayers.</p>

I recognize that <em>Petition of Kariher </em>also contains some more restrictive language, <em>see, </em>e.g., <em>Petition of Kariher, </em><a href="/pa/284/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="284 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1092095" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0455-01">284 Pa. at 472</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20265" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="131 A. 265">131 A. at 271</a> (indicating that "in a declaratory judgment proceeding the court will not decide future rights in anticipation of an event which may not happen”), but even this language was subject to qualification by the Court. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20265" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="131 A. 265">id.</a> </em>(clarifying that the restriction based on the assertion of future rights applies "unless special circumstances appear which warrant an immediate decision, as, for instance, where present rights depend on the declaration sought by plaintiff[.]”). Moreover, I acknowledge that subsequent decisions appear to have tightened the standing requirements in the declaratory judgment context since <em>Petition of Kariher; </em>my point here is that the courts have not looked back to reconcile the more restrictive approach with the recognized policies underlying the Declaratory Judgment Act.</p>

The present situation may qualify as one in which legislators’ voting power has been diluted, and thus, at least arguably may reside within the contemplation of existing case law touching on legislator standing. <em>Cf. Zemprelli v. Daniels, </em><a href="/pa/496/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="496 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1772969" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0247-01">496 Pa. 247</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="496 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1772969" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0247-01">436 A.2d 1165</a>, (1981) (discussing the standing of legislators in a <em>quo warranto </em>setting in terms of dilution of voting interests). The present case seems to me to be sufficiently unique, however, that I would withhold the conclusion as to whether future legislators would enjoy special standing to challenge a prior enactment curtailing their options on future legislative action, at least until after a fuller assessment of Petitioners' direct standing.</p>
