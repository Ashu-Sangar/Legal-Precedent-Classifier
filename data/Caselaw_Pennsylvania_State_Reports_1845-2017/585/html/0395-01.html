In January 1999, the prosecutor mentioned in opening statements that she would present evidence that the case involved drug-turf wars.

Following closing arguments, the court issued <em>sua sponte </em>a curative instruction and, after dismissing the jury, asked if defense counsel considered the instruction adequate.

R.A.P.1925(b) statement. In violation of Pa.R.A.P.1925(b)’s requirement that an appellant file his statement within fourteen days after entry of the trial court’s directive order, Castillo waited until on or about November 1, 2002<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> to file what was then an untimely statement.</p>

Castillo then filed a brief in Superior Court, raising for the first time issues of trial court error and counsel ineffectiveness in addition to the previously raised issue of prosecutorial misconduct. The Superior Court, in an unpublished memorandum decision, refused to consider the issues not specifically raised in the Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement, but did address the prosecutorial misconduct issue raised in the untimely Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement.

    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.6",535,[192,901,1155,738]]]'>The Commonwealth urges this Court to reverse the Superi- or Court and reaffirm the rule set forth in <em>Lord </em>and <em>Butler. </em>The Commonwealth asserts that the bright-line rule of <em>Lord, </em>which we reestablished in <em>Butler </em>just three years ago, provides for certainty of result and consistency of consequences for failure to comply with Pa.R.A.P.1925(b). In contrast, the Commonwealth maintains that prior to our decision in <em>Lord </em>litigants could not predict when Pa.R.A.P.1925(b)’s waiver provision for non-compliance would apply. The Commonwealth asserts that appellate courts applied the waiver provision inconsistently with, for example, some courts waiving issues only in those cases where meaningful appellate review of the issues was impossible, while other courts overlooked non-compliance based on the equities of the issue.</p>

R.A.P.1925(b) statements. The Commonwealth observes that following this continued exercise of discretion, this Court reasserted the bright-line rule in <em>Butler </em>by stating that “waiver under Rule 1925(b) is automatic.” <em>Butler, </em><a href="/pa/571/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="812 A.2d 631" data-case-ids="1070147,11367450" data-case-paths="/pa/571/0441-01,/a2d/812/0631-01">812 A.2d at 633</a>.</p>

      <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>In arguing in favor of the continued vitality of the bright-line rule, the Commonwealth observes that the <em>Lord/Butler </em>rule effectuates the purpose of Pa.R.A.P.1925(b), which is to aid appellate review by providing a trial court the opportunity to focus its opinion upon only those issues that the appellant plans to raise on appeal, and guarantees predictable consequences for failure to comply with the rule. Additionally, the Commonwealth offers that the simplicity of Pa.R.A.P.1925(b)’s requirements imposes only a minor burden on the appellant, who also may proactively seek from the trial court an extension of time to file or the ability to amend a statement if needed. The Commonwealth thereby requests that this Court reverse the Superior Court and conclude that Castillo waived the prosecutorial misconduct issue by failing to raise it in a timely filed Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement.</p>
    <p id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[264,1111,1160,1069]]]'>The Defenders Association of Philadelphia filed an amicus brief in this case and in <em>Commonwealth v. Schofield, </em>which was joined by Castillo, who did not file his own responsive brief. The Defenders Association argues that the harsh sanction of waiver should be reserved only for situations where non-compliance with Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) completely prevents appellate review. It asserts that waiver would be inappropriate where the trial court addressed the issue raised in the non-compliant statement either in its opinion or elsewhere in the record. Moreover, the Association suggests that cases could exist where waiver would not be appropriate even where the trial court’s reasons are not apparent anywhere in the record. Even in those situations where waiver might be appropriate, the Association recommends that the appellate courts remand or otherwise request that the trial court address the issue, possibly by requiring appellants to file supplemental Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statements. The Association claims that this more lenient procedure would not impose the harsh penalties of waiver on the client, when the fault is due to counsel’s failings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

      <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>The Defenders Association, however, fails to provide a solution for the problems caused by inconsistent application of discretion which plagued the system prior to <em>Lord </em>and <em>Butler. </em>Even in arguing for relaxation of the rule, the Association demonstrates the potential for inconsistent results in its exposition of the permutations of non-compliance, where it suggests the certain kinds of non-compliance might justify waiver and others should not, depending on a fact-specific determination of the sufficiency of the record. In so doing, the Association reinforces the need for a bright-line rule to provide litigants and courts with clarity and certainty. The bench and bar under the <em>Lord/Butler </em>rule are not left to ponder whether the record sufficiently allows the appellate court to glean the trial court’s rationale, either from a filed Pa.R.A.P.1925(a) opinion or elsewhere in the record. Moreover, Courts are not forced to ascertain whether an explication of the trial court’s rationale is unnecessary for appellate review. To hold otherwise is to turn back the clock to a time of inconsistent results and uneven justice.</p>

Allowing for discretion regarding timeliness will result in inconsistencies. For example, when faced with the lack of a timely Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement, one trial court might file quickly and efficiently an opinion waiving all issues, while another might address the issues it believes the appellant will raise, and still another might delay filing an opinion until a statement is received. If the appellant in each hypothetical case eventually files an equally untimely statement, the appellate court in the first case would waive the issues that the trial court waived, while in the second two scenarios, under current Superior Court precedent, the appellate court could address the issues so long as the trial court addressed the same issues in its opinion. As <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>a result, the same factual situation could produce diametrically opposed results depending on how quickly a trial court files its opinion after the expiration of the Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) filing period. As referenced above, we decline to adopt a position which will yield unsupportable distinctions between similarly situated litigants.</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[251,634,1164,743]]]'>Thus, the <em>Lord/Butler </em>rule remains necessary to insure trial judges in each appealed case the opportunity to opine upon the issues which the appellant intends to raise, and thus provide appellate courts with records amendable to meaningful appellate review. <em>See Lord, </em><a href="/a2d/719/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="719 A.2d 306" data-case-ids="11673876,11673960,356262,356264" data-case-paths="/a2d/719/0306-01,/a2d/719/0306-02,/pa/553/0415-01,/pa/553/0414-01">719 A.2d at 308</a>.

As counsel’s actions in <em>Halley </em>resulted in the denial of the criminal defendant’s right to a direct appeal, we held that the appropriate remedy was to reinstate the defendant’s right to pursue a direct appeal. Moreover, the severity of the sanction is less burdensome due to the minimal requirements for compliance under Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) and the trial courts’ demonstrated willingness to grant extensions to <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>proactive appellants prior to the expiration of the filing period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

In this regard, I agree with <em>amicus </em>that, relative to counseled appeals, the policy allowing for discretionary review (coupled with curative remands, where appropriate, to secure a sufficient Rule 1925(a) opinion) better serves the ends of justice than the mechanical elimination or curtailment of direct appellate review on account of attorney derelictions. Indeed, I believe that reflexive displacement of appeals, in whole or in part, based on factors outside the litigants’ direct control is in substantial tension with the right to direct appellate review conferred by the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>See </em>Pa. Const. art. V, § 9. Concerning <em>pro se </em>litigants, particularly as applied in cases such as <em>Schofield </em>in which there has been meaningful and substantial compliance and the policy ends of Rule 1925 have been satisfied, <em>see supra </em>note 1, the strict waiver policy also seems to me to be unnecessary and an unduly harsh sanction.</p>
