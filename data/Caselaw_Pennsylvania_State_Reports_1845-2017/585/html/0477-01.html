Kiesewetter Jr. should be disbarred from the practice of law in this Commonwealth as a result of a 1994 federal civil jury verdict entered against him for fraud. For the reasons set forth herein, we hold that the Disciplinary Board (hereinafter “Board”) properly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel under the circumstances of this case and agree that disbarment is warranted.</p>
    <p id="b617-9" data-blocks='[["BL_617.10",617,[187,1415,1155,900]]]'>On December 21, 1999, Office of Disciplinary Counsel (hereinafter “ODC”) filed a petition for discipline, alleging that Respondent engaged in fraud by misappropriating substantial family assets. The allegations relied upon the civil verdict entered against Respondent in the matter of <em>Constance K. Elliott, et al. v. William B. Kiesewetter, Jr., </em>Civil Action No. 93-0753 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The civil litigation stemmed from a dispute between Respondent and his sisters, Patricia J. Kiesewetter and Constance K. Elliott, over the ownership of family assets with a principal value exceeding $2.4 million. The civil trial was bifurcated with liability and punitive damages determined by jury verdict and compensatory damages determined thereafter by the court. On December 5, 1994, the jury returned a verdict against Respondent, finding him liable for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and fraud.</p>
    <p id="b618-3" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[258,280,1160,842]]]'>
      <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>The jury’s answers to the specific interrogatories established that Respondent’s parents placed the disputed assets into the names of their three children, intending to make an immediate irrevocable gift of those assets to their children. The jury found that Respondent violated his fiduciary duty to his sisters and that he acted fraudulently toward them with respect to the disputed assets. It further found that large amounts of the family’s assets were transferred into accounts created pursuant to the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (hereinafter “UGMA”), 20 Pa.C.S. § 5301 <em>et seq., </em>in the names of Constance K. Elliott’s three sons. Finally, the jury found that Respondent was his nephews’ fiduciary with respect to the UGMA accounts and that he breached his custodial duty to his nephews thereby unjustly enriching himself. On April 4,1997, the federal court ruled that Respondent’s total liability was $3,626,322, which included $500,000 in punitive damages.</p>
    <p id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.5",618,[255,1147,1162,677]]]'>During a pre-hearing conference in this disciplinary matter, ODC raised the issue of collateral estoppel, arguing that Respondent should be precluded from denying the facts as found in the civil fraud trial. Alternatively, it argued that the transcript of the civil trial should be accepted into evidence. Hearing Committee 4.01 ruled that collateral estoppel did not apply, but permitted ODC to introduce the record of the federal civil trial in the disciplinary proceeding. The parties were further permitted to supplement the record if desired. The matter was subsequently reassigned to Hearing Committee 4.03 because Committee 4.01 was unable to determine whether there was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

Respondent presented two character witnesses who testified that he is an honest and sincere person with a good reputation in the community for truth and integrity. Respondent also testified on his own behalf and asserted that his mother voluntarily transferred a portion of assets to him, that he was never in charge of the finances of his sisters and nephews, that he never had a general power of attorney, and <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>that he never invested their funds. Respondent has not worked for income since February of 1995, when a freeze order was entered against his assets in connection with the civil judgment. As of the date of the disciplinary hearing, Respondent had not paid any portion of the judgment. He has no prior disciplinary history.</p>

Moreover, the Committee determined that the jury determined that Respondent had a fiduciary duty to his sisters and a custodial duty to his nephews and violated those duties by acting fraudulently with respect to the assets. It found that Respondent’s testimony to the contrary was not credible. Accordingly, Hearing Committee 4.03 recommended that Respondent be disbarred.</p>
    <p id="b619-5" data-blocks='[["BL_619.6",619,[194,1641,1154,689]]]'>Respondent thereafter filed a brief on exceptions and requested oral argument. Oral argument subsequently was held before a three-member panel of the Board. By order dated July 29, 2004, the Board ruled that the doctrine of collateral estoppel from a civil verdict did <em>not </em>apply in a disciplinary proceeding and remanded the matter to Hearing Committee 4.03 for an expedited hearing on the charges. ODC thereafter filed in our Court a petition for review of the Board’s order. On November 4, 2004, our Court entered an order vacating the Board’s July 29, 2004 order and remanding the matter to the Board for it to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel as set forth in <em>Duffield, </em>to address any outstanding issues in the matter, and to recommend an appropriate sanction.</p>

It found that Respondent fully litigated the facts of the civil matter upon which the disciplinary action was based, had a full opportunity to examine witnesses and present evidence, and had been found to have engaged in fraud by the same standard of proof applicable to a disciplinary proceeding. The Board further concluded that the misappropriation of $2.4 million constitutes dishonest and egregious misconduct that warrants disbarment. Respondent thereafter filed in our Court a request to present oral argument pursuant to Pa.R.D.E. 208(e)(2), which we granted.</p>

Respondent contends that the significant differences in the consequences of the two proceedings and the disparity of safeguards inherent in each action suggest that collateral estoppel should not apply. In support of this contention, he notes that our disciplinary rules currently only apply collateral estoppel principles to cases involving criminal convictions, <em>see </em>Pa.R.D.E. 214(e) (providing that a certificate of conviction of an attorney for a serious crime shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that crime in any disciplinary proceeding instituted against the attorney based upon the conviction) and reciprocal discipline matters, <em>see </em>Pa.R.D.E. 216(d) (providing that a final adjudication in another jurisdiction that an attorney has been guilty of misconduct shall establish conclusively the misconduct for purposes of a disciplinary proceeding in this Commonwealth).</p>

ODC could not have joined the civil fraud action commenced against Respondent. Further, Respondent had fair notice that his fraudulent conduct was prohibited by the Rules of Professional Conduct and therefore the subsequent disciplinary action was foreseeable. Considering that the plaintiffs in the civil action were seeking millions of dollars in damages, Respondent had every incentive to present a vigorous defense. The civil judgment was also not inconsistent with any previous judgments in favor of Respondent. To the contrary, application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel ensures consistency of judgments by prohibiting Respondent from denying facts that were found by an impartial tribunal. Finally, Respondent was afforded all the safeguards inherent in a civil action and would be entitled to no greater protections in a disciplinary proceeding. Significantly, and as discussed in more detail <em>infra, </em>585 Pa. at 488-91, 889 A.2d at 53-54, the burden of <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>proof utilized in the civil proceeding to determine that Respondent engaged in fraud satisfied the burden of proof employed in a disciplinary proceeding.
