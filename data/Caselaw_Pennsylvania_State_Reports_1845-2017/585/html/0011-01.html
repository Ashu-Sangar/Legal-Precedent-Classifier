This Court granted that motion and directed that the PCRA court hold a competency hearing. Such a hearing ultimately was held on February 2 and 3, 2004.

Additionally, Appellant claims that his' counsel is involved in a number of illegal activities and is part of a conspiracy to defraud his family of large sums of money which initially started in 1979. Appellant testified that in 1979, there was a drug raid in counsel’s law office involving members of the Pagan motorcycle gang and Appellant’s mother. He claims that during this raid, a radio transmitter, similar to the one he claims is implanted in his head, was removed from his mother’s abdomen “with a knife.” Appellant is disturbed that his counsel will not litigate this issue of the radio transmitter. He believes that some type of technology would enable the prosecution and/or the defense to explore the actual crime scene via the radio transmitter and that, therefore, the issue <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>of the radio transmitter must be explored in the pending PCRA proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">7</a> Appellant insists that he is not mentally ill and that he is innocent of the murders.

Dr. Sadoff s opinion on this point is supported by MMPI testing which indicates that he is not faking illness, whereas Dr. Rotenberg believes Appellant cannot be malingering because he has maintained the delusions for such a long period of time.

The court explicitly <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>disagreed with counsels’ claim that Appellant’s delusional beliefs interfere with his ability to trust and work with his counsel. In support of that conclusion, the court noted that Appellant has not terminated his relationship with counsel despite his attempts to advance his theory regarding the transmitters; he was extremely polite and respectful to counsel during the hearing and demonstrated no hostility or animosity towards either of his counsel; and that if Appellant honestly believed that his attorneys were working to have him executed, or that they had defrauded his family in the past, he would not treat them so congenially.

We did not, however, explicitly state the applicable standard, discussing instead the issue of whether a defendant’s incompetence is a bar to effective collateral review when a next friend has been appointed to act on behalf of the defendant due to his or her incompetence. We intimated in <em>Haag, </em>however, that the appropriate standard would be whether the defendant is able to understand the nature of the proceedings and able to communicate with and assist his counsel in the pursuit of collateral relief.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">10</a> As noted above, <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>this is the precise standard applied by the PCRA court in the instant matter.

Respecting the guilt phase, Appellant contends that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to impeach the testimony of James Walck who testified at trial concerning an alleged confession that Appellant made to him shortly after the murders while the two men were incarcerated in Lancaster County Prison. Significant to the instant claim of ineffectiveness, Walck testi<a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>fied that Appellant told him that he sodomized the victim, Sandra Wiker and that, after he sodomized her, he asked Sandy Nace to kill her.

He testified that swabs taken from the victim tested negative for sperm and that neither her anus nor vagina showed signs of forcible injury. He also testified, however, that it is possible to have a sexual assault without any semen being present or without any damage to the anus. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony from Dr. Penades that, while it is possible for a sexual assault to occur without physical evidence, he had no evidence to suggest that such, indeed, occurred in the instant case and, again, that his examination revealed no signs of traumatic injury.</p>

At the PCRA hearing, counsel for Appellant presented the testimony of John Smialek, Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Maryland. Dr. Smialek testified that he reviewed the testimony of Dr. Penades and the autopsy reports prepared by him as well as the testimony of Walck. He testified that the findings and testimony of Dr. Penades are not consistent with an anal sexual battery. Appellant also points to the PCRA testimony of Marcellus Barnett, a friend of Appellant, who testified that Appellant was not the type of person that would confide in others as Walck had claimed he did. Appellant also asserts that counsel should have called FBI Agent Harold Deadman, who had testified in Appellant’s 1986 trial that there was no hair or fiber evidence whatsoever linking Appellant to the apartment where the murders occurred.</p>

Indeed, the defense thoroughly cross-examined Walck regarding his veracity. For example, Walck admitted on cross-examination that prior to providing police with information implicating Appellant, he had given police information concerning Sandy Nace’s involvement in these murders. He also admitted to having given information to a local police department in the past regarding another person, all in exchange for favorable treatment regarding charges pending against him. Counsel also elicited from Walck testimony that he had been charged with and/or convicted of numerous robberies, thefts and burglaries, beginning as early as 1976 when he was just a juvenile, up to and including 1985. In response to questioning of defense counsel as to why he did not obtain a medical examiner to testify to this lack of evidence in an effort to impeach Walck’s testimony, Attorney Cullen stated that he saw no need because there was no physical evidence to support a sexual battery. He also noted that had they put on a defense expert to testify, similar to Dr. Penades, that there was no evidence of a sexual battery, the prosecution could easily have elicited testimony from such expert that it is possible for a sexual assault to occur without any physical evidence to that effect. In other words, the prosecution could have spun the testimony on this point, just as the defense had done regarding the testimony of Dr. Penades. Attorney Cullen explained further that he determined it was better to attack the testimony of Walck as entirely incredible given his known propensities to offer information to authorities in exchange for leniency in his own criminal matters than to attempt to discredit him on the issue of the lack of physical evidence to support an anal rape because such attempt could, as just noted, easily fail and such failure may then lend credence, in the minds of the jurors, to the remainder of Walck’s testimony. Respecting the failure to call the FBI agent that had testified at Appellant’s first trial, to again testify that there was no physical evidence found at the scene of the crime linking Appellant to the murders, Attorney Cullen stated that he would not call an agent of the FBI to testify because they generally work for the prosecution and, in his opinion, tend to equivocate when testifying to this <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>type of evidence and that, in any event, he did not need to call him since he was able to present evidence from other sources that there were no fingerprints, hair, or fibers found connecting Appellant to the apartment where the murders occurred.</p>

With respect to each particular claim raised here, counsel offered reasonable explanation for his actions that were credited by the PCRA court. Moreover, even assuming we were to find counsel’s actions unreasonable, Appellant’s claims would still fail on either the merit prong or the prejudice prong. First, counsel did thoroughly impeach the credibility of Walck at trial, albeit, with evidence other than additional medical testimony. Second, while Appellant alleges that FBI Agent Deadman should have been recalled, he fails to assert that Agent Deadman was available to testify at the 1990 trial and, in any event, fails to establish the requisite prejudice insofar as this precise evidence was presented at trial via other testimony. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Finally, the PCRA testimony of Dr. Smialek essentially was the same information testified to by Dr. Penades at trial.

At the time of his arrest, Appellant had in his possession two rings that were allegedly stolen from Paul Conrad’s house on the night of the murders. Appellant contends that the rings were a critical piece of evidence linking him to the scene of the crime and, thus, that the significance of the rings should have been of paramount importance to counsel. Appellant maintains that with minimal investigation, counsel could have learned, and presented evidence to the effect, that the rings had come into his possession prior to the murders. At the PCRA hearing, Appellant presented the testimony of Crystal VanSickle who testified that Timi Butterbaugh, a girlfriend of the victim Paul Conrad, was a drug addict who oftentimes stole items, including jewelry, from stores as well as from Mr. Conrad, which she would then pawn to support her drug habit. Ms. VanSickle also testified that Allen Ault, a friend of Appellant, was seen in possession of one of these rings the evening of the murders. Significantly, the PCRA court found this testimony to be incredible and credited the testimony of trial counsel who testified that they fully explored the issue of the rings with Appellant prior to trial and that he could not give them a reasonable explanation as to how he came to possess them. Affording the court’s credibility determinations proper deference, we reject Appellant’s claim of ineffectiveness as being wholly without merit. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In support of this claim, Appellant asserts that prior to trial, counsel had obtained various medical and/or psychological records that documented the brain injury suffered by Appellant in 1982 and also had obtained records from the Department of Corrections that documented the profound effect that particular injury had on Appellant’s behavior and personality.

In <em>Malloy, </em>we held that counsel’s duty in this respect “encompasses pursuit of all statutory mitigators of which he is aware or reasonably should be aware, unless there is some objective, reasonable ground not to pursue the circumstance (such as when it might open the door to harmful evidence).” <em><a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">at 787</a>.

Counsel, however, chose not to pursue this evidence further and failed to commission a social history report, despite receiving funds for one. The Supreme Court deteimined that counsel’s failure to pursue these leads with further investigation was objectively unreasonable, noting that such failure did not result from strategy, but rather was the result of simple inattention.</p>

The PCRA court’s conclusion that counsel’s actions regarding the Department of Corrections records were reasonable since they sought a court order to obtain these records and hired experts to evaluate their significance rings hollow. As noted above, counsel’s duty encompasses more than the mere recognition or collection of relevant documents; rather, counsel is charged with the duty to pursue all mitigating evidence of which he should reasonably be aware. <em>Malloy, </em><a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">856 A.2d at 787</a>.

Notwithstanding its conclusion that counsel’s actions were reasonable, the PCRA court addressed this third prong of the ineffectiveness standard, finding that “given [Appellant’s] behavior prior to 1982, the brutality of the crimes involved and the aggravating factors found by the jury, it is highly doubtful that this evidence of a head injury would have persuaded the jury to have imposed life imprisonment.” PCRA ct. op. at 6. In support of that finding, the court noted that the records from the Department of Corrections indicate that prior to the head injury he suffered in 1982, Appellant displayed some of the same personality traits that he had after the injury and had also been diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder prior to the injury. However, as noted earlier in this opinion, there was testimony presented at the PCRA hearing that the head injury suffered by Appellant greatly aggravated those personality traits and the records from the Department of Corrections document the drastic change in personality that Appellant displayed following the head injury. Moreover, the fact that Appellant’s experts each testified that evidence of his injury and resulting brain damage was relevant to establishing two additional mitigating factors that were not presented at trial leads us to conclude that Appellant sufficiently established the requisite prejudice. Had the jury heard this relevant evidence, there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have found an additional mitigating circumstance and struck a different balance in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <em>See Malloy, </em><a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">856 A.2d at 789</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">17</a>

Cancelmi, Jr., an attorney with the Public Defender's Office of Greene County, informing counsel that Appellant had been ordered to undergo involuntary treat<a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>ment pursuant to the Mental Health Procedures Act, 53 P.S. § 7101 <em>et seq., </em>for a period of ninety days. The letter states that a psychiatrist for the State Correctional Institution at Greene, Dr. Asad Khan, testified at the hearing that Appellant is delusional and paranoid and that, in his opinion, a then-current hunger strike by Appellant was a result of his delusional beliefs regarding the radio transmitter and the Department of Correction's ability to monitor and control him via that transmitter. According to this letter, Dr. Khan ruled out intentional manipulation or malingering on the part of Appellant. Appellant requests that he be permitted to supplement the record in this Court, or that the matter be remanded so that he could supplement the record of the PCRA court, with the letter from Mr. Cancelmi, the transcript from the commitment hearing, and the testimony of Dr. Khan.</p>

Testimony from the PCRA hearing reveals that prior to trial, counsel received, via a court order, records from the Department of Corrections regarding Appellant dating back to 1981. Until presented with an actual copy of the court order, Attorney Cullen did not remember seeking a court order in 1989 to obtain these records, and did not remember whether he ever obtained these records prior to the first trial. Those records, which were admitted into evidence at the hearing, indicate that Appellant was sentenced in 1980 to three to six years of incarceration for his convictions of burglary, theft, and violation of probation. Those records further reveal that while incarcerated for those crimes, Appellant suffered a head injury on or about July 4, 1982, and underwent a craniotomy at Nesbitt Memorial Hospital. The records indicate that a drastic behavioral change was noted very soon after the accident and that Appellant developed seizures which were determined to be a result of the head injury. The records indicate that following the injury, Appellant had numerous misconducts, at least one <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>of which was rather serious. Those records include reports of periodic evaluations, each of which reference Appellant’s antisocial and impulsive behavior. Those records further indicate that Appellant complained repeatedly after the injury of feeling moody, irritable and depressed and that he was unable to control his anger and desire to strike out at others. One psychiatrist’s progress note indicates his belief that the head injury organically affected Appellant’s ability to control his impulses. Another report, dated June 2, 1983, after documenting Appellant’s "drastic behavioral change" following his head injury, indicates a need to monitor Appellant for the possibility of an organic impairment. •</p>

Admitted into evidence at the PCRA hearing was a copy of Dr. Gottlieb's forensic psychiatric evaluation that was prepared prior to the <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>initial trial in this matter. That evaluation was based on an examination performed on October 4, 1985, and concluded that there was no evidence of a severe psychiatric disorder that would render Appellant incompetent to stand trial. However, in that same evaluation, Dr. Gottlieb recommended that Appellant undergo psychological testing to determine Appellant’s IQ and to confirm Dr. Gottlieb's impressions. He also stated that if the psychological testing suggested organicity, then a follow-up with a neurologist would have been appropriate. Dr. Gottlieb testified at the PCRA hearing that counsel never again contacted him regarding this matter and that he was never asked to testify at Appellant's trial.</p>

Three of those witnesses, Appellant’s sister, a brother, and a family friend, all testified to Appellant’s caring and charitable nature except for when he was drinking. Each of those examinations was relatively brief and met with no cross-examination. The fourth witness, Dr. John, testified as to his psychiatric evaluations of Appellant, three of which occurred prior to the first trial, the fourth, just prior to the retrial. He testified that Appellant's parents were pretty much uninvolved in Appellant's upbringing; that Appellant began drinking alcohol at age thirteen; and that he had a poor academic record. He testified that the testing he performed revealed an IQ of 94 and a diagnosis of polysubstance abuser and mixed personality disorder. He testified that Appellant’s disorders make it difficult for Appellant to interact with other individuals socially and interfere with his ability to be employed. He testified that Appellant is more likely to become aggressive and volatile when drinking or ingesting controlled substances, but that he could function well in a very controlled environment such as prison where there are definite rules. Diane Metzger, Appellant's sister, testified that Appellant began drinking at age thirteen and became an alcoholic like their father, but that when Appellant was not drinking, he would take his family to festivals and Dutch Wonderland, oftentimes spending his entire paycheck on them. In examining this witness, Attorney Cullen asked whether Appellant was ever injured, to which she responded that he had suffered a head injury several years back while he was incarcerated. Counsel did not, however, pursue this line of questioning. Appellant’s brother, Donald Zook, also testified to Appellant’s charitable nature with his family except for when he was drinking. Thus, while there is evidence in the instant matter that trial counsel did conduct some investigation into Appellant’s background in preparation for the penalty hearing, it appears clear from the record that counsel did not <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>undertake a “reasonable” investigation as required under the Sixth Amendment.</p>

Ms. Eaby filed an amended PCRA petition on December 10, 1996, and a supplement thereto on July 21, 1997. Subsequently, Ms. Eaby was granted leave to withdraw and on April 13, 1998, the court appointed James Moreno, Esquire of the Center for Legal Education, Advocacy and Defense Assistance (CLEADA), as counsel for Appellant.

    <p id="b176-9" data-blocks='[["BL_176.11",176,[267,1079,1157,261]]]'>I join the Majority Opinion, subject to the following qualifications concerning the Majority’s finding of counsel ineffectiveness in failing to present evidence of appellant’s head injury and the relevance of that injury to establishing two separate and additional mitigating circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b176-10" data-blocks='[["BL_176.12",176,[266,1367,1159,692]],["BL_177.1",177,[186,282,1152,474]]]'>First, contrary to the suggestion by the Majority, I am not entirely convinced that there was any serious deficiency in counsel’s <em>investigation </em>of mitigation evidence in this case— particularly given that the passage of time appears to have made it difficult for counsel to recall the precise circumstances and exact contours of that investigation. Counsel here <em>did </em>conduct an investigation and <em>did </em>discover the prison records which documented the head injury appellant suffered three years before he committed the two murders that were the subject of the instant prosecution. However, the PCRA court noted that the evidence was equivocal concerning whether counsel actually forwarded the records at issue to his mental health experts: the experts thought not and, while counsel <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>could not specifically recall, he noted that he would have had no reason not to have forwarded the records after going to the trouble of securing them. In <em>a </em>circumstance such as this, where the proof made it only as likely as not that counsel failed to forward the records, I think it was eminently reasonable for the PCRA court to conclude that the party with the burden of rebutting the presumption of effectiveness failed in his proof. I would not discount so quickly, as the Majority does, the PCRA court’s logical conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[187,791,1153,679]]]'>Accordingly, I am not convinced that this case involves a failure of investigation. But, what seems to have been proven is that counsel made nothing of the fact of the documented brain injury, its potential effect upon appellant, and its relationship to specific, potential mental health-based mitigating circumstances which were not otherwise pursued before the sentencing jury. And so, while counsel’s investigation may have been diligent, it appears there was a lapse in the followup and in the presentation to the jury, there was no specific, reasonable explanation proffered to explain that failure, and no objective reason is otherwise apparent. For this reason, I agree that the performance prong of the Strickland<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">1</a> test has been satisfied.</p>
    <p id="b177-6" data-blocks='[["BL_177.6",177,[186,1514,1152,577]],["BL_178.1",178,[258,278,1160,477]]]'>On the question of prejudice, I recognize that this is a case where counsel presented a cogent case in mitigation, attempting to portray appellant in a positive light. In addition, I think that it is unrealistic in the extreme ever to discount the difficult uphill battle any capital defense lawyer faces where, as here, one of the aggravating circumstances involves the fact that his client elected to commit multiple first degree murders. This is a mark of distinction that seems different in kind from other statutory aggravators. Thus, if the foregone additional mitigation evidence in this case were mere catchall “I had a bad childhood” evidence, I doubt that this Court could find <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>that appellant sustained his burden to prove prejudice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">2</a> Similarly, the mere fact that appellant suffered a head injury alone would not be a fact that would convince me that counsel was ineffective. But, here, the undisputed proof is of documented brain damage and the proffer, also apparently unrebutted, is that the evidence at least would have supported a juror in finding additional statutory mitigators. In these circumstances, I agree that prejudice has been established, and I concur in the award of a new penalty hearing.</p>
