In a published opinion, a majority of the court overruled in part and sustained in part Appellees’ preliminary objections. The court initially found that Appellants had standing to challenge the default rate provision contained in the 2002 GAA. The court then granted Appellees’ preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer. Specifically, the court rejected Appellants’ averment that the 2002 GAA conflicts with Act 68, and is therefore necessarily substantive rather than incidental in violation of Article III, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In reference to Appellants’ assertion that the 2002 GAA conflicts with Act 68 because Act 68 requires that providers be reimbursed for “reasonably necessary costs,” while the 2002 GAA caps an out-of-network provider’s rate at DPW’s default fee-for-service rate, the court found that no such conflict exists. Reading the 2002 GAA and Act 68 <em>in pari materia, </em>the court found the provisions compatible in that Act 68 requires that providers be reimbursed for “reasonably necessary costs” and the fee-for-service rate set by DPW is, by definition, a reasonable cost for the provided service. Accordingly, the court <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>found the contested language incidental rather than substantive and dismissed the Petition for Review.

So common was this practice that it got a popular name, universally understood, as ‘logrolling.’ A still more objectionable practice grew up, of putting what is known as a ‘rider’ (that is, a new and unrelated enactment or provision) on the appropriation bills, and thus coercing the executive to approve obnoxious legislation, or bring the wheels of the government to a stop for want of funds. These were some of the evils which the later changes in the constitution were intended to remedy. Omnibus bills were done away with by the amendment of 1864 that no bill shall contain more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in the title. But this amendment excepted appropriation bills, and as to them the evil still remained. The convenience, if not the necessity, of permitting a general appropriation bill containing items so diverse as to be fairly within the description of different subjects was patent. The present constitution meets this difficulty— First, by including all bills in the prohibition of containing more than one subject, except ‘general appropriation bills’ (article 3, § 3); secondly, by the provision that ‘the general appropriation bill shall embrace nothing but appropriations for the ordinary expenses of the executive, legislative, and judicial departments of the commonwealth, interest on the public debt, and for public schools; all other appropriations shall be made by separate bills each embracing but one subject....’</blockquote>

Appellants argue that the 2002 GAA overlooked such authority as it relates to the reimbursement of emergency services under Act 68 because the 2002 GAA requires that providers be reimbursed at DPW’s default reimbursement rate, a provision that was not sanctioned by the regulatory authority of DOH and PID. In fact, Appellants note both DOH and PID, in accordance with their authority delegated under Act 68, excluded fee-for-service plans from the definition of “managed care plan” in the Act 68 implementing regulations. <em>See </em>28 Pa.Code § 9.602; 31 Pa.Code 154.2.

In this regard, Appellees first note that no provision of Act 68 compels the “negotiation of rates” between out-of-network providers and MA MCOs. To the contrary, the statute applies generally to all hospitals and to all MCO’s, MA and non-MA, requiring the hospitals to render emergency medical care without having to seek or receive authorization and the MCOs to pay for that care. Appellees continue that Act 68 merely assures that, when a hospital enrolled in the MA program delivers emergency services to an MA recipient enrolled in an MA MCO with which the hospital has no contract, the amount that the hospital would otherwise be paid under the MA fee-for-service program for the same service, to the same recipient, will be the amount the MA MCO must pay the hospital under the default rates of the 2002 GAA.</p>

We view the legislature’s attempt to impose DPW’s fee-for-service default rate as the rate non-plan providers such as Appellants <em>must </em>accept for emergency services as an effort by the legislature to suspended Act 68’s requirement that providers be paid “all reasonably necessary costs” for the period of time covered by the 2002 GAA. As asserted by Appellants, prior to the 2002 GAA, out-of-network providers could negotiate with MA MCOs for “reasonably necessary costs” associated with emergency services pursuant to Act 68 as the legislature failed to impose specific reimbursement rates for these services. After the passage of the 2002 GAA, these costs were capped at DPW’s fee-for-services rate. Thus, unquestionably, the amount Appellants could receive for out-of-network services to MA MCO members was subject to change because prior to the passage of the 2002 GAA out-of-network providers were not limited in negotiating for these services. In other words, out-of-network providers could receive <em>all </em>reasonably necessary costs for a given service, even if such cost exceeded DPW’s fee-for-service reimbursement rate.

The court’s decision rested on the fact that, because the hospital was required, under federal law, to treat MA MCO enrollees, and the MA MCO could not prevent its enrollees from seeking treatment at the hospital, neither party should receive a windfall for the services provided in the absence of a contract.</p>

As in this case, the provider in <em>Temple </em>was obligated to provide services to MA MCO enrollees and, in the absence of a contracted-for rate for these services, the court concluded that equity required that the provider be paid the average actual cost for the services. These costs, the court concluded, were neither represented by DPW’s default rates or the provider’s published rates, but fell somewhere in between the two.</p>

Act 68, which was enacted after <em>Hahnemann </em>was decided, does not refer to any DPW rate schedules or regulations mandating the amount MCOs must pay providers. Nor does Act 68 specify that DPW can impose such a rate. In fact, Act 68 expressly excludes the fee-for-services schedule from its scope. <em>See </em>40 P.S. 991.2102(4) (specifying that the term “managed care plan” does not include ancillary service plans or indemnity arrangements which are fee-for-service). Likewise, the implementing regulations of both the DOH and PID, the regulatory entities charged with implementing the requirements of Act 68, exclude fee-for-service plans from the definition of managed care. <em>See </em>28 Pa.Code § 9.602 (noting, in the DOH regulations implementing Act 68, that the term “managed care plan” does not include “fee for service” plans); <em>see also </em>31 Pa.Code § 154.2 (PID regulations noting the same). Moreover, the DOH and PID have regulatory authority in this regard. However, they have expressly declined to impose default rates for reasonably necessary costs based upon the legislature’s very clear indication in Act 68 that default rates do not apply thereunder. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=31%20Pa.%20Bull.%203043" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="31 Pa.
