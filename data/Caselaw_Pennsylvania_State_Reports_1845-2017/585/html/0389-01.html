During trial, she alleged that she had changed her mind prior to any murder attempt, and contracted instead to pay her co-defendant the agreed upon consideration in exchange for his making repairs to her house and car. Evidence revealed that the co-defendant and another accomplice attempted to carry out the original plan by firebombing the mother’s house, resulting in the death of a two-year-old child and severe injuries to other members of the household. Notwithstanding her “withdrawal from conspiracy” defense, on August 4, 2000, Schofield was convicted of murder in the first degree, two counts of attempted murder, two counts of arson, two counts of aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, arson, and causing or risking a catastrophe. The trial court sentenced her to life in prison on the murder charge and additional sentences on the related charges.</p>

Judge Klein filed a vigorous dissent asserting that the purpose of <em>Lord </em>and <em>Butler </em>had been satisfied because the trial judge had been informed of the issues the appellant planned to raise and had filed an opinion from which the Superior Court could conduct meaningful review, despite the <em>pro se </em>defendant’s failure to file the statement with the clerk of the court. Moreover, Judge Klein asserted that the language in <em>Butler, </em>requiring both provision of the statement to the judge and filing with the court, is mere <em>dicta, </em>because in <em>Butler </em>there was no verifiable evidence that the defendant actually supplied the judge with the document.</p>

Specifically, Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) requires that an appellant “file of record in the lower court and serve on the trial judge a concise statement of the matters complained of on the appeal no later than 14 days after entry” of an order requesting the statement. As discussed in the companion case, <em>Castillo, </em>the requirement of strict compliance with Pa. R.A.P.1925(b) guarantees a trial judge’s ability to focus on the issues raised by the appellant, and thereby, allows for meaningful and effective appellate review. Moreover, a bright-line rule eliminates the potential for the inconsistent results that existed prior to <em>Lord, </em>when trial courts and appellate courts had discretion to address or to waive issues raised in non-compliant Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statements. As is evidenced by <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>this case, non-compliance creates substantial problems on appeal, where the lack of filing results in the inability of the appellate courts to determine which issues were presented to the trial court, and thus preserved for appeal, and whether the trial court received the statement within the required time period.</p>
