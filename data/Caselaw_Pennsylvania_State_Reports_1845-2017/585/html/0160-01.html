Rather, the only intimation that the right was of constitutional dimension was the fact that we held that the trial court’s action to disregard a defendant’s waiver of the instruction resulted in <em>per se </em>error — a defendant was entitled to a new trial when the trial court gave the instruction over his objection.

A decision not to have the court instruct the jury to draw no adverse inference from the defendant’s silence is a risky trial strategy. It is difficult to see how any defendant in a circumstance where the court orders the jury not to draw the logical lay inference that results from silence in the face of evidence of guilt can be said to have been prejudiced. Perhaps there are unusual instances where the particular facts of a case will warrant counsel in not wanting the jury so informed — though such a case is hard to imagine — and the charge should not be forced upon counsel in that instance. <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>But such exceptional circumstances are what appeals are for, and the ill-wisdom of the <em>Edwards </em>rule is that it allowed the unusual case to become the “tail that wags the dog.” To grant relief irrespective of actual prejudice, in instances such as those contemplated by <em>Edwards, </em>may forestall appeals, but at the cost of criminal justice.</p>
