PCRA court opinion at 6 (citing Pa.R.Crim.P. 907(2)). The court first acknowledged that <em>Atkins </em>left it to the individual states to decide on the standards and procedure that a court should use in adjudicating the mental status of a defendant. Thus, it recognized that it needed to develop such standards and procedures in order to resolve Appellee’s claim. Consistent with this, the PCRA court held that the burden of proof in such cases was on the petitioner to establish his mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence and that such evidence must be presented to the court and not a jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It then went on to define “mental retardation” by relying on the definitions of that term as set forth by the American Psychiatric Association in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.1992) (hereinafter “DSM-IV”) and the American Association of Mental Retardation (hereinafter “AAMR”) in Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 1 (10th ed.2002) (hereinafter “Mental Retardation”). Each of these definitions, the court concluded, required the demonstration of “three core components: (1) substantial intellectual impairment; (2) impact of that impairment on the everyday life of the individual (i.e., substantial deficits in adaptive functioning); and (8) appearance of the disability prior to age 18.” PCRA court opinion at 15.</p>

The court, however, was persuaded that this evidence established Petitioner’s mental retardation. Specifically, the evidence relied upon by the PCRA court included the facts that: Appellee was placed in special education classes beginning in first grade for the “educable” mentally retarded; during his early years, his IQ was repeatedly tested and he tested in the 50’s and 60’s; in his early teens, he twice tested in the high 70s and <em>low-80’s</em>

      <em>; </em>and in 1986, at 21 years of age, he was measured with an IQ of 71 and was described as functioning within the “borderline retarded range of intelligence.” PCRA court opinion at 17. In addition to the documentary evidence, all five mental health experts who testified during the penalty phase and at the first PCRA hearing, including the Commonwealth’s expert at the PCRA hearing, agreed that Appellee was borderline retarded or mentally retarded.

The Commonwealth requests that this court vacate the PCRA court’s order and remand this matter for further proceedings, including an examination of Appellee by Commonwealth experts and an evidentiary hearing. In support of its position, the Commonwealth first argues that the Court’s decision in <em>Atkins </em>constituted exceptional circumstances, which justify discovery in this PCRA proceeding. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(E)(1). The Commonwealth points out that there has never been an examination of Appellee to determine, for purposes of the Eighth Amendment prohibition, whether he is mentally retarded, and the Commonwealth contends that it is a matter of fundamental fairness to allow it the opportunity to conduct such an examination. The Commonwealth also disputes the PCRA court’s reliance on the “practice effect” in the absence of being able to conduct its own examination of <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>Appellee. <em>See supra </em>n. 4. Likewise, the Commonwealth argues that it was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this issue since the Commonwealth disputed Appellee’s claim that he was mentally retarded in its answer to Appellee’s petition. Lastly, the Commonwealth faults the PCRA court for failing to define mental retardation, and argues that absent such a definition, it was impossible for the court to make a determination of whether Appellee was mentally retarded.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[254,750,1161,652]]]'>Appellee responds that the fact of his mental retardation was never challenged at the prior proceedings and principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel should bar the relitigation of this issue. In fact, the Commonwealth’s expert accepted the fact that Appellee was mentally retarded in order to defeat the mental health claim that Appellee raised at the first PCRA hearing. Furthermore, he maintains that the prior documentary and testamentary evidence was sufficient to establish his mental retardation and the jury agreed with that evidence, since it found his low intelligence to be a mitigating factor. Thus, Appellee concludes that the Commonwealth should not be allowed to perform further testing on him.</p>
    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[252,1446,1165,863]]]'>Appellee acknowledges that this case presents an issue of first impression as to how <em>Atkins </em>should be implemented in this Commonwealth and points out that <em>Atkins </em>categorically bans capital sentencing and execution of persons with mental retardation. At a minimum, Appellee contends that the states must adopt the definition provided by the AAMR or the American Psychiatric Association as these were the definitions used in <em>Atkins. </em>But, Appellee argues that states are free to adopt a more inclusive standard, like the definition set forth in Pennsylvania’s Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act, 50 P.S. § 4102, and Appellee urges this court to adopt this definition in applying <em>Atkins. </em>Ultimately, however, Appellee contends that this court need not resolve the question of the proper standard for assessing mental retardation since Appellee is mentally retarded under any constitutionally acceptable definition of mental retardation.</p>

The United States Supreme Court cited two different definitions of “mental retardation” in <em>Atkins, </em>and we will first consider these definitions. The AAMR defines mental retardation as a “disability characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adapative behavior as expressed in the conceptual, social, and practical adaptive skills.” Mental Retardation at 1. The American Psychiatric Association defines mental retardation as “significantly subaverage intellectual functioning (an IQ of approximately 70 or below) with onset before age 18 years and concurrent deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning.” DSM-IV at 37. Thus, as noted by the PCRA court, both definitions of mental retardation incorporate three concepts: 1) limited intellectual functioning; 2) significant adaptive limitations; and 3) age of onset.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Mental Retardation at 14; DSM-IV at 39. The concept should also take into consideration the standard error of measurement (hereinafter “SEM”) for the specific assessment instruments used. Mental Retardation at 57. The SEM has been estimated to be three to five points for well-standardized measures of general intellectual functioning. Mental Retardation at 57; DSM-IV at 39. Thus, for example, a subaverage intellectual capability is commonly ascribed to those who test below 65-75 on the Wechsler scales. Mental Retardation at 58; DSM-IV at 39.</p>

Both the AAMR’s definition and the DSM-IVs definition of mental retardation provide that a low IQ score is not in itself sufficient to classify a person as mentally retarded. Mental Retardation at 25; DSM-IV at 39-40. Rather, the person must also show significant limitations in adaptive behavior. Adaptive behavior is the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that have been learned by people in order to function in their everyday lives, and limitations on adaptive behavior are reflected by difficulties adjusting to ordinary demands made in daily life.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Mental Retardation at 73; DSM-IV at 40. The AAMR recommends that such limitations should be established through the use of standardized measures. “On these standardized measures, significant limitations in adaptive behavior are operationally defined as <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>performance that is at least two standard deviations below the mean of either (a) one of the following three types of adaptive behavior: conceptual, social, or practical, or (b) an overall score on a standardized measure of conceptual, social and practical skills.” Mental Retardation at 14.

Therefore, we hold that a PCRA petitioner may establish his or her mental retardation under either classification system and consistent with this holding, assuming proper qualification, an expert presented by either party may testify as to mental retardation under either classification system. Moreover, consistent with both of these classification systems, we do not adopt a cutoff IQ score for determining mental retardation in Pennsylvania, since it is the interaction between limited intellectual functioning and deficiencies in adaptive skills that establish mental retardation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Moreover, contrary to Appellee’s assertions, we do not agree that the definition offered in the Pennsylvania Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act is significantly broader than the definitions we adopt today.

This definition generally encompasses the considerations provided for by the AAMR and DSM-IY definitions; and to the extent that the definition of the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act broadens the definition of mental retardation that we <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>adopt today, we merely note that a broader definition may be appropriate when the diagnosis is for something other than penological interests.

Finally, in 1986, at the age of 21, his full scale IQ was recorded at 71 and Appellee was found to be functioning within the “borderline retarded range of intelligence.” <em>See </em>Report of Psychological Evaluation, 5/8/1986. The PCRA court accepted Appellee’s experts’ testimony that the higher scores at the age of 16 was due to the “practice effect” described at note 3. In addition to the documentary evidence, the PCRA court also reviewed the testamentary evidence from the first two proceedings, during which, the experts routinely opined that Appellee was “borderline retarded” or “mentally retarded.” N.T., Sentencing Hearing, 3/25/1993, at 67; N.T., Sentencing Hearing, 3/25/1993, at 139; N.T., First PCRA Hearing, 9/27/1997, at 50; N.T., 9/27/1997, <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>at 209. After reviewing the available evidence, the PCRA court concluded that “while petitioner’s IQ scores varied widely, the evidence provided [sic] this court established by a preponderance of the evidence that his IQ qualifies as between 70 and 75, or below, placing him in the mild mental retardation range.” PCRA court opinion at 21.</p>

To this end, Appellee presented two experts in support of his position that in addition to being mentally retarded, he also was organically brain damaged. In order to counter Appellee’s experts’ testimony, the Commonwealth presented one expert, Dr. Dixon Miller, a trained psychologist with a subspecialty in clinical neuropsychology. The Commonwealth’s position was simply that any evidence of organic brain damage was merely redundant with the diagnosis of <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>borderline or mental retardation. In support of his testimony, Dr. Miller repeatedly stated that Appellee was “functioning at the mentally retarded or borderline retarded range.” N.T., 9/27/1997, 209, 217-18; 222; 228-24. The PCRA court relied on this testimony, essentially concluding that the Commonwealth conceded Appellant’s mental retardation.

Yet, there is a critical difference between these two classifications, since if a defendant is classified as having borderline intellectual functioning, he would not automatically be considered “mentally retarded” under <em>Atkins </em>unless he also showed significant deficits in adaptive behavior. <em>See supra </em>n. 8. Furthermore, at the first PCRA hearing, Appellee’s experts’ testimony occurred in the context of Appellee’s attempt to establish his organic brain damage, rather than mental retardation. Thus, this testimony is of limited value in answering the question before us. Lastly, at the sentencing hearing, Appellee’s experts’ testimony either classified him as “borderline” or “mildly mentally” retarded. Again, this equivocal testimony does not establish that Appellee was in fact mentally retarded under <em>Atkins. </em>Thus, we conclude that the PCRA court abused its discretion by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing when there was no relevant evidence offered to establish mental retardation under <em>Atkins. </em>We remand this case for further proceedings consistent with our decision today.</p>

Examples of such skills are language and money concepts (conceptual); responsibility and the ability to follow rules (social); and meal preparation and money management (practical). Mental Retardation at 42 Table 3.1. The DSM-IV requires significant limitations in at least two of the following skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety.

For example, the DSM-IV provides that when classifying a person in the “borderline intellectual functioning” range, assessing deficits in adaptive skills may become more important, since “it is possible to diagnose Mental Retardation in individuals with IQ scores between 71 and 75 if they have significant deficits in adaptive behavior that meet the criteria for Mental Retardation.” DSM-IV at 45.</p>

For this same reason, we reject Appellee's assertion that the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata preclude reliligation of the <em>Atkins </em>claim. Under these doctrines, the particular issue (for purposes of collateral estoppel) or particular matter (for purposes of res judicata) must have been previously litigated. <em>Commonwealth v. Holder, </em><a href="/pa/569/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="569 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="312749" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0474-01">569 Pa. 474</a>, <a href="/a2d/805/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="805 A.2d 499" data-case-ids="11433672,312749" data-case-paths="/a2d/805/0499-01,/pa/569/0474-01">805 A.2d 499</a>, 502 n. 3 (2002). Yet here, as the PCRA court recognized, Appellee's claim of mental retardation has never before been litigated. Because there was no previous litigation, it is evident that the claim is not being improperly relitigated at this juncture.</p>

More than three years have passed since it was announced that each state had to set standards and procedures for adjudicating the mental retardation of a defendant in a capital case.
