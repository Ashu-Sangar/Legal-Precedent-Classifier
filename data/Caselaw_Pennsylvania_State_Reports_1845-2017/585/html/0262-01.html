Officer Mason testified that, at approximately 9:50 a.m. on July 2, 1997, he and his partner, Officer Carl Selby, were patrolling the area around 2500 North Chadwick Street in North Philadelphia in response to complaints received about the high volume of drug sales in the area. The officers were in plainclothes and riding in an unmarked police vehicle. After Officer Selby parked on Huntingdon Street near 17th Street, Officer Mason walked one block over to Chadwick Street, sat on a step and began reading a newspaper, “trying to blend in.” Shortly thereafter, Officer Mason observed three men — appellant, Charles Felder and an unidentified man — sitting on the steps six to seven houses away from his location, at 2509 North Chadwick Street. A woman approached Felder, who retrieved a clear plastic baggy from his pocket, took money from her and, in exchange, gave her objects from the baggy. The woman then walked away and Felder placed the baggy in the gas cap of a nearby automobile.</p>

One block from where the transaction occurred, the officers saw the same three men. They left their vehicle, identified themselves as police officers, displayed their badges, and attempted to stop the men. Appellant and Felder heeded the officers’ directives, but the third male ran. Two uniformed female police officers in the immediate vicinity pursued the fleeing male.</p>

The officers also did not have their guns drawn. The officers then drove around the block toward the direction of the female officers’ screams, which proved to be the approximate location of the prior alleged drug transaction. When Officers Mason and Selby arrived, the female officers informed them that the screams that they had heard were directed to the unidentified man to get him to stop, but the man had escaped.

Officer Selby performed a pat-down of Felder, recovering a clear plastic baggy containing thirty-nine black-tinted, small packets of crack cocaine. During Officer Selby’s pat-down of Felder, and before appellant could be frisked, Officer Mason noticed appellant shaking his right leg. Officer Mason saw something slide down appellant’s pants leg, heard a thump as the object hit the ground, and then saw appellant kick the discarded object under the police vehicle. Officer Mason looked under the vehicle and recovered a loaded, .38-caliber handgun. He then arrested appellant. A search incident to arrest yielded $1105 in United States currency and three rounds of .38-caliber ammunition from appellant’s pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10.</p>

The court found that, upon observing what appeared to be an illegal drug transaction by Felder, police had probable cause to arrest Felder, but that they lacked probable cause to arrest appellant up until the time the gun fell from his pants leg. However, the court concluded that appellant’s presence with Felder, a suspected drug dealer, at the scene of the transaction and at the scene of Felder’s arrest, gave police reasonable, articulable suspicion that appellant might also be armed and dangerous, such that they could lawfully perform a <em>Terry </em>stop and frisk for their own safety. The court also found that exigent circumstances existed which justified Officers Mason and Selby in interrupting their stop of appellant and Felder, <em>ie., </em>they “were required to aid their fellow officers who were attempting to apprehend the fleeing male.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Further, the court held that, under the totality of the circumstances— including the reasons for the transportation, its short duration, the short distance of transportation, and the fact that appellant was not handcuffed — the mere placement of appellant in the police vehicle did not convert the investigative detention into an arrest. With respect to the seizure of the firearm, the court found that once the firearm fell from appellant’s pants leg, police had probable cause to arrest him; the subsequent search of appellant and the seizure of ammunition and currency therefore were lawful as an incident to that arrest.</p>

However, the panel subsequently reconsidered and vacated its order. On November 20, 2002, the panel issued a published, 2-1 decision which affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

The majority reasoned that those circumstances — brief duration, no force, no restraints, and the short distance of transportation — revealed that the detention “avoided the coercive characteristics associated with an arrest.” <em>Revere, </em><a href="/a2d/814/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="814 A.2d 197" data-case-ids="9336628" data-case-paths="/a2d/814/0197-01">814 A.2d at 200</a>. Thus, the majority concluded that the officers required only reasonable suspicion to justify their seizure and transportation of appellant.

In the majority’s view, appellant “misread” <em>Lovette </em>as establishing such a <em>per se </em>rule. <em>Lovette </em>“clearly indicates that when such an action is justified, placing a suspect into a police vehicle in order to transport him to the scene is not an arrest and need not be supported by probable cause.” <em>Revere, </em><a href="/a2d/814/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="814 A.2d 197" data-case-ids="9336628" data-case-paths="/a2d/814/0197-01">814 A.2d at 200</a>. The majority recognized that, under the facts in <em>Lovette, </em>this Court found that an arrest had occurred; however, the majority deemed it significant that <em>Lovette </em>had suggested that transporting a suspect during an investigative detention could be justified by exigent circumstances. The majority then concluded, as the suppression court had, that exigent circumstances in fact existed in the case <em>sub judice </em>— to wit, the officers’ belief that the screams of their fellow officers suggested they were in physical danger — and that placing appellant in the car while driving to investigate those screams was a proper, limited response to the exigency.</p>

To have ignored these screams in order to complete the investigative stop of appellant and Felder would have required Officers Selby and Mason to have ignored the calls of their fellow officers. Alternatively, Officers Selby and Mason would have had to abandon their investigation to respond to the shouts. Such choices, it seems, are those that the language in <em>Lovette </em>was intended to allow police to avoid making.

The owner of the burglarized premises arrived home as the officer was investigating and informed him that the premises had been secured when he left that morning. The officer noticed a trail of muddy footprints on a plot of ground between the burglarized premises and the vacant house where some of the stolen goods had been taken. The officer patrolled the area and saw three males a block and a half from the scene of the burglary; the men attracted his attention because of the mud on their shoes. The officer stopped the trio and asked for identification, which none could produce. The officer decided to transport the trio back to the burglary victim’s home, and in anticipation of that transportation, conducted pat down searches which produced a ring and a valuable silver dime from one of the appellant’s companions.

Moreover, unlike in <em>Lovette, </em>police here did not pat appellant down, or seize anything from him, prior to the emergency decision to transport him as they responded to the shouts. Once the police ascertained that the other officers were safe, they immediately resumed and completed their investigative detention.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

Appellant James Revere makes no claim that the approach under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution is different than that under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and thus, the majority properly presumes similarity in legal analysis. Majority Opinion at 270 n. 6, 888 A.2d at 699 n. 6. While our Court has consistently followed <em>Terry, </em>in investigative detention cases under the Pennsylvania Constitution, our case law makes equally clear that we are not in any way bound by <em>Terry </em>for purposes of Article I, Section 8 jurisprudence and that if <em>Terry </em>and its federal progeny evolve to a point that is inconsistent with our Constitution’s guarantees, we are free to embrace a standard other than adhered to by the United States Supreme Court. <em>In the Interest of D.M., </em><a href="/pa/566/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="183" data-cite="566 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="706229" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0445-01">566 Pa. 445</a>, <a href="/pa/566/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="184" data-cite="781 A.2d 1161" data-case-ids="706229,9480622" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0445-01,/a2d/781/1161-01">781 A.2d 1161</a>, 1163 (2001).</p>

I agree with the majority that, in performing this inquiry, reviewing courts must appreciate that police are often acting in dangerous and fluid situations and that reviewing courts should not engage in unrealistic second-guessing. Consideration of reasonably less intrusive alternatives should be part of the relevant inquiry and serves to balance the concerns of citizens and law enforcement officers. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Indeed, if there were ten police officers at the crime scene while investigating the two detainees, and the officers were faced with the exigency of safety concerns for their fellow officers, relocating the detainees might vety well be considered to be unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances and thus, an unconstitutional arrest.</p>
