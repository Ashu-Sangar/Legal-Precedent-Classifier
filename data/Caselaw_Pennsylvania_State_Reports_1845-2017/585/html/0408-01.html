The sole issue before this Court is whether the sentencing court had the authority to revoke appellee’s probation and impose a prison sentence on the basis of a conviction that occurred subsequent to the imposition of probation, where, at the time probation was imposed, the criminal conduct underlying that conviction was known to the court but the court deferred consideration of the crime pending the outcome of the trial. For the following reasons, we hold that the trial court had the authority to sentence appellee as it did, and we therefore reverse the order of the Superior Court and reinstate the trial court’s judgment of sentence.</p>

On that same date, the trial court imposed, for each crime, a sentence of one year of Intermediate Punishment to be followed by two years of probation, with the sentences to run concurrently.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>trial court also ordered appellee to complete long-term inpatient care, conduct forty hours of community service, and pay court costs.</p>

In appellee’s view, each parole/probationary term is forever extinguished upon its revocation and is then replaced by the succeeding VOP sentencing order. The later sentencing order can be violated, appellee argues, only by new conduct occurring after the order is entered. Thus, appellee submits that, at the October 29, 2002 VOP hearing, the trial court was faced with the “dilemma” of having to decide whether to impose a county prison sentence — based upon his technical violations of probation — or a state prison sentence — based upon the technical violations as well as the intervening arrest and criminal charges. To properly resolve this dilemma, appellee submits that the trial court could have taken a number of actions, pending the outcome in the intervening, open criminal cases, including, <em>inter alia, </em>postponing the probation hearing or revoking probation but deferring the sentence — options which appellee failed to request at the October 29, 2002 VOP hearing. Appellee insists, however, that: “Judge Sarmina could not do what she chose to do — impose a new sentence on October 29, 2002, which included probation, and then revoke this newly imposed probation for conduct that occurred prior to its imposition.” Appellee’s Brief at 13. Appellee further contends that the trial court’s “advance warning” that it would “improperly” sentence appellee if he were later convicted for the open cases did not vitiate the impropriety. Finally, appellee answers the Commonwealth’s reliance upon Bossche; <em>Meyer, </em>and <em>Paige </em>by contending that these cases are inapposite because they all involved the defendant’s fraud or deceit in obtaining probation, conduct which appellee alleges is absent <em>subjudice.</em>

Furthermore, we see no reason, under the facts of this case, to force the trial court’s conduct into one or the other of the constructs alleged by appellee to have been improperly intertwined by the Commonwealth: <em>i.e., </em>(1) the revocation of probation based upon “after-discovered” evidence; or (2) the imposition of “conditional” probation. We are satisfied, in light of our case law, that the salient point is that the ultimate disposition of outstanding criminal charges, which would require revocation if a conviction occurs, is a proper basis to adjust an existing VOP sentence — to the defendant’s ultimate benefit or to his detriment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>
