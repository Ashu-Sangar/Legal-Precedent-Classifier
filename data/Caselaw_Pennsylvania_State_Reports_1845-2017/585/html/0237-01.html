Because we hold that the seizure of the firearm did not violate appellee’s constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment and/or Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, we reverse the order of the Superior Court to the extent that it affirmed the suppression of the firearm in question.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellee was charged with one count each of possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance (cocaine), and two firearms offenses. Appellee filed a motion to suppress evidence, alleging that the drugs and the firearm which formed the basis for the prosecution were illegally seized, “without ... warrants and without probable cause to do so, and not incident to a lawful arrest and without the consent of [appellee].” A hearing on the motion was held on April 3, 2002 before the Honorable Peter F. Rogers.</p>

The Commonwealth responded by calling Philadelphia Police Officer Ernest Miller, who testified that on September 20, 2000, at approximately 2:25 a.m., he and his partner, Officer Malik Abdulhadi, were on routine patrol in their unmarked police vehicle in the area of 53rd and Delancey Streets in West Philadelphia, when they heard gunshots nearby. Officer Miller contacted the police dispatcher and inquired whether there were reports of gunfire in the area. Officer Miller continued driving west when, approximately two minutes later, the dispatcher confirmed that gunfire had been reported at 53rd Street and either Irving or Delancey Street. Officer Miller drove toward that location. As his cruiser turned the corner at 55th and Locust Streets, Officer Miller saw appellee and Steven Brown standing at the driver’s side of a brown Cadillac Deville. Officer Miller then saw appellee placing a large hand gun into the back of the Cadillac, through the rear driver’s side window. The officers stopped their vehicle, pulled out their badges, approached appellee and Brown and identified themselves as police officers. By that time, appellee and Brown had walked to the rear of the vehicle. When the officers identified themselves, appellee quickly closed the trunk of the vehicle and Brown threw a clear plastic bag to the ground. N.T., 4/3/02, 6-9.</p>
    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[251,1500,1164,618]]]'>Officer Miller testified that he then conducted a safety pat down of Brown and also retrieved the discarded plastic bag, which contained five small orange packets of what was later determined to be marijuana and six orange packets of what was later determined to be cocaine. Meanwhile, Officer Abdulhadi patted appellee down and recovered from his person 41 packets containing a white chunky substance which was later determined to be crack cocaine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> A search incident to appellee’s arrest resulted in the seizure of $449 in cash from appellee’s person. Officer Miller testified that, when asked to whom the narcotics belonged, appellee and Brown each named the other.</p>

The firearm was identified as a .9 millimeter Cobra with 33 live rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber. Officer Miller also testified that there was nothing in the vehicle or gym bag that appeared to belong to or otherwise relate to appellee, that appellee did not have a key to the car, and that a record check of the Vehicle Identification Number revealed that the vehicle was not registered to appellee, but to “Jack somebody and Nancy Ayoub.” N.T., 4/3/02, 11-13, 36-37.</p>
    <p id="b379-4" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[134,986,1164,1334]]]'>Appellee elected to take the stand and relate his version of the arrest, which differed in significant respects from the police account. Appellee stated that he left his home at 54th and Cedar Streets in West Philadelphia at approximately 2:00 a.m. and met his friend, Darryl Parish, and another male, Kenny Parker, at 55th and Locust Streets, near a brown Cadillac. Shortly thereafter, Steven Brown exited his apartment on Locust Street and joined the others, who had planned to go to an “after hours spot.” Parish and Parker walked up the street, leaving appellee and Brown talking near the Cadillac. Appellee testified that, at that point, a vehicle came around the corner toward them and parked so close that appellee could not go anywhere. Two men exited the vehicle with guns drawn and ordered appellee and Brown to lay face-down on the ground. Appellee testified that the men, who did not immediately identify themselves as police officers, searched his person while he lay in the street and retrieved money and narcotics from his pockets. The officers then handcuffed appellee and ultimately placed him in the police vehicle. It was only at that point that appellee saw Officer Abdulhadi remove the duffle bag from the back seat of the Cadillac, unzip the bag, pull out the handgun, and say, “Look what we have here.” On cross-examination, appellee testified that the Cadillac was not his, and that it belonged to Parker. N.T., 4/3/02, 43-52.</p>

      <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>After resting his case, appellee’s counsel began arguing the lawfulness of the police conduct premised upon appellee’s testimony, only to have the suppression court interrupt and state, “You can completely forget [appellee’s] version and deal with the Commonwealth’s evidence.” Counsel complied and framed his legal argument in terms of the Commonwealth’s evidence contending, with respect to the cocaine, that police lacked probable cause to search his client; and, with respect to the firearm, that police lacked probable cause to search the Cadillac, had no warrant, and lacked consent to search the vehicle. N.T., 4/3/02, 55-56. The Commonwealth responded first by addressing the seizure of the firearm, arguing that when a police officer views an object from a lawful vantage point, and the incriminating nature of that object is immediately apparent, a warrantless seizure is justified; and that, in any event, appellee had failed to show that he had an expectation of privacy in the Cadillac. N.T., 4/3/02, 58-60. In an extended exchange with the prosecutor, the suppression court indicated it was unconvinced with the government’s argument respecting the firearm. Judge Rogers then interrupted the prosecutor before he could argue the legality of the personal search, announcing he was granting the motion as to both the cocaine and the firearm. N.T., 4/3/02, 63-64.</p>
    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[266,1546,1159,472]]]'>The suppression court did not make formal findings of fact on the record, nor did it state which of the divergent factual accounts it credited. With respect to conclusions of law, the court very briefly stated that it was ordering suppression of the drugs found on appellee’s person because “that is a full blown search.” With respect to the firearm, the court ordered suppression because the police searched the car without a warrant and appellee had “no obligation ... or burden to come forth and say that is my car.” N.T., 4/3/02, 61-63.</p>
    <p id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[267,2041,1155,99]],["BL_381.1",381,[141,279,1154,523]]]'>The Commonwealth timely appealed to the Superior Court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and filed a timely statement of matters complained of on <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>appeal, alleging that appellee lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle; that the firearm seized was in plain view; and that the police acted upon both reasonable suspicion and probable cause. Some months later, on September 27, 2002, Judge Rogers filed an opinion in which he summarized the suppression testimony of all witnesses, noted the “total conflict” in the testimony, and then stated, for the first time, that he had “accepted the testimony of the defense, in large part, and rejected that of the Commonwealth.” Trial court slip op. at 6.</p>
    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.6",381,[142,826,1153,787]]]'>In its legal analysis, the court then noted, with respect to the search of appellee’s person and the seizure of his cocaine, that under the version of the arrest testified to by appellee, the police “had no lawful basis for even an Investigative detention’ because there were no facts that would give rise to the level of a ‘reasonable suspicion.’ ” In the alternative, the court concluded that, under the Commonwealth’s evidence, there was neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion to support the police officers’ actions. With respect to the seizure of the firearm from the Cadillac, the court discussed its understanding of warrantless vehicle searches, ultimately concluding that no exception to the warrant requirement applied. The court failed to address the Commonwealth’s argument that appellee lacked an expectation of privacy in the Cadillac. Trial court slip op. at 14-17.</p>

The panel first noted that, because the suppression court had largely credited appellee’s testimony, and that testimony suggested that the police could not have seen appellee holding a gun on the street, the police lacked probable cause or reasonable suspicion to arrest and/or search appellee, Brown and the vehicle. The panel next recognized that “under the credited evidence appellee had no expectation of privacy with respect to the vehicle.” Super. Ct. slip op. at 10 n. 3. Nevertheless, the panel determined that it “need not <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>address” the Commonwealth’s preserved foundational argument that appellee’s lack of a reasonable expectation of privacy in the car rendered the suppression of the firearm erroneous. Conflating exclusionary rule issues with proof of the firearm possession charge at trial, the panel concluded that the argument did not have to be addressed because the Commonwealth had failed to meet its “initial burden of proof to demonstrate at the suppression hearing, that there was some [possessory] connection between the appellee and the gun.” In the panel’s view, because, under the credited evidence, “[t]he Commonwealth did not establish that the appellee actually put the gun into the bag, nor the bag into the car .... [w]e therefore find it unnecessary to address the argument that the appellee maintained no expectation of privacy in the vehicle or its contents.” Finally, the panel seemed to suggest that the vehicle search was part and parcel of the preceding search of appellee’s person and somehow was “but-for” tainted by that prior illegality:</p>

This Court is bound by those of the suppression court’s factual findings which find support in the record, but we are not bound by the court’s conclusions of law. <em>E.g. Commonwealth v. Templin, </em><a href="/pa/568/0306-02" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="568 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="163560,163569" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0306-02,/pa/568/0306-01">568 Pa. 306</a>, <a href="/pa/568/0306-02" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="795 A.2d 959" data-case-ids="163560,163569,163662,9427437,9427468,9427541" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0306-02,/pa/568/0306-01,/pa/568/0305-01,/a2d/795/0959-01,/a2d/795/0959-02,/a2d/795/0959-03">795 A.2d 959</a>, 961 (2002). When the suppression court’s specific factual findings are unannounced, or there is a gap in the findings, the appellate court should consider only the evidence of the prevailing suppression party (here, appellee) and the evidence of the other party (here, the prosecution) that, when read in the context of the entire record, remains uncontradicted. <em>E.g. Commonwealth v. Mendenhall, </em><a href="/pa/552/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="552 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="559298" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0484-01">552 Pa. 484</a>, <a href="/a2d/715/1117-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="715 A.2d 1117" data-case-ids="11710107,559298" data-case-paths="/a2d/715/1117-01,/pa/552/0484-01">715 A.2d 1117</a>, 1118-19 &amp; n. 1 (1998)</p>

      <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>Although the facts were sharply disputed at the suppression hearing concerning the stop and search of appellee’s person, the relevant facts were undisputed concerning central aspects of the police seizure of the firearm: <em>i.e., </em>it was undisputed that the firearm was seized from the Cadillac, not from appellee’s person, and no evidence was forwarded to suggest that appellee had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the Cadillac. Indeed, respecting the latter point, appellee never argued or testified that he had such an expectation of privacy; instead, he stated that the vehicle was not his, but was owned by Kenny Parker. Appellee did not claim that he had a right to use or access the vehicle, or to exclude others (such as the police) from it. Moreover, the Commonwealth’s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that the vehicle was registered to someone other than appellee (or Parker) and that no key, papers or other identification were found which would have indicated that appellee had any legitimate connection to the vehicle. For purposes of our review, we will accept that police had no legal justification to enter the Cadillac and seize this firearm without a warrant; in so doing, we will further assume that the police entry and seizure violated the constitutional rights of any person who at the time possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle. The purely legal issue before this Court is the effect of appellee’s lack of an expectation of privacy in the vehicle in such a scenario. This is a legal issue as to which this Court’s review is plenary and non-deferential. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth recognizes that to convict appellee of a firearms offense at trial, it -will be obliged to prove a possessory connection between appellee and the firearm seized from the Cadillac. However, the Commonwealth emphasizes that this trial burden is not the first order of business at a pre-trial suppression hearing devoted to the question of whether the defendant’s personal rights were violated by a police search or seizure, such that an exclusionary rule remedy is available.</p>

Thus, Rule 581(A) provides that, “the defendant or defendant’s attorney may make a motion to the court to suppress any evidence alleged to have been obtained in violation of the defendant’s rights.” Similarly, in addressing the Commonwealth’s obligation at the suppression hearing, the Rules provide that the Commonwealth “shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence and of establishing that the challenged evidence was not obtained <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>in violation of the defendant’s rights.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 581(H). The focus of the Rules, thus, is upon purported violations of the defendant’s rights; the Rules impose no preliminary burden on the Commonwealth of establishing a “connection” between the defendant and the item of evidence the defense seeks to have excluded before that question of a violation of rights may be addressed.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that there is no record support for, or recognized legal relevance arising from, the panel’s statement that “but for” the illegal search of appellee’s person, the police would not have searched the car. The Commonwealth notes that the “ ‘test for excludability is not whether the evidence would have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police, but rather, whether the evidence has been come at by exploitation of that illegality....’” Brief for Appellant, 15 n. 1, <em>quoting Commonwealth v.

Under either version of events testified to at the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth asserts, the search of the vehicle was not causally related to the search of appellee, much less tainted by the personal search: Police testified that they searched the car because they saw appellee place a gun in it even before they approached him; while appellee said police searched the car for no reason apparent to him, and certainly for no reason which derived from their search of his person. The Commonwealth concludes that, because the police did not exploit evidence obtained from the search of appellee’s person in order to develop suspicion concerning, or gain access to, the vehicle, the mere fact that appellee was seized (whether lawfully or unlawfully) before the police entered the vehicle provides no rational basis for suppressing the fruits of the separate vehicle search.</p>

First, it permits the losing party to make a more intelligent assessment of whether or not to burden the appellate justice system with an appeal of the suppression ruling, particularly in cases of contested evidence.

Thus, in cases where suppression is denied, a trial occurs, and a conviction ensues, and the defendant seeks to challenge the suppression ruling, the timely and specific ruling the suppression judge is required to enter under Rule 581(1) is essential to ensuring that the trial judge and the appellate courts will have a record upon which they can timely and meaningfully discharge their responsibilities.</p>

The point of a motion to suppress physical evidence is to eliminate certain tangible evidence from the Commonwealth’s trial armamentarium, on grounds that the manner of the government’s acquisition of that evidence involved a violation of the defendant’s constitutional rights. Whether that evidence is to be suppressed does not depend upon whether the Commonwealth has committed itself to introduce the evidence at trial, or how important it is to the Commonwealth’s case, or how strong the evidence is, or whether it is subject to trial contradiction, explanation or rebuttal; the focus is upon its manner of acquisition, and how that manner of acquisition implicated the defendant’s constitutional rights. By the same token, an unsuccessful motion to suppress does not restrict the defendant from arguing at trial that the evidence should be excluded, or discounted by the factfinder, on grounds unrelated to the constitutionality of its acquisition. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 581(J).

I write separately only to note that our decision today should not, in any way, be interpreted to represent support for the broad proposition that passengers in a vehicle or those with something other than ownership interests in a vehicle cannot establish a legitimate expectation of privacy in the vehicle searched. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Shiflet, </em><a href="/pa/543/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="543 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="461479" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0164-01">543 Pa. 164</a>, <a href="/pa/543/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="670 A.2d 128" data-case-ids="461479,7858876" data-case-paths="/pa/543/0164-01,/a2d/670/0128-01">670 A.2d 128</a>, 131 (1995); <em>Commonwealth v. Tarbert, </em><a href="/pa/517/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="517 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1809842" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0277-01">517 Pa. 277</a>, <a href="/pa/517/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="517 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1809842" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0277-01">535 A.2d 1035</a>, 1038 (1987) (indicating that “the driver and passengers do not forfeit all reasonable expectation of privacy, and may not be subjected to unfettered governmental intrusion”); <em>see also Wyoming v. Houghton, </em><a href="/us/526/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="526 U.S. 295" data-case-ids="11133135" data-case-paths="/us/526/0295-01">526 U.S. 295</a>, 303, <a href="/us/526/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="526 U.S. 295" data-case-ids="11133135" data-case-paths="/us/526/0295-01">119 S.Ct. 1297</a>, <a href="/us/526/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="526 U.S. 295" data-case-ids="11133135" data-case-paths="/us/526/0295-01">143 L.Ed.2d 408</a> (1999) (noting that passengers possess the same “reduced expectation of privacy” in vehicles as drivers). Indeed, we have repeatedly indicated that the focus of the inquiry in such situations is not whether the person has a property right in the area searched, but rather, focuses on the person’s legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched. <em>Commonwealth v. Ardestani, </em><a href="/pa/558/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="558 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="838543" data-case-paths="/pa/558/0191-01">558 Pa. 191</a>, <a href="/a2d/736/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="736 A.2d 552" data-case-ids="11575860,838543" data-case-paths="/a2d/736/0552-01,/pa/558/0191-01">736 A.2d 552</a> (1999). Read in this light, this case stands for the limited proposition that, similar to Appellant Williams in <em>Commonwealth v. Torres, </em><a href="/pa/564/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="564 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1276824" data-case-paths="/pa/564/0086-01">564 Pa. 86</a>, <a href="/a2d/764/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="764 A.2d 532" data-case-ids="11164461,1276824" data-case-paths="/a2d/764/0532-01,/pa/564/0086-01">764 A.2d 532</a>, 543 (2001), Appellant did not establish a subjective expectation of privacy in the vehicle. Thus, he is not entitled to relief on his suppression motion.</p>
