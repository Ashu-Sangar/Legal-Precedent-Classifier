      <em>Brakeman </em>addressed the enforceability of an insurance policy’s provision which required the insured to provide written notice of an accident to the insurer “as soon as practicable” after the accident. This Court held “where an insurance company seeks to be relieved of its obligations under a liability insurance policy on the ground of late notice, the insurance company will be required to prove that the notice provision was in fact breached and that the breach resulted in prejudice to its position.” <em><a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/pa/472/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="472 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1727725" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0066-01">at 198</a>.

The requirement was not imposed by a statutory scheme to further a public policy interest, but was drafted by the insurer to protect its own interest in being able to conduct timely investigations of claims. <em>See Brakeman, </em>at 197. The notice provision in <em>Brakeman </em>required the insured to report the accident to the insurer, whereas § 1702 requires reporting to the police or other proper governmental authority, agents independent from the insurer itself.

She overlooks the fact that, unlike <em>Brakeman, </em>which only required the insurer be notified, the instant policy requires <em>police </em>notification, just as the MVFRL does.

Furthermore, to the extent there is any conflict between the policy and the MVFRL: “ ‘stipulations in a contract of insurance in conflict with, or repugnant to, statutory provisions which are applicable to, and consequently form a part of, the contract, must yield to the statute, and are invalid, since contracts cannot change existing statutory laws.’ ” <em>Prudential Properly and Casualty Insurance Company v.

As the Superior Court held in <em>Owens </em>and <em>Blazquez, </em>§ 1702’s fraud prevention is not achieved by reporting to employers or other agencies which do not investigate accidents, care for accident victims, or ensure highway safety; the police are charged with reporting and investigating accidents and are “in a unique position to prevent fraud.... ” <em>Owens, </em>at 753; <em>see also Blazquez, </em>at 387 (“[G]overnmental agencies which are proper repositories for reporting under the MVFRL are those that care for victims of accidents such as governmental fire and rescue squads, those agencies which investigate accidents such as law enforcement, and those agencies charged with the safety of the roads and highways, such as PennDOT.” (citation omitted)).</p>

Similarly, Section 1718(a), “Exclusion from benefits,” provides that an insurer shall exclude an insured from certain benefits when the conduct of the insured contributed to the injury sustained in specified ways, such as intentional injury. Moreover, and directly applicable to the provision of uninsured motorist coverage, Section 1731(d), “Limitation on recovery [of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage,]” categorically denies recovery of underinsured motorist benefits for persons who have recovered damages under uninsured motorist coverage and recovery of non-economic damages under uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage when the individual would not be able to recover non-economic damages pursuant to Section 1705 (relating to the election of limited tort).
