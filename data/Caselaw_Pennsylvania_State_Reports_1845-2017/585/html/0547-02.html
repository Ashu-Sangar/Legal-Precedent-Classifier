Angelina and James also had defensive stab wounds on their hands and/or arms. Based on the physical findings of the autopsy and the visual and auditory accounts provided by eyewitnesses, the medical examiner estimated the time of death of all three victims was between 11:00 p.m. on Tuesday, September 20, 1983, and 2:00 a.m. on Wednesday September 21, 1983.</p>

One neighbor, who was walking his dog at approximately 11:00 p.m. September 20, observed Victor standing in the kitchen doorway of the Lunario home and heard Angelina call to him. Another neighbor, Linda Sinkevich, was startled by her dog barking at 11:45 p.m. <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>and, upon looking out of her window, observed a powder blue car with a shiny grill and hood ornament parked close to her own car. Her husband also saw this vehicle when he arrived home between 2:15 and 2:30 a.m. on September 21. Both witnesses stated the vehicle was gone by 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Sinkevich subsequently identified a car shown to her in a photograph as the one she saw in front of her house, and also identified a car at a State Police garage as the one she saw on the night of the murders. The vehicle in the photograph and in the garage belonged to Appellant.</p>

Between 1:20 a.m. and 1:25 a.m., Pauline Stroka heard a noise, and when she walked onto her porch to investigate, heard Angelina scream “Oh my God, no.” Ms. Stroka, who knew James had been ill, did not call the police because she assumed something had happened to him. Based upon these observations the police were able to narrow the time of the murders to between 1:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. on September 21.</p>

Police inspection of the crime scene also uncovered substantial amounts of money, including $12,296 in cash. The Lunarios kept their cash in envelopes, which they hid in drawers, photo albums, and boxes, and maintained a record of their money by keeping a running tally on the front of the envelopes. While inspecting the home, the police discovered empty envelopes with notations on the front indicating that they had once contained a total of over $4000, which the police concluded had been stolen by the intruder.</p>

In the early 1980’s, Martin married the DeGrazio’s daughter, Mary, and while living in the DeGrazio’s home, had <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>befriended Victor. During their friendship, Victor allowed Martin access to a strongbox, which contained thick envelopes consisting of $100 bills, and lent money to Martin. Thus, Martin knew that the Lunarios had envelopes of cash hidden throughout their house. Just before the murders, Martin had a falling out with Victor that essentially ended their friendship.</p>
    <p id="b701-4" data-blocks='[["BL_701.5",701,[195,704,1154,965]]]'>The murder investigation revealed that five months prior to the Lunario murders, on April 21, 1983, Appellant was charged with rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent and aggravated assault, terroristic threats, and recklessly endangering another person.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Following his arrest for these charges, Appellant retained counsel, Attorney Brier, who demanded payment of a retainer to represent Appellant in proceedings related to these crimes. It was the Commonwealth’s theory at trial that Appellant’s financial obligation to Attorney Brier provided a motive for the murder and robbery of the Lunarios. Another brother of Appellant, Robert D. Chmiel (hereafter Robert), and Appellant’s sister, Nancy Chmiel Moran (hereafter Nancy), confirmed that Appellant needed money to pay his defense attorney. When Appellant told Martin he needed “fast money” to pay his lawyer, Martin informed Appellant about Victor’s strongbox of cash and envelopes of money, and Martin and Appellant agreed to burglarize the Lunario home.</p>

Martin also described to Appellant the layout of the Lunario home. Martin, however, later told police that he subsequently changed his mind because Victor was his friend and he feared he may be seen by his in-laws, who lived next door. Thus, Martin backed out of the plan.</p>

When Appellant returned to the construction site from gathering supplies, Martin confronted Appellant about the murders. Appellant initially denied any involvement. Later that afternoon, however, Appellant admitted to Martin that he had murdered the Lunarios. Appellant also provided Martin with a detailed account of what had transpired that night.</p>

Specifically, Appellant told Martin that he had tried to enter the Lunarios’ home via the cellar door, but upon finding it locked, proceeded to enter the home through the rear door on the first floor. Once inside the home, Angelina, who was sitting on the couch in the living room, cried out, so Appellant killed her to silence her. Appellant told Martin that James also attempted to scream from his hospital bed on the first floor, and Appellant killed him as well. Appellant then proceeded up the stairs to the second floor, where he killed Victor in his bed. Appellant advised Martin that he stole $4,500.00 from the strongbox and $800 from Angelina’s purse. Appellant also searched for money under the cushions of the sofa Angelina had been sitting on, and then straightened <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>Angelina’s slumped body into an upright position. Appellant informed Martin that he placed the stolen money in a pillow case he obtained from the Lunario home. After committing the murders and searching the premises for cash, Appellant drove to Martin’s home, but was advised by Martin’s wife, Mary, that Martin was not home. Later, upon reading a news account of the murders that discussed the substantial sums of money recovered by the police, Appellant told Martin that “it would have been nice to get that” because “as it stands, I only got $1700 for each of them.” N.T., 8/26/02, at 33-34.</p>

Martin initially denied any involvement with or knowledge of the Lunario murders. Upon being confronted by the police with a photograph depicting him wearing the sweater that was used to make the mask, however, Martin informed police of Appellant’s confession to him.

Police ruled out Martin’s involvement in the murders by independently verifying his alibi with several impartial sources. According to Martin, he spent the early morning hours of September 21, 1983, with his brother-in-law Mr. Buffton, whom the Lackawanna County Association of Retarded Citizens (ARC) employed to keep watch for brush fires occurring on East Mountain in Scranton, twenty-five minutes from the Lunario home in Throop. Scranton Fire Chief and ARC employees confirmed Martin’s alibi for that time period.</p>

On October 29, 1984, a jury found Appellant guilty of three counts of murder of the first-degree, two counts of robbery, one count of burglary, and two counts of theft by unlawful taking. Following completion of the penalty phase of trial, the jury sentenced Appellant to death. Appellant filed counseled post-trial motions as well as a pro <em>se </em>petition alleging that Attorney Kennedy had been ineffective for, <em>inter alia, </em>making no effort to locate alibi witnesses, discouraging him from taking the stand, and failing to request an accomplice instruc<a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>tion as to Martin’s testimony. The trial court appointed new counsel, stayed the post-trial motions, and held an evidentiary hearing (treated as a hearing pursuant to the then-effective Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9551) on the ineffectiveness claims. Following the hearing, at which Attorney Kennedy testified, the trial court denied the motions for a new trial and for PCHA relief and formally imposed the sentence of death. On direct appeal, this Court reversed Appellant’s conviction on grounds that Attorney Kennedy had been ineffective for failing to request an accomplice witness instruction regarding Martin’s testimony. <em>Chmiel I, </em>639 A.2d at 9.</p>

Prior to trial, Appellant filed an omnibus motion requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court preclude the use at trial of the testimony given by Attorney Kennedy at the 1988 PCHA evidentiary hearing on the basis that this testimony had impermissibly disclosed confidential attorney-client communications by revealing that Appellant had told him more than one version of events and of his whereabouts on the night of the murders. <em>See Chmiel II, </em>738 A.2d at 409. The trial court denied the motion. Accordingly, during the second trial, the prosecution introduced testimony provided by Attorney Kennedy during the prior PCHA hearing. On March 2, 1995, a second jury found Appellant guilty of three counts of murder in the first-degree, two counts of robbery, and one count of burglary. At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury sentenced Appellant to death. On August 19, 1999, on direct appeal to this Court, we reversed Appellant’s second conviction on the basis that the testimony of Attorney Kennedy from the PCHA hearing should not have been admitted into evidence during Appellant’s second trial because the use of that testimony violated Appellant’s right against compelled self-incrimination and his right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Chmiel II, </em>738 A.2d at 413.</p>

The jury further found the following mitigating circumstances: (1) the absence of a significant history of prior criminal convictions, and (2) “other evidence of mitigation” as a result of his family relationships and abusive upbringing.

There is a difference between an identification of a defendant and of an inanimate object. The due process concerns implicated in identification of a defendant are not implicated in the identification of a vehicle. Identification of an accused tends to be direct proof of the case against him, while that of an inanimate object is only indirect proof of the defendant’s guilt.

To respond adequately, Appellant argues that he would have faced compulsion to disclose to the jury that he had exercised his right against self-incrimination. Appellant argues that the unfair prejudice caused by his inability to respond fairly to the question and explain his confusion without waiving a constitutionally protected right outweighed the probative value of the post-Mircroda, pre-exercise statement and the trial court erred in failing to preclude all of Appellant’s post-arrest statements. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 403 (“Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”).

This attorney, Attorney Brier, had represented Appellant on the rape charges. It was central to the Commonwealth’s case that Appellant’s motive for the Lunario burglary was to obtain “fast money” to pay Attorney Brier. To this end, the prosecutor introduced Martin’s testimony that Appellant’s debt to Attorney Brier was the impetus for the crime. Appellant attempted to refute this theory by testifying that Attorney Brier had quoted him a fee of $5000, which Appellant had partially paid. Thus, Appellant attempted to demonstrate that there was no urgency for him to acquire money. Over defense objection, the prosecutor called Attorney Brier to the stand to give his version of the fee arrangement with Appellant. Attorney Brier testified that Appellant retained him in the spring of 1983 “to represent him in a legal matter” for which his fee was $10,000, not $5000, of which $7000 remained due and unpaid. N.T., 9/5/2002, at 163. Appellant asserts that this testimony violated the attorney-client privilege and that he never waived this privilege. Appellant argues he was prejudiced by this testimony because it misled and confused the jury. In this regard, Appellant argues that other than Martin’s statement that Appellant needed “fast money,” there was no connection between Attorney Brier’s testimony and the murder of the Lunarios and the testimony’s purpose was merely to sow confusion. As evidence of this purpose, Appellant notes that there was no link between Attorney Brier’s representation and the murders because the attorney remained unpaid even after the murders.</p>

Appellant has not demonstrated an abuse of trial court discretion in allowing Attorney Brier’s testimony. Moreover, it was certainly relevant that Appellant had a sizeable outstanding debt. Appellant’s attempt to negate the relevance by emphasizing the fact that his attorney remained unpaid after the murders is unpersuasive: whether he actually gave the proceeds of the crime to his attorney is immaterial.

Trial counsel testified to being surprised by this turn of events, and intended to dispatch their private investigator to retrieve Nina so she could testify. Appellant, however, prevented them from doing so, and advised his counsel that he was worried about how his daughter was handling the strain of the trial and did not want to put additional pressure on her.

On appeal, this Court held that this line of questioning — and in particular the prosecutor’s reference to Appellant’s discussions with his prior attorney-violated Appellant’s right to the effective assistance of counsel and to be protected against compelled self-incrimination. <em>Commonwealth v.

By forbidding the prosecutor from referencing any discussions that Appellant had with his prior attorney, the trial court’s ruling below very clearly recognized <em>Chmiel II’s </em>underlying concern, and in my mind effectively removed it from this case.

      <em> </em>The tendency of this evidence, which was incorporated into the penalty phase of trial, to show Appellant’s continuing dangerousness was enhanced by the Commonwealth’s presentation of the factual underpinnings of a violent rape in aggravation at the penalty hearing, and the prosecuting deputy attorney general’s commentary concerning death as a “solution” to Appellant’s status as a killer “beyond the realm,” as well as his repeated references to Appellant’s “thirst[] after the bliss of the knife” and blood lust.
