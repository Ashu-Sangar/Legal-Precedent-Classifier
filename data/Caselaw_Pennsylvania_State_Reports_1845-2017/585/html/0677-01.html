Once, most members lived within walking distance, but now most do not live close to the church. During the 1980s, Wesley had 300 to 400 members, with 200 actively attending services; since 1989, after the parcels for the parking lot were purchased and available for use by church members, the membership increased to more than 700 members, with 350 attending services. Testimony established limited off-street parking exists near the church; most on-street parking spaces are used by neighborhood residents. The Church contended the parking lots are an integral part of its operation, and that without them, membership would decline to the point that sustaining its ministry financially or spiritually would not be feasible.</p>

Starting with the facts, <em>Second Church </em>is on all fours.

The Pennsylvania Constitution in relevant part, however, has not. Therefore, <em>Second Church </em>remains the law and is controlling. Simply put, under its teaching, a tax exemption to the Church for its parking lot is violative of Article VIII, Section 2(a)(i) of the Pennsylvania Constitution and Section 204 of the General County Assessment Law.</p>

Before the Constitution of 1874 was adopted, the General Assembly was free to grant exemptions from taxation without restriction, and did so with some frequency. During the debates that took place at the Convention to Amend the Constitution, the delegates sought to end the practice of special tax exemption legislation by defining the General <a id="p682" href="#p682" data-label="682" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*682</a>Assembly’s authority to grant tax exemptions with specificity. 6 Debates of the Convention to Amend the Constitution of Pennsylvania 93 (1873). As to an exemption from taxation for church properties, some delegates at the Convention were of the opinion that no such exemption was in order while others believed that an exemption for churches, parsonages owned by churches, and attached lands up to five acres was desirable. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94. After discussion, the delegates voted to give the legislature the authority to grant exemption from taxation to "actual places of religious worship.” <em>Id. </em>at 93-98.</p>
