Also, while he noted that Barcelona had some bruising and lacerations on his forehead which occurred prior to death and which could not have been caused by the impact upon falling from the bridge, he also stated that they could have been sustained after Barcelona fell into the creek but prior to his drowning.

However, the trial judge rejected Appellee’s argument, instead relying on <em>Boykin </em>to conclude that “[i]t is sufficient” to establish corpus delicti “if these circumstances are consistent with crime even though they are also consistent- with accident or suicide.” (R.R. at 259a)(citing <em>Boykin, </em><a href="/pa/450/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="450 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1947098" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0025-01">450 Pa. at 29</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=298%20A.2d%20258" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="298 A.2d 258">298 A.2d at 261</a>).

The Commonwealth maintains that the Superior Court ignored certain pieces of evidence tending to establish that Barcelona's death was not accidental—namely, his mother’s testimony that he was afraid of water and heights; the condition of the railroad bridge, which was so hazardous that Barcelona would never have attempted to cross it; the fact that persons seeing Barcelona on the night of the alleged homicide did not observe any bruising on his face; and the testimony of a woman who saw a male carrying a box away from the area of the burglary site and toward the railroad bridge at about 5 a.m. on February 24. However, none of this evidence makes it more likely than not that Barcelona’s death was the result of criminal activity. First, Barcelona’s mother admitted that she did not observe Barcelona during his night walks, and others testified that they saw Barcelona on or near the town bridge at about the time of the alleged homicide. Second, Barcelona was known to engage in hazardous and irrational conduct, and the <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>condition of the railroad bridge makes it more likely that, if he attempted to cross this bridge, his fall from the bridge was <em>accidental. </em>Third, the fact that no one saw Barcelona with bruises or lacerations in the hours prior to his alleged homicide has no bearing on whether these bruises or lacerations were inflicted by an assailant in the act of homicide. Finally, the testimony of the woman made absolutely no connection between the male, who she was unable to identify, and Barcelona.</p>

I write separately only to further elucidate my understanding of the majority’s holding respecting the interplay between the decisions in <em>Commonwealth v. Boykin, </em><a href="/pa/450/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="450 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1947098" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0025-01">450 Pa. 25</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=298%20A.2d%20258" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="298 A.2d 258">298 A.2d 258</a> (1972) and <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>
      <em>Commonwealth v. Byrd, </em><a href="/pa/490/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="490 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="1763816" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0544-01">490 Pa. 544</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="490 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="1763816" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0544-01">417 A.2d 173</a> (1980). My understanding of that holding is that <em>Boykin </em>merely stands for the proposition that, for purposes of determining the admissibility of an extra-judicial inculpatory statement of the accused, the <em>corpus delicti </em>is established if there is evidence, independent of that inculpatory statement, which is consistent, but not merely equal, with both accident and criminality; and that the court’s later holding in <em>Byrd, </em>that the evidence must be more consistent with criminality than with accident before extra-judicial inculpatory statements of the accused may be admitted, is no more than a refinement of the <em>Boykin </em>standard.</p>
