On December 21,1990, at or about 2:00 p.m., Detective Renee Kacsuta of the Pittsburgh Police Department met with a confidential informant for the purpose of making an undercover buy of narcotics. The informant drove Kacsuta to Mt. Pleasant Street in <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>the Northview Heights section of Pittsburgh. According to Kacsuta, the seller, whom she later identified as the Appellant,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> approached the informant’s vehicle and leaned down toward the car window. Kacsuta testified that she leaned forward and greeted the seller. Thereafter the seller discussed with the informant a sale of a “bundle” of heroin. After quoting a price of $180, the seller walked up the street approximately fifty feet, where he met with an individual later identified as Keith Lee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Lee handed something to the seller, whereupon, the seller returned to the vehicle and handed to Kacsuta a plastic baggie containing fifteen balloons filled with heroin. In return, Kacsuta paid the seller the agreed price of $180. This entire episode lasted approximately fifteen minutes, during which Kacsuta was able to observe the seller’s appearance.</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[253,1142,1151,521]]]'>Immediately following the drug transaction, according to Detective Kacsuta, the informant told Kacsuta that the seller was Nathaniel Roebuck. Upon returning to police headquarters, Kacsuta entered the name of “Nathaniel Roebuck” into the BCI computer and received a description which matched that of the man whom she had observed during the drug transaction. Kacsuta also removed a photograph of Nathaniel Roebuck from the police identification office, and this she also identified as a photograph of the man from whom she and the informant had purchased the heroin.</p>

Pleasant Street, together with the informant, for the purpose of making another purchase of heroin from the seller. On this occasion, Kacsuta was driving her own vehicle and the informant was riding as a passenger. Upon their arrival at Mt. Pleasant Street, the seller approached the driver’s side of the vehicle and asked Kacsuta what she wanted. When Kacsuta told the seller she wanted a “bundle,” he replied that the price had gone up to $190. When Kacsuta <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>responded affirmatively, the seller conferred with a man who was later identified as Albert Austin.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Austin then entered two separate apartment buildings, and, upon emerging from the second building, approached Kacsuta’s vehicle and handed her a bundle of fifteen balloons which were filled with heroin.

Appellant filed a pretrial discovery motion seeking disclosure of the confidential informant who had participated in the two undercover drug transactions which had led to his arrest. Appellant alleged that his defense at trial would be mistaken identification and expressed the belief that the informant’s testimony might be helpful. At a pre-trial hearing on this motion, Appellant testified that, on the day prior to his arrest on the instant drug charges, he had been picked up by police and questioned regarding an unrelated shooting incident because he had been misidentified by the victim of that shooting. Appellant also related an additional incident in which an acquaintance of his, Ivy Edwards, had observed in a police station a “wanted” poster which had Appellant’s picture on it, but which contained the name and description of another individual. Following the pre-trial hearing, the Court denied Appellant’s motion for disclosure of the identity of the informant.</p>

Appellant also called Albert Austin as a witness, and he admitted his participation in the transaction of January 23,1991, but denied that the other man had been Appellant. After hearing all the testimony, the jury rejected Appellant’s defense of misidentification and found him guilty of all charges.</p>

In support of his theory of misidentification, he offered testimony at the pretrial hearing that on the day he was arrested for the present charges he had been misidentified to the police by a person who accused Appellant of shooting him.

At trial, Appellant testified, and denied being present at the transaction or having ever met Detective Kacsuta. Albert Austin, who admittedly was present at, and involved in the transaction on January 23, and subsequently pleaded guilty to possession, delivery and conspiracy based on his participation therein, testified at Appellant’s trial that Appellant was not present or involved in any way with that transaction.

The majority, however, ignores the record which demonstrates that appellant and Detective Kacsuta were not the only witnesses to the crimes. In fact, Keith Lee witnessed and participated in the first transaction and thereby would have been in a position to confirm or dispel appellant’s participation. Indeed, appellant himself concedes that Lee was <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>present at the first transaction.

Within one hour of that transaction, the detective entered appellant’s name into the BCI computer and obtained a description and photograph of appellant which the detective concluded matched the person from whom she had just purchased heroin. Indeed, when <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>questioned about the second transaction, the detective testified that she immediately recognized appellant as being the same person from whom she purchased heroin the month before and the same person in the BCI photograph.</p>

This unfortunate conclusion places yet another insurmountable obstacle in the path of effective law enforcement to combat the scourge of drugs in Pennsylvania’s beleaguered communities. By this decision, the majority effectively eliminates the use of confidential informants to make drug buys by a police officer acting in tandem with a confidential informant. The majority may blithely ignore the violence and mayhem surrounding the drug trafficking in our communities, but those who wish to aid the police in their enforcement efforts will now do so only at their own peril.
