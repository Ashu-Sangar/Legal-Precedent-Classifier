    <p id="b623-10" data-blocks='[["BL_623.11",623,[191,1479,1150,529]]]'>The appellant, Robert Donald Auker, was convicted of murder of the first degree and kidnapping of his former wife, Lori Ann Auker, by a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Northumberland County. At the sentencing phase, the jury returned a verdict of death. The Court of Common Pleas imposed a death sentence in addition to a consecutive sentence of ten to twenty years for kidnapping. The present direct appeal ensued. Although we affirm Appellant’s convictions, we vacate the sentence of death and remand for a new sentencing hearing.</p>

    </p>
    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[246,385,1148,459]]]'>The body was discovered on a hot day, June 12, 1989, by a young woman who was walking down a dirt road near the home of her grandparents. She smelled an odor, investigated and saw a badly decomposed body clad in a jacket, jeans and sneakers. She rushed back home and her family contacted the police. Deputy Coroner Matthew Olley pronounced the body dead and the body was transported to the morgue pending the autopsy by Dr. Isidore Mihalakis, a forensic pathologist.</p>
    <p id="b624-6" data-blocks='[["BL_624.6",624,[243,868,1149,512]]]'>Dr. Mihalakis opined that the cause of death was homicide. He observed holes in the victim’s jacket that continued through the sweater underneath, which were consistent with between seven and ten knife stab wounds in the back and chest area. He concluded the wounds would have impacted the vital organs; however, since the body was essentially skeletonized at the time of the viewing, he could examine no organs because they had disappeared either from insect or decomposition activity. Dr. Mihalakis also turned over scalp hair samples to the police for analysis.</p>
    <p id="b624-7" data-blocks='[["BL_624.7",624,[239,1402,1151,302]]]'>Dr. Mihalakis further confirmed the approximate date of death through the use of an entomological expert, Dr. K.C. Kim, whose specialty is the classification and identification of insects and parasites of humans and animals. Dr. Mihalakis collected samples of the various insects present on and within the corpse for analysis and Dr. Kim examined the insects.</p>
    <p id="b624-8" data-blocks='[["BL_624.8",624,[235,1728,1152,513]]]'>Dr. Kim testified that the presence and relative maturity of insects allowed him to estimate the approximate time of death. He testified that different decomposition stages attract different types of insects. He also explained that ambient air temperature and physical site (open field, shaded locale or aquatic area) also affect the rate of maturity of insects. In determining the approximate decomposition period, Dr. Kim utilized a climate report from the national weather service, description of the autopsy and description of the scene where the corpse was discovered.</p>
    <p id="b624-9" data-blocks='[["BL_624.9",624,[233,2265,1146,96]],["BL_625.1",625,[183,324,1150,314]]]'>When Dr. Kim testified, he identified samples of the insects found on the victim.

Dr. Kim concluded that accounting for the average mean temperature during the time the corpse had been missing, the maturity of the various insects present and the stages of decomposition at which certain insects would be present, the body had been decaying nineteen days to twenty-five days.</p>

Lori lived with her son and her two cats at the home of her parents, Richard and Ruth Auman. She had been living with them since her separation from appellant in October, 1988. At the time of Lori’s disappearance, her son was with appellant for a one-week visitation. Ruth Auman last saw Lori at 3:30 p.m. on May 24 as Lori left home, driving a brown 1976 Pontiac LeMans, for her job at a pet store near the Bon Ton entrance of the Susquehanna Mall. At 4:00 p.m., Lori’s supervisor called to ask whether Lori was coming to work. Mr. and Mrs. Auman then went to look for Lori, in case she may have had car trouble between home and the mall. When they arrived at the mall, they found Lori’s locked car parked near the entrance to her place of employment. Mr. Auman then reported to the state police that Lori was missing.</p>

Lori was divorcing appellant and was involved in a bitter child custody and support dispute with him. Two to three weeks before her disappearance, Lori’s mother had discovered two shotguns <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>under Lori’s bed. Lori explained they were there to protect her if appellant came while her parents were not home and tried to take her son. Lori’s friend, Mindy Eroh, also testified that Lori carried mace in her pocketbook in case appellant attacked her and that she was aware Lori kept guns under her bed.</p>
    <p id="b626-5" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[254,649,1146,411]]]'>Laurel Gehers, Lori’s work supervisor, testified that in the few weeks preceding her disappearance, Lori was afraid that appellant would hurt her. On numerous occasions during that period, appellant would appear in front of the pet store and Lori would run to the back room of the store, stating, “Bob’s here, cover for me!” She would continue to hide until he departed. Ms. Gehers stated that this behavior increased near the time of Lori’s disappearance.</p>
    <p id="b626-6" data-blocks='[["BL_626.6",626,[249,1083,1149,560]]]'>Lynn Cookson, one of Lori’s co-workers, testified that Lori told her about her fear of appellant and about her guns. Close to the time of Lori’s disappearance, Ms. Cookson would help Lori leave work by watching Lori from her car because appellant would often wait for her. Lori had told Ms. Cook-son about appellant’s statement shortly before Lori’s disappearance that “if he could not have her [Lori], no one else can.” Lori had also told Ms. Cookson about the guns under her bed. And, Ms. Cookson corroborated the testimony of Ms. Gehers regarding Lori’s reaction to appellant’s appearance in front of the store.</p>
    <p id="b626-7" data-blocks='[["BL_626.7",626,[247,1675,1149,411]]]'>Malcolm Derk was dating Lori and testified that he would escort her in the evening to her car because she was afraid of appellant being around. Two nights before Lori’s disappearance, Derk met her at 9:00 p.m. to walk her to her car. When Lori spotted appellant in appellant’s car next to her parked car, Lori and Derk left the mall in Derk’s car. They returned an hour later to find appellant still there. The couple then returned at 11:30 p.m. and appellant had departed.</p>

Appellant lived <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>with Mr. and Mrs. Donald Auker, both adoptive parents of appellant. According to Mrs. Auker, appellant drove their Celebrity on May 24 and arrived home between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. Mr. Auker was displeased that appellant drove the car on May 24 because he was not permitted or insured to use the Celebrity. The next day, Mr. Auker decided to trade the car for a truck and did so on May 27. Harry Hartman, husband of appellant’s natural mother, resided across the street from the Auker residence and testified that appellant used the Celebrity on May 24 and that he observed appellant on May 25 “meticulously” vacuuming the passenger side of the front of the Celebrity and vacuuming and scrubbing its trunk, which struck him as unusual behavior for appellant.</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[189,1076,1150,698]]]'>The Celebrity was traded to Jack Miller, a local car salesman, on May 27, and only Miller and Ray Benner were inside the vehicle before it was wholesaled to Todd Brosious, owner of Todd’s Auto Sales, on May 27. The car was sent to be cleaned; however, the cleaners needed only to vacuum the vehicle for foot dirt. After cleaning, Todd Brosious took the vehicle to the local auction and, on June 8, Jim Eby bought it for a friend who by coincidence was a state trooper. The trooper cooperated with the state police’s request of the vehicle for analysis. All who had been inside the vehicle from the time of trade provided hair samples to ensure that none of their hair would be confused with the hair of appellant or the victim.</p>

The hairs were similar to those of Lori Auker. Hairs from Lori’s cats were found in the trunk area and on the appellant’s Velcro splint which he wore on the date of Lori’s disappearance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The cat hairs were an identical match.

The machine had a security camera that photographed the location directly in front of it at ten-second intervals. At 3:47.24 p.m., the tape displayed a woman wearing clothing like the victim’s clothing walking from the area where her car had been parked toward the mall. In the next frame, taken at 3:47.34 p.m., the same woman was leaning into an open front passenger door of a vehicle that had pulled across her path and was stopped with its brake lights on in the wrong lane of travel. No other frame of film showed the woman or the car on May 24.</p>
    <p id="b628-6" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[236,996,1152,633]]]'>The incident was reenacted and a process known as digital image enhancement<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> was used to support the Commonwealth’s argument that the car in the video was the Celebrity appellant had used on May 24. The bank permitted the use of the video camera in a reenactment of the incident using the Celebrity. Through the assistance of specialists, the Commonwealth compared the videos of the May 24 incident with the reenacted incident in both unenhanced and enhanced format. A Chevrolet representative testified that the vehicles depicted in the original and the reenactment photos appeared to be Chevrolet Celebrities within certain production years including 1984.</p>

On June 14 and 15, 1989, within two and three days of the victim’s discovery, appellant contacted the insurance company and advised that the policy had been improperly issued, as it should have had spousal coverage. Wards noted the error and reissued the policy with coverage for the spouse. Appellant did not inform Wards of Lori’s death in the telephone calls, even though he had been informed of the discovery of Lori’s body on June 12. Appellant waited until June 23 to do so.

Experts testified that the cause of death was unnatural due to the remote location and the position and condition of the body, that the manner of death was homicide and that the possible date of death included May 24, the day that Lori Auker disappeared. Dr. Mihalakis observed holes in the jacket and sweater which he concluded were between seven and ten knife stab wounds in the back and chest area. He concluded that the wounds would have impacted the vital organs; however, no examination could occur because the organs had disappeared either from insect activity or decomposition.

The car in the video was like the 1984 Celebrity appellant had used without his parents’ permission on May 24. On May 25, appellant “meticulously” vacuumed the passenger side of the front of the Celebrity and vacuumed and scrubbed its trunk.

The record reflects that appellant failed to disclose the identity of some witnesses to counsel and disclosed the identities of the others a day before trial was to begin. In all cases, appellant was unable to show that the witnesses had something to offer to help the defense. With respect to witnesses not called, appellant has failed to demonstrate that the testimony of any of these witnesses would have been helpful to his defense. Further, appellant’s claims weaken even more by what the trial court called appellant’s “ever changing story as to what occurred on the day in question” which resulted in counsel’s unwillingness to participate in appellant’s deceptions. Finally, when appellant assumed defense of his case at one point in the trial, calling several witnesses on his own behalf, the court even recessed to allow the state police to go out and find a witness desired by appellant; It later asked if appellant desired to call any further witnesses and he indicated that he <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>did not.

The record reflects that Forgas’ testimony would have gone to the evidence surrounding the Chevrolet Celebrity parked in the mall parking lot. Expert testimony at trial identified the vehicle in the parking lot as a Chevrolet Celebrity but did not conclude that the vehicle was the same Celebrity as the one driven by appellant. Trial counsel need not introduce expert testimony on his client’s behalf if he is able effectively to cross-examine witnesses and elicit helpful testimony. <em>Commonwealth v.

Failure by counsel to conduct a more intensive investigation, in the absence of any indication that such investigation would develop more than was already known, is not error.

Also, the record reflects that counsel would not take certain alibi evidence to the district attorney because he viewed them as “stories” and to do so would have violated counsel’s rules of professional conduct.

Torture is the intentional infliction of a considerable amount of pain and suffering on a victim which is unnecessarily heinous, atrocious or cruel manifesting exceptional depravity. <em>Commonwealth v. Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/522/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="522 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1818950" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0256-01">522 Pa. 256</a>, 277, <a href="/pa/522/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="522 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1818950" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0256-01">561 A.2d 699</a>, 709 (1989). There must be an indication that the killer was not satisfied with the killing alone. <em>Commonwealth v. Edmiston, </em><a href="/pa/535/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="535 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1841472" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0210-01">535 Pa. 210</a>, 236, <a href="/pa/535/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="535 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1841472" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0210-01">634 A.2d 1078</a>, 1091 (1993). Torture includes the infliction of <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>intense pain to punish or coerce someone; it is torment or agony or anguish of body or mind. <em>Commonwealth v. Nelson, </em><a href="/pa/514/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="514 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1804591" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0262-01">514 Pa. 262</a>, 279, <a href="/pa/514/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="514 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1804591" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0262-01">523 A.2d 728</a>, 737 (1987).</p>
    <p id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.5",645,[162,522,1150,768]]]'>I believe the record belies the majority’s conclusion that the Commonwealth failed to prove torture as an aggravating circumstance. The record reflects that: Lori Auker was forcibly placed in appellant’s car, as shown by the presence of Lori’s hair in the door jamb; she was forcibly placed in the trunk of the car, as shown by the presence of her cat’s hair in the trunk; and she was subjected to the fear, anguish, and physical punishment of having to ride in appellant’s trunk. There was no evidence that Lori was dead before reaching the site, as no blood was found in the car or in the trunk. Further, there was no evidence that the victim immediately died from the numerous, painful stab wounds, so the jury could reasonably have inferred that Lori Auker was left alone to bleed to death and suffer greatly in the steep ravine.</p>
    <p id="b645-6" data-blocks='[["BL_645.6",645,[159,1334,1152,368]]]'>I believe these facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, are sufficient to support beyond a reasonable doubt the jury’s finding that the murder was committed by means of torture. The majority’s contrary conclusion, I believe, reflects the personal views of the justices rather than a proper application of our appellate standard of review.</p>
