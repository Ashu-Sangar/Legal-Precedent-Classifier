Identical charges arising from a separate incident were brought against him in a second information. In a third information, the defendant was charged with harassment, disorderly conduct, and retail theft. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the defendant pled guilty to the theft charges contained in the first and second informations as well as the harassment and disorderly conduct charges in the third information.

In interpreting the language of 18 Pa.C.S. § 109(3), Rosario maintains that the prosecution of a defendant is barred in all cases where a guilty plea has been accepted by the court except in those instances in which the defendant requests withdrawal of the plea. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b101-7" data-blocks='[["BL_101.7",101,[156,1947,1153,422]]]'>Section 109(3) bars the prosecution of defendant in instances in which a prior prosecution resulted in a conviction. For purposes of this rule, “[t]here is a conviction if ... a plea of guilty [is] accepted by the court.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 109(3).

Rule 320 provides that “[a]t any time before sentence, the court may, in its discretion, permit or direct a plea of guilty to be withdrawn and a plea of not guilty substituted.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 320. This rule is clear that, absent an abuse of discretion, a trial judge can order the withdrawal of a guilty plea any time prior to sentencing. The use of the disjunctive “or” clearly identifies two situations when the trial judge can withdraw a guilty plea: when requested by the defendant or <em>sua sponte </em>without the defendant’s request. Thus, Rosario’s argument can not prevail if trial judges are to be afforded the discretion conferred by Rule 320 concerning the withdrawal of guilty pleas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Thus, the drafters of the Model Penal Code clearly premised the bar to subsequent prosecution on a guilty plea that remained in effect during the course of a criminal proceeding. Accordingly, we conclude that the language of 18 Pa.C.S. § 109(3), “a plea of guilty accepted by the court,” refers to a guilty plea that continues to remain in effect until the imposition of sentence.
