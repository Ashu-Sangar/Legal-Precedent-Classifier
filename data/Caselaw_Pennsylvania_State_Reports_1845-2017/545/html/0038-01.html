The Commonwealth Court was procedurally correct in not ordering this matter retransferred to the Lycoming County Court of Common Pleas once it determined that it lacked original jurisdiction over Hill's complaint. In <em>Balshy, </em>this Court noted that it disapproved of one court being transferred a case and then attempting to retransfer the matter back to the court where the matter was originally filed because of a lack of jurisdiction. Instead, the proper practice in such cases would be to dismiss the action and for the parties to take an appeal. <em>Balshy, supra, </em>at 388, <a href="/pa/507/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="507 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1792331" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0384-01">490 A.2d at 416</a>.</p>
