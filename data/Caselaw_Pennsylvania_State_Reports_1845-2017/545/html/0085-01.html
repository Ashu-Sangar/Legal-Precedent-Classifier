The court of common pleas affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part an interest arbitration award under Act 111.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As is relevant to this case, the court of common pleas upheld an interest arbitration award which provided that pensions to be received by members of the Nazareth Borough Police Association (“the Association”) be based upon gross (W-2) earnings. This Court granted allocatur limited to the issue of whether pension benefits are to be calculated on the basis of a pensioner’s gross earnings rather than merely that pensioner’s base salary when it is found that there is no inequity between the income-driven bases upon which pension contributions are paid into a plan and upon which pension benefits are paid out to beneficiaries.

Because of this factual difference, we reversed the Commonwealth Court’s finding that the word “salary” in Act 600 encompassed only base pay. <em><a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">at 327</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">586 A.2d at 368</a>. We saw no grounds to treat the various types of compensation differently where “the Borough implicitly acknowledge[d] the similarity between the regularly scheduled work and the additional work” by deducting retirement contributions from base, overtime, and extra work pay. <em><a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">at 328</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">586 A.2d at 368</a>. Our reasoning was based on the premise that “[t]o permit the Borough to require contributions from the overtime and extra work compensation while denying the advantage of the additional compensation in the benefit formula would be inconsistent and inequitable.” <em><a href="/pa/526/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="526 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1825949" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0324-01">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b184-4" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[253,1330,1149,742]]]'>Thus, in <em>Liston, </em>where the employee was not required to make contributions from overtime pay, it was appropriate for the Commonwealth Court to find that the word “salary” encompassed only base pay. However, in cases such as <em>Palyok, </em>where the employee was required to make contributions from overtime and extra work compensation, it would be inequitable not to include overtime and extra work pay in the calculation of monthly pension benefits. Thus, the term “salary” as embodied in Act .600 denotes base salary and excludes other forms of compensation unless the parties through past practice or agreement have expanded this definition. This is consistent with our decision in <em>Palyok. </em>To the extent that the Commonwealth Court ruled that the term “salary” is defined as gross (W-2) earnings, it was in error.</p>
