For the reasons set forth below, we find that the trial court’s award was amply supported by the evidence and, on that basis, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and reinstate the order of the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas awarding counsel fees and costs incurred by appellant Gazey in Gazey’s defense of the original matter. This Court also finds that appellant is <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs which she incurred in connection with the appellate litigation of this baseless negligence action.

    <p id="b704-5" data-blocks='[["BL_704.5",704,[249,658,1152,831]]]'>A summary of the evidence giving rise to the instant dispute is that on June 28, 1988, appellee Janice Thunberg was traveling in the left-hand lane of the westbound lanes of a four-lane divided highway. A car driven by one Howard Strause was also traveling west, but in the right-hand lane. As Thunberg approached, the Strause vehicle allegedly crossed the center line into Thunberg’s lane of travel. Thunberg violently swerved to the left and lost control of her vehicle. As a result of Thunberg’s loss of control over her vehicle, her car skidded across the low medial strip separating westbound traffic from eastbound traffic and entered the eastbound lanes of the highway facing oncoming traffic. There, she crossed the eastbound left-hand lane and entered the eastbound right-hand lane. While driving into oncoming traffic, Thunberg’s car struck John Gazey’s vehicle head-on, killing him and injuring her.</p>

Pa. R. Civ. P. 1007(1). Thunberg thereafter filed a complaint against all defendants, alleging in pertinent part against appellant Gazey that her injuries were caused by the decedent’s negligent operation of his car. In summary, Thunberg’s complaint alleged that Mr. Gazey failed to exercise due care in the operation of his vehicle by, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to maneuver his car in such a manner as to avoid <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>hitting Thunberg’s out-of-control vehicle when it crossed the medial divider and drove directly into oncoming traffic.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

On October 8, 1991, Gazey moved for summary judgment and three days later Thunberg filed a motion to allow withdrawal or amendment of the admissions, accompanied by answers to the request for admissions with a rule to show cause upon Gazey requesting she demonstrate why Thunberg should not be permitted to file the answers. The Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas denied Thunberg’s request to withdraw or amend her admissions, and noted that because she failed to file a brief in opposition to Gazey’s summary judgment motion, Thunberg was deemed not to oppose the motion. After reconsideration, Gazey’s motion for summary judgment was finally granted and Gazey was ultimately dismissed as a defendant in Thunberg’s negligence suit.</p>

On appeal, the Superior Court reversed and vacated the trial court’s order finding that the record was devoid of evidence upon which the trial court could have found that Thunberg instituted her action against Gazey in bad faith. The Superior Court further determined that the evidence showed that Thunberg reasonably believed that her claim against Gazey was valid and that this fact prevented the assessment of any counsel fees and costs against Thunberg.

The trial court thus had ample grounds upon which to award counsel fees and costs for the commencement of such an arbitrary action. <em>See </em>Rule 3.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, <em>supra. </em>Thunberg’s appeal to the Superior Court merely argued that there was no evidence of record that demonstrated that Thunberg had brought the action with a bad motive or in any improper way. However, these arguments ignore the “arbitrary” factor upon which the trial court awarded the fees, and instead focus upon the “vexatious” and “bad faith” factors of 42 Pa.C.S. § 2503(9). There was no attempt by Thunberg to explain why preliminary investigations of the allegations contained in the complaint were not made. Rather, the only argument provided by Thunberg is that her counsel thought she should name Gazey as a defendant in order to protect his client’s interests. This reason, however, fails to provide a sufficient basis for bringing an action against a party. Plaintiffs should only bring actions against another party where they have a reasonable basis to believe that the allegations contained in the complaint are true. The filing of a complaint merely to protect a client’s possible claim against a party without any regard for the truth of the matters asserted therein may give rise to an award of attorney’s fees where such allegations are later proven to have been made without a reasonable investigation or inquiry by the filing party. Here, given Thunberg’s lack of a legal or <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>factual basis for her negligence action, and the rigid standard of review to which an appellate court is bound in these cases, we find that Thunberg’s appeal of the trial court’s ruling was frivolous, taken solely for delay and that her conduct was dilatory.

In view of these admissions, we believe that there existed sufficient evidence of record for the trial court to find that the lawsuit against Gazey’s estate had no supportable basis in law or in fact given Thunberg’s attorney's failure to conduct any substantive preliminary investigation into the matter before filing suit. See Pa. R.Civ.P. 1023 (every pleading of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by that attorney, thereby signifying that to the best of his knowledge there is good ground to support the pleading). While this Court by no means imposes upon an attorney or party the obligation to conduct such a thorough investigation that discovery is not needed, an attorney or party is obliged to conduct at a minimum a reasonable preliminary investigation to ensure that there are sufficient facts, which, if believed, would warrant the filing of a specific claim against a particular party. Given the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Thunberg failed to meet even the minimal investigative threshold before filing such an action against the decedent’s estate and naming his aggrieved widow therein, especially in light of the fact that the writ of summons was filed one day before the lapse of the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions.</p>

This simply defies logic and reason. A determination that Thunberg initiated this suit arbitrarily must be judged by the information which was reasonably available at the time of the initiation of the suit and not by retroactively applying “facts” subsequently deemed to be found by operation of law.

That the attorney might have employed an accident reconstruction expert or interviewed witnesses other than Thunberg, etc., surely does not render his reliance upon the police report and his interview -with Thunberg “random”. Additionally, in light of the allegation contained in the Thunberg complaint that Gazey could have avoided the accident, and the fact that it was the collision between Gazey’s car and Thunberg’s car which caused Thunberg’s injuries, it does not appear that naming Gazey was based upon random or convenient selection rather than on reason. Thus, an award of counsel fees cannot be justified upon the ground that the attorney’s behavior was “arbitrary.”</p>

The fact that her claim may have been weak, and was subsequently dismissed by an action for summary judgement, does not necessarily equate Thunberg’s conduct of instituting the action with conduct which is arbitrary, vexatious, or in bad faith. The trial court awarded counsel fees and costs on the basis of Thunberg not having a viable claim against the estate of Gazey. Because this is not the correct standard to be implemented in an action for attor<a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>ney’s fees, and because the trial court’s findings are not supported by the record, we find that the trial court erred in holding the counsel fees and costs were warranted....</blockquote>
