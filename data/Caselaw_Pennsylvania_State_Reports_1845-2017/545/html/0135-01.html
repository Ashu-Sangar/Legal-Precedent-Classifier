The Board granted the petition. However, the Board concluded that the referee committed no error because the aforementioned issues were properly resolved by credibility determinations on the part of the referee.

The Commonwealth Court panel’s analysis focused on the referee’s findings of fact number 4 and 5. These findings of fact, according to the court, are based on the testimony of Sandra Henry, a vocational counselor who had developed three positions for Appellant, as well as the Appellant’s own admissions. Noting that the referee had found her opinions to be credible, the court stated that Ms. Henry testified that Appellant did not apply for the three positions she referred to him. The court also indicated that Appellant testified that he did not speak with the designated contact person at Trap Rock and did not file an application. Based on these facts, the referee and the Board found that Appellant did not act in good faith in applying for the jobs to which he had been referred. The court reasoned that Ms. Henry’s testimony and Appellant’s admissions constitute substantial evidence to support the referee’s and the Board’s finding that Appellant did not meet his burden under <em>Kachinski v.

It is not disputed in this case that Appellant had recovered sufficiently to perform sedentary to light-duty work. Appellant presented no medical evidence before the referee to refute Dr. Weisband’s opinion, nor has he raised this issue on appeal. We therefore need only focus on the requirements that Employer refer Appellant to an open job which he is physically capable of performing and Appellant’s good faith or bad faith in following through on that referral.</p>

Despite this letter, appellant waited three days before he began pursuing the Trap Rock position. Appellant also conceded that when he did make the call, he spoke with someone other than Mr. Root, a person who appellant only identified as “Tony.” Appellant further conceded that he never sought to follow-up with Mr. Root after his belated phone call. Moreover, appellant admitted that he assumed it would be necessary to do more than he did if he hoped to find a job when he graduated with his two year college associate degree. Based on all of the above, the referee had sufficient competent evidence to support a finding that appellant did not exercise good faith in pursuing the Trap Rock position to which he was referred. <em>See Republic Seafood, Inc. v.

Majority Opinion at 145. As the majority correctly states, “[i]n meeting its burden of proof, an employer must prove that a job referral is ‘actually available’ to the claimant and must bring the referral to the attention of the claimant or his counsel.” <em><a href="/pa-commw/156/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="156 Pa.
