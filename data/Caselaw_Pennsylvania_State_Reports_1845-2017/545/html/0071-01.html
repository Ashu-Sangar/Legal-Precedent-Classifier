The Superior Court held that the trial <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>court correctly determined that the proper time for Appellant to challenge the Attorney General’s jurisdiction to bring charges against him was after a preliminary hearing. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the Order of the Superior Court.</p>

Despite finding “serious questions ... being raised ... relative to the authority of the Attorney General to institute these proceedings,” the trial court denied Appellant’s petition without prejudice and concluded that this was not the appropriate time to raise this argument. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant argues that the complaint on its face fails to allege sufficient facts to bring this case within the purview of the Attorney General’s authority as there was no specific allegation that either Appellant or the entities known as “North End Plumbing Company” or “North End Plumbing Incorporated” were corrupt organizations. Specifically, Appellant contends that the language in Count forty-nine, the only count that would implicate the Attorney General’s power to prosecute, fails to include any additional information apart from referencing the preceding forty-eight counts with the exception of the catchall language “through a pattern of racketeering activity as set forth in detail in Counts 1-48 above____” (R.R. at 8a). Thus, Appellant, relying on <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s petition, which asks the trial court to conduct a <em>Goodman </em>hearing, is clearly a pretrial request for relief. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Simply stated, even those citizens who are arrested and are innocent of the crimes for which they are charged must defend themselves at some point in the criminal justice system.
