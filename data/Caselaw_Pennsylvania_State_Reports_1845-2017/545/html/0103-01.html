    <p id="b197-10" data-blocks='[["BL_197.10",197,[175,1059,1151,735]]]'>Appellant, Robert C. Bolus, appeals from the Order of the Superior Court which affirmed the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County. A jury convicted Appellant of two counts of receiving stolen property,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> tampering with or fabricating physical evidence,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and criminal solicitation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> all in connection with his possession of a stolen tractor-trailer rig and an earth moving machine (“front-end loader”) that was transported on the trailer. This Court granted Appellant’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal limited to the question of whether Appellant’s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to questions concerning Appellant’s pre-arrest failure to cooperate in the police investigation. For the reasons that follow, we hold that trial counsel was not ineffective.</p>
    <p id="b197-11" data-blocks='[["BL_197.11",197,[172,1831,1149,365]],["BL_198.1",198,[258,341,1145,371]]]'>Appellant owned a towing service near Interstate 80 close to Scranton. In October of 1991, an individual named Leonard Brush approached Appellant regarding a tractor-trailer that he had seen stored on Appellant’s towing service lot, unused for over one year. Appellant permitted Brush, who was interested in purchasing the tractor-trailer, to inspect it. Unbeknownst to Appellant, during the inspection, Brush obtained <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>the tractor-trailer’s vehicle identification numbers (“V.I.N.s”). Appellant told Brush that the tractor-trailer had been abandoned and that, although he did not currently have title to it, he was in the process of obtaining title via a mechanics lien. Brush, who had previously been convicted of receiving stolen property, decided to proceed in a cautious fashion. Accordingly, Brush hired a private investigator to trace the V.I.N.s.</p>
    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[255,753,1147,370]]]'>The investigation revealed that the tractor-trailer had been reported stolen property from a storage yard in Flushing, New York, in June, 1989. The police then contacted the inquiring party and learned that the tractor-trailer was now located in Appellant’s towing service yard. The police then proceeded to Appellant’s storage yard and when Appellant was not present, they verified the tractor-trailer’s V.I.N.s.</p>
    <p id="b198-5" data-blocks='[["BL_198.6",198,[253,1166,1149,580]]]'>After confirming that the tractor-trailer was in fact stolen, the police questioned Appellant regarding his possession of the stolen property. Appellant initially told the police that the tractor-trailer had broken down on Interstate 80 and that he towed it in pursuant to a request by the police. According to Appellant, he then replaced a defective fuel pump and attempted unsuccessfully to contact the vehicle’s owner. Because the owner never returned his phone calls or paid the towing, repair, and subsequent storage bills, Appellant had retained possession of the tractor-trailer and was waiting to obtain title via a mechanics’s lien.</p>
    <p id="b198-6" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[249,1797,1148,583]]]'>The police did not believe Appellant’s account of the events. The police initially became suspicious when they were unable to find any record of a request for a tow on the interstate for the vehicle in question, which would ordinarily be contained in a police log. In addition, they were dissatisfied with Appellant’s explanation that because he recently moved his office, he was unable to locate either the repair bill or the telephone number of the owner. Finally, the police found Appellant’s explanation of how he was trying to obtain title unbelievable in light of the difference in value that existed between the small amount of his bills and the large value of the vehicle.</p>

As they were removing it, the police asked Appellant if he knew anything about the front-end loader which had been stolen along with the tractor-trailer. Appellant denied having any knowledge regarding the whereabouts of the front-end loader, and then, on advice of counsel, refused to cooperate further with police.</p>

The police later determined that the front-end loader was the one stolen along with the tractor-trailer they had seized from Appellant the day before. On January 1, 1991, Appellant was arrested and subsequently brought to trial. At trial, Appellant testified to a different version of events from that which he had previously told the police. Appellant testified that he had purchased the front-end loader. In order to substantiate this defense, Appellant produced cancelled checks purportedly paid to an individual named Willie Thomson. Moreover, Appellant denied any knowledge that the machine was stolen.</p>

It held that Appellant’s failure to cooperate, like flight, was evidence tending to establish guilt. <em>Commonwealth v.

The Superior Court concluded that the federal Constitution did not prohibit the prosecutor from engaging in this line of questioning because during the time period in which the prosecutor had referred to Appellant’s silence, Appellant had not yet become the focus of a criminal investigation or placed under arrest. <em><a href="/citations/?q=635%20A.2d%20200" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="635 A.2d 200">Id.</a> </em>This appeal followed.</p>

First, Appellant contends that the prosecutor’s line of questioning impermissibly made mention of his silence, thus violating the Pennsylvania Constitution as interpreted by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v.

While it is efficacious for the Commonwealth to attempt to uncover a fabricated version of events, in light of the “insolubly ambiguous” nature of silence on the part of the accused, we do not think it sufficiently probative of an inconsistency with his in-court testimony to warrant allowance of any reference at trial to the silence. Accordingly, the Commonwealth must seek to impeach a defendant’s relation of events by reference only to inconsistencies as they factually exist, not to the purported inconsistency between <em>silence at arrest </em>and testimony at trial. <em>Silence at the time of arrest </em>may become a factual inconsistency in the face of an assertion by the accused while testifying at trial that he related this version to the police at the time of arrest when in fact he remained silent.

Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Appellant has satisfied the first two prongs of the <em>Pierce </em>test, <em>ie., </em>the claim had arguable merit and Appellant’s trial counsel had no reasonable basis for his conduct, Appellant nevertheless has failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to the final prong. Specifically, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced in such a way that the outcome of the trial could have reasonably been different. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, 158-59, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a>, 975 (1987).
