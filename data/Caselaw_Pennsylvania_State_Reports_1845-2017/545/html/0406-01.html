    <p id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.7",500,[236,883,1157,1109]]]'>On May 14, 1980, the Governor’s Office issued Management Directive 530.22 which designated all attorney positions in agencies under the Governor’s jurisdiction as “major nontenured policymaking or advisory positions,” which are excluded from unemployment compensation under section 1002(11) of the Unemployment Act. 43 P.S. § 751, <em>et seq. </em>The Department of Justice was one of those agencies at that time. On January 20, 1981, with the advent of an elected Attorney General, the Department of Justice became the Office of Attorney General. On December 17, 1985, the Attorney General issued “Administrative Policy 2.10” which was subsequently amended in January 1987. Both versions of Administrative Policy 2.10 provided that all attorneys in the Attorney General’s Office were excluded from unemployment coverage under section 1002(11) of the law. Hence, in accordance with this designation, by memorandum dated January 11, 1984, all attorneys in the Attorney General’s office were notified by the Office of Management Services that, since their positions were subject to the section 1002(11) exclusions, they were also exempt from paying unemployment compensation tax on their salaries.</p>

Thereafter, Zerbe was promoted to the position of Attorney III and in 1982 Zerbe’s class title was changed to Deputy Attorney General III. On September 4, 1992, Zerbe was furloughed from his employment with the Attorney General’s <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>Office.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Notwithstanding the written policy that Zerbe, as an attorney, was not eligible for unemployment compensation and that he did not pay unemployment compensation tax, Zerbe filed an application for benefits with the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation seeking unemployment compensation benefits. The Bureau denied Zerbe’s application and he thereafter sought a referee’s hearing. The referee agreed that Zerbe was not entitled to benefits. Zerbe then appealed to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review which affirmed the referee’s denial of benefits holding that since Zerbe’s Deputy Attorney General position was, at all times pertinent, designated as a major nontenured policymaking or advisory position, Zerbe’s position was not within the term “employment” for purposes of unemployment compensation law. Hence, the referee ruled that Zerbe was not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits. Zerbe appealed to the Commonwealth Court arguing that the Attorney General is not authorized to designate policymaking or advisory positions when those positions are in fact not policymaking or advisory; and in the alternative, assuming the Attorney General is so authorized, that the Attorney General failed to make a proper designation in the instant case. The- Commonwealth Court, by order and published opinion, reversed and remanded this matter to the Unemployment Compensation Board to determine whether Zerbe’s position, in fact, involved actual policy-making or advisory functions. <em>Zerbe v.

Unlike <em>Elrod </em>and <em>Branti, </em>here appellee is not challenging his discharge or alleging that he was wrongfully discharged in violation of his First Amendment freedoms of political belief and association. Rather, Zerbe contends only that he was wrongfully denied unemployment benefits on the basis that the controlling question in determining whether he is entitled to unemployment compensation should be whether he actually <em>performed </em>“major policy making or advisory” functions rather than whether his position is merely <em>designated </em>as a “major policy making or advisory” position. Hence, the only issue that was before the Commonwealth Court, and now before this Court, is whether Zerbe, an employee who occupied a position <em>designated </em>as a major nontenured policymaking or advisory position and during the tenure of which he paid no unemployment tax, is entitled to unemployment compensation benefits. Therefore, a remand to determine whether Zerbe <em>performed </em>major poheymaking or advisory functions, factors which have no bearing on the issue at hand, was clear error.</p>
