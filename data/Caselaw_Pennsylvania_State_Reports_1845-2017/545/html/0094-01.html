Appellant conducts its business in the Park Home, a four story, brick, Victorian building located within Williamsport’s Historic District.

Council then referred Appellant’s application to the Historic Preservation Committee of City Council (“Committee”). The Committee conducted seven sessions, including two public meetings and a meeting with the Park Home Board of Directors President, Samuel R. Hoff. Council subsequently held three public meetings at which Appellant’s application for demolition was discussed. On July 16, 1992, Council voted to reject Appellant’s permit request.</p>

It first argues that Council’s denial of its request for a permit to demolish the Park Home amounts to an unconstitutional taking without just compensation. The basis for this assertion is that the building has deteriorated to the point where it is unsafe to continue to be used in its current capacity. As such, Appellant argues that it must either refurbish the existing structure at great expense or sell it at a depressed fair market value due to the historic designation of the building. We disagree.</p>

He further testified that it was board policy that the building not be sold and that it had been publicly stated that the property was not for sale. (R.R. at 108a). These statements clearly indicate that the Board of Directors did not even consider the possibility of selling the property as an alternative to demolition.

The Historical Architectural Review Board has denied applications for permits without filing the report that it is required to file under the ordinance.” Brief for Appellant at 40. This is nothing more than an unsubstantiated allegation which does not demonstrate the vagueness of the provisions at issue or the arbitrariness of the Board’s actions.

The trial court responded to this claim by noting that there was no objection made by Appellant when the matter was remanded to Council for the issuance of findings of fact. The court further observed that Appellant suffered no prejudice in light of the fact that it was afforded the opportunity to fully present its case at a <em>de novo </em>hearing before the trial court.
