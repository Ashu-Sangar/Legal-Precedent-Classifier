According to eyewitnesses, Appellant leaned forward and shot the driver, Linda Rowden, twice with a revolver.</p>

A subsequent search of Walker’s apartment uncovered a set of Appellant’s clothes and a box of unused bullets.

The test for determining the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner and drawing all proper inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, the jury could have determined all elements of the crime to have been established. <em>Commonwealth v. Jermyn, </em><a href="/pa/516/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="516 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1808565" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0460-01">516 Pa. 460</a>, <a href="/pa/516/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="516 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="1808565" data-case-paths="/pa/516/0460-01">533 A.2d 74</a> (1987). The evidence as described above is more than sufficient to support a first degree murder conviction. Mayo, who was seated in the front seat of the vehicle, directly beside the victim, testified that he observed Appellant shoot the victim. Several other eyewitnesses testified that they observed Appellant <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>quickly leave the crime scene carrying a revolver. Walker testified that Appellant admitted shooting the victim immediately following the event. Appellant himself evidenced his guilt by immediately fleeing the Philadelphia area. Forensic and ballistic reports corroborated all of the eyewitness testimony. A person is guilty of criminal homicide if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causes the death of another human being. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2501(a). The Crimes Code defines murder of the first degree as “a criminal homicide ... committed by an intentional killing,” i.e., a “willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2502(a) and (d). The evidence adduced at trial was clearly sufficient to support the jury’s verdict of guilt of murder of the first degree.</p>

Appellant argues that the trial judge was incapable of remaining objective and unbiased in light of its participation in Appellant’s first conviction in <em>Fisher I. </em>This argument fails. Recusal is required whenever there is substantial doubt as to a jurist’s ability to preside impartially. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3, subd. C(l)(a); <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Boyle, <a href="/pa/498/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="498 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1776076" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0486-01">498 Pa. 486</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="498 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1776076" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0486-01">447 A.2d 250</a> (1982). Before the trial commenced, the trial court entered an order which clearly set forth that if Appellant chose a bench trial or entered a guilty plea, the court would recuse itself; but if <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>Appellant demanded a jury trial, the court would not recuse itself. The court stated clearly that if a jury trial was demanded, the jury would decide all issues of fact, and that the court was able to set aside anything that was adduced at the previous trial and had no preconceived ideas concerning the second trial. Further, a reading of the trial court opinions in both <em>Fisher I </em>and <em>Fisher II </em>illustrate that the court’s rulings were based on the appropriate application of legal principles and not improper personal opinion or bias of the trial judge. If a judge rules that he or she can hear and dispose of the case fairly and without prejudice, that decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth v. Frank, </em><a href="/pa-super/395/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="395 Pa.

    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[189,1083,1149,412]]]'>Next, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss the charges against Appellant under Pa.R.Crim.P., Rule 1100. Appellant points to the eight year period between July 11, 1980, when the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint against Appellant, and July 18, 1988, when his trial commenced. However, Appellant was arrested in the Fall of 1987, in New York City where he had been hiding out since the 1980 murder.</p>

Appellant insists that the Commonwealth must show that it exercised due diligence in its efforts before it may take advantage of a Rule 1100(c) exclusion. However, the due diligence requirement “does not demand perfect vigilance and punctilious care, but rather a reasonable effort.” <em>Commonwealth v. Polsky, </em><a href="/pa/493/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="493 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="8732947" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0402-01">493 Pa. 402</a>, 407, <a href="/pa/493/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="493 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="8732947" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0402-01">426 A.2d 610</a>, 613 (1981). “Common sense, the public interest, and justice demand that a defendant not be <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>permitted the -windfall of an absolute dismissal under Rule 1100 when he voluntarily absents himself from the jurisdiction, refuses to return, and due diligence by law enforcement authorities fails to secure his return.” <em>Polsky </em><a href="/pa/493/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="493 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="8732947" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0402-01">493 Pa. at 407-08</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="493 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="8732947" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0402-01">426 A.2d at 613</a>. A review of the record reveals that local police authorities continued reasonable efforts to apprehend Appellant throughout his eight year absence. Local authorities submitted his name and description to a national wanted persons list, set up a stake-out upon reports that Appellant was returning to the area, followed up leads, and continued to interview witnesses, friends and families regarding the murder and Appellant’s possible whereabouts. The authorities exercised due diligence, and thus, there was no error.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[243,1037,1155,1284]]]'>Next, Appellant contends that the trial court erred by refusing to suppress physical evidence discovered by police officers during a search pursuant to a warrant at Appellant’s apartment immediately following the shooting. Appellant contends that the affidavit of probable cause did not support a finding of probable cause, in that Appellant’s criminal “street activity”, if any, did not bear a “substantial nexus” to Appellant’s residence, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Way, </em><a href="/pa-super/342/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="342 Pa. Super. 341" data-case-ids="632938" data-case-paths="/pa-super/342/0341-01">342 Pa.Super. 341</a>, <a href="/pa-super/342/0341-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="342 Pa. Super. 341" data-case-ids="632938" data-case-paths="/pa-super/342/0341-01">492 A.2d 1151</a> (1985). However, the affidavit sets forth the folio-wing pertinent facts: Rowden had been shot; witnesses to the shooting saw Appellant leave Rowden’s car holding a pistol and wearing a white shirt; officers had reliable information that Appellant had been living at the specified address, and that shortly after the shooting Appellant had been seen entering the apartment wearing a white shirt and then shortly thereafter leaving the apartment wearing a burgundy colored shirt; Appellant was still at large and the weapon used in the shooting had not been recovered. Thus, police had reason to believe that Appellant had left the clothes he was wearing at the time of the shooting, and possibly the murder weapon and other evidence, at the premises to be searched. Accordingly, the Commonwealth met its burden of showing a substantial nexus between the crime and Appellant’s apartment.</p>
    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[191,280,1151,1015]]]'>
      <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>Next, the Appellant alleges various incidents of trial court error throughout voir dire. Preliminarily, we note that the scope of voir dire rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge and his or her decisions will not be reversed unless palpable error is established. <em>Commonwealth v. Sparrow, </em><a href="/pa/471/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="471 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1725173" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0490-01">471 Pa. 490</a>, <a href="/pa/471/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="471 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1725173" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0490-01">370 A.2d 712</a> (1977). First, Appellant contends that the trial court erred by not conducting individual voir dire as is required in capital cases under Pa.R.Crim.P. 1106. However, no objection was made to the group voir dire employed, and thus the issue is waived. In addition, our review of the record indicates that although group voir dire was initially employed to ask general questions regarding the venire-persons’ potential sight or hearing impairments, the venire-persons’ potential relationships with law enforcement officers, witnesses or other significant parties, or the venire-persons’ prejudices or preconceptions about the case, counsel did have an opportunity to individually voir dire any venire-person in private if desired. <em>See Commonwealth v. DeHart, </em><a href="/pa/512/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="512 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1800469" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0235-01">512 Pa. 235</a>, <a href="/pa/512/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="516 A.2d 656" data-case-ids="1800464,1800469" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0234-01,/pa/512/0235-01">516 A.2d 656</a> (1986). There was no error.</p>
    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[189,1329,1149,581]]]'>Second, Appellant contends that the Commonwealth’s peremptory challenges of two black women, Spears and Mooring, were not supported by racially neutral reasons as required under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em><a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">476 U.S. 79</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">106 S.Ct. 1712</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">90 L.Ed.2d 69</a> (1986). We begin by noting that the record reveals that four black individuals were randomly called to the venire pool; one black man was not reached before the jury selection was complete; two black women, Spears and Mooring, were peremptorily struck by the Commonwealth; and one black person, Jettie Phillips, was chosen to participate as a juror in the trial.</p>
    <p id="b339-6" data-blocks='[["BL_339.6",339,[191,1958,1147,369]],["BL_340.1",340,[253,314,1147,95]]]'>The record reflects that the Commonwealth explained that its peremptory challenge of venire-person Mooring was based on the fact that Mooring’s son was facing trial on assault charges for beating his girlfriend. The evidence to be presented by the Commonwealth at trial involved allegations that the Appellant had threatened and abused the victim, his girlfriend, prior to the shooting. Thus, the reason offered by <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>the Commonwealth in support of its peremptory challenge of Mooring was sufficient and race neutral.</p>
    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[248,442,1146,577]]]'>The record also reflects that the Commonwealth explained that its peremptory challenge of venire-person Spears was based on the fact that Spears’ uncle was the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. The prosecutor explained that this relationship would give Spears greater general knowledge of the law and might cause her to hold the Commonwealth to a higher standard of proof. This, coupled with the prosecutor’s concern regarding Spear’s initial response that she would not be able to impose the death sentence, was a sufficient race neutral reason for utilizing the peremptory challenge.</p>
    <p id="b340-6" data-blocks='[["BL_340.6",340,[239,1052,1155,1063]]]'>Third, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to strike for cause venire-person Shutes. Shutes indicated that he was employed as a police dispatcher for Montgomery County. He stated that he had called detectives in the county but had never met them. He also indicated that he could not impartially assess the testimony of Halbert Fillinger, M.D., the Commonwealth’s forensic witness, because he was aware of Fillinger’s excellent professional reputation through his work as a dispatcher. Appellant contends that under these conditions, Shutes should have been struck for cause, and that because the court would not so strike Shutes for cause, Appellant was forced to use a peremptory challenge and was thereby prejudiced. However, Shutes did state, “I think I can follow what the law would warrant” and that he would be able to consider the evidence in this case fairly and impartially.

Although Strauss did indicate, at times, that she would be able to apply the law, these assurances were equivocal at best, and the trial court found that she had never definitively answered the question of whether she could impose the death penalty if convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. The decision to strike for cause is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion.

She indicated that neither experience would in any way predispose her in the instant matter. When asked if the criminal trial resulted in a conviction, the Commonwealth’s objection was sustained.

The prosecutor reserved the right to point out during his own closing that the military record had not been proven, if no such evidence had been offered.

    <p id="b368-8" data-blocks='[["BL_368.9",368,[228,1128,1151,603]]]'>I dissent from the majority’s reversal of appellant’s sentence of death and holding that “victim impact” testimony is not admissible during the penalty phase of a capital case. Instead, I agree with the concurring opinion’s determination that “victim impact” testimony is a relevant consideration for a jury during the penalty phase of a capital case. I write separately, however, because I believe that even if the challenged testimony did constitute “victim impact” testimony, the trial court’s instructions in the case <em>sub judice </em>were adequate to advise the jury of the proper light in which it would consider such evidence. Hence, I would affirm appellant’s sentence of death.</p>

    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.6",369,[183,656,1151,619]]]'>However, contrary to the majority’s assertion, the trial judge’s charge to the jury did not <em>in any way </em>instruct the jury to consider the victim’s testimony as evidence of an aggravating circumstance. The words “aggravating circumstance” were never used in the context of “victim impact” testimony. Rather, the trial judge instructed the jury that in considering the “victim impact” testimony and the Commonwealth’s interest in counteracting the defendant’s mitigating evidence, they should consider that “just as the murderer should be considered an individual, so too the victim, Linda Rowden, is an individual whose death represents a unique loss to society and, in particular, to her family.” •</p>
    <p id="b369-5" data-blocks='[["BL_369.7",369,[181,1298,1150,675]]]'>It is well settled that there is a presumption in the law that a jury will follow the court’s instructions, thus, I believe any confusion that the majority speculates the jury may have suffered was cured by the additional information provided to the jury by the trial judge after the jury presented its question regarding the testimony during their deliberations. <em>Commonwealth v. Tilley, </em><a href="/pa/528/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="528 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1829784" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0125-01">528 Pa. 125</a>, 142, <a href="/pa/528/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="528 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1829784" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0125-01">595 A.2d 575</a>, 583 (1991). The trial judge adequately instructed the jury that such testimony was not to be considered evidence of an aggravating circumstance but rather, it should only be considered mentally in their deliberations. The judge’s answer adequately ensured that the jury understood the manner in which they would consider the “victim impact” testimony.</p>

      <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>Moreover, the majority’s reversal of appellant’s death sentence on the basis of speculation regarding the jury’s deliberations is unnecessary because the aggravating circumstance found by the jury was wholly unrelated to the “victim impact” testimony. The jury found that appellant murdered the victim, his ex-girlfriend, because he believed she was providing the police with information concerning appellant’s alleged previous involvement in another murder. <em>See, </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(15).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> This aggravating circumstance is not related in any manner to the substance of the testimony of the victim’s mother, Betty Rowden. Ms. Rowden’s testimony concerned how the murder of her daughter devastated her life and the close relationship her family had enjoyed before her daughter was murdered by appellant. Such testimony did not provide any evidence that the victim was providing the police with any information regarding appellant’s criminal activities; thus, even if the jury was confused about the effect the “victim impact” testimony was to play upon their deliberations, such confusion resulted only in harmless error. The jury’s finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating evidence mandates that the death penalty be imposed. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv). There is simply no indication in this case that the jury, following the trial judge’s accurate instruction and his subsequent curative answer to their question, improperly considered the “victim impact” testimony during their deliberations or in determining that the aggravating circumstance was proven beyond a reasonable doubt and outweighed the mitigating evidence presented. <em>Mills v.

I do not believe that the jury’s single question during deliberations inquiring whether the effect of the victim’s death on the victim's family should be used as an aggravating circumstance proved confusion. As discussed <em>infra, </em>in response to the question, the trial court gave a clear instruction that the jury was <em>not </em>to place the effect of the victim's death on the victim's family on the verdict form, but rather the jury must only consider it mentally in their deliberations. Furthermore, appellant’s <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>counsel did not at any time poll the jury or attach affidavits from the jurors to substantiate the allegation that the jurors were still confused about the use of the “victim impact” testimony, assuming such confusion existed, which would arguably give the majority a basis for its present ruling on this topic. <em>Commonwealth v.
