For the reasons presented herein, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b173-6" data-blocks='[["BL_173.7",173,[202,877,1152,623]]]'>Prior to 1991, special education classes in Pennsylvania-public schools were taught by intermediate units that had contracted with local school districts to provide this service. In 1991, the Commonwealth instituted a new scheme for the funding of these classes. The new arrangement made it more economically attractive for Appellants to conduct their own special education programs than to continue contracting with an intermediate unit. Accordingly, beginning with the 1991-92 school year, Appellants took over the special education programs administered by Allegheny Intermediate Unit # 3 (“I.U.”) and, pursuant to the Transfer of Entities Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (“Act”), hired a number of I.U. teachers as well.</p>

U. However, the teachers were not credited for any years of service prior to their employment in the I.U. itself even though they had received credit for this prior experience upon their initial hiring by the I.U.</p>
    <p id="b174-5" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[206,585,1149,733]]]'>Appellee filed an action for declaratory judgment in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, seeking an order directing Appellants to credit the former I.U. teachers for any years of service prior to I.U. employment. Following the submission of briefs and stipulated facts, the court found section ll-1113(b) of the Act to be ambiguous. In order to determine the proper interpretation of the section, the court applied the Statutory Construction Act of 1972.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> After concluding that section 11—1113(b) was not meant to deprive the transferred teachers of experience gained prior to employment in the I.U., the court ruled in favor of Appellee and ordered Appellants to credit the teachers for this prior experience.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellants then filed post-trial motions, which the court denied.</p>

    <p id="b175-6" data-blocks='[["BL_175.7",175,[173,1378,1149,529]]]'>We agree with Appellee that the meaning of section 11-1113(b) is not explicit. Specifically, we believe that the phrase “years of service in the sending entity” is open to more than one interpretation. It can reasonably be taken to mean all years of service credited by the sending entity, as Appellee suggests, or only those years of service actually earned in the sending entity, as Appellants suggest. When the wording of a statute is not clear on its face, as here, we must ascertain the intent of the General Assembly in accordance with the Statutory Construction Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
