He was sentenced to death for the murder conviction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The jury found that the aggravating circumstance of committing the killing while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), outweighed the mitigating circumstance of acting under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2).</p>

The two had known each other for four or five months. They had stopped at a gas station to purchase matches. Appellant approached the victim and asked for some change. The victim refused to give Appellant money and Appellant stated, “You’ll regret it.”</p>

Douglas told the victim that Appellant was the same man who wanted money earlier. Appellant again asked the victim for some change. The victim responded that he had none. Appellant then fired a shot through the closed window, striking the victim in the head.

The victim stirred as Douglas was moving inside the van and Appellant shot him again at least two more times. Appellant then went through the victim’s jacket looking for money or valuables and ordered Douglas to go through the victim’s pockets. While searching the victim, Appellant asked Douglas, who is black, ‘What are you doing with this white man?” Fearful of disclosing that the victim was her friend, she replied, “Trying to do the same thing [you are], trying to get paid.” (N.T. 3/30/92, pp. 87-94).</p>

After Douglas exited the van, she reported the incident to a security guard in a nearby apartment building. She did not reveal Appellant’s identity at that time. The police arrived and Douglas reported the location of the murder.</p>

Lytle stated that she had known Appellant since childhood, but did not know Douglas. She <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>believed that the female in the van was another woman that she knew.

We find no reasonable basis for counsel’s failure to object. Further, we are unable to determine how the sentencing jury considered the testimony in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. As only one aggravating and one mitigating circumstance were found, the jury may have improperly relied upon Frinzi’s testimony to tilt the balance of evidence in favor of the death penalty. A new sentencing hearing is therefore required. We note that the recent amendment to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 does not apply to the new sentencing hearing since § 2 of Act 22 of 1995 provides that the amendment shall only apply to sentences imposed for offenses which take place on or after the effective date of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>
