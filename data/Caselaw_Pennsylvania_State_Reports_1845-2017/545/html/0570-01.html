Section 2(1) was a prior codification of the Local Agency Law which afforded a hearing for an adjudication and it used the same definition of “adjudication” currently contained in Section 101 of the Administrative Law and Procedure Act. The <em>Hecknauer </em>court found that a city administrator, who was discharged from his at-will position, did not have an interest in his continued employment which could constitute a privilege. Thus, the <em>Hecknauer </em>court found that the at-will city employee was not entitled to administrative hearing. Like <em>Hecknauer, </em>we find that appellant has failed to plead facts sufficient to establish that his interest in continued employment as a Special Investigator III constitutes a privilege. Thus, no adjudication occurred which would entitle appellant to an Administrative Law hearing.</p>

Appellant also claims that appellees breached their contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing by dismissing him from his Special Investigator III position. At the outset, we note that the Commonwealth Court did not address these claims in dismissing appellant’s Petition for Review. A review of the record discloses that appellant did not clearly preserve these issues when addressing appellees’ preliminary objections. Thus, these issues are deemed waived.</p>

Pa. R.App. P. 1513(a). A review of appellant’s Petition for Review shows that these legal theories were neither raised nor could they be fairly comprised from the objections raised.
