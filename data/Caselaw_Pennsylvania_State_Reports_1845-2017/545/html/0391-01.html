This calculation will, in an immediate offset case, give us the present value of the pension. The present value must then be reduced by the coverture fraction of .65. The end result is the marital portion of the present value of the pension. <em>See DeMasi v. DeMasi </em><a href="/pa-super/366/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="366 Pa.

The inducements consisted of a supplemental retirement income for a period of time based on years of service,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> a bonus based on bonuses paid in recent years, and an annuity program (ORBIT), in which the employee paid 27% of the cost of the annuity and the employer paid 73%.

    <p id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[195,829,1152,413]]]'>The issue of how to treat these inducements to retire arises because the husband asserts that these benefits, which substantially increase the value of the pension, have nothing to do with Mr. Gordon’s salary or pension benefits at the time of separation, and are, therefore, not part of the valuation of his pension for purposes of equitable distribution. Mrs. Gordon, however, points out that the previous passage from <em>Berrington </em>continues as follows:</p>

These changes in the pension not attributable to the participant’s labors or contributions, therefore, are not regarded as property acquired after separation, <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>but as adjustments to the plan which should be available to both parties to the marriage.

    <p id="b490-5" data-blocks='[["BL_490.6",490,[239,1150,1152,537]]]'>As to the first question, it is plain that the retirement inducements of supplemental retirement income, bonus and the annuity resulted in an increase in retirement benefits to Mr. Gordon. Had he not chosen to accept the inducements, his retirement would have been less than it now is. Mr. Gordon’s claim that these payments are not part of a retirement plan is without merit, for they are related only to his retirement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> It follows, therefore, that there were increases in retirement benefits payable to Mr. Gordon, and the first requirement is satisfied.</p>

The second requirement, therefore, is satisfied.</p>
    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[213,770,1151,791]]]'>Third, for the most part, the increased benefits were not attributable to the efforts or contributions of Mr. Gordon. Supplemental retirement income and the bonus were simply benefits based upon years of service, and so required no effort or contributions from Mr. Gordon, but the ORBIT annuity, designed to protect the pension for a period of fifteen years against erosion from inflation, was paid 27% by Mr. Gordon and 73% by the employer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The portion of the annuity paid for by the employer, but not the portion paid for by Mr. Gordon, therefore, is includable in the marital estate along with the supplemental retirement income and bonus.

Superior Court erroneously included post-separation pay raises in violation of <em>Berrington. </em>In addition, because they are not attributable to the efforts or contributions of Mr. Gordon, the retirement inducements consisting of continuation of salary, the bonus, and the 73% of the ORBIT annuity are to be included in the marital estate, but are to be reduced in value by the coverture fraction.</p>

We note, however, that in a deferred distribution, one does not ‘‘value” the marital portion of the pension plan at the time of equitable distribution, because there are unknown factors, such as when the participant will retire and whether the formulation of the plan will change after equitable distribution. One identifies the marital share of the benefit, but one does not “value” it. In an immediate offset, however, one is dealing in the present instead of the future. The marital share of the pension is presently being offset against other marital property, and it is "valued” as of the date of equitable distribution. See <em>Sutliff v.

However, I disagree with its determination that the Superior Court erred by excluding the “continuation pay” and “retirement bonus” from marital property. In making the determination that these assets should be included as marital property, the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court relies upon this Court’s reasoning in <em>Berrington v.

As the Superior Court points out, this early retirement incentive program was not a benefit offered on a continuous basis; rather, it was offered by the company during times of down-sizing or reorganization. During the marriage or at the time of separation, Mr. Gordon had no “right” to this benefit. In fact, in her brief to this Court, Mrs. Gordon acknowledged that there was only a “possibility” that Mr. Gordon could benefit from an early retirement program. (Appellee’s Brief at 21). Mr. Gordon’s “right” accrued when he was offered the package in 1987 during reorganization of his department. Furthermore, it appears that these incentives were not provided in lieu of any of the original pension benefits which accrued during the marriage; rather they were given in addition to those benefits. Therefore, these benefits should be excluded from the marital estate. Accordingly, I write separately as I would affirm the Superior Court’s determination of this issue.</p>
