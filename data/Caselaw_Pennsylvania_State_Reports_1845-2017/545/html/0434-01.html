The issue raised in this case is whether the provisions of the Borough’s Home Rule Charter (“the Charter”) and Administrative Code provide Appellant with an expectation of continued employment in the nature of a property right such that the elimination of her job constituted an adjudication under Local Agency Law. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>

At the time of Appellant’s termination, she was one of four non-union administrative assistants employed by the Borough, and of those four, she had the most seniority.</p>

Thus, she was entitled to notice and a hearing under Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. § 553, but only received a letter notifying her that her position was being eliminated three days later on January 25, 1991. However, as the trial judge found, in this case a hearing would not have accomplished anything. As discussed above, there <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>are no rules or regulations regarding Appellant’s lay-off or the elimination of her position. Thus, the trial court held that “the only appropriate remedy is to set aside the adjudication and reinstate [Appellant] with back pay.” <em>Delliponti v.

The trial court did not mention this issue, and the Commonwealth Court did not address this issue because of its resolution of the case. We reject the Borough’s mitigation of damages argument and hold that the trial court correctly reinstated Appellant with back pay.</p>

It submits that Appellant did not take the necessary steps to obtain employment. It also alleges that there were unquestionably comparable jobs available. Even assuming that Appellant did not take necessary steps to obtain employment, the Borough has not met its burden of proof. To support its argument, the Borough cites to Appellant’s testimony that she made telephone inquiries regarding three job openings she <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>read about in the newspaper but did not pursue any other jobs.
