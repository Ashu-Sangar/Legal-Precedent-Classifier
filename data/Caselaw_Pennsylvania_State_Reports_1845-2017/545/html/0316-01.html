    <p id="b410-9" data-blocks='[["BL_410.9",410,[248,801,1147,416]]]'>This case involves an insurance coverage dispute over whether there was sufficient evidence at trial to establish that a third-party had the permission of the policyholder to use the insured automobile, thereby making the insurer liable for damages resulting from the third-party’s use of the policyholder’s car. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the Superior Court, which held that the evidence was not sufficient to render the insurance company liable.</p>
    <p id="b410-10" data-blocks='[["BL_410.10",410,[240,1241,1152,843]]]'>The underlying history giving rise to this matter is that Ronald Miller, while driving a car owned by his girlfriend’s mother, hit and injured appellant David Adamski, who was riding nearby on a motorcycle. Following a bench trial in the Northampton County Court of Common Pleas, the jury awarded $305,000.00 in' damages to appellants Adamski and his wife.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Because the car Miller used was insured by Allstate Insurance Company, appellants then filed an action to garnish the policy limits under the mother’s automobile insurance policy claiming that Allstate, as the insurer of the mother’s car, was liable under the insurance policy for partial payment of the damages Miller caused.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Allstate denied coverage arguing that it was not liable for any damages because it was only liable under the policy for damages if the driver had permission from the insured to drive the insured’s car, and Miller did not have the mother’s permission to drive her car.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>Following a bench trial, the trial court found that Miller had the mother’s implied consent to use the vehicle and entered a verdict in favor of appellants and against Allstate in the amount of $50,000.00. Allstate filed post-trial motions requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because it believed appellants failed to establish that Miller had the mother’s consent to drive her automobile. The trial court denied appellee’s post-trial motions. On appeal, the Superior Court found that the trial court had abused its discretion in finding that implied consent existed and reversed the trial court’s ruling in favor of appellants. <em>Adamski v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa-super/434/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="434 Pa.

Sometime in 1994, the insured arranged for appellee and her daughter to live together at an apartment complex after the daughter became pregnant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Shortly thereafter, on July 19, 1994, while appellee drove the daughter from her brother’s house back to their apartment due to her feeling ill, he collided with appellant Adamski’s motorcycle.</p>
    <p id="b412-4" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[257,845,1152,771]]]'>At all times pertinent, the daughter had possession of the mother’s car (which was kept at the apartment complex where the daughter and Miller resided) and control of the keys. At no time did Miller have a vehicle of his own, a situation of which the mother was aware. The daughter permitted Miller to use the car to travel to and from his work, to go the store, visit his family and for other occasions. Miller further testified that he was the person that handled the maintenance of the car and that he did so at his own expense. When asked whether the mother was aware that he drove the car, he testified that on at least one instance before the collision, when driving home from work during the afternoon, she actually saw him driving the car and talked to him after he stopped the car to talk to her. He further testified that at no time did the mother tell him that he should not or could not drive her car.</p>

The mother further testified that she was unaware that Miller was going to the brother’s house the next day, that she never told Miller he could not drive her car, that she knew Miller and' her daughter were living- together, that she knew Miller did not own a car, that Miller had never asked for permission to drive her car, that she was the person that maintained the car, that she had never seen Miller drive her car and that after the accident she took the car away from her daughter <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>since her daughter had violated her rules by allowing Miller to drive the car.</p>

She further testified that she did not keep the car, that her mother only let her use the car on occasion, that she never willingly let anyone use the car other than herself although Miller had taken the car without her express permission on at least two occasions before the accident, that as a result of Miller threatening her she had lied in a prior statement that she was not feeling well on the 19th and that she allowed Miller to drive the car, that Miller never maintained her mother’s car, that her aunt had seen someone driving the car other than hefself and informed her mother, that upon learning that someone else had driven the car, her mother repeated to her that she was not to let others drive her car, and that her mother did not like Miller. The daughter further testified that after the accident Miller broke up with her to go back to a former girlfriend.</p>
