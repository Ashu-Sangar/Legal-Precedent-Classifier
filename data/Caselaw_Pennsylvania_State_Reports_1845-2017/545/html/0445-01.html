However, as discussed above, a careful reading of the Motor Vehicle Code makes it clear that appellants were under DUI-related suspensions from the time the Department of Transportation received notice of their DUI convictions. Therefore, although the period of revocation or suspension does not begin to run for computation purposes until the effective date, appellants were subject to the penalty provisions applicable for driving while their licenses were suspended as a result of a DUI-related conviction. To hold otherwise would create the absurd result of allowing drivers whose licenses have been suspended as a result of a DUI conviction to avoid the enhanced consequences of continuing to drive until some point in the future simply because they have flagrantly disregarded the Motor Vehicle Code in the past.

However, because appellants’ licenses were suspended as the result of DUI convictions, their licenses were revoked under Section 1540(a), which does not provide that the suspensions are effective on the "effective date” set by the Department, but provides for immediate suspension on turning over the license (or earlier if the court decrees).</p>

This provision shall also apply until the person has had the operating privilege restored. This subsection shall also apply to any revocation imposed pursuant to section 1542 (relating to revocation of habitual offender’s license) if any of the enumerated offenses was for a violation of section 3731.</blockquote>
