    <p id="b391-10" data-blocks='[["BL_391.11",391,[171,1714,1151,685]]]'>The issue presented in this appeal is whether the newly enacted Driving Under the Influence statute, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(5), which imposes criminal penalties on individuals who have a blood alcohol content (“BAC”) equal to or in excess of .10% within three hours of driving, violates the due process guarantees of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Because, § 3731(a)(5) unnecessarily encompasses both lawful and unlawful conduct; fails to provide a reasonable standard by which a person may gauge their conduct; encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement; and fails to require proof that a person’s BAC actually exceeded the legal limit <em>at the time of driving;, </em>we conclude that 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(5) is unconstitutional.</p>

Officer Szurlej followed appellee in his police cruiser for about a quarter of a mile before activating his emergency lights and pulling appellee over to the side of the road. Appellee on his own volition exited his vehicle, stumbled, and then began to walk toward Officer Szurlej. Officer Szurlej ordered appellee back to his car, approached the vehicle and observed that the vehicle’s registration and inspection stickers were expired. Upon speaking with appellee, the officer noticed that appellee’s speech was slurred, that his eyes were bloodshot and that he smelled strongly of alcohol. Officer Szurlej administered three field sobriety tests, all of which appellee failed.</p>

First, without requiring any proof that the person actually exceeded the legal limit of .10% at the time of driving, the statute sweeps unnecessarily broadly into activity which has not been declared unlawful in this Commonwealth, ' that is, operating a motor vehicle with a BAC below .10%. If, for example, a person was operating a motor vehicle with a BAC below the legal limit and he were pulled over at that time, the evidence could not sustain a charge for driving under the influence as determined by a blood alcohol test since his BAC was under the legal limit. However, if that same person’s BAC rises above .10% within three hours after driv<a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>ing, he may now be prosecuted for driving under the influence of alcohol under the amendment to the statute in question since the statute eliminates the requirement that the Commonwealth must establish that the accused actually exceeded the legal BAC limit at the time of actual operation of the vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[234,633,1157,1063]]]'>Second, the amendment has the effect of creating significant confusion as to exactly what level of alcohol in the blood is prohibited under the Motor Vehicle Code. Prior to the amendment, the Motor Vehicle Code provided for a bright line rule whereby a person could be prosecuted for operating a vehicle with a BAC of .10% or greater. <em>See </em>§ 3731(a)(4). The current version, however, could actually be interpreted as creating two circumstances in which a person could be prosecuted: either where a person had an actual BAC of .10% at the time of driving (under § 3731(a)(4)), or where a person has a BAC which is <em>somewhere </em>below .10% at the time of driving but which rises above .10% within three hours after driving (under § 3731(a)(5)). Clearly, this does not provide a reasonable standard by which an ordinary person may contemplate their future conduct. As the learned trial court below pointed out, “How is a citizen to know when their lawful action (drinking and driving) ripens into criminal conduct? How can one predict when and whether a 0.10% alcohol level will be reached within three hours of driving?” <em>Commonwealth v. Barud, </em>143 P.L.J. 7 (1995).</p>
    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.6",398,[230,1740,1152,574]]]'>Indeed, the most glaring deficiency of § 3731(a)(5) is that the statute completely fails to require any proof that the accused’s blood alcohol level actually exceeded the legal limit <em>at the time of driving. </em>Rather, the statute criminalizes a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit up to three hours <em>after </em>the last instance in which the person operated a motor vehicle and without any regard for the level of intoxication at the time of operation. Thus, a person may be prosecuted under § 3731(a)(5) even though his or her blood alcohol level did not actually rise above the legal limit of .10% until <em>after </em>the last instance in which he or she drove.</p>

      <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>The Commonwealth argues that this statute should be upheld on the basis that it provides a mechanism for an individual to rebut the presumption that they were operating a vehicle while below the legal limit of .10% BAC. While it is clear that the intent of the amendment was to cure those instances in which a persons’ BAC barely exceeded the legal limit at the time of testing, the statute fails to provide for any mechanism, as do many other jurisdictions, whereby the accused may either: (1) rebut the state’s presumption that their BAC at the time of testing accurately reflected their BAC at the time of driving or (2) produce competent evidence that he or she was below the legal limit at the time of driving (other than consumption after the fact) thereby requiring the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s BAC exceeded the legal limit at the time of driving. As currently enacted, however, the statute does not even require any proof that the person had a BAC above the legal limit at the time of driving, thereby criminalizing conduct which has not been declared criminal by the legislature.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
