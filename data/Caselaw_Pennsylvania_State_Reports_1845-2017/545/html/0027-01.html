The department held that the trustee had no discretion to preserve the trust assets; rather, the assets were a resource available to the life beneficiary, making her ineligible for medical assistance benefits. The Commonwealth Court affirmed. We allowed the appeal to review this determination.</p>

When he died in 1976, he was survived by Mary, his wife, and a son John, who served as trustee. Louis Rosenberg’s will bequeathed approximately $157,000 to his widow outright, and $65,000 was placed in the trust. In 1987, Mary Rosenberg’s health required her to enter a nursing home. To pay for her care between 1987 and 1992, she expended virtually all of the $157,000 she had inherited. In February, 1992, she applied for medical assistánce benefits, commonly known as Medicaid, from public welfare. To qualify, she could have no more than $2,400 in available resources; the Department of Public Welfare ruled that the $55,000</p>

If he had intended the entire principal of the trust to be available for the support of his one handicapped son, so that the entire principal would have to be exhausted before his son could receive state-provided care in the form of medical assistance, he would likely have created a trust for that son alone and separate trusts for his other children. Second, the settlor accepted Commonwealth assistance during his lifetime in the form of partial subsidization of his son’s institutional care. We inferred that the settlor intended for his son to continue receiving whatever state assistance he was entitled to, and intended the discretionary trust only to supplement the state assistance.

Thus, the considerations of <em>Lang </em>and <em>Snyder </em>do not apply; rather, this case is virtually indistinguishable from <em>Commonwealth Bank. </em>The public welfare department and the Commonwealth Court employed this precise rationale in holding that the trust assets were a resource available to the beneficiary. On its face, the decision appears to be impeccable.</p>

Nevertheless, they remain persuasive and prominent indicators.</p>
    <p id="b126-7" data-blocks='[["BL_126.8",126,[259,1397,1150,194]]]'>The specific factors appellant claims were overlooked may be summarized as: first, the scheme of distribution created by the testator, and second, evidence of the health of the testator and his wife.</p>
    <p id="b126-8" data-blocks='[["BL_126.9",126,[254,1627,1151,742]]]'>The record indicates that the testator, during his lifetime, established a long-term pattern of gift-giving to his two sons and his two grandchildren—for years, he gave each of them the maximum nontaxable amount permitted under the federal estate and gift tax laws. He also created inter vivos trusts for the educational expenses of his grandchildren in addition to the testamentary trusts for the grandchildren. These substantial lifetime gifts, appellant argues, show the testator’s “inclination to avoid dissipation of his assets by having them taxed away,” as well as his long-standing desire to benefit his issue. From this it follows, according to appellant, that his intention with regard to the support trust for his wife was that it not be used for her long-term medical care, but that it be preserved for their issue.</p>

      <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>Such a conclusion is purely speculative. The lifetime gifts to the sons and grandchildren constitute substantial benefits to his issue and we might reasonably conclude that such completed gifts would have reduced his concern that the sons and grandchildren receive any benefit as remaindermen of his estate. Moreover, the testator’s scheme of distribution, dividing the bulk of his estate between an outright gift to his wife and the support trust for his wife, was created to minimize federal estate taxation. Perhaps his entire estate would have been given to his wife outright were it not for the federal estate tax. The testator had the right to leave his wife any amount (subject to the statutory minimum), and had no duty to leave any portion of his estate to their issue. The testator could have made separate bequests to the children and grandchildren if he had a definite intention that they were to receive part of his estate. Alternatively, he could have made them life beneficiaries of the trust along with his wife, which would arguably have brought the trust within the ambit of <em>Lang </em>and <em>Snyder, </em>where the interests of other life beneficiaries would have precluded expending the entire trust on the widow. He chose not to utilize such possibilities, and we cannot conclude that the testator definitely intended his issue to receive benefits as remaindermen rather than to provide primarily for his wife. We reiterate, however, that such speculation sheds little or no light on the intent of the testator on the issue involved in this case.</p>

    <p id="b128-4" data-blocks='[["BL_128.6",128,[242,659,1149,523]]]'>This conclusion, however, does not follow logically and is pure speculation in any event. The record of the parties’ health sheds no light on the testator’s intent with regard to long-term medical care. Despite prior good health, it is obviously possible that the testator considered the possibility of declining health and the potential need for long-term care. He chose, in any case, to create a discretionary support trust for his wife to provide for her welfare, maintenance, support, and medical expenses, inter alia, which appears plainly to include long-term institutional medical care.</p>
    <p id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.7",128,[235,1207,1153,1006]]]'>As for appellant’s argument that the decision of the Commonwealth Court resuscitates the repudiated concept that it is shameful to accept public welfare as a form of charity, we find no such attitude reflected in the opinion of the court. To say, as the court did, that the testator “intended that the principal of the testamentary trust he established be available to his wife for her médical expenses and that he did not intend for her to rely on public assistance for her health care after his death,” <em>Rosenberg, </em>165 Pa.Cmwlth. at 14, 644 A.2d at 217, is a simple legal conclusion based on the evidence in the record. A contrary result would require a presumption that every testator intends his survivors to utilize public assistance if possible so that a testamentary trust instrument such as this must be interpreted so as to make the widow eligible for medical assistance benefits in order to maximize the inheritance of the remaindermen. Although <em>Lang </em>condemned the notion that receiving public assistance is shameful, we do not subscribe to the opposite notion, that receiving public assistance is the presumed goal of estate planning.</p>
