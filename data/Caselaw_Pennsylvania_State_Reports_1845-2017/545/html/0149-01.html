JFC is a temporary employment agency which hired Claimant and assigned him to G &amp; B, a warehousing company, to drive a tractor-trailer.

Total disability benefits were awarded. The Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the award of benefits but reversed the referee’s determination that JFC was Claimant’s employer at the time of the injury.

Personnel at the Naval Depot, the destination of most deliveries, usually completed the bill of lading and noted therein the exact location to deliver the goods. Eckert did not specify a particular route which Claimant was to take. After hauling a load, Claimant would report back to G &amp; B. Claimant was not responsible for unloading the truck. If the deliveries were not accepted, Claimant would return to G &amp; B. About five to ten percent of Claimant’s duties included stacking boxes, running small errands and picking up miscellaneous tools and supplies under the direction of Eckert.

G &amp; B argues that <em>English </em>is not controlling since, unlike Claimant, the employee there required training to perform his assigned tasks. As noted in our discussion of <em>Accountemps, </em>we find that the mere fact that the employee is skilled does not, in and of itself, establish that the original employer has retained the right to control the manner of performance of the work assigned.</p>

In support of its argument that JFC retained control over Claimant, G &amp; B asserts that Claimant reported to a woman at JFC. Although Claimant testified that there was a woman at JFC to whom he ‘‘reported,” he stated that she only called to inform him of an available job. This does not establish that the JFC representative had any right to control the performance of Claimant's work.</p>
