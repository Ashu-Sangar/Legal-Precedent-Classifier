We left in place the system of county funding until this new legislation was implemented. That was nine years ago. At this writing, the General Assembly has not enacted an alternate system of funding the courts of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania State Association of County Commissioners and ten counties (hereinafter “the Counties”) now bring this action in mandamus pursuant to an application for this court to exercise its original jurisdiction to compel the General Assembly to abide by the order in <em>Allegheny County II, </em>requiring a state scheme of funding the courts of Pennsylvania.

In our Commonwealth, it has always been the province of the legislative branch to enact legislation to raise revenue to support the sister branches.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">3</a> Inherent in this duty is a corresponding responsibility to assure the proper and efficient expenditure of the revenue raised. The result reached by the majority opinion would eliminate the legislative branch’s responsibility for enacting legislation that properly raises and efficiently expends revenue and would transfer this expenditure responsibility totally to the judicial branch, thus eliminating a vital check and balance between these two co-equal branches of the government. Such usurpation of authority provides the judicial branch with unfettered power to spend revenue as it sees fit in the name of a unified judicial system without being directly answerable to the source of the revenue, the citizens, if such revenue is not spent wisely or efficiently. Such an egregious action drastically upsets the checks and balances of our scheme of government. As James Madison stated in the Federalist Papers when commenting on the need for the separation of powers: “[T]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” <em>The Federalist No. 4-7, </em>at 301 (J.Madison) (C. Rossiter ed.1961). The fact that there may be, as the majority noted in <em>Allegheny County II, </em>“continual friction and dissention” between the taxing authority and the various courts of the counties in this Commonwealth is merely a recognition of the delicate balancing of power within our system of government with its concomitant checks on the power of sister branches by each branch. However, this inherent tension hardly warrants this Court’s wholesale elimination of the statutorily-enacted funding scheme whereby individual counties are responsible for the funding of their respective county court systems. Neither does it warrant this Court assuming the power unto itself to determine the funding level of the unified judicial system and then unilaterally imposing that determination on the legislative branch, thereby eliminating an important check on the judicial branch by the legislative branch. This is the very definition of judicial tyranny.</p>
    <p id="b437-4" data-blocks='[["BL_437.5",437,[164,1373,1154,796]]]'>The concurring opinion illustrates eloquently the few instances of “continual friction and dissention” between the judicial branch and the funding source. Certainly, these few instances do not give support to the majority’s conclusion of continued friction and dissent. But, even though the author of the concurring opinion expresses misgivings over the propriety of the majority’s decision, the author invokes the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>as a basis for the concurrence in the majority’s decision. I recognize that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>mandates that great consideration be accorded to established precedent. The doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>however, “is not a vehicle for perpetuating error, but rather a legal concept which responds to the demands of justice.” <em>Mayle v.

Act No. 2 of 1967 authorized the Constitutional Convention that produced the present Article 5 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Section 5 of Act No. 2 authorized the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Constitutional Convention. As part of its duties, the Preparatory Committee produced nine (9) reference manuals to give delegates general information on the Convention, to present a brief history of the several Pennsylvania Constitutions and to provide pertinent information concerning the subject matter and areas the delegates were authorized to consider. As part of the reference manual on the judiciary, the Preparatory Committee, when discussing the administration and costs of the judiciary, noted the existence of the present county funding scheme and the fact that some proponents of a unified judiciary are convinced that such a scheme would only work if all costs are borne by the state. <em>Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention 1967-68, </em>Ref. Manual No. 5, The Judiciary, Part VII, § 8 at 230. Despite being informed of the problems in funding, the delegates at the Constitutional Convention chose not to speak to this issue either in the Constitutional provision or in the debates concerning the unified judiciary. Because it appears that the delegates intentionally omitted the funding of the unified judiciary, I believe it was improper for the majority in <em>Allegheny County II </em>to supply such an omission. <em>See Altieri v. Allentown Officers' &amp; Employees’ Retirement Board, </em><a href="/pa/368/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="368 Pa. 176" data-case-ids="1230388" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0176-01">368 Pa. 176</a>, 180— 81, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.2d%20884" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="81 A.2d 884">81 A.2d 884</a>, 886 (1951) (it is not for the courts to legislate or by interpretation to add to legislation matters which the legislature saw fit not to include).</p>

Throughout history, the dividing lines between the boundaries of power and our three separate co-equal branches of government have often been incapable of exact definition. Generally, the executive branch has the power to recommend legislation and the power and duty to see that the laws are faithfully administered and carried out. The legislative branch has the power and duty to pass legislation, and the judicial branch has the power, duty and responsibility of interpreting the legislation in order to determine if it violates the constitution. <em>Stander v.
