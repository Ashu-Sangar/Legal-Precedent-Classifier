The victim testified that as he was walking home, Appellee darted in front of him, pulled out a ten to twelve-inch blade kitchen knife from his pants and demanded the victim’s money. After the victim responded that he had no money, Appellee’s co-defendant checked the victim’s jacket and pants’ pockets, and took from the victim a pack of Viceroy cigarettes, keys and the victim’s student identification. The co-defendant returned the victim’s keys before fleeing but kept the victim’s cigarettes and student identification. The victim further testified that the robbery occurred in a well-lit area and that the encounter lasted several minutes.</p>

As he slowed his vehicle to get a closer look, he observed that the victim looked distressed. Consequently, Officer Smith drove approximately twenty-five to fifty yards down the street and then turned around to come back toward the three men. As <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>he approached, Appellee and the co-defendant ran towards Forbes Avenue. The victim informed Officer Smith that the two males had just robbed him at knife point. The victim described Appellee as fair complected with light eyes and wearing a red shirt and blue jeans. The victim described the co-defendant as darker skinned with a mustache, wearing a white shirt and blue jeans. The victim further informed Officer Smith that Appellee and his co-defendant took his student identification and a pack of Viceroy cigarettes.</p>

After searching them, he found the victim’s Viceroy cigarettes and the victim’s student identification in the co-defendant’s possession. Officer Smith found the knife in the campus parking lot approximately forty yards away from where he stopped Appellee and his co-defendant. After arresting Appellee and his co-conspirator, Officer Smith transported them to the campus police station. The victim identified both Appellee and the co-defendant as the perpetrators at the Pittsburgh Campus Police station approximately fifteen minutes after his attack.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The victim also made a positive in-court identification of Appellee as his attacker.</p>

Although it was determined that the appellant’s arrest was illegal, this Court nevertheless upheld the admissibility of an in-court identification as well as an out-of-court identification that occurred immediately after the appellant was arrested. In so holding, we observed that “[n]o law abiding society could tolerate a presumption that but for the illegal arrest the suspect would never have been required to face his accusors [sic].

    <p id="b561-4" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[184,438,1151,1339]]]'>The legislative history surrounding 71 P.S. § 646 reveals that the statute was enacted to provide effective police protection for property and persons within the state university and college campuses and to relieve the municipality or city where these institutions are located of the burden of policing state university and college campuses. <em>See </em>Senate Journal, p. 333 (June 3, 1968). To achieve this end, section 646(e) provides that campus police are vested with the same powers exercised by the police of the cities or municipalities in which the campus police are located. 71 P.S. § 646(e). <em>See also, Commonwealth v.

Here, Officer Smith was on duty and conducting official university business.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> While the officer was on duty, he was travelling his routine, patrol route, and, due to the non-contiguous geographic make-up of the campus, uti<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>lized the public streets for ingress and egress to the university campus. As Officer Smith approached, appellee and his co-defendant ran. Officer Smith observed the suspects running across a university parking lot and pursued them, again, travelling on public roads since the university does not possess a contiguous boundary. Officer Smith ultimately detained appellee and his co-defendant across the street from the university parking lot at a location which was apparently just beyond the University of Pittsburgh Law School. Thus, pursuant to the combined meaning of 71 P.S. § 646 and 42 Pa.C.S. § 8953, read <em>in pari materia, </em>I conclude that campus police have the authority to make extra-territorial arrests when the campus officer is on official business, patrolling his usual route, and observes a crime such as in the instant case. <em>Pratti, <a href="/pa/530/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="530 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1833047" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0256-01">supra;</a> Merchant, <a href="/pa/528/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="528 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1829790" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0161-01">supra.</a> </em>To hold otherwise would allow a felon to escape arrest by a campus police officer simply by fleeing to a site off-campus where he would be immune from lawful arrest by the campus police. Lawfully appointed campus police officers do not have to turn a blind eye to crimes committed in their plain view while they are routinely conducting the university business. Such a result would defeat the legislature’s intent and would adversely impact campus and student security by providing a safe haven for marauding criminals who could simply retreat off campus following their criminal conduct on campus.</p>

Hence, an evidentiary hearing to establish where the robbery and arrest took place is unwarranted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

I also note that the Superior Court erred by remanding this matter for an evidentiary hearing to establish the location of the robbery and arrest where the trial record was unclear. In ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the defendant has the burden, either through the record as it exists at the time the claim is brought or by making the appropriate pleadings and offers of proof at an appropriate hearing, to establish that his claim is of arguable merit. <em>Commonwealth v.

In the instant case, appellee made no offer of proof regarding where the robbery and arrest occurred. Therefore, the Superior Court erred by remanding the case for an evidentiary hearing to create such a record. <em><a href="/pa/492/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="492 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1767206" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0558-01">Id.</a> </em>(trial counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to gather evidence regarding defendant’s amenability where the record fails to reveal facts suggesting that defendant is amenable to rehabilitation or special treatment).</p>

Here, the Superior Court remanded this matter for an evidentiary hearing not to examine trial counsel's stewardship, but to establish whether the robbery and arrest occurred on or off campus. This was error.</p>
