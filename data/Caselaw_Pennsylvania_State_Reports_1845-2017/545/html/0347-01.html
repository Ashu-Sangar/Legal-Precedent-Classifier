During the course of the stop, the officer detected a moderate odor of alcohol, observed that Appellant’s eyes were bloodshot, and noticed that Appellant had difficulty with respect to his speech and gait. Appellant admitted to Officer Lutcher that he had consumed three beers between the time of 1:30 a.m. and 2:15 a.m.</p>

Appellant complied but did not perform the tests to the satisfaction of the officer. As a result, Appellant was taken to the Milton police station where he was given an intoxilyzer test. The first breath sample was taken at 3:23 a.m., forty-six minutes after the initial stop, and registered .157% blood alcohol content (“BAC”). The second sample was taken one minute later and registered .142%. The trial court noted that “[n]either the arresting officer nor the officer who had administered the test were [sic] qualified as an expert in order to testify at trial that the amount of alcohol by weight in [Appellant’s blood <em>at the time he was driving </em>was greater than .10%.” <em>Commonwealth v.

However, there was no specific indication as to what BAC would be considered significantly above .10%, nor did we establish a temporal threshold for the lapse of time between driving and BAC testing. Based on this lack of specifically defined boundaries, the trial court in the instant case concluded that it could not grant a motion in arrest of judgment. <em>Commonwealth v.

It is apparent that the trial court’s erroneous charge allowed the jury to base its verdict on unsubstantiated speculation. There was no evidence to support a finding that Appellant had a BAC of .10% <em>while he was operating his vehicle. </em>Thus, the only question is whether the trial court correctly granted Appellant a new trial as the proper remedy for the improper jury charge.

The specific reason for the deficiency in the evidence supporting the conviction in <em>Loeper </em>is not relevant to our resolution of the instant case. Both Appellant and the defendant in <em>Loeper </em>were convicted of violations of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731(a)(4), and it was subsequently determined that the evidence of record was insufficient to support their convictions. On that basis, fundamental fairness dictates that the remedy for each defendant be the same.

Because the Commonwealth proceeded through trial in accordance with the applicable law, and the trial court so instructed the jury on the then applicable law, the trial court determined that justice weighed against its granting appellant’s motion in arrest of judgment and that a new trial was the appropriate remedy. Specifically, the trial court stated, “in consideration of the Court’s charge, the issue of blood alcohol content was sufficiently ambiguous as to leave open to speculation the question of [appellant’s] BAC at while driving.” <em>Commonwealth v. Shade, </em>No. CR-90-411, slip op. at 4 (C.P.

While this Court determined that the evidence in those cases was insufficient to support the verdicts, those holdings were based on the specific facts of those cases. In <em>Modaffare, </em>the defendant’s BAC registered at .108% almost two hours after the time at which he was driving. In <em>Jarman, </em>the defendant’s BAC registered .114% an hour after driving. And in both cases, expert witnesses testified that it was possible or even probable that the defendants’ BACs had peaked between the time of the stop and the time of testing. The Court specifically held in those cases that the Commonwealth must relate BAC back to the time of driving and that, where the BAC barely exceeded .10% and there had been a significant time lapse between driving and the blood test, the inference of guilt was <em>weakened, </em>and therefore more evidence than simply BAC test results would be required to sustain a conviction. <em>Jarman, supra </em>at 96, 601 A.2d at 1231; <em>Modaffare, <a href="/pa/529/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="529 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1831171" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0101-01">supra </a></em><a href="/pa/529/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="529 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1831171" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0101-01">at 105</a>, 601 A.2d at 1235.
