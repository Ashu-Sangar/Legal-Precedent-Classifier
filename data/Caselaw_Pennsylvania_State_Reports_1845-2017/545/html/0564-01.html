On March 18, 1996, the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County <em>sua sponte </em>ordered a competency examination of Petitioner pursuant to sections 7402(d) and (e) of the Pennsylvania Mental Health Procedures Act (“the Act”), 50 P.S. §§ 7101-7503 (1976), after finding that there was a <em>prima facie </em>question as to Petitioner’s incompetency.
