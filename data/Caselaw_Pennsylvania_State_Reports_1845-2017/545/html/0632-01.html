    <p id="b726-6" data-blocks='[["BL_726.7",726,[248,687,1152,688]]]'>Appellant, Gary Monteson (Claimant), suffered a work-related back injury on October 31, 1989, while working for Trinity Industries (Employer). Employer issued a notice of compensation payable dated November 22, 1989. On December 7, 1989, Claimant signed a final receipt and returned to work. On January 1, 1990, Claimant reinjured his back at work and benefits were reinstated pursuant to a supplemental agreement dated January 15,1990. Claimant’s treating physician released Claimant to work and on April 10,1990, a second final receipt was signed. However, Employer laid off Claimant and other workers with similar seniority effective April 5, 1990. Claimant then applied for and received unemployment compensation benefits from April 1990 to June 1990.</p>
    <p id="b726-7" data-blocks='[["BL_726.8",726,[243,1400,1148,464]]]'>Claimant was subsequently hired by Greenwood Nissan as a car salesman on June 9, 1990. Two days later, Employer offered Claimant his pre-injury job. Claimant rejected this offer of employment. Two weeks later, Greenwood Nissan terminated Claimant’s employment due to his failure to sell cars. Claimant remained unemployed until March 1991, when he was hired as an independent agent by Sosmetal, Inc. to sell automotive repair materials. He was terminated by Sosmetal in October 1991.</p>
    <p id="b726-8" data-blocks='[["BL_726.9",726,[240,1897,1147,302]]]'>On November 22,1991, Claimant filed a petition to set aside the April 10, 1990, final receipt. Claimant alleged that at the time he signed the final receipt he was not fully recovered from his work-related injury.

      <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>The referee found that Claimant had not fully recovered from his original injury when he signed the April 10, 1990, final receipt and that he was still suffering from symptoms of the original injury. The referee granted the petition to set aside the final receipt, reinstated total disability benefits from April 10, 1990, to June 8, 1990, awarded Claimant partial disability benefits for June 9 and June 10, 1990, and suspended benefits as of June 11, 1990. The referee determined that Employer was entitled to a suspension of benefits because it had proven that Claimant voluntarily refused to accept its offer of employment for reasons unrelated to his work-related injury, citing <em>Dugan v. WCAB (Fuller Co.), </em><a href="/pa-commw/131/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="131 Pa. Commw. 218" data-case-ids="1399098" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/131/0218-01">131 Pa.

    <p id="b727-4" data-blocks='[["BL_727.5",727,[159,1042,1151,475]]]'>On appeal, the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board held that the referee’s reliance on <em>Dugan </em>was misplaced, but the error was harmless. The Board held that Employer was entitled to a suspension of benefits as of June 11, 1990, because Claimant had refused a job offer from Employer for reasons unrelated to his disability and because the law does not require an employer to keep a job open indefinitely. The Board also found that the Claimant did not exercise bad faith in refusing Employer’s June 11,1990, job offer.</p>

When, two days after Claimant started this new job, Employer offered Claimant his pre-injury job, Claimant rejected the offer. Claimant was not a successful car salesman, however, and he was terminated after only two weeks on the job for failure to sell enough cars. He was likewise unsuccessful at his subsequent sales job with Sosmetal, Inc., and, thus, in October of 1991, he again found himself receiving unemployment compensation. In November of 1991, Claimant sought to set aside the April 10, 1990 final receipt and sought reinstatement of his benefits as of April 10, 1990, when he was laid off upon his return to work.</p>

Further, quoting this portion of section 413 lends no answer to the issue of whether the Claimant’s earning power is once again adversely affected by his work-related injury. Moreover, I find <em>Harle </em>equally unsupportive of the majority’s position. The claimant in <em>Harle </em>had injured his thumb at work. He received worker’s compensation benefits, and, when he was released by his physician to return to light duty work, his employer had ceased conducting business. The employer in <em>Harle </em>filed a termination petition asserting the claimant’s disability had ceased. The Commonwealth Court found that the claimant’s medical disability had not entirely ceased, and that, since the claimant’s pre-injury position was not available and the claimant had obtained a similar position elsewhere at a lower wage, modification of benefits to partial disability was appropriate. This court vacated the Commonwealth Court’s remand of the matter for calculation of partial disability benefits, instead ordering the matter remanded to the Board with instructions that the claimant’s benefits be suspended.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

By creating the causal connection requirement, the majority fails to conduct any inquiry into the Claimant’s capacity to work and availability of work, matters which we have previously stated in <em>Dillon </em>affect the extent of an injured employe’s loss of earning power.</p>
