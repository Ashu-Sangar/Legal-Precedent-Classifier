Julia had older sons by a previous relationship. One of those sons, Louis, and Appellant hated each other. Louis, who moved out of the house at the age of fourteen to live with other relatives, estimated that over the course of seven years, he saw his mother on only three occasions, and rarely spoke with her by telephone. On those occasions when Louis contacted his mother, Appellant and Julia would argue. Julia was afraid to meet with or talk to Louis in her home because Appellant had told her that any place he found Louis he was going to get him.</p>

On one occasion prior to Marcia’s death, Appellant had an altercation with' one of Julia’s other sons, Javier. Following the fight, Javier called the police, and Appellant left the house with Marcia. When Julia could not find them, she filed a missing person report with the police. After driving around searching for Appellant <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>and Marcia, Julia eventually discovered them on the street. Appellant positioned himself between Julia and Marcia and specifically threatened that if she ever called the police on him again and he was arrested, she would find Marcia in the river with her throat slashed.</p>

When he discovered that his mother was not home, Louis went to a friend’s house nearby. Louis then proceeded to wash his car on the street, and Appellant walked by. Louis testified that Appellant looked directly at him as Appellant walked towards his residence. Louis continued to visit with friends and relatives while he awaited his mother’s arrival. Eventually, Julia came out of the house, and the two of them arranged to meet at a relative’s home, thereby avoiding Appellant. Louis, Julia, and Marcia visited for approximately one half-hour. This marked the first time that Louis had seen Marcia since she was an infant. After the visit, they left the house separately.</p>

At that point, Marcia told Appellant not to hug or kiss her because someone had already done that. Believing that he might have already seen Louis, Appellant asked Julia if in fact Louis was in town. Julia responded in the affirmative. Appellant then entered the house, retrieved his car keys, and came out carrying a long pole. He then took Marcia by the hand, led her out the backyard gate, got into Julia’s car and drove off. That was the last time Julia observed Marcia alive.</p>

A neighbor of Appellant and Julia, Evelyn Garcia, also saw Appellant in the late afternoon on May 25, 1993. Ms. Garcia testified that she observed Appellant open the gate to his yard, take Marcia by the hand, cross the field behind the house, and drive off with Marcia in Julia’s station wagon. About fifteen to twenty minutes later, she witnessed Appellant <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>return. She observed Julia go to the car, but Marcia was not in it.

At approximately 6:30 p.m. on May 25, 1993, Appellant approached Sgt. Lawrence Platt and stated ‘You want me, I killed my daughter.” (N.T. 11/17/93, 92). Sgt. Platt asked Appellant to explain how it had happened, but Appellant refused. Sgt. Platt advised Appellant that he could not arrest him without further information, to which Appellant responded, ‘Yes, you have to arrest me.” (N.T. 11/17/93, 93). Sgt. Platt invited Appellant into the Shift Commander’s Office and again asked what had happened. Appellant responded, “I’ll tell you tomorrow,” but refused to give any further information. (N.T. 11/17/93, 94). Sgt. Platt asked Appellant why he was making him wait until tomorrow. Appellant responded, “I’m going to make them suffer, I’m going to put pressure on them like they put pressure on me.” (N.T. 11/17/93, 95). Later Appellant told Sgt. Platt that he put Marcia in the water. When questioned, he reiterated, “I’ll tell you tomorrow.” (N.T. 11/17/93, 98). When pressed further as to where he put her, Appellant responded “Eddy-stone.” (N.T. 11/17/93, 99). At that point, Del Comm was contacted in order that a search boat be dispatched to locate Marcia; however, nothing was found that night. The next day, Marcia’s body was discovered in the Delaware River, near its juncture with Ridley Creek, in an isolated area consisting of industrial and private property. Her body was found about 1,000 feet from the Fourth Street Bridge, which is closed to traffic by a barrier. Based on the testimony of Elsa Martinez and Sgt. Platt, and exhibits depicting the area, the trial court took judicial notice that the location where Marcia was found was approximately four miles from Marcia’s home.</p>

The legislature has provided that a sentencing hearing is required at which evidence may be presented to the jury, or the judge as the case may be.
