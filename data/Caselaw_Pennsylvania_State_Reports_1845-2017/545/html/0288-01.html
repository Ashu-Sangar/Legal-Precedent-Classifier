    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.5",388,[250,533,1149,615]]]'>Instantly, the County has raised a substantial constitutional question that falls within the exception of the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. The question as to the constitutionality of Act 195 as applied to the court-appointed employees in this case is substantial. The County contends that these employees are quasi-judicial and their inclusion in a collective bargaining relationship would be incompatible with the judicial independence expected of such court-appointed employees. Considering as true all of the County’s well-pleaded facts, we find that the County has presented a substantial constitutional question, which this Court has not yet addressed.</p>

The Commonwealth Court found that the County had the following administrative remedies available to it: (1) filing a petition for review of the order in question with the Board before the union election and/or (2) filing exceptions with the Board after the election has been held. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

There is no provision in Act 195 granting the Board the authority to rule on this constitutional issue. <em>See </em>43 Pa.C.S. § 1101.101-2301. Moreover, the Board’s fact-finding expertise is not necessary for the adjudication of the constitutional issue raised.
