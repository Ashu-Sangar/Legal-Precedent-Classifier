      <em>OPINION OF THE COURT</em>
    </p>
    <p class="author" id="b115-9" data-blocks='[["BL_115.10",115,[203,1010,400,39]]]'>FLAHERTY, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b115-10" data-blocks='[["BL_115.11",115,[160,1077,1148,306]]]'>This is an appeal by allowance from an order of the Commonwealth Court which affirmed in part and reversed in part an order of the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Board). At issue is whether medical expenses can be awarded to a worker whose compensation benefits have been terminated.</p>
    <p id="b115-11" data-blocks='[["BL_115.12",115,[156,1417,1151,364]]]'>In 1983, Thomas A. Randall (claimant) suffered a work-related injury to his back while employed as a laborer at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Bethlehem). Claimant was provided compensation benefits until September 27, 1985, at which time a workmen’s compensation judge, Judge Deeley, granted Bethlehem’s petition to terminate benefits. Benefits were terminated effective October 12,1984.</p>
    <p id="b115-12" data-blocks='[["BL_115.13",115,[158,1810,1146,204]]]'>After receiving notice that his benefits were terminated, claimant reported to work on October 7, 1985. However, because he was walking with a cane and asserted an inability to go up steps, he was not permitted to return to his job.</p>
    <p id="b115-13" data-blocks='[["BL_115.14",115,[157,2040,1151,313]],["BL_116.1",116,[256,316,1147,257]]]'>Claimant subsequently filed a petition for reinstatement of benefits. Following a hearing, Judge Deeley concluded that claimant’s injury had recurred. Judge Deeley also determined, however, that claimant could return to work without restriction and without loss of wages. Accordingly, he granted the reinstatement petition in part, and ordered that claim<a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>ant’s compensation benefits be suspended effective October 7, 1985. (In effect, therefore, benefits were reinstated from October 12, 1984 until October 7, 1985.) Further, Bethlehem was ordered to pay medical expenses that claimant incurred after his compensation benefits were terminated.</p>
    <p id="b116-4" data-blocks='[["BL_116.5",116,[251,601,1155,797]]]'>An appeal was taken to the Board, whereupon the award of medical expenses was affirmed and the remainder of Judge Deeley’s decision was reversed and remanded on the basis that his findings of fact were incomplete and inconsistent. On remand, a different workmen’s compensation judge, Judge Baldys, was assigned to the case. Additional hearings were conducted. Judge Baldys concluded that claimant was not a credible witness, that claimant’s offer to return to work on October 7, 1985 was not made in good faith, and that claimant was not precluded from returning to work by any effects of his work injury. Accordingly, Judge Baldys ordered that benefits be suspended as of October 7, 1985. He indicated, however, that were it not for the fact that the Board had already affirmed Judge Deeley’s decision awarding medical expenses, he would simply have dismissed claimant’s petition.</p>
    <p id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.6",116,[250,1424,1148,94]]]'>An appeal was again taken to the Board, and the decision of Judge Baldys was affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.7",116,[246,1545,1150,573]]]'>An appeal to the Commonwealth Court ensued. That court held that claimant’s benefits had been terminated effective October, 1984, and that claimant failed to sustain his burden of proving a recurrence of his disability that would have entitled him to a reinstatement of benefits; hence, the court reversed the portion of the Board’s order which affirmed the reinstatement of benefits through October 7, 1985. The Board’s order was affirmed, however, to the extent that it allowed claimant to be compensated for medical expenses incurred after September 27,1985, the date when the order terminating compensation benefits was issued.</p>

Bethlehem contends that the Commonwealth Court’s holding was <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>inconsistent with that court’s own precedents and our decision in <em>Pieper v.

The court stated:</p>
