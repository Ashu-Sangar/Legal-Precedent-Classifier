The complainant, who appeared intoxicated,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> related to the appellant that she had been drinking all day and that she did not have her current driver’s license in her possession. Accordingly, she requested the officer’s permission to enter her apartment to retrieve her driver’s license and use the bathroom. Appellant acceded to her requests and followed the complainant inside her apartment.</p>

The complainant also testified that, although she was too drunk to remember all of the details, she eventually ended up sitting next to appellant on the couch at which time she alleged that he put his hand up her shirt and fondled her breasts.

She testified that he also placed his hand on the back of her head to direct her toward his penis. She testified that she continuously turned away from appellant causing him eventually to cease his actions and that, as he started to leave, he told her that he would return the next day. The complainant testified that other than pushing her in the bedroom, appellant never used force in any other way, did not appear angry, did not force, her onto the <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>couch, did not hold her down on the couch and that he did not pin her down on the couch.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Nonetheless, shortly after appellant left the apartment, the complainant testified that she went downstairs to use her neighbor’s telephone and at that time told her neighbor that appellant had raped her.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The neighbor called an ambulance for the complainant and while waiting for its arrival, he observed the complainant apparently lapse in and out of consciousness twice.

Hedrick would have also testified that the complainant further asked him “Can you tell me why the hair on a white woman’s vagina is the same as the hair on a black man’s head?” and again started to laugh afterwards. With respect to her demeanor in the ambulance, he would testify that she was very “friendly” towards him, and that she was smiling at him, “looking in his eyes,” and pulling her body towards him throughout the ambulance ride.
