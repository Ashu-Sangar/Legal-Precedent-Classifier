Three of these adjustments involved depreciation: (1) the allocation of the purchase price of the nursing homes; (2) the disallowance of the vendor’s depreciation based on its gain on sale; and (3) the computation of useful asset lives. The remaining two adjustments involve interest: (1) the disallowance of interest expense as to debt below the depreciation basis; and (2) the disallowance of interest expense as to assets purchased from the prior owner’s operating company. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b255-3" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[189,350,1147,421]]]'>
      <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>In June of 1981, Around the World of Pennsylvania (“ATW”) purchased certain assets of the nursing homes from GolMew Suburban Associates (“GSA”). ATW paid $873,-161.13 for the assets of GolMew Manor and $1,254,892.79 for the assets of Suburban/Highland Hall. In March of 1984, ATW merged with Trade Around the World of Pennsylvania (“TAW”), and DPW, for auditing purposes, treated the merger as retroactive to July 1,1983.</p>
    <p id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[183,811,1150,583]]]'>The DPW then took the five actions which Appellants challenge in this matter. First, when TAW purchased the assets of the nursing homes, neither it nor the vendor assigned values to the separate assets included in the sale. Instead, TAW sought to use the reports of two independent appraisers to allocate the purchase price among the categories of land, buddings and equipment. The DPW, however, rejected the appraisals, instead determining the values of the three assets categories according to the prior owner’s allocation. This resulted in lesser depreciation allowances for TAW than it would have received had the appraisals been used.</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[180,1433,1150,472]]]'>Second, in establishing the prior owner’s depreciation, DPW disallowed most of the vendor’s depreciation for its final year of operation because the sale price negotiated with TAW showed that the vendor did not suffer the economic burden of full depreciation for that year. However, when DPW determined TAW’s depreciable basis in the properties, it also disallowed the depreciation allocable to the vendor, including the depreciation disallowed in the vendor’s final year of ownership.</p>
    <p id="b255-6" data-blocks='[["BL_255.7",255,[177,1946,1148,205]]]'>Third, DPW assigned useful lives to the nursing homes based upon the useful lives assigned by the prior owner. Annual depreciation was then determined by dividing each asset’s new cost basis by its original useful life.</p>

This percentage corresponds with that portion of the loan which was used to finance the difference <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>between each facility’s purchase price and its new cost basis, and remains constant throughout the payment of the loan.</p>
    <p id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[245,464,1144,202]]]'>Finally, The Department did not consider the assets purchased from Skilled Health Facilities (“SHF”) by TAW in determining the percentage of interest disallowance. Instead, DPW viewed this conveyance as a separate transaction.</p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.6",256,[241,701,1146,367]]]'>Appellants filed appeals with DPW regarding the above five adjustments, and an administrative hearing on these matters was held on June 23, 1988. After a final order denying the appeals in their entirety was entered on April 27, 1989, Appellants then filed an appeal with the Commonwealth Court, which found all adjustments proper as discussed more fully below.

    <p id="b256-8" data-blocks='[["BL_256.9",256,[240,1900,1149,474]]]'>Appellants first contend that the DPW erred in allocating the purchase prices of the nursing homes according to the prior owner’s allocations. Instead, Appellants assert that the DPW should have used the values assigned by the independent appraisers at the approximate time of the sale. Appellants base their argument on the fact that section IV.D.9.f of the Manual, which governs reimbursement of a long term care facility’s depreciation on capital assets,, is silent as to allocation of costs to groups of assets. The section provides:</p>

    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[190,671,1148,374]]]'>According to Appellants, the DPW’s interpretation is illogical because the prudent purchaser who buys assets at less than fair market value ends up having its reimbursement determined by the prior owner’s allocation. This in turn violates federal mandates to assure rates that are reasonable and adequate to meet costs incurred by efficiently and economically run facilities. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C § 1396a(a)(13)(A).</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.6",257,[187,1085,1149,543]]]'>However, as the Commonwealth Court correctly observed, the Manual requires the assignment of a cost basis according to the <em>lesser </em>of the purchase price or the fair market price as appraised. <em>Suburban, </em><a href="/pa-commw/146/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="146 Pa.

Clearly, the failure of the transaction documents to make an allocation of the purchase price could not deprive DPW of the benefit of the provisions of section IV.D.9.f of the Manual which specified that the cost basis “shall be the <em>lesser </em>of the purchase price or the fair market value ____” (emphasis added). Where the purchase price (or allocated purchase price) cannot be determined from the transaction documents, the method adopted by the DPW in the instant case is <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>reasonable because of the consistency it affords.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.6",258,[280,563,1150,679]]]'>Appellants next contend that the DPW improperly considered the amount of depreciation offset by the gain on sale in computing the prior owner’s depreciation. The DPW offset the seller’s allowable depreciation by the amount of gain seller realized from the sale of the facilities, which Appellants concede is proper under Manual section IY.D.9.e, which provides: “Gains and losses realized from the disposal of depreciable assets, not to exceed 10% of the total allowable depreciation for the year, are an allowable cost.” However, Appellants challenge the DPW’s determination of their depreciable basis in the properties, which did not give Appellants the benefit of an increased cost basis that would result from the disallowance of the seller’s depreciation in its final year of ownership.</p>
    <p id="b258-6" data-blocks='[["BL_258.7",258,[279,1265,1148,524]]]'>The DPW correctly maintains that a buyer’s cost basis under section IV.D.9.f is the purchase price “less any straight line depreciation by the prior owner” without regard to any reduction imposed by DPW under Manual section IV.D.9.e. Such an interpretation of section IV.D.9.f is proper since the section makes no reference to possible adjustment to the straight line depreciation under .the preceding subsection (section IV.D.9.e). Moreover, any other interpretation would result in a windfall increased cost basis (albeit a relatively small one) to the buyer.</p>

Instead, Appellants claim that the DPW should have used an updated useful life (also known as “relifing”), based <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>upon American Hospital Association (“AHA”) guidelines, less years of use. Appellants claim that since the Manual in effect at the time of the assignment was silent on the calculation method, HIM-15 should control.

A useful life of 40 years was assigned, with depreciation taken at a rate of $2,500 per year. In 1982, the building had a fair market value of- $220,000 and was purchased for $200,000. The cost basis to the new owner was $150,000, obtained by taking the purchase price and subtracting the prior owner's depreciation of $50,-000 ($2,500 per year multiplied by 20 years). Applying the DPW's methodology, the new owner would be allowed to take total depreciation of $75,000, at an annualized rate of $3,750 for 20 years (obtained by dividing the $150,000 cost basis by the useful life of 40). This is 150% of the amount of depreciation the prior owner would have been entitled to had he retained ownership.</p>
