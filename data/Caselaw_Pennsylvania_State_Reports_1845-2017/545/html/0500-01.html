Leroy Thompson, an unlicensed cab driver, testified that he drove eighteen-year old Kenyatta Miles, Andre Kinard and sixteen-year old Michael Henry, co-defendants, to the same shopping center on March 17, 1990. The three co-defendants were searching for someone who had allegedly assaulted Miles earlier in the day. Both Miles and Henry were carrying handguns; Miles had a .357 Magnum and Henry had a .22 caliber pistol.</p>
    <p id="b598-6" data-blocks='[["BL_598.6",598,[256,1012,1151,1002]]]'>Demby and Gore each purchased sneakers at Samsung, a store located in that shopping center. When Demby and Gore were leaving the store, Miles approached Gore and asked him about his new sneakers. Gore responded that the sneakers were Jordan’s, size eight and one-half. Gore and Demby then went to Jean’s World, another store, to purchase hats. Upon exiting Jean’s World, Miles and co-defendants Kinard and Henry approached Demby and Gore. Miles pushed Gore against a window and ordered him to hand over his new sneakers. As Miles and Gore were struggling over the bag containing the sneakers, Miles used his .357 Magnum to fire at Gore, but the bullet missed him. Simultaneously, Kinard pushed Demby and attempted to forcibly take his bag containing the sneakers. Then, Henry fired a bullet from his .22 caliber pistol at Demby that did not hit him. Miles fired a second shot that also missed Gore, but his .38 caliber bullet hit Demby in the heart. Miles, Kinard and Henry then fled from the scene carrying Demby’s sneaker bag. Demby died at the scene.</p>

In <em>Bruton, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court held that the introduction of a non-testifying co-defendant’s incriminating statement that implicates another defendant deprives that defendant of his Confrontation Clause rights.

Miles restates his argument that he was prejudiced because his co-defendants’ statements were redacted using an “X” and the jury could not have failed to understand that the letter “X” in the co-defendants’ statements represented Miles.

Miles then gave a statement to Detective Jastrzembski until approximately 4:00 p.m. At 5:30 p.m., Detective Dougherty entered the room, reminded Miles of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and asked Miles if he had read and understood his rights. Miles then gave a second statement.
