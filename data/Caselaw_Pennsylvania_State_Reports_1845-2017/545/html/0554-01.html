She received treatment at the emergency room of Ashland State Hospital and was admitted as an inpatient under the care of Dr. Landis Heistand, an orthopedic surgeon. The next day Dr. Heistand operated on Mrs. Mos-er’s leg. Hospital records describe the procedure as an open reduction and internal fixation of medial malleolus. Dr. Heistand released her from the hospital five days later. On January 7, 1991, Dr. Heistand removed surgical hardware from Mrs. Moser’s leg, and he permitted her to return to work on January 24, 1991. Mrs. Moser continued to see Dr. Heistand until May 6, 1991. From the time of her operation until her last visit, Mrs. Moser told Dr. Heistand that she <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>continued to experience pain in her right leg and had difficulty walking.</p>

Ashland State Hospital and DPW filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, in which they alleged that the Mosers failed to state a cause of action that fell within any of the statutory exceptions to sovereign immunity. The Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County (trial court) sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint against the Commonwealth defendants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Upon review of the Moser’s complaint, the Commonwealth Court determined that it lacked any averment, which if accepted as true, could establish that any specific conduct of Ashland State Hospital or DPW was a substantial factor in causing Mrs. Moser’s harm.

Nevertheless, the medical-professional liability exception to sovereign immunity specifically refers to “[a]cts of health care employees” and “a Commonwealth party who is a doctor, dentist, nurse or related health care professional.” Accordingly, while 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(2) waives sovereign immunity for the negligent acts of specified individuals when they are working at or for a Commonwealth institution, it does not waive sovereign immunity for individuals who act as the corporate entity.</p>

    <p id="b654-11" data-blocks='[["BL_654.14",654,[255,1621,1153,581]]]'>The majority holds that 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(2) does not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity for Commonwealth hospital facilities. As a result of the majority’s reasoning, public hospitals are allowed to operate at a lower standard of medical care than private hospitals. Although a narrow reading of the sovereign immunity exception might lend to the Majority’s conclusion, I do not believe the legislature intended the disparate result of divergent standards of care. Because I read 42 Pa.C.S. § 8522(b)(2) in concert with the corporate liability doctrine and 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922, I do not believe the legislature intended this result, I must respectfully <em>dissent</em>

    <p id="b655-7" data-blocks='[["BL_655.9",655,[180,1190,1154,945]]]'>In this action, Karyl Moser was taken by ambulance to the Emergency Room of Ashland State General Hospital to receive medical treatment by medical professionals under the control of Ashland State General Hospital. Even though two private hospitals, Pottsville Hospital and Good Samaritan Hospital, are in the immediate proximity of the Appellants’ home where Karyl Moser was injured, Moser was not presented with a choice as to which facility she wished to be taken to for treatment. Subsequent to her admission and treatment, Appellees billed Mrs. Moser and her husband in excess of $5,535.00 for services provided. Had she been taken to either Pottsville Hospital or Good Samaritan Hospital, Karyl Moser, in all probability, would have received a similar bill. It is clear under <em>Thompson </em>that either of those facilities would owe her a duty of care. It is illogical that the mere misfortune of being transported to a public rather than a private hospital should result in a patient receiving potentially inferior medical care without a direct remedy.</p>

      <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>This Court adopted the doctrine of corporate liability to hold hospitals accountable for the administering and dispensing of medical care. In light of <em>Thompson </em>we must now move forward in defining the sovereign immunity provisions to hold all hospitals in Pennsylvania to the same standard. In enacting 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922, the General Assembly confers to this Court the ability to prevent absurd and unreasonable results. To hold otherwise allows public hospitals to operate at a lower standard of care than private hospitals.</p>
