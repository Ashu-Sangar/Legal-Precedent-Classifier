Therefore, because the competency of the audiologist was not challenged, <em>Hill </em>cannot be considered persuasive on the issue of whether the testimony and reports of an audiologist are sufficient to support a claim for hearing loss. Unlike <em>Hill, </em>that issue has been challenged in the case <em>mb judice </em>and is squarely before this Court at this time.
