    <p id="b303-6" data-blocks='[["BL_303.7",303,[227,758,1148,744]]]'>Charles W. and Edith McNeil, husband and wife (individually, Mr. McNeil and Mrs. McNeil; collectively, Appellees), commenced this asbestos-related personal injury action following occupational injuries suffered by Mr. McNeil. The complaint, filed in the trial court on November 8, 1985, sought damages for non-malignant conditions allegedly caused by Mr. McNeil’s occupational exposure to the asbestos-containing products of many named defendants. Specifically, these nonmalignant conditions included pleural thickening, asbestosis, and restrictive lung disease. When the case went to trial, the only remaining defendant was Owens Corning (formerly known as Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation), all other defendants having settled, been dismissed or filed for bankruptcy.</p>
    <p id="b303-7" data-blocks='[["BL_303.8",303,[227,1534,1146,258]]]'>Consistent with the standard practice for asbestos-related personal injury actions tried in the trial court, the case was reverse-bifurcated with issues of medical causation and damages comprising the first phase of trial, and, if necessary, issues of liability constituting the second phase of trial.</p>
    <p id="b303-8" data-blocks='[["BL_303.9",303,[226,1824,1150,526]],["BL_304.1",304,[241,312,1145,207]]]'>After the filing of the complaint, but prior to trial, Mr. McNeil was diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer. At trial, Appellees contended that in addition to the non-malignant conditions, asbestos exposure also caused the lung cancer. In addition, Appellees presented evidence at trial of restriction in Mr. McNeil’s activities before his lung cancer diagnosis, which Appellees claimed was attributable to the separate, non-malignant conditions. Defense expert Theodore Rodman, M.D. agreed that Mr. McNeil had lung cancer, but testified that his malignancy was not asbestos-related, but was <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>attributable solely to cigarette smoking.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Dr. Rodman further testified that Mr. McNeil did not have pulmonary asbestosis, but did have very mild pleural thickening, which did not cause any symptoms.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[236,547,1149,419]]]'>The trial court submitted a special verdict slip to the jury consisting of four questions, one on causation, the other three on damages, with the first question asking: “Do you find by a fair preponderance of the evidence that exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing factor in the development of Mr. McNeil’s lung cancer?” The jury answered “no” to this question and, therefore, did not reach the remaining three questions on damages.</p>
    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.6",304,[234,994,1150,363]]]'>Judgment was entered against Appellees and in favor of Owens Corning. By Order dated May 5, 1993, the trial court denied Appellees’ Motion for a New Trial. McNeil appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that the verdict sheet submitted by the trial court improperly precluded an award of damages for Appellees’ alleged non-malignant asbestos-related injuries.</p>
    <p id="b304-6" data-blocks='[["BL_304.7",304,[229,1387,1148,571]]]'>On April 11, 1995, the Superior Court filed an Order and accompanying Opinion vacating the trial court judgment and remanding for a new trial. The Superior Court held that the trial court should have permitted the jury to consider conditions other than cancer in determining whether Appellees were entitled to damages. Judge Olszewski filed a Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, agreeing with the majority’s conclusion that Appellees should be permitted to pursue a claim for Mr. McNeil’s non-malignant conditions, but emphasizing that the new trial should be strictly limited to those non-cancer claims.</p>

On June 6, 1995, the Superior Court entered a per curiam Order denying the Motion for Panel Reconsideration, stating that the case was to be remanded to the trial court on all issues. On December 15,1995, this Court granted Owens Coming’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal. The issue before us is whether the Superior Court erred in granting Appellees a new trial on both the claims of cancer and non-cancer asbestos related injuries. For the following reasons, we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>

In <em>Marinari, </em>the court observed that each disease alleged (i.e., pulmonary disease, lung cancer and mesothelioma) is a separate and distinct disease. This Court explicitly recognized the holding in <em>Marinari </em>recently in <em>Simmons v.

Traditionally, American courts have used the term res judicata to indicate claim preclusion, i.e., the rule that a final judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction on the merits is conclusive as to the rights of the parties and constitutes for them an absolute bar to a subsequent action involving the same claim, demand or cause of action. <em>See, e.g., Matchett v.
