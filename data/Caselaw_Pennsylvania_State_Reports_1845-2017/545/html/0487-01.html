N.T., March 8, 1993, at p. 111. His wife had sent their 5 year old daughter, Priscilla, upstairs to draw Priscilla’s bath water. <em>Id. </em>The Appellant woke up and started to climb the stairs. <em>Id. </em>at 112. The wife heard one scream. <em>Id. </em>She ran upstairs to find the Appellant turning on the cold water tap with Priscilla sitting in the tub of hot water, whereupon the wife snatched Priscilla out of the hot water. <em>Id. </em>The wife called the paramedics who transported Priscilla to the hospital at approximately 11:00 p.m.</p>

N.T. at 73. Around 2 a.m., Nurse Lynn Work started to ask Priscilla questions and Nurse Cindy Ebersole recorded Priscilla’s answers to the questions. <em>Id. </em>at 97-104. In response to questioning by Nurse Work about what happened, Priscilla responded that Daddy turned on the hot water and daddy put me in the water. <em>Id. </em>at 99. Appellant was charged with aggravated assault, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2702(a)(1), and brought to trial before a jury. At the trial, the prosecution intended to call Nurse Ebersole. The defense requested an offer of proof. The prosecution stated that Nurse Ebersole would take the stand and repeat Priscilla’s statements regarding her father. The defense objected to this as being inadmissible hearsay. The prosecution responded that such testimony came within the medical treatment exception. The trial judge ruled in the prosecution’s favor. Thereafter, the prosecution called Nurse Ebersole, who repeated Priscilla’s statements <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>regarding her father. Appellant was convicted of aggravated assault. He appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed his conviction in a memorandum opinion with one judge finding the statement to be admissible pursuant to the medical treatment exception and one judge finding it admissible because it comported with 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5985.1, concerning admissibility of children’s out-of-court statements regarding sexual abuse. One judge, in dissent, found the statement to be outside the scope of the medical treatment exception.</p>
