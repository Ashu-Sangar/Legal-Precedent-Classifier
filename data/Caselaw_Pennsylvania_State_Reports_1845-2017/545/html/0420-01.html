Appellant also contends that even if it were constitutional to allow a Commonwealth psychiatrist to testify as to the examination of a defendant raising an <em>insanity </em>defense, it is inappropriate to allow a psychiatrist to testify as to the examination of a defendant raising a <em>diminished capacity </em>defense. Appellant argues that where an insanity defense is raised, there is no issue of "guilt” because the defendant concedes the act and the requisite mental state but contends that the criminality <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>should be excused because the defendant did not understand the difference between right and wrong. Therefore, Appellant asserts, statements made by the defendant to a Commonwealth psychiatrist cannot be considered incriminating. She asserts that in a diminished capacity defense case, however, the issue of whether the defendant could form specific intent is contested and is an issue of "guilt”; therefore, statements made by a defendant to a State psychiatrist could be considered incriminating and the defendant should not be compelled to undergo the exam. Thus, she asserts, allowing Dr. Kool to examine her violated her privilege against self-incrimination.</p>
      <p id="b522-7" data-blocks='[["BL_522.2",522,[286,1387,1119,479]]]'>Several courts have been presented with the argument that while it may be appropriate to compel an examination by a State psychiatrist of a defendant who raises an insanity defense, it is inappropriate where the defendant has raised a mental infirmity defense other than insanity. The courts have overwhelmingly rejected this distinction as being irrelevant in determining whether a defendant retains the privilege against self-incrimination during the psychiatric interview. <em>See, e.g., Arizona v.

      <p id="b522-8" data-blocks='[["BL_522.3",522,[283,1873,1118,436]]]'>We are in agreement with the majority of these courts on this issue. The rationale supporting our holding in the matter <em>sub judice </em>is that where a defendant has raised a mental disability defense, a defendant has waived his or her privilege against self-incrimination and may be compelled to submit to a psychiatric exam so that the Commonwealth can prepare its case in rebuttal. We have <em>not </em>based our holding on the notion that statements made by a defendant to a Commonwealth’s psychiatrist do not violate the privilege against self-incrimination because they are somehow non-incriminating. Thus, determinations of whether one defense can truly be characterized as involving issues of "guilt” whereas another cannot, simply do not advance our analysis.</p>
