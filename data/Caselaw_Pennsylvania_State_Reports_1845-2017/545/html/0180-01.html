In support of this contention, Appellant cites to the fact that the second penalty phase jury did not have the benefit of hearing all of the facts at trial. He does not explain the significance of this fact or how it renders the aggravating circumstance in this case unsupported by the evidence. Nevertheless, it is our statutory obligation to insure that the sole aggravating circumstance in this case is supported by sufficient evidence. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(h).</p>

(N.T. 1/21/93, 45). With no more cocaine or money to purchase same, he remembered that Ms. Phillips kept cash in her pocketbook. (N.T. 1/21/93, 45). He then went to Ms. Phillips’ house and entered the residence with the intention of stealing money in order to purchase cocaine. (N.T. 1/21/93, 45-46). Upon entering the house, he viciously attacked Ms. Forte and demanded money from her. (N.T. 1/21/93, 45). Appellant also told police that if Ms. Forte had not been present, he would have taken the money from Ms. Phillips’ pocketbook while she was upstairs retrieving his belongings. (N.T. 1/21/93, 49-50). This evidence unquestionably supports the jury’s finding that the killing was committed while in the perpetration of a felony. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In another part of his brief, Appellant sets forth in an argument heading that counsel was ineffective for failure to request a psychological evaluation of Appellant throughout the trial. Although this claim is never developed beyond the mere allegation contained in the heading, it is obvious that our disposition of the underlying issue does not entitle Appellant to relief because counsel can never be deemed ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
