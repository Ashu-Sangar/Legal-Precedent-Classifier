On May 13, 1994, a state trooper filed three traffic citations against Christopher Stock (hereinafter “Appellant”) based upon a hit and run car accident. The charges were 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3743(a); accidents involving damage to an attended vehicle; 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3744(a), breach of duty to give information and render aid; and 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 3714, careless driving. Appellant hired an attorney to represent him before the District Justice, and a hearing was scheduled for August 19,1994 at 10:00 a.m.</p>

In fact, the hearing was not continued and Appellant was found guilty in absentia that same day, August 19,1994. The District Justice imposed 3 separate fines upon Appellant. Thereafter, Appellant notified his attorney of his desire to appeal the conviction rendered in absentia. At the latest, his attorney became aware of Appellant’s desire to appeal by September 6, 1994. Appellant’s attorney did not file a timely appeal; Appellant’s attorney did not file the notice of appeal until September 26, 1994. This was more than 30 days after August 19, within which time the Appellant was required to file a notice of appeal. Pa.R.Crim.P.

Based on the foregoing assertions, the Commonwealth argues that because Appellant had no right to counsel, <em>a fortiori, </em>he had no right to effective assistance of counsel and therefore the principles of ineffective assistance of counsel are not applicable here. Essentially, the Commonwealth argues that since Appellant had no right to effective assistance of counsel, Appellant likewise did not have available to him the remedy of an appeal nunc pro tunc, which is meant to vindicate the right to counsel where such a right (be it constitutional or statutory) exists and where counsel fails to timely perfect an appeal.</p>

At this juncture, we note that the Constitution of this Commonwealth specifically provides Appellant herein a right to appeal his summary conviction. “There shall be a right of appeal in all cases to a court of record from a court not of record; and there shall also be a right of appeal from a court of record or from an administrative agency to a court of record or to an appellate court[.]” <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>Pa.

As demonstrated above, the remedy of a nunc pro tunc appeal is intended to vindicate the appellant’s right to appeal in certain extraordinary situations where that right to appeal has been lost. The remedy of an appeal nunc pro tunc is not as such intended to directly vindicate an appellant’s right to counsel (be it statutory or constitutional). This becomes apparent when we realize that the remedy of a nunc pro tunc appeal is available to litigants in civil cases as well, where no right to counsel exists.</p>

We conclude that it does.</p>

His conviction would stand and he would be without remedy. Appellant is not able to vindicate his right to appeal via the Post Conviction Relief Act since he is not eligible to seek relief thereunder because he is not “incarcerated in this Commonwealth under a sentence of death or imprisonment or on parole or probation.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(2) (listing requirements to be eligible for relief under the PCRA)(emphasis added).

Likewise here, if Appellant’s state constitutional right to an appeal is to have any meaning and is to be vindicated, it can only be vindicated by granting him an appeal nunc pro tunc. Furthermore, it would be entirely unfair in the criminal context to permit Appellant’s state constitutional right of an appeal to be extinguished solely on the basis of his counsel’s failure to timely file the appeal where Appellant had requested an appeal to be filed. <em>Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, we conclude that the Court of Common Pleas abused its discretion in denying Appellant leave to file an appeal nunc pro tunc from the District Justice, and, therefore, reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand this case for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
