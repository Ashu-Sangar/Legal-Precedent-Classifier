Because we find that it is within the trial court’s broad discretion to strike as untimely an answer which blatantly ignores the time limits set by procedural rules and that the trial court does not abuse its discretion in striking an answer where the moving party has failed to seek a default judgment, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the trial court striking appellees’ answer and new matter.</p>
