Crompton, although not visible to the troopers, was in the living room with Homar. The troopers rang the doorbell, announced their presence, opened the screen door and entered the front hall of Crompton’s home. After entering, the troopers found four marijuana cigarettes on a coffee table in the living room and a silver object containing marijuana on the floor. The troopers also discovered five and one-half pounds of marijuana, several water bongs, a pipe, plastic bags and a triple beam scale. Immediately, the troopers arrested Crompton, charging him with violating the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act.1 *<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The case went to trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County (trial court).</p>

Albeit that neither party argued that the second exception applies to this case, the dissenting opinion states, “[a]lthough the record is not well developed, it appears that the second exception to the knock and announce rule set forth in <em>Commonwealth v.

The dissenting opinion adopts one version of the police officer's testimony; "[t]he officers were separated from appellant and the other occupants of the house only by a screen door through which they could see one of the occupants move away from the door when the police rang the bell and identified themselves as police.” This recitation of the facts disregards the trooper’s contradictory testimony that the occupants did not react to the doorbell. Our review of the record does not permit such an interpretation of the officer’s testimony.</p>

That response to the presence of police at the door indicates that the police, who were wearing black jackets with the words “State Police” written across the front in large yellow letters, were most likely visible to the occupahts and that the occupants of the house already knew the officers’ purpose. <em><a href="/pa/531/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="531 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1834400" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0504-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/531/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="531 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1834400" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0504-01">at 508</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="531 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1834400" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0504-01">614 A.2d at 222</a>.
