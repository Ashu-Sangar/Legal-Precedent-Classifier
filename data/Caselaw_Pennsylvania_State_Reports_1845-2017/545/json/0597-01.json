        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal by allowance from an order of the Commonwealth Court which reversed an order of the Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Board (Board) granting a teacher, Alvin Goldberg, one year of service credit for the 1976-77 school year. Goldberg was a full-time salaried employee of the Pennsbury School District (District) when he and other teachers engaged in a strike for 29 days during the 1976-77 school year. In accordance with the collective bargaining agreement that ended the strike, the teachers worked for a total of only 163 days during the school year and they were paid 1/184 of their salaries for each day worked. This fraction reflects the fact that, were it not for the strike, the teachers\u2019 school year would have consisted of 184 days of work.\nThe District subsequently reported to the Pennsylvania School Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PSERS) that the teachers worked for 163 days during the school year. Accordingly, PSERS credited Goldberg with .91 year of service. In computing this credit, PSERS divided the 163 days worked by 180, which is the minimum number of school days in a school year under section 1501 of the Public School Code, 24 P.S. \u00a7 15-1501. This provided a larger credit than would have resulted if, instead of the number 180, the number 184 had been used to reflect the number of days that the teachers were originally scheduled to work.\nGoldberg filed a claim with PSERS requesting that the .91 year credit be replaced with a full one-year credit. A petition to intervene filed by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association was then granted by the Board. Hearings on Goldberg\u2019s claim ensued.\nGoldberg based his claim on a regulation promulgated by the Board pursuant to the Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Code (Retirement Code), 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8101 et seq. The regulation in question, 22 Pa.Code \u00a7 213.2(a)(1), provides in pertinent part:\n(1) A full-time salaried employe shall receive 1 year of credited service for each nonoverlapping period of 12 consecutive employable months for which he contributes for at least 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours of employment.\nIn short, this regulation gives full-time salaried employees one year of service credit for 1,100 hours of employment. It is undisputed that during his 163 days at work in the 1976-77 school year, Goldberg worked a total of 1,222.5 hours.\nThe hearing examiner determined that, under this regulation, Goldberg was entitled to a full year of service credit for the 1976-77 school year. The Board affirmed. The Commonwealth Court subsequently reversed.\nThe Commonwealth Court held that the regulation is contrary to section 8302(a) of the Retirement Code, and, thus, that the regulation is invalid. See Consulting Engineers Council of Pennsylvania v. State Architects Licensure Board, 522 Pa. 204, 206, 560 A.2d 1375, 1376 (1989) (administrative regulation cannot be upheld if it is contrary to the statute under which it was promulgated). In relevant part, section 8302(a) provides:\n(a) Computation of credited service.\u2014In computing credited school service of a member for the determination of benefits, a full-time salaried school employee shall receive one year of credit for each school year or the corresponding fraction thereof, in accordance with the proportion of the full school year for which the required regular member contributions have been made. A per diem or hourly school employee shall receive one year of credited service for each nonoverlapping period of 12 consecutive months in which he is employed and for which contributions are made for at least 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours of employment. If such member was employed and contributions were made for less than 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours, he shall be credited with a fractional portion of a year determined by the ratio of the number of full-day sessions or hours of service actually rendered to 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours, as the case may be.\n24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8302(a) (emphasis added).\nThe Commonwealth Court reasoned that the regulation, by allowing full-time employees a full year of credit for 1,100 hours of employment, is inconsistent with the requirement of section 8302(a) that credit be awarded \u201cin accordance with the proportion of the full school year for which the required regular member contributions have been made.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because the required regular member contributions were made for only 163 days of the 180 day school year, the court held that Goldberg was entitled to credit for only the corresponding fraction of the school year.\nWe agree that the regulation awards credit in a manner that does not take into account the proportion of the full school year that teachers worked and made contributions to the retirement fund. To provide credit for days that teachers did not work or contribute to the retirement fund would be without logical basis. Such an approach would inflate members\u2019 benefits and at the same time increase unfunded liabilities of the pension fund. Section 8302(a) therefore incorporates the simple notion that the portion of the school year for which one receives credit should correspond to the portion of the year that one in fact worked and made contributions to the fund.\nFor full-time salaried employees, the practical effect of the challenged regulation is to treat a \u201cfull school year\u201d as merely 1,100 hours of employment. The Retirement Code does not define the term \u201cfull school year.\u201d It does, however, define a \u201cschool year\u201d as the \u201c12-month period which the governmental entity uses for purposes of administration regardless of the actual time during which a member renders service.\u201d 24 P.S. \u00a7 8102. This definition clearly contemplates that the actual time during which a member renders service may be less than 12 months per year. It does not, however, provide useful guidance as to what period, for the purpose of determining credits for full-time employees under section 8302(a), should be considered a full school year.\nThe Retirement Code states that for per diem or hourly school employees one year of credited service will be granted for each 12 month period in which contributions are made \u201cfor at least 180 full-day sessions or 1,100 hours of employment.\u201d 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8302(a), supra. In drafting 22 Pa.Code \u00a7 213.2(a)(1), the Board attempted to define a full school year for full-time employees in the same manner as the credited service year was defined for per diem and hourly employees. The Board\u2019s effort did not, however, conform to the statute.\nThe Retirement Code quite logically defines the credited service year for per diem and hourly employees in terms of days and hours. Indeed, it would be difficult to conceive of any other method by which the service year for such employees could be specified. The statute does not, however, apply the same definition in the context of full-time salaried employees.\nExamination of section 8302(a), supra, reveals a clear distinction between full-time salaried employees and per diem or hourly employees in terms of the formulas by which their credits are to be determined. Nothing in section 8302(a) suggests a legislative intent that the same hours-based formula should be used for both types of employees. Indeed, section 8302(a) expressly indicates the contrary. By awarding credit to full-time salaried employees in proportion to the fraction of the full school year for which contributions were made, rather than in proportion to a fraction of 1,100 hours worked, section 8302(a) evidences a legislative intent that a full school year is not the same as 1,100 hours of employment. In short, the statute plainly sets a higher standard for full-time salaried employees than for per diem and hourly employees.\nNevertheless, because the Retirement Code fails to specify the exact number of days that are to be deemed a full school year, the term \u201cfull school year\u201d as used in the Code must be construed in accordance with its common usage. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a) (construction of statutory words and phrases shall be in accordance with common and approved usage); DeLellis v. Borough of Verona, 541 Pa. 3,10, 660 A.2d 25, 28 (1995) (\u201cWhere statutory words or phrases at issue are undefined by the statute ... this Court is required to construe the words according to their plain meaning and common usage.\u201d). The plain meaning and common usage of the term school year derives from the Public School Code, which sets at 180 the number of days that constitute a standard school year. It provides:\nAll public kindergartens, elementary and secondary schools shall be kept open each school year for at least one hundred eighty (180) days of instruction for pupils.\n24 P.S. \u00a7 15-1501.\nThe Commonwealth Court did not err, therefore, in concluding that the Board\u2019s regulation defining a full school year as 1,100 hours rather than 180 days was contrary to the Retirement Code. The regulation was properly held invalid.\nOrder affirmed.\nNIX, C.J., and NEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nCAPPY, J., files a dissenting opinion.",

        "text": "CAPPY, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent. Regulations promulgated by an administrative agency are accorded a presumption of validity and reasonableness. Hospital Association of Pa., Inc. v. Foster, 157 Pa.Commw. 363, 629 A.2d 1055 (1993); Pa. Assoc. of Rehab. Facilities v. Foster, 154 Pa.Commw. 555, 624 A.2d 270 (1993). The construction of a statute by those charged with its execution and application is entitled to great weight and should not be disregarded or overturned except for cogent reasons, and unless it is clear that such construction is clearly erroneous. Spicer v. Commonwealth., D.P.W., 58 Pa.Cmwlth. 558, 428 A.2d 1008 (1981). Indeed, an administrative regulation must be upheld unless it is in conflict with the statute under which it was promulgated. See Consulting Engineers Council of Pa. v. State Architects Licensure Bd., 522 Pa. 204, 206, 560 A.2d 1375, 1376 (1989). Moreover, the Board must construe the Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Code (\u201cRetirment Code\u201d) liberally in favor of the retiree, provided that such construction does not violate the express language of the Code. Dowler v. Public School Empl. Ret. Bd., 153 Pa. Commw. 109, 620 A.2d 639 (1993). It is with these standards in mind that the majority should have considered Appellants\u2019 claim.\nThe sole issue before the court is: Whether the Board\u2019s regulation at 22 Pa.Code \u00a7 213.2(a)(1) which construes a \u201cfull school year\u201d for purposes of crediting a full time salaried member\u2019s retirement benefit under 24 P.S. \u00a7 8032(a) as being either 180 days or 1,100 hours of service is clearly erroneous and contrary to 24 P.S. \u00a7 8032? As the majority recognizes, the practical effect of the regulation is to treat a \u201cfull school year\u201d as merely 1,100 hours of employment. (Majority at 293) The majority also correctly notes that the Retirement Code nowhere defines the term \u201cfull school year.\u201d Id. The majority also notes that the Retirement Code does define \u201cschool year\u201d as the \u201c12-month period which the governmental entity uses for purposes of administration regardless of the actual time during which a member renders service.\u201d 24 P.S. \u00a7 8102. The majority concludes that the Retirement Code\u2019s definition of \u201cschool year\u201d does not, \u201chowever, provide useful guidance as to what period, for the purpose of determining credits for full time employees under section 8302(a), should be considered a full school year.\u201d Id. With all of the foregoing, I agree. Moreover, I find what the majority has said in these passages to be dispositive of the issue before this court.\nInsofar as Retirement Code is admittedly silent as to the definition of a \u201cfull school year,\u201d it is impossible to see how the Board\u2019s regulation, defining full school year as being either 180 days or 1,100 hours of service, can be contrary to 24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8101-8535, the statute under which the regulation was enacted generally or more specifically, contrary to 24 Pa. P.S. \u00a7 8302(a). The mere fact that \u00a7 8302(a) makes reference to awarding full time salaried employees credit in proportion to a fraction of the full school year and awarding per diem or hourly employees credit in proportion to either 180 days or 1,100 hours does not, in my opinion, evidence a legislative intent to necessarily define a \u201cfull school year\u201d for full time salaried employees in terms other than 1,100 hours. Following the logic of the majority, the fact that the statute specifically indicates that the per diem or hourly employees are to be awarded credit in proportion to 180 days or 1,100 hours whereas full time salaried employees are to be awarded credit \u201cfor each school year or the corresponding fraction thereof\u2019, the legislature must have intended a full school year for such full time salaried employees to mean something other than 180 days. Indeed, this is the precise definition which the majority today herein adopts. Such linguistic gymnastics are unnecessary to resolve this case. Viewing the matter under the deferential standard of review as set forth above, we need ask only one question: Is the regulation contrary to the statute under which it was promulgated? As the majority admits that the statute is silent as to what constitutes a full school year, and the regulatory definition is not contrary to the express language of the Retirement Code, the regulation defining \u201cfull school year\u201d should be upheld.\nFinally, the majority, after rejecting the reasonable definition of \u201cfull school year\u201d promulgated by the Retirement Board in 22 Pa.Code \u00a7 213.2(a)(1), looks to a statute other than the Retirement Code for a definition of \u201cfull school year.\u201d The majority asserts that the \u201cplain meaning and common usage of the term school year derives from the Public School Code, which sets at 180 the number of days that constitute a standard school year.\u201d Majority op. at 603, citing 24 P.S. \u00a7 15-1501. However, this totally ignores the fact that the Public School Code also permits the Secretary of Education to define the full school year in terms of 990 hours of instruction at the secondary level and 900 hours of instruction at the elementary level. 24 P.S. \u00a7 15-1504. Additionally, I note that the 163 day school year at issue herein counted as a full school year for purposes of student advancement to the next grade; for purposes of credit for a teacher\u2019s eligibility for sabbatical leave; and for purposes of advancement by teachers on the salary schedule. That the term \u201cfull school year\u201d can mean different things in different statutory contexts (and even within the same statutory context) and for different purposes proves to me that the Board\u2019s regulation which defines \u201cfull school year\u201d for purposes of crediting retirement benefits, where the Retirement Code is admittedly silent as to the definition, is not unreasonable, and therefore, should not be stricken.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n. The Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Board is the agency charged with the execution and application of the Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Code, 24 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 8101-8534. Laurito v. Public School Emp. Ret. Bd.., 146 Pa.Commw. 514, 606 A.2d 609, 611 .(1992). See also 24 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8502(h).\n. The majority at p. 602 of the opinion states \u201c[b]y awarding credit to full-time salaried employees in proportion to the fraction of the full school year for which contributions were made, rather than in proportion to a fraction of 1,100 hours worked, section 8302(a) evidences a legislative intent that a full school year is not the same as 1,100 hours of employment.\u201d By this logic, the fact that the statute states that a \"full-time salaried employee shall receive one year of credit for each school year\u201d (emphasis added) rather than \"for each 180 days served\u201d as the statute provides in the very next sentence for per diem or hourly employees evidences a legislative intent that a full school year is not the same as 180 days.",
