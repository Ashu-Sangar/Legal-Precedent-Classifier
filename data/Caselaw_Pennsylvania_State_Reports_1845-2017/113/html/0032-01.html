In such case the reasoning of the exceptants might well be deemed irresistible ; that notwithstanding the words “I hereby unqualifiedly revoke ” made use of in the codicil, the manifest intention of the testatrix was simply to add to the amount to be received by the beneficiaries, and that her intention therefore could not have been to revoke the bequests already given by her will if the larger bequests of the codicil would become inoperative. I would prefer to base the construction upon this broad and reasonable ground, rather than upon a strict adherence to language susceptible of another interpretation, were the uses of these bequests really identical. But in the will I find the bequests, although to the same churches as in the codicil, yet for uses not precisely identical. The churches are but the trustees for certain uses in both; but in the will the bequests are to be applied “to the use and benefit of the Missionary funds of each of the said churches respectively ” generally and in the codicil I find they are to be confined to “the use and benefit of the Home Missions of each of said churches respectively.” Under the first bequest the fund could have been applied to the use and benefit of foreign’ missions; but under the last they could not. There is such a difference therefore in the uses of the legacies that it is impossible to. say bow much the change in this regard may have influenced the testatrix in her express revocation of the first form of the bequests ; and therefore I cannot see any way to tlie conclusion so earnestly argued in behalf of the exceptants, that, although the bequests in the codicil to the churches are void, the bequests in the will for which they have been substituted can be sustained.</p>
