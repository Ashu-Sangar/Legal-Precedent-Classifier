    <p class="summary" id="b217-7" data-blocks='[["BL_217.6",217,[226,1194,1175,1038]]]'>The Act of 1840 is to be construed in harmony with the Act of June 16th, 1836, regulating executions, where it is provided that no exception shall he issued upon any judgment after the expiration of the period fixed (originally a year and a day, but subsequently enlarged to five years), unless the party defendant shall be first warned by <em>scire facias, </em>etc. By the Act of April 16th, 1840, a judgment transferred to another county is to have the same force and effect, and no other, as if originally entered in the Court to which it is thus transferred. The Statute does not give full status to such judgment obtained by transfer. As said by Judge Gibson, in Brandt’s Appeal, 4 Harris, 846, “It is not, then, a very judgment, but a <em>quasi </em>judgment, and that, too, only for limited purposes. It is affected with all the weakness of the original, and must stand or fall with it.” Nor can such judgment by transfer be itself transferred to another county: Mellon <em>v. </em>Guthrie, <a href="/pa/15/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="15 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="408737" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0116-01">15 Pa. St., 116</a>. And it is transferred in its character as a judgment, and not as a lien. Thus, until the recent Act of Assembly, an award of arbitrators could not be transferred until the judgment had become absolute by failure to appeal: Hall-man’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20810" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="18 Pa. 810">18 Pa. St. 810</a>. Nor could a verdict docketed as a lien bo transferred: Bailey <em>v. </em>Elder, <a href="/pa/90/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="90 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="1065630" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0446-01">90 Pa. St., 446</a>; nor a decree in equity for the payment of money: Brooke <em>v. </em>Phillips, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20Pa.%20183" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="88 Pa. 183">88 Pa.

If, in such state, it is transferred to another county, it is to have the same force and effect, and no other, as if originally entored in such county. The condition <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>in which it is, is continued in its transferred state, otherwise it would be given a new force and effect, and one which it did not before possess. In its unrevived condition it had in a certain sense ceased to bind the defendant’s person. How could the mere transfer remove this condition, when by the very terms of the Act it is to have no other force and effect than if originally entered in the Court to which it is transferred? Such transfer is said by C. J. Lowbie, in King <em>v. </em>Nimick, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20298" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="34 Pa. 298">34 Pa. St., 298</a>, to have a strong analogy to a' <em>testatum </em>execution. But it is clear that no <em>testatum </em>could run from an unrevived judgment into another county.</p>

St., 420</a>. The question there was of lien merely, and not of execution. The judgment when transferred was in full life, and the Court simply held that it acquired a lien b3 its transfer, distinct from and independent of the lien in the old county, so that the expiration there did not affect the judgment as transferred.</p>

If the original judgment be set aside, the judgment entered on the transcript falls with it. The latter is not an independent and self-sustaining judgment. Two independent judgments of the very same kind, each binding the person, and each for the same thing, cannot be sustained. If it were otherwise, the payment of one would not be a satisfaction or discharge of the other.</p>
