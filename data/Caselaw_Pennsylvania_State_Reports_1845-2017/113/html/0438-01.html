After her arrival in this city Mr. Gamier bought a grocery store at Tenth and Manilla streets, fitted it up and stocked it at his own expense, and placed Mrs. McLean in charge 5 he replenished the stock from time to time, and Mrs. McLean paid him as she got money from the receipts of the store.</p>

This store was also sold at a good profit and Mrs. McLean received the price. The relationship between Mrs. McLean and Mr. Gamier was most intimate. He was her friend and adviser, and in the. language &gt;of one of the witnesses was more like a son to her than a nephew. At the instance of Samuel, the son of Mrs. McLean, she had her life insured in the Provident Savings and Life Assurance Society of New York, in two policies — one of them in her own favor, and the other in favor of her nephew, James Garnier, the latter policy was for 12,000, and neither it nor the application for it had any reference to any indebtedness from Mrs. McLean to Mr. Gamier, or that it was taken to secure any indebtedness. In fact, the defendant Garnier, in his answer and his counsel on argument, disclaimed that it was taken out to secure an indebtedness, and avowed that there never had been a settlement between Mrs. McLean and Mr. Garnier, and from the nature of their intimacy could not be, and stated to the Master that if his right to the proceeds of the policy was not otherwise absolute, he would not, and did not, claim it by reason of any indebtedness.</p>

Poverty may overtake the father in his lifetime, and thus both father and mother be cast upon the son, or if the father die before her, the necessity may fall at once upon the son. Why then should he not be permitted to make a provision by insurance, to reimburse himself for his outlays, past or future ? What injury is done to the insurance company ? They receive the full premium, and they know in such case, from the very relationship of the parties, that the contract is not a mere gambling adventure, but is founded in the best feelings of our nature, and on a legal duty which may arise at any time.”</p>

It is very clear that the insurance was obtained in good faith and not for the purpose of speculating upon the hazard of a life in which he had no interest: Scott <em>v. </em>Dickson, <em>supra. </em>The policy in question shows the willingness of the company to take the risk on the ground of relationship alone.”</p>

It may be stated generally, however, to be such an interest, arising from the relations of the party obtaining the insurance, either as creditor of or surety for the assured, or from the ties of blood or marriage to him, as will justify a reasonable expectation of advantage or benefit from the continuance of his life. It is not necessary that the expectation of advantage or benefit should be always capable of pecuniary estimation ; for a parent has an insurable interest in the life of his child, and a child in the life of his parent; a husband in the life of his wife, and a wife in the life of her husband. The natural affection in cases of this kind is considered as more powerful — as operating more efficaciously- — to protect the life of the insured than any other consideration. But in all cases there must be a reasonable ground, founded upon the relations of the parties to each other, either pecuniiary or of blood or affinity, to expect some benefit or advantage from the continuance of the life of the assured. Otherwise the contract is a mere wager, by which the party taking the policy is directly interested in the early death of the assured. Such policies have a tendency to create a desire for the event. <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>They are, therefore, independently of any statnte on the subject, condemned, as being against public policy.</p>

Between husband and wife, and parent and child, the relationship is so close and intimate, and the mutual dependence and legal liability for support so manifest, that nothing more is wanting to establish the insurable interest. Gamier, however, did not hold any such relation to Ellen M’Lean, either natural or assumed; he was simply her “ friend and adviser.” He was doubtless a valuable friend ; he had advanced money to bring her to Philadelphia; he fitted up, stocked, and from time to time, replenished the store at Tenth and Manilla; having disposed of this for her benefit, he purchased the establishment on Fitzwater; and, selling this, he bought for her a third, on Fifth below Christian. She repaid Gamier, however, for his outlays, in her behalf, from time to time, from the ordinary receipts of the several stores, and from the proceeds of the sales.</p>

It is not denied that at the date of the policy Mrs. McLean was indebted to Gamier, for money advanced and expended in her behalf, in some amount between $500 and $750. It is said, however, in his answer that Gamier disclaims as a creditor; that he places" his right to the proceeds of the policy on other grounds, and makes no claim whatever by reason of any indebtedness. We do not so understand either the answer or the evidence, given by the defendant in the case. The bill charges, in the first paragraph, in substance, that the policy was taken out and applied as a collateral security to the debt, which Mrs. McLean then owed Gamier, and in the subsequent paragraphs, that the debt having been fully paid in the lifetime of the assured, the proceeds of the policy should pass into her estate. This fact is specifically denied; the defendant, in his answer, says it is “ not true that the policy of insurance referred to in paragraph one of the complainant’s bill was applied for, and issued upon, the life of Ellen McLean for any such reason or purpose as therein stated.”</p>

Upon examination of the proofs, we find no evidence from which the fact might be fairly inferred. The insurance was not effected at the instance of Mrs. McLean, but at the suggestion of her son Samuel McClatcliy, in whose name a second policy in $1,000 was at the same time issued. The premiums were paid and the policy maintained by Gamier; indeed, there is not the slightest proof in support of the plaintiff’s hypothesis, that the policy was held in trust for the debtor, and, in the absence of such proof, the presumption is that the rights of the parties appear upon llic face of the policy: Cunningham <em>v. </em>Smith, 20 P.

Lewis, in fact, only owed Cammack $70, although he voluntarily and without consideration gave his obligation at the time for $3,000. “If the transaction,” says Mr. Justice Miller, “ as set up by Cammack be true, then, so far as he was concerned, it was a sheer wagering policy, and probably a fraud on the insurance company. To procure a policy for $3,000 to cover a debt of $70 is of itself a mere wager. The disproportion between the real interest of the creditor and the amount to be received by him deprives it of all pretence to be a <em>bona fide </em>effort to secure the debt, and the strength of this proposition is not diminished by the fact that Cammack was only to get $2,000 out of the $3,000; nor is it weakened by the fact that the policy was taken out in the name of Lewis aud assigned by him to Cammack.
