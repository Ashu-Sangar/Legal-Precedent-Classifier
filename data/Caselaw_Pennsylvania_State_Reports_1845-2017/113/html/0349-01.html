Kent says “the most comprehensive, if not the most precise definition in the English books is, that public Acts relate to the Kingdom at large, and private Acts concern the particular interest or benefit of certain individuals, or of particular classes of men. Generally speaking, statutes are public; aud a private statute may rather be considered an exception to a general rule. It operates upon a particular thing or private persons: ” 1 Kent, 460. Sedgwick says the best definition is that given by Dwarris, “ Thatpublic Acts relate to the public at large, and private Acts concern the particular interest or benefit of certain individuals or of particular classes of men.” Dwarris on Statutes, 464. There are many cases in the books upon the distinction between public and private Acts. A note in Bacon’s Abridgment, volume 9, page 231, also found in Chitty’s Blackstone page 231, contains a noto iu the printed report from the committee for the promulgation of the statutes, in which it is said that “ Acts are deemed to be public and general Acts, which the judges will take notice of without pleading, viz., Acts concerning the king, the queen, and the prince; those concerning all prelates, nobles and great officers; those concerning the whole spirituality; and those <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>which concern all officers in general, such as all sheriffs, &amp;c. Acts concerning trade in general, or any specific trade ; Acts concerning all persons generally, though it be a special or particular thing, such as a statute concerning the assizes, or woods in forests, chases, &amp;c., &amp;c. Private Acts are those which 'concern only a particular species, thing or person, of which the judges will not take notice without pleading them, viz. Acts relating to the bishops only; Acts for toleration of dissenters ; Acts relating to any particular place, or to divers particular towns, or to one or divers particular counties, or to the colleges only in the universities.”</p>

In England it is clear that such a statute is regarded as special. It will ¡afford any one who has the time and takes* an interest, much pleasure, and, perhaps, instruction, if he will carefully read the reported English cases on the question in hand. The statute of Westminster, which says that no sheriff or other minister of the king shall take any reward to do his office, but be satisfied with what he receives from the king, was held .to be a public statute, because it extends to all officers : 4 Re]!., 76, Holland’s case; Bacon’s Abridgement, volume 9, page 233.</p>

This statute was enacted in 1444. Before this the sheriff was not obliged to bail one arrested on mesne process, unless he sued out a writ of mainprise, though he might have taken bail of his own accord. This .arbitrary power, which sheriffs possessed, of bailing, or refusing to bail, produced great extortion and oppression. It took three hundred and forty-four years for the English courts to settle the question as to whether this is a public or private statute. In some of the cases it was held that it only relates to sheriffs, and is therefore a private statute, whilst in others it was held that, though it relates to officers of a certain description, yet all the king’s subjects are included in it, for it gives to all of them the right to give bail. The following are a few of the cases in which the statute was held to be private: 2 Saund., 154; Benson <em>v. </em>Welby, 2 Plowd., 65; Sid. 439. The contrary was held in 2 Lev., 1Ó3; Okey <em>v. </em>Sell, 1 Lev. 8,3; Sid. 23; Samuel <em>v. </em>Evans, 2 Term Rep., 569; Lovell <em>v. </em>Sheriffs of London, 15 East, 320; 2 Saund., 155 note. All the cases are collected in Bacon’s Abridgement. The last is the said case of Samuel <em>v. </em>Evans. That was a <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>well considered case and ail the authorities on both sides cited by counsel and the Court. Ashurst, J. said: “If all the cases on this subject were on one side, however apparently contrary to reason they might be, the Court would be bound by them; but if there be several cases, which are not reconcilable with reason on one side, and one sensible case to the contrary, we ought to decide according to the latter. Now there can be no doubt on the reason of the thing, but that the statute of 23 Hen. IV., is a general law; for though it is said to relate to officers of a certain description, yet all the king’s subjects are included in it, for it gives to all of them the liberty of being bailed.” Bulker, J., in an opinion in the same case, said: “It is astonishing that a doubt could ever have arisen whether the statute 23 Hen. IV., c. 9 were a general law or not, for it alludes to all arrests, and every person who may be arrested is within the provisions of it.” In Holland’s case, 4 Co. 76, it was held that “office was a general word or genus; sheriff is a special word or species; and sheriff of Norfolk is <em>individmm; </em>and the statute 23 Hen. VI., c. 9, which extends only to sheriffs, is but a particular and special Act.” It will be observed that all the cases holding the Act to be public, put it on the ground that all the king’s subjects are included in it. It is therefore clear, X think, that at the common law an Act which relates only to a certain description of officers, such as sheriffs, prothonotaries, &amp;c., is a special Act. That being so, the Act of Assembly in question in this case is clearly a special Act. Indeed, it only relates to certain persons or individuals after they have, gone out of office, for it gives them the right to sue for fees “within six years after the expiration of their official terms.” It is an Act relating to certain individuals, giving them privileges not given to all the citizens of the Commonwealth.</p>

The legislature may pass special laws in all cases not mentioned in the article of the constitution referred to. I am of opinion that it is an Act regulating, in some sense, the jursidiction of justices of the peace. It extends their jurisdiction throughout the whole state. It changes the rules of evidence. It makes a certificate of a prothonotary, that any bill of fees appears by the record of his office to be correct, <em>prima facie </em>evidence that such fees are lawfully due and correct. It is an Act providing or changing, in one sense, the method for the collection of debts, or the enforcing of judgments.

The Act comes clearly within the constitutional prohibition. It was passed for a particular purpose; it is an exception to a general law; it relates to particular persons; it relates to a class of a class of persons; and it extends the powers of justices of the peace and of constables; it changes the rules of evidence, the methods of collecting debts and enforcing judgments.</p>

L., 25), to recover from defendants, residents of Northampton county, certain fees earned by him, as sheriff, in a case in which they were plaintiffs. The summons, directed to a constable of Northumberland, was served in <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>Northampton county by a deputy residing there, but defendants did not appear.</p>

In these and other particulars it is clearly in conflict with the constitutional provisions above quoted.</p>
