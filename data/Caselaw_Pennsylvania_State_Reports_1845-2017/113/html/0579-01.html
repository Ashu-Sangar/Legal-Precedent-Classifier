We think it is so divisible. It is laid down by Chitty, as the result of the cases, ‘that agreements in restraint of trade, whether under seal or not, are divisible, and, accordingly, it has been held that when such an agreement contains a stipulation which is capable of being construed divisiblv, and one part thereof is void, as being in restraint of trade, whilst the other is not, the Court will give effect to the latter and will not hold the agreement to be void altogether.’ The cases cited in support of the proposition are Chesman <em>v. </em>Nainby, 2 Strange, 739; Wood <em>v. </em>Benson, 2 Crompton &amp; Jervis, 94; Malian <em>v. </em>May, 11 Meeson &amp; Welsby, 653; Price <em>v. </em>Green, 16 Id., 346; Nichols <em>v. </em>Stretton, 3.0 Queen’s Bench, 346.

The restriction (as to the county where plaintiff’s works are located) does no more than afford a fair protection to the plaintiff; it does not unfavorably affect the public, nor does it oppress the defendant.

Ch., 340. In equity a decree is not of right, but of grace, and a chancellor will refuse to enjoin if in conscience it appear he would do greater injury by enjoining than by leaving the party to his redress by a Court and jury: Reichard’s Ap., <a href="/pa/57/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="57 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1010471" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0105-01">57 Pa. St., 105</a>. Applying these familiar rules to this ease, it is difficult to see how the decree could have been made. Fell needed no protection. He was engaged in no business that suffered by the engagement of Smith with Blabon. Without appreciable damage to Fell, the appellant is deprived of the right and ability to earn his living, simply because of a hard bargain. A chancellor must have a sensitive conscience that could be moved into action by the appeal of Fell. The Courts of law are open to Fell if the contract is legal. There, he can be compensated, through adequate forms of procedure, for any damage he may have sustained.

The plaintiff had issued execution on his judgment against said corporation, by virtue of which the sheriff had seized all its property, including property claimed by the defendant, and advertised the same for sale on May 24th, 1883.</p>
    <p id="b605-8" data-blocks='[["BL_605.8",605,[216,1204,1181,650]]]'>On the day before the sheriff’s sale the agreement was made. That all the parties to the agreement were in some way interested in the business and property is obvious. And it is also apparent that they contemplated that Fell would buy the machinery and plant at the sheriffs sale. Among other things they covenanted that Fell should release the levy on the goods claimed by tfie defendant, that he should pay the employés of Smith &amp; Reazor the amount due them, and that he would make no claim for royalty under the contract between Smith &amp; Reazor and said corporation, dated July 15th, 1882; and the other parties jointly and severally covenanted to forthwith cease the manufacture of ochre, and not at anj'- time thereafter either as principals or principal, or by or as agents, or employés, or in any other way, engage in the manufacture of ochre in the county of Lehigh or elsewhere.</p>

There is no difficulty about the sufficiency of the consideration for the defendant’s covenant. It is more than the release of the property he claimed, if that is of doubtful sufficiency. C. W. Smith, one of the parties of the second part, is his son ; he jointly and severally with his son and Reazor, covenanted with Fell, the other party, in consideration of Fell’s covenants, to cease the business and not engage in it in the future. The joint and several covenant of the three was the inducement to Fell. The agreement and the sheriff’s sale of the property of the corporation, put all the interested parties out of the business, except Fell, and put him in with a covenant by the three that they would not again engage in the business. In effect the plaintiff became the purchaser of <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>the property and relieved the others from payment of indebtedness. It was altogether reasonable to settle the dispute about the ownership of the property claimed by the defendant; there is nothing to show that either party to that dispute was acting in bad faith. That it was’ reasonable for Fell to agree to pay certain debts, and release the claim for royalty, cannot be gainsaid. This agreement seems to be fairly within cases ; of the first class, upheld as legal, as stated in the appellant’s jargument, namely, “sales of stock and good will, with cove- / nant not to carry on the business on the same spot in opposition ' to the purchaser.”</p>
