The relator, T. P. Smart, was a contractor of the said city, and the respondent, Robert P. Dechert, controller of the city and county of PliiladelphiaThe alternative writ recited that under authority of an ordinance passed June 24th, 1881, the relator had constructed a <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>sewer for the city, that certain property on the line was not subject to assessment or municipal charge for the construction, and that by an ordinance approved June 9th, 1885, the chief engineer and surveyor was directed to draw, and the city controller authorized to countersign, a warrant for $600, to pay for the construction of said sewer in front of the property referred to; that the chief engineer had drawn the warrant as directed, but the controller had refused to countersign it, and had returned it to the chief engineer, and that the relator had no specific remedy at law for the grievance thus sustained. The controller was, therefore, commanded to countersign the warrant or show cause why he should not.</p>
    <p id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[240,939,1178,249]]]'>The controller made a formal return to the alternative writ, and to that return the relator filed a demurrer. All matters, therefore, sufficiently set forth in the return must be taken for true, and these with the material allegations of the writ, not traversed by the return, constitute the substantial facts upon which this case is to be determined.</p>
    <p id="b251-7" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[238,1199,1182,549]]]'>The respondent in his return to the writ as the controller of the city and county of Philadelphia, claims to exercise a discretionary power under the law in refusing to countersign the ■warrant referred to, and that in the exercise of that discretion, he was not subject to the direction of the Court; further, that under the provisions of the ordinance of city councils, and by the terms of the contract under which the work was done, the construction of the sewer had been fully paid for; that the city owed no debt, and was under no obligation whatever to the contractor therefor, that the appropriation was therefore not authorized by law, and that in the proper exercise of bis duties as controller, he was required to withhold his signature from the warrant.</p>

Whilst the writ may perhaps be awarded to set the latter class of officers in motion, and to compel action upon the particular matters over which they may have jurisdiction, it will in no manner interfere with the exercise of that discretion nor control or dictate the judgment, or decision which shall be reached. It is unnecessary to quote authorities in support of this plain and well established principle of tlie law; such has been the uniform course of all the decisions, and in this case we do not understand the doctrine to be denied. The question for our consideration, therefore, is whether or not the controller of the city and county of Philadelphia in the exercise ’ of his <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>officg, when called upon to countersign a warrant, is invested with a discretionary power in the performance of that duty, or whether his duty in this respect is merely ministerial.</p>

The ordinance provides further as follows: “It shall be a condition of the contracts awarded under the provisions of this ordinance that the contractor shall accept assessment bills as so much cash paid by the citj on the said contract, and that he shall collect the same at his own cost without recourse to the city in any event.” By ordinance approved February 16th, 1869, the rate was increased to $1.50 per foot front.</p>

Smart, the relator, under a written contract with the city, agreed to construct the sewer on Sixty-third street as authorized by the ordinance of 24th June, 1881; the price and mode of payment were agreed upon as follows: “For sewer, three feet in diameter, per lineal foot and man-holes, the sum of the assessment bills given by the survey department against the properties or premises fronting on the streets on which the sewer forming the subject of this contract is to be constructed, which said bills the said party of the second part agrees to accept in full for all work done under this contract. The said party of the second part further agrees to make no claim whatever upon the city of Philadelphia, excepting upon bills against city property,it being distinctly understood and agreed that the city of Philadelphia does not in anywise guarantee any of the said bills to be good and collectible. Payments for the entire work shall be made by the chief commissioner of highways upon estimates signed by the chief engineer and surveyor in assessment bills, prepared as specified in section 2 of ordinance ‘regulating the assessment upon property for the construction of sewers,’ approved May 12th, 1866, and warrants upon the city treasurer to an amount as authorized by <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>ordinance approved April 3d, 1868, in payment for the street intersections, manholes, and legal deductions. All of which payments shall be received as so much cash, and be collected without recourse to the city of Philadelphia; but for the purpose of the better enabling the contractor to collect the same, the name of the said city may be used, and all her legal remedies, whether by bill or otherwise, employed.”</p>
    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[235,732,1179,1124]]]'>Smart constructed the sewer, and, it is admitted, received the assessment bills in full for the work, according to contract, including two against the Grandom Institute, the property on the east side of Sixty-third street,extending along the whole length of the sewer. He subsequently, on February 1st, 1882, filed in the name of the city of Philadelphia, to his own use, two claims for the construction of the sewer against the Grandom Institute and the said property, which claims are entered in the Court of Common Pleas No. 4, of Philadelphia. Having issued writs of <em>scire facias, </em>the Grandom Institute pleaded nonassumpsit, and that the property was rural; the relator replied that the property was not rural. The relator ordered the cases on the trial list, but no further proceedings appear of record, and the suits remain pending and unsatisfied. By the express terms of the general ordinance of May 12tb, 1866, as well as by the ordinance of June 24th, 1881, under and subject to which the contract was made, as well as by the conditions of the contract itself, payment was to be made in assessment bills, which were accepted as cash, to bo collected at the contractor’s cost, and without recourse to the city in any event. It was expressly provided, also, that the city did not “in any wise guarantee any of the said bills to be good and collectible.” It is plain, therefore, that the city owed Smart nothing for the construction of the sewer; he had been paid in full four j’ears before the ordinance was passed authorizing the warrant, and paid precisely as tile contract provided.</p>

There was no mistake, no change of circumstances, or an3 other intervening matter wliich caused the contract to operate oppressively on the contractor; the parties stood on equal ground, no advantage was taken in the contract, and the law, as well as the facts, was presumably as well known to one pai^r as to the other.</p>

The power to raise money for city purposes, and also the power to disburse it, subject to certain restrictions, is vested in the city councils, and the warrants, which issue from the several departments, are drawn up under such regulations of the councils as may best serve the public couvenience and promote the dispatch of business.</p>

    <p id="b255-8" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[228,1514,1179,911]]]'>It was his duty in any case, before countersigning the warrant, to know that the appropriation necessary for each department had been made, and that the total was within the estimate of the income, as required by the Act of 1879; to be satisfied that the warrant covered items for which appropriations had been made, and that these appropriations had not been exhausted, as required by the Act of 1856; these inquiries, as they involved no particular exercise of discretion, are perhaps of a clerical, and therefore of a ministerial character only. But other duties devolved upon him ; as the superintendent of the fiscal affairs of the city, (Act 2d February, 1854,) it was his duty to do what he might “ deem needful to protect the interests of the said city.” (Act 13th May, 1856.) • To this end (Act 2d February, 1854), he was invested with all the powers, and directed to perform all the duties, enjoined by law on county auditors; and as a legal sanction to the just and full performance on bis part of these duties, in the interests of the city, it was declared (Act 21st April, 1855), to be a misdemeanor in office, and to subject him to the pains and penalties of the criminal law, if be should “ pass any bill or order for any object not authorized by law.”</p>

It is his duty, of course, to respect the contracts lawfully made on part of the city, and to discharge the legal obligations of the city, by countersigning warrants, regularly drawn in payment thereof, but it must be conceded that he was not bound to do what in his judgment was by the law positively forbidden.</p>

Iiis jurisdiction as Controller, in the performance of the duties of the county auditors, was as full and complete as that of the courts, and he was entitled to exercise these important functions free from all interference. The Court might, when a proper case was presented, correct an error in judgment on part of the Controller, but they would not bj mandamus interfere in advance with that discretion which it was his right and duty freely to exercise, or dictate the decision which, in a given case, he must reach.</p>

Had the controller refused to act in the matter at all, the Court by its mandamus might have compelled him to act, hut this was all it could do, but after he had acted, and had refused to sanction the warrants it was a mere piece of usurpation on the part of the Court to attempt to compel him to revise his decision, and adopt its judgment in preference to his own.</p>
