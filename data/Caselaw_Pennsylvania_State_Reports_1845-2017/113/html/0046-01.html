No dissatisfaction appears to have been expressed by the mother of the minors, with the management of their interests by the guardian, nor by the wards themselves, who are now of an age to understand business matters and quite competent, in fact, although not in law, to object to any mismanagement of their interests.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[239,511,1182,691]]]'>It is doubtless true that as a general rule a guardian cannot legally charge for improvements made upon the land of his ward, without an order of Court permitting such expenditure. As said in the case of Ebert <em>v. </em>Ebert, 5 P. P. S., 120, the guardian makes such improvements at his own risk, otherwise he might improve his wards out of their property. But it does not follow from this that when improvements have been judiciously made in good faith, the court may not afterwards sanction them, and allow for the moneys thus honestty expended. It is all within the sound discretion of the Orphans’ Court. Here the evidence clearly shows that the shed was necessary, and the ice house a great convenience. The Auditor, in his opinion, says that he decides to surcharge the guardian with the-amount of these items with reluctance, and expresses the belief that if an application had been made to the Court the expenditures would have been sanctioned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b66-5" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[238,1202,1181,433]]]'>. How, while the Auditor, in the absence of an order of Court, felt himself constrained to decide against the allowance of the items in question, there having been no previous order of the Court permitting such improvements, it is in the power of the Court to prevent the injustice which would follow from surcharging the accountant with the amounts thus judiciously and fairly spent for the benefit of his wards, now to approve and sanction his cause by allowing the disputed items as the Auditor could not do. Accordingly the exceptions, on part of the guardian, are sustained and the expenditures approved.</p>

The Auditor at first directed that John Killpatrick, .the exceptant, should pay four fifths of the costs and Thomas E. Kendrick, the guardian, the remaining one fifth. He after-wards changed this direction and reported that the costs should all be paid from the funds. This is the same as ordering that the wards, who, with their mother, have been opposed from the first to these proceedings, should have all the expenses of a litigation they had nothing to do with and which their mother and nearest friend persistently discountenanced ; a litigation which, as appears by the evidence and by the report of the Auditor, started out with allegations of wrong and collusion, which have entirely failed of proof, and with charges of errors in the account as against the wards which the evidence has not established. The exceptant is a mere volunteer, and without any legal interest in the matters involved. He has failed to establish the case alleged by him, and there would seem to be no other logic.il'or proper eonclu<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>sion than that tbe costs should be paid by him. It is therefore ordered that the account be referred back to the Auditor for re-statement according to this decision, and that John Killpatrick pay the costs of the proceeding. The Auditor restated the account in accordance with the opinion and reported the same. His report was confirmed.</p>
