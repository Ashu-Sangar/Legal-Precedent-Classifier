About fifteen years before his death he married Elizabeth Miller, a maiden lady residing in the borough of Milton, Pa. At the time of his marriage Mr. Housel was a -widower, with three adult male children living, and a large number of grandchildren. Mrs. Elizabeth Housel <em>(née </em>Mil<a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>ler) was the owner of a house and lot situate on Front street, Milton, which dwelling was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Housel from the date of their marriage until the date of their respective deaths. Mrs. Housel survived^ her husband about two end one half months. She died without issue. Both left wills. Oq the 2d day of April, 1868, before her marriage to Mr. Housel, Elizabeth Miller executed to one Dr. Charles Dougal a mortgage for the sum of $2,400, which was subsequently assigned to Mr. Housel for the consideration of $1,500. After hermarriage, viz., on the 15th day of March, 1871, Mrs. Housel executed another mortgage on the premises before mentioned to one Hannah B. Kauffman for the sum of $1,000, which mortgage was also subsequently assigned to John M. Housel, the decedent. In the will of Mr. Housel he referred to judgments which he there alleged he held against his wife. .Upon a search being made by his executor no judgments could be found of record, consequently he interrogated Mrs. House!, the widow, in regard to the matter. She said she owed her husband $2,500, and would confess judgment for that amount to him (the executor), which she accordingly did. After the death of Mrs. Housel the above mortgages were discovered upon the record. Before the discovery of the mortgages the judgment, to wit, $2,500, and interest from the date of the death of Mrs. PIousel, $88.75, were paid to Mr. Housel’s executor, and now form a part of the fund for distribution. Mrs. Housel left a will appointing S. L. Finney her executor, who converted her entire estate into money. All of her real estate (being that above mentioned) brought, at public sale, the sum of <em>$4,600; </em>her personal property sold for $181. Before her death, viz., on the 2d day of April, 1884, Mrs. Housel served a notice on the executor of her late husband in form as follows:</p>

The widow or children of a decedent may therefore elect to retain three hundred dollars, “ or any part thereof, out of any bank notes, money, stocks, judgments, or other indebtedness” belonging to the decedent’s estate.

He gave to her the household furniture &amp;c., during her lifetime, one third of his personal estate after payment of debts, etc., absolutely, and provided that her indebtedness to him should not be collected whilst she lived. The bequest of one third of his. personal estate is in the most distinct and unequivocal language, and in order apparently, that there might be no occasion for mistaking his intention, in this respect, he directs, that the household furniture, is not to be included in the distribution, in which the amount of that one third is to be ascertained. The gold watch, which he bequeathed to his son James, was not to be taken into the appraisement, and it is quite probable, that the testator intended that it should in like manner be excluded. Let that be as it may, it is certain, that the will does not indicate any intention of the testator, that any other portion of his personal propertj, excepting what he thus particularly specified, was to be excluded from the computation of the widow’s third.</p>
