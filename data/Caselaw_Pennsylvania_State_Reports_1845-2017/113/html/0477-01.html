Earley, against the defendants, W. B. Brickell, P. Y. Hite and the Central Bank of Pittsburgh, to determine the interest of the plaintiff in a body of lands situate in this county, containing about fifteen thousand acres, the legal title of which is held by the plaintiff and defendants as tenants in common. Prior to the acquisition of any title by Brickell and Hite, the legal title of these lands was vested in C. R. Earley, who executed a mortgage to one George C. Lord, to secure the pajrment of the sum of $75,000, which mortgage was duly recorded and was a lien upon the lands when Brickell and Hite acquired their title. By means of sundry mesne conveyances the legal title of one undivided one third part of these lands became vested in P. Y. Hite; the legal title of another undivided one third part became vested in W. B. Brickell, and the legal title of the remaining undivided one third part became vested in C. R. Earley. At the time of the acquisition of these several titles, the mortgage of George C. Lord was a lien upon the entire body of lands, and each of the aforesaid owners held his title subject to the lien and operation of said mortgage. On the 25th day of August, 1874, George C. Lord, the mortgagee, in consideration of the payment of $25,608.22, executed and delivered to C. R. Earley a release, by the terms of which he released to C. R. Earley, his heirs and assigns, the undivided one third part of the lands described in said mortgage. This release was recorded in Elk county on the 9th day of December, A. D. 1874. To No. 1, January Term, 1881, in the Circuit Court of the United States in and for the Western District of Pennsylvania, proceedings were commenced by George C. Lord to foreclose his mortgage against C. R. Earley, with notice to J. H. Walter, W. B. Brickell, P. Y. Hite, and J. D. Baldwin, <em>terre-tenants, </em>and on the 22d day of July, 1882, judgment was obtained for the sum of $30,727.14. In the record of these proceedings the plaintiff filed a copy of his claim upon <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>tbe mortgage, and appended tbe following to his statement of claim: “Excepting and reserving therefrom the undivided one third of said mortgaged premises released from the lien of said mortgage, by the said George C.

Y„ Hite conveyed by deed the undivided two ninths of said lands to the said Central Bank of Pittsburgh; it was claimed on the trial that by the sale and conveyance to the bank by the marshal’s sale of the undivided two thirds of said lands, and by the conveyance to it of the undivided two ninths by Brickell and Hite, that the bank thereby acquired the legal title of the undivided eight ninths, and that there remained in C.

The release to C. R. Earley operated to exempt his undivided one third from sale by the marshal, and the effect of said sale was to pass to the purchaser all the interest which Brickell and Hite had in said lands, and consequently they could convey nothing by their deed. The title of said lands is therefore vested in C. R. Earley as to one undivided one third, and in the Central Bank of Pittsburgh as to the undivided two thirds; judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff on the reserved question for the undivided one third part of the lands described in the writ, <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>and <em>the </em>plaintiff is entitled’to <em>have the </em>same set out <em>to him </em>in severalty.</p>

The Central Bank of Pittsburgh having afterwards acquired an interest in the property by purchase, was admitted to defend, and the plea of <em>non tenent insimul </em>was entered.</p>
    <p id="b496-13" data-blocks='[["BL_496.15",496,[253,1937,1186,346]]]'>The verdict of the jury was for the plaintiff, the meaning and.effect of which is that the parties hold together and in common, as set forth in the declaration, and that the plaintiff is entitled accordingly. The verdict was taken, however, subject to the opinion of the Court on the question of law reserved, whether the plaintiff is entitled to have the undivided one third part of the lands set apart to him in severalty, or one undivided ninth part only.</p>
    <p id="b496-14" data-blocks='[["BL_496.16",496,[254,2282,1185,174]],["BL_497.1",497,[211,503,1180,779]]]'>The facts out of which this question of law is supposed to arise are not stated, and the proper determination of it depends, we think, wholly upon the facts. The contention of the defendant in error is that the original purchase of these <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>lands by Earley was as a trustee for Bricked,.Hite, Baldwin and himself; that Baldwin’s interest was subsequently purchased for the joint benefit of the others; that the unpaid purchase money secured by the mortgage was, as between themselves, in fact, a joint indebtedness of the four purchasers, and afterwards of the remaining three; and that the $25,608.21 paid by Earley on 20th July, 1874, was his own money. Upon this assumption of the facts it is argued that Bricked, Hite and Earley were, <em>inter sese, </em>primary debtors for their own third of the purchase money only, and sureties for the other two thirds respectively; that the payment made by Early of ins own money would, in equity, be applied to his own proper debt, rather than to the debt for which he was held as surety; and, as the record of the release and of the proceedings, under which the marshal’s sale was effected, gave full notice, the release would operate as a discharge of the undivided third interest in the land, which at the time he himself owned even as against the purchaser at that sale.</p>
    <p id="b497-6" data-blocks='[["BL_497.4",497,[210,1283,1177,509]]]'>On the other hand, it is contended by the plaintiffs in error, that Earley’s original purchase was on his own account, and in his own interest; that the mortgage was given for his indebtedness ; that the conveyances to Brickell and Hite are absolute in form, contain no condition or provision imposing any share of this burden upon them ; that the release in question was therefore just such a discharge as in the law Earley was bound to provide, for the benefit of his grantees; and as there was no specific application of the money at the time to any particular third interest in the property, Earley has no equity which would now enable him to apply the mpney specifically in his own relief.</p>

We cannot draw conclusions of fact from the evidence, for the reason that the evidence is not before us. Every reservation of a question must, for this reason, place distinctly upon the record not only what the point is, which is reserved, but the state of facts out of which it arises; this is essentially necessary to enable the parties to except to it, and to have it reviewed: Ferguson <em>v. </em>Wright, 11 P.

The facts out of which the question springs must be seen in the record proper, or in the super-added statute record furnished by a bill of exceptions. This is quite as true in the case of reserved questions of law as in other cases, and has been stated in Irwin v. Wickersham, and Wilson <em>v. </em>Steamboat Tuscarora, 1 Casey, 316 and 317, and in Winchester v. Bennet, 4 P. F. S., 510. There are but three modes in which facts arising upon the evidence can find their way into the record — by the finding of a jury, which is a special verdict — by the agreement of the parties, called a case stated — and by the certificate of the Court, contained in a bill of exceptions.
