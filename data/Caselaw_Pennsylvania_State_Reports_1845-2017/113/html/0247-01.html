It seems to assume (and it is a fair inference) that a man afterwards marrying and cohabiting with a woman who has given birth to a bastard child, was its father. In any event, the fact is not disputed, that the testator was the father of the child and subsequently married the mother, and cohabited with her. The design and theory of this Act was to lift the unfortunate illegitimate out of the dust, and endow him with the quality and dignity of an heir. Until the marriage of liis mother to his natural father he is the son of nobody, and sometimes called <em>filius </em>nullius, sometimes <em>filius populi. </em>He has had a physical birth, but is incapable of heir-ship. His blood is corrupt and he is denied the inheritance, is not the “lawful heir*” and would not, as in the ancientapologue, have been slain, that thieves could steal the inheritance. But the statute gives him a new birth, and he is an heir by the fiat of the law. .There is no doubt that the legal birth is the time when heirship developed upon him. Any other construction would defeat his right as heir, and thus the <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>statute fail of its purpose. The contention is that this Act of 1857 is retroactive, and was intended to make the bastard legitimate from the date of its birth, as it is “to enjoy all the rights and privileges as if it had been born during the wedlock of the parents,” that is, if the parents marry, the illegitimacy of the child is purged, and it is to be considered as if it bad always been legitimate. To give the Act this construction would involve the anomaly that the child was legitimate when its parents were unmarried. We shrink from such an interpretation of the Act. Even if the effect of the marriage of the parents was made retroactive, so as to legitimate from birth, still a court would hold to prevent injustice that the child was only born into the inheritance upon the marriage. Then is the case within the will’s Act? That statute says “when any person shall make his last will and testament, and shall afterwards marry or have a child.....not provided for in such will and die, ..... although such child be born after the death of the father, that is, if he has a child after making his will, even if it should be born after his death, as if to say no matter when born so it is born after making the will and unprovided for, as to such child the will is inoperative. The third proposition in Walker <em>v. </em>Hall, 10 Casey, 483, is stated thus : “If aman make his will and has an after-born child or children, not provided for in such will, and dies leav' ing such after-born child or children, so far as regards such child or children he dies intestate, and his will is revoked <em>pre tanto.” </em>The provision for the case of birth after the decease of the testator was to meet a child in <em>ventre sa </em>mere, so that although in <em>esse </em>when the will was made, still if born after the will falls as to it: MeKnight <em>v. </em>Ileed, <a href="/whart/1/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Whart. 213" data-case-ids="1829031" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0213-01">1 Wharton, 213</a>. In Young’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20115" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Wright 115">3 Wright, 115</a>, the child was born after making the will, and the day before the testatrix died, and will revoked. In Grosvenor <em>v. </em>Fogg, 31 P. F. S., 401, one child was born a year before the death of the testator, another three years before, and a third six years prior, but all subsequent to the date of the will, and it was held that the will was revoked <em>pro tanto </em>as to them all. The Auditor denied the claim of the child upon the ground that the object of the wills Act was to provide for a child of whose existence the father was ignorant when he made his will, and that the Act could only apply to a child physically born after the date of the will. It must be conceded that all the cases of which we have knowledge, decided under this Act, were cases in which the child was physically born after the date of the will. If the words <em>after-born </em>in tlie Act are to be confined to mean physical birth only, the child would be excluded. On the other hand if the child’s legitimate existence is to date from the marriage of its parents <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>and not from the day of its natural birth, the will must open so as to allow it to share in the inheritance. The object of the Act was to provide for a change of circumstances in the condition of the testator after he had made his will, which were unknown'to him at the time of making it. Indeed, the common law theory of the revocation of wills by the subsequent birth of issue is that the testator’s circumstances have so altered, that new duties have accrued to him subsequent to the date of the will, such as may be presumed to produce a change of intention. When such is the case it will amount to an implied revocation. This is based upon the idea that the testator must be supposed tacitly to have annexed a condition to his dispositions that the will shall stand, provided no such change happens in the relations of his duty as shall call for a different distribution: Coats <em>v. </em>Hughes, 3 B’inney, 514. In the case on hand the testator knew of the physical existence of the claimant at the time he made his will, but at that time he owed it no duty other than that imposed upon him by the Bastardy Act found in the Penal Code. It was a stranger to his'blood, but the marriage having been consummated after the date of the will, new duties developed upon him in relation to it. He was then not onty under a natural and moral obligation to provide for it, but under a legal obligation as well, because it then became his child with the same force and effect as if it had been then'born unto him. We think that the marriage produced such a change in the circumstances of the testator in relation to this child after the date of the will as to revoke it <em>pro tanto. </em>In this way alone can we give effect to the Act of 1857, which legitimates bastard children upon the marriage and cohabitation of their parents, and to the Wills Act of 1833, which declares that the will must open and let in a child which the testator has after the date of the-will. This child acquired a legal birth after the date of the will, and it would be contrary to all equity to debar it from the inheritable qualities which the law conferred upon it by virtue of this birth. We see no error in the apportionment of the costs as made by the Auditor. This exception is overruled. The conclusion to which we have arrived requires a new distribution. April 19th, 1886, the report is re-committed to the Auditor with instructions to report a new distribution in accordance with this opinion.</p>

It is an inheritable or legal birth which a legitimate child lias at its physical birth, and an inheritable or legal birt.li a bastard legitimated has at its legitimation. The spirit and intent of the legislature in enacting the Act of 14th May <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>1857, was clearly to give an illegitimate child, legitimated bv the marriage of its parents, all the rights and privileges of a legitimate child, this being the case under the authority recognized in Big Black Creek Improvement' Company <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 13 Norris, 455. The construction held by the Court below should obtain. “Statutes are to be construed so as may best effectuate the intention of the makers, which sometimes maybe collected from the cause or occasion of passing the statute, and when discovered it ought to be followed with judgment and discretion in the construction, though that construction may seem contrary to the letter of the statute.”. The construction of the Act of 14th May, 1857, and of the Wills Act of 8th April, 1833, is, however, plain and clear. Jennie P. Fetzer, bone and bone, blood and blood of George Fetzer, exalted by legal birth on the 9th day of August, 1883, to the station and dignitj- of his legitimate child, in all equit}*- and in law is entitled to the rights and privileges of, and as his legitimate child had to him after the making of his will.</p>

    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.7",270,[223,1342,1187,648]]]'>The single question, presented by the specifications of error in this case, is whether Jennie P. Fetzer, appellee’s ward should be considered an after-born child of the testator within the meaning of the Act of April 8th, 1833, sect. 15, which provides : “ When any person shall make his last will and testament, and afterwards shall marry or have a child or children not provided for in such will, and die leaving a widow and child, or either a widow, or child or children, although such child or children be born after the death of their father, every such person, so far as shall regard the widow, or child or children after-born, shall be deemed and construed to die intestate ; and, such widow, child or children, shall be entitled to such purparts, shares and dividends of the estate, real and personal, of the deceased as if he had actually died without any will:” Purd. 1477, pi. 18.</p>
    <p id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.8",270,[225,1991,1186,429]]]'>The facts, definitively settled by the Auditor’s report and verdict of the jury, are, that Jennie P. Fetzer, born in April 1883, was the natural child of George Fetzer and Mary A. Stetler, who were afterwards lawfully married in August of same year. Two days before their marriage George Fetzer made his will, in which he bequeathed to Miss Stetler, mother of the child, $1000 “for her kind treatment of” him, and gave the residue of his estate, real and personal to his son, grandchildren and sister, without making any provision for the child born, as aforesaid, out of lawful wedlock.</p>
    <p id="b270-7" data-blocks='[["BL_270.9",270,[268,2423,1138,45]],["BL_271.1",271,[241,427,1179,379]]]'>Before the Auditor, charged with distribution of testator’s <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>estate, it was contended that under the Act above quoted, in connection with the Act of May 14th, 1857, the child in question must be regarded as an “after-born ” child and therefore entitled to a child’s share of testator’s real and personal estate. This contention was not sustained by the learned Auditor, but the Orphans’ Court being of a different opinion entered a decree in her favor. From that decree this appeal was taken by those claiming under the will, and thus' arises the question above stated.</p>
    <p id="b271-6" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[243,818,1183,1157]]]'>The learned Auditor, as we think, rightly held that the Act of 1833, in providing for after-born children, means a physical birth, and not a mere legislative legitimation, after making the will; that it was intended to provide for children, actually born after the execution of a will, and of whose existence their father is supposed to be ignorant at the time of making his will, and notforthose previously born and then in full life. This certainly accords with the plain, unambiguous wording of the Act, and we have no doubt as to its correctness. Nor do we think the Act of 1833, above quoted, has been, in this respect, qualified by the subsequent Act of 1857, which provides: “In any and every case where the father and mother of an illegitimate child or children shall enter into the bonds of lawful wedlock and cohabit, such child or children shall thereby become legitimated and enjoy all the rights and privileges as if they had been born during the wedlock of their parents.” Upon no reasonable construction of this Act can it be held that appellee’s ward was born after testator’s will was executed. The conceded fact is, she was born four months before, and therefore in no proper sense of the term can she be regarded as an after-born child within the provision of the Act. The reasoning of the learned Auditor is so satisfactory and conclusive of the correctness of his position that it is deemed unnecessary to discuss the subject. We think the learned Court erred in not’decreeing distribution of the fund in accordance with the first schedule of distribution reported by the Auditor.</p>
    <p id="b271-7" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[507,1987,920,430]]]'>Decree reversed at the costs of appellee, and it is now adjudged and decreed that the net balance, remaining after appropriations made to payment of debts and expenses of Audit, viz : $5457,19, be distributed as follows, viz: To Mary A. Fetzer, widow, $1817,06; to Joseph McCulloch, Guardian of Ellen Fetzer, minor &amp;c., $1730,53 ; to Joseph McCulloch, Guardian of Gertie Fetzer, minor &amp;c., $1730,53; to Louisa Wollaver, $173.07.</p>
