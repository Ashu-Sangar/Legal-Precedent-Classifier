The declaration is not for use and occupation. If it had been, the contention of the defendant that the action would not lie upon mere proof of the occupation, although the possession was permissive on the part of the plaintiff, would be sound. In such case the action would not lie in the absence of a proof of an express promise on the part of Jeremiah Luck, the co-tenant, to pay. Such an express promise has -not been shown — but such is not the case before us. The plaintiff is seeking to recover the crops which grew upon the lands held in common, which his co-tenant in his lifetime received in excess of his share.</p>

It is true in this case there was an express promise on the part of the defendant to pay, but the Court says that the plaintiff was entitled to maintain assumpsit upon proof that the defendant bad taken all the proceeds of the land and sold it. Tin's was followed by Borell’s Administrator <em>v. </em>Bored, 9 Casey, 492, in which it was distinctly held that one tenant in common could maintain assumpsit against his co-tenant to recover a share of the profits, upon proof that the whole was received by the defendant. In such case the law raises an implied promise to pay over the plaintiff’s share. It is insisted that these cases have been overthrown bv the decisions in Kline <em>v. </em>Jacobs and wife, 18 P. F. S., 57, andKoss <em>v. </em>Gould, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20W.N.C.%20188" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="15 W.N.C. 188">15 W. N. C., 188</a> ; but we do not think so. Xu the former the action was for use and occupation, and the Court held that the tenant in common could not recover against his fellow for the use and occupation of the common property without proof of an express contract to pay rent. An action for use and occupation depends not upon privity of estate, but upon privity of contract. The Court does not notice the cases of Borell’s Administrator <em>v. </em>Borell, and Gillis v.McKenney, just referred to, and we do not feel at liberty to regard them as overruled. We best discharge our duty by leaving the responsibility of doing that to the Supreme Court. We are mindful that Mr. Justice Thayer, in Noss <em>v. </em>Gould, holds that they are overruled by Kline <em>v. </em>Jacobs, but he does not say tliat the Supreme Court have plainly declared that sue!) was their intentions. Whilst we concede his great abil<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>ity as a Judge, yet we decline to follow,his ruling on account of the serious consequence that would ensue if his views of the law be correct. He there holds that in a ease like the one in hand where one co-tenant passively permits his fellow to have the exclusive possession of the lands held in common and to receive all the rents, issues and profits, that he cannot recover in the absence of an express promise to pajq neither by action of'assumpsit, nor account render under the statute of 4 Anne, c. 16, nor by bill in equity, not in any other way whatsoever. It is a maxim of the law that it affords a remedy for evei’y wrong. We therefore prefer the doctrine enunciated by the Supreme Court in the cases which are claimed to be overthrown, and hold that they are still the law and that assumpsit will lie. This remedy is far preferable to the now almost obsolete action <em>of </em>account render, and superior to any that can be invoked, unless it be by bill in equity. In assumpsit a jury can settle all the equities between the parties and do ample and complete justice. We therefore charge you that this action can be maintained, and that the plaintiff cannot be defeated upon the ground that he has misconceived his action, if you find from the evidence that the plaintiff was the co-tenant with Jeremiah Luck of the land upon which the crops in dispute grew, and that he received more than his share. In such case the plaintiff can recover whatever the defendant received over and beyond his share. It is undeniable that the will of Jeremiah Luck, deceased, given in evidence by the plaintiff, constitutes him a co-tenant with Jeremiah Luck, of the lands therein devised to them as tenants in common. The contention of the plaintiff is that Jeremiah Luck entered upon these lands devised to them as tenants in common in April 1874, and farmed the same and raised crops thereon until his death, in August, 1884, and that during this entire period of about ten years he appropriated to his own use all the crops, and that the plaintiff received none of them. How this is will be for you to find from the evidence.</p>

The statute of 4 Anne, chap. 16, sec. 27, Roberts Dig. 48, allows the action of account render without proof of an express contract. Of course account was the only remedy expressly given under the statute of Anne, which allows the action against the co-tenant “as bailiff for receiving more than comes to his just share or proportion,” and these words were held to apply only where he has received more than his just share from others, as for instance if one tenant in <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>common should rent the common property to a third party and receive all the rent: Henderson <em>v. </em>Eason, 9 Eng. Law and Eq. Rep., 337. If this English decision shall be considered law in Pennsylvania, even account under the statute could not be maintained in ordinary cases, and surely not in the case in hand. The plaintiff in error insists on this narrow construction of the statute of Anne, when he cites Norris <em>v. </em>Gould, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20W.N.C.%20187" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="15 W.N.C. 187">15 W. N. C., 187</a>, yet in another part of his argument he suggests that the proper remedy would be by bill in equity. It is however clear that if this statute can be so construed as to permit a bill in equity, it may likewise be construed to permit assumpsit. Plence if the position of the plaintiff in. error be maintained that assumpsit don’t lie, then indeed would the plaintiff below be without a remedy, and so would every tenant in common where his co-tenant first happens to get into possession. Such a conclusion, if possible, must be avoided. Even partition would afford no relief, but would only prevent the continuance of such legalized deprivation of what is justly due. But in the ease in hand even partition cannot be obtained, for Israel Lincoln Luck has more than a life estate, he has a conditional fee, for which the Partition Acts make no provision. The result of all this would be that Mary E. Luck, the step-mother of Israel Lincoln Luck, and the devisee of Jeremiah Luck, deceased, who is now in the exclusive possession of this land, might continue in the same and appropriate the crops as her husband did in his lifetime without any liability whatever to Israel Lincoln Luck. Or in other words, Israel Lincoln Luck’s estate would' be worthless to him, and the bounty of his grandfather would be defeated. To all this the argument of the plaintiff in error leads. All this strengthens our position, that the contention of the plaintiff in error should not be sustained, unless the necessity be imperative.</p>

Again in <a href="/mass/26/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="9 Pick. 34" data-case-ids="2058505" data-case-paths="/mass/26/0034-01">9 Pick., 34</a>, it is decided that if one tenant in common of a wood cut off and sell a portion, his co-tenant can maintain assumpsit for money had and received. We are unable to see a difference between the profits made out of a machine, or a ship, or a wood by one of several joint owners, or tenants in common, and those made out of a farm. Again, assumpsit by one co-tenant against another to recover his share of the rents and profits received by the latter, has been sustained in several of the other states on the grounds, 1. That, whenever account can be maintained, <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>may also; and 2. That, the statute of Anne, supra, being remedial, ought to receive a liberal construction: Moses <em>v. </em>Ross, 41 Maine, 360; Miller <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Pick.%20186" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="7 Pick. 186">7 Pick., 186</a>; Munroe <em>v. </em>Luke, 1 Metcalf, 464; Shephard <em>v. </em>Richards, <a href="/mass/68/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 Gray 424" data-case-ids="1998199" data-case-paths="/mass/68/0424-01">2 Gray, 424</a>; Dickinson <em>v. </em>Williams, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Cush.%20260" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="11 Cush. 260">11 Cush., 260</a>; Buch <em>v. </em>Spofford, 40 Maine, 328; Gowen <em>v. </em>Shaw, 40 Maine, 58; Dyer <em>v. </em>Wilbur, 48 Maine, 287; Ficquit <em>v. </em>Allison, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Mich.%20329" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="12 Mich. 329">12 Mich., 329</a>.</p>
    <p id="b279-6" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[242,1261,1180,997]]]'>The 12th assignment of error complains of the action of the Court below in rejecting the testimony as to some lime put upon this land by Jeremiah Luck. Here there was no agreement on the part of Israel Lincoln Luck to pay his proportion of any lime put upon the common property by Jeremiah Luck. The rule undoubtedly is that repairs, which are absolutely necessary to the enjoyment of the property, if made by one tenant in common, may be claimed in part against a co-tenant. But this rule does not apply to arable land: Beatty <em>v. </em>Bordwell, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20Pa.%20441" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="91 Pa. 441">91 Pa., 441</a>. The set-off claimed was small, and considering the liberality as to set-offs, with which the defendant below was treated, she should not complain. Nor is there any hardship in this. Jeremiah Luck was “perfectly acquainted with his rights,” or had the means of becoming so, and he put on this lime without asking the consent of his co-tenant: Crest <em>v. </em>Jack, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20239" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="3 Watts 239">3 Watts, 239</a>; Gregg <em>v. </em>Patterson, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20209" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 209">9 W. &amp;. S., 209</a>. The language of Agnew J., in Glidden <em>v. </em>Strupler, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20405" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="52 Pa. 405">52 Pa., 405</a>, is also applicable in this case on this point. It is as follows: “In this case, added to the equal source of knowledge, there is the further element of legal incapacity, a knowledge of which is always 'imputed, and in this case an admitted fact, which takes away all claims to equity.”</p>

Three of them, however, are of a contrary opinion, and as our brother Tkttnkey did not hear the case we are unable to pass upon the first three assignments of error. We all agree, however, in reversing the case upon the twelfth assignment. The defendant’s counsel offered to show the amount of lime the defendant had put upon the land, and that it was necessary to put it on in order to raise the crops. The learned judge excluded this evidence upon the authority of Beatty <em>v. </em>Bordwell, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20Pa.%20440" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="91 Pa. 440">91 Pa. St., 440</a>. This was error. That case does not rule this. This action was assumpit for the value of the crops. The most that the plaintiff could recover would be the value of the crops after a proper allowance for expenses. The lime, or other fertilizer, put upon the land for the purpose of growing the crop was as much a part of the expenses as was the labor of planting or harvesting it. This is too plain to need elaboration. We notice nothing in the remaining assignments which requires discussion.</p>
