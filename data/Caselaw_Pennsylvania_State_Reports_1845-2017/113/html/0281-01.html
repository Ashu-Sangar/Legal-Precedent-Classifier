Therefore, in the matter of Church Street, 4 P. F.

Its provisions all relate to streets in the several boroughs of Montgomery County, which is the subject expressed in its title; and its title, though general, contains nothing calculated to mislead, but fairly gives notice of its subject sufficient to lead to inquiry. It confers original jurisdiction upon the Court of Quarter Sessions over streets or roads within the limits of any incorporated borough in Montgomery County, but repeals no existing laws, leaving to the boroughs incorporated under the general borough laws their power to ordain streets and allejs when needed for municipal purposes, as before, and to have the damages assessed as provided in such cases. The jurisdiction it confers tends to equalize the law. The taxable inhabitants of the boroughs are taxed for damages resulting from the laying out of public roads in the townships, and it seems but fair that there should be reciprocation in that respect, and the laying out of streets, useless to the general public in boroughs through the action of a jury selected from the body of the county outside of the boroughs themselves, is not likely to be greatly abused.</p>

    <p id="b302-7" data-blocks='[["BL_302.8",302,[209,944,1186,859]]]'>Did the Act of May 19th, 1871, entitled, “ An Act relating to streets in the several boroughs of Montgomery county,” impose upon the county the damages assessed to the owners of property on the laying out, opening or widening of streets, roads or alleys in any of the said boroughs, we would agree with the counsel for the county that the Act was unconstitutional and void. In such case the title to the said Act would have to be regarded as wholly defective, since it affords no notice that it embraces anything relative to the county. But as there is nothing apparent in the statute which at all affects the county, or expresses an intention to make such damages payable out of its treasury, we cannot, for this reason, which has been urged by the counsel for the .plaintiff in error, pronounce the Act unconstitutional. It will be observed that” both the Borough Act of 1851 and the general road law not only provide for the assessment of damages upon the laydng out of streets and roads, but also prescribe how they shall be paid, whilst the Act of 1871 only directs the method by which such damages shall be assessed, and says nothing as to their payment.</p>
    <p id="b302-8" data-blocks='[["BL_302.9",302,[208,1804,1171,212]]]'>They are to be assessed under the General Road Act, but as there is no direction for their payment, the Borough Act remains, in this particular, unaltered, and to it we must resort in order to learn how those damages, when ascertained, are to be liquidated.</p>

This might be so if the assessment necessarily involved payment by the county, but it does not, for the two things are essentially different. There is no reason why the Legislature might not direct that on the taking of land by a railroad company, in exercise ,of its right of eminent domain, the damages to the owner should be assessed under the provisions of the general road law, but in such case it would not follow that the <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>county must pay those damages when assessed. It is clear, therefore, that unless the Act of 1871 imposes this burthen upon the county it cannot be made to bear it. This Act must be construed as supplemental to the charters of the several boroughs in the county of Montgomery, and when in them we find provision for the payment of damages, we certainly cannot assume that a supplement which involves only their mode of assessment, is to be extended by implication so as to compel their payment out of the county rather than the borough treasury. It follows that as the Court of Quarter Sessions neither has made, nor can make, any order affecting the county of Montgomery, it, the said county, has no standing to maintain the <em>certiorari </em>now before us.</p>
