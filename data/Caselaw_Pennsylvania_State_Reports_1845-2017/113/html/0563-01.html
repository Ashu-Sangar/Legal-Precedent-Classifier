    <p id="b585-8" data-blocks='[["BL_585.6",585,[216,1158,1178,1295]]]'>The proper practice in cases of mandamus is very succinctly stated in Treas. Jeff. Co. <em>v. </em>Shannon, 1 P. F. S., 221, as follows: “The Act of Assembly plainly points out the course to bo pursued when a proper suggestion is filed; if it contain the substance of a case for a mandamus, the course is, to issue an alternative writ commanding the defendant to perform the act required, or return his reason for not doing it. Upon this writ, the Act provides that the court shall allow the persons suing or defending such convenient time to make return, plead, reply, rejoin or demur as shall be just and reasonable.” If, after issue and trial, the return be adjudged insufficient, then a peremptory mandamus will issue to compel the performance of the duty required. The Act contemplates regular issues of fact and law, as in other cases: 8 Casey, 218; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20237" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Wright 237">1 Wright, 237</a>. See also Childs <em>v. </em>Comm’th, 3 Brewster, 194. Or, as stated in Keasy <em>v. </em>Bricker, 10 P. F. S., 9. “ The ordinary practice is to direct an alternative mandamus to issue when the court is satisfied on affidavits that the writ should be issued as a matter of justice and right, to compel the performance of an act or duty, for which otherwise there would be no adequate remedy. This gives the party to whom it is directed an opportunity to do the act, or to show good reason at the return of the writ why he should not do it. He does this by making a return to the writ. It is at this point the pleadings in the cause begin. The return may traverse the facts alleged in the writ, or admitting them may avoid performance by stating sufficient facts in excuse. The relator may then demur, plead to, or traverse the facts set forth in the return. Such is the ordinary practice recognized by the Act relating to mandamus.”</p>

When this cause was here before, we held that in the absence of any restriction in the charter, the right of a stockholder, in a trading corporation, to an inspection of the books, papers and accounts was, in certain cases, and under certain limitations, incident to the relation of a stockholder to the company. Of course a stockholder is bound by the corporate articles, where the right of inspection of the corporate books and papers is qualified by express stipulation; those who become members are subject to the qualification. But the doctrine of the law, as we then said, is that the books and papers of the corporation, though of necessity left in some one hand, are the common property of the stockholders,” and “ unless the charter provides otherwise, a shareholder has the right to inspect them and to take minutes from them for a definite and proper purpose, at reasonable times.” The facts set forth in the writ are, by the return in part denied, in part qualified, and in part admitted, but assuming the correctness of the return as far as it goes, and the facts set-forth in the petition not traversed thereby, the following facts may, we think, for the purposes of this case be deemed admitted.</p>

In the year 1868 the Plicenix Iron Co. ceased to act as iron builders, and, excepting in one or two instances, confined its operations to the manufacture of iron building materials. In October, 1870, the Plioenix Iron Co. entered into an agreement with Clarke, Reeves &amp; Co., by the terms of which the company agreed and became bound, permanently to withdraw from the business of construction, and to confine their operations to the manufacture of materials alone ; Clarke, Reeves &amp; Co., .on the other hand, agreed and became bound to pursue the business of construction, to purchase at certain rates tbeir materials wholly from tlie Phoenix Iron Co., and at the completion of each contract to pay to the Plicenix Iron Co. one half of tlie net amount which the might receive by reason of the contract. This coutract, originally in parol, took effect from 22d October, 1870, but was not reduced to writing until 21st May, 1871.

We cannot anticipate the bill which the relator may bring. What specific relief he may seek can now only be the subject of conjecture; it will be time enough to determine the question of <em>res adjudieata </em>when the case is presented. The question now is, as to the relator’s right to inspect the books; he avers that he purposes filing a bill in equity against the corporation and its officers, and that it is necessary that he see the books and papers in order that he may correctly state the facts now concealed from him. As we said in the former opinion of this Court, upon learning the facts he may abandon bis purpose for want of matter of complaint. He desires “to inspect and see whether he can raise a particular case in his favor by examining the books. He is a stockholder, to a very considerable amount, in what appears to be a prosperous and highly profitable trading corporation ; for nine years, although large profits have admittedly accrued, no dividends have been declared; the profits are in no way accounted for; be is denied all access to the books and papers for information. At a regular stockholders’ meeting the minutes, because of his presence, were suppressed, the examination of papers prevented, and the meeting adjourned whilst the relator hold the floor asking for information. A stockholder in a trading corporation must certainly have some rights which a board of directors should respect. Sellers was not bound to accept the mere statement of the board, whether under oath or otherwise, as to the contents of the books, &amp;c. He bad a right to a reasonable personal inspection of them, and with the aid of a disinterested expert might make such extracts as were reasonably required in the preparation of the bill be purposed to bring.</p>
