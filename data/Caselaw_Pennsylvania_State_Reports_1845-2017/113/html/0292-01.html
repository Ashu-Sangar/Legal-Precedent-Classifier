They gave bond and caused an attachment to be issued for the whole sum against Fernau <em>&amp; </em>Thomas. By virtue thereof the sheriff attached certain goods, which had already been levied on by former executions; and also attached some book accounts and other claims. On the 10th of March the defendants in the attachment filed their affidavit, denying that they had fraudulently contracted any part of said debt, and obtained a rule to 'show cause why the attachment should not be dissolved. On the hearing thereof the Court thought the fraud averred was not sufficiently proved, and made the rule absolute on the 25th April. This action of the Court has never been reversed. It stands as a conclusive judgment that the attachment was improperly issued.</p>

The contention now is whether the dissolution of the attachment destroyed the vitality of the bond.</p>
    <p id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[214,505,1167,88]]]'>This leads us to consider the design of the Act and the language of the bond.</p>
    <p id="b315-7" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[214,591,1170,601]]]'>1. The manifest purpose of the statute was not to supersede the usual forms of action for the recovery of debts. It provides a mode of proceeding only when the debtor has committed, or is about to commit, some fraudulent act. Then and then only does it give a creditor the right to forthwith seize the property of his debtor, and to hold the same as security for the payment of a judgment to be thereafter recovered. Without fraud of the debtor his property cannot be thus seized nor held for the security of the creditor. When seized under the allegation of fraud, its release may be procured either by dissolving the attachment, or by giving security conditioned for the payment of the judgment, which may be recovered “in said attachment ” or for the return of the property attached.</p>
    <p id="b315-8" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[214,1197,1172,345]]]'>Under the view we take of this case it is not necessary to decide now whether an attachment under this Act will lie, when the affidavit charges fraud as applicable to only a part of the debt, for a recovery of which the suit is brought. The writ goes out claiming the whole debt as an entirety. If it can be so used as to obtain possession of-property to pay a debt, concerning a large portion of which no fraud is alleged, the whole purpose aud spirit of the statute will be perverted.</p>
    <p id="b315-9" data-blocks='[["BL_315.7",315,[217,1542,1169,506]]]'>The intent of the Act is not to take from an unfortunate, but honest debtor, his property, before judgment rendered against him. If the fraud averred is not sufficiently proved, the attachment falls. When it does fall the plaintiff loses all the security which he temporarily held thereunder. Whether that security existed by virtue of the writ of attachment alone or by the superadded bond of the defendant and his sureties based thereon, a dissolution of the attachment strikes down the security. Without fraud of the defendants the plaintiffs were not entitled to demand either form of security. When the attaching power was stricken down, the bond of the defendants fell with it.</p>
    <p id="b315-10" data-blocks='[["BL_315.8",315,[217,2059,1169,389]],["BL_316.1",316,[267,429,1174,385]]]'>2. The language in the condition of the bond strengthens the conclusion at which we have arrived. It is to secure the payment of a judgment to be recovered “in said attachment.” It is based on the fact that property is held under the attachment, and assumes that it may legally be so held. It promises to surrender “the property attached ” to an officer having an execution against said defendants on any judgment rendered “ in said attachment ” in favor of said plaintiffs. The judgment, for the payment of which the obligors bound them<a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>selves, was to be one that should be rendered in and by virtue of the attachment; and not one that might be obtained “ as in the case of a summons for debt regularly issued and duly served.” That language does not indicate any enlarged right, flowing from the issuing of an attachment and the seizure of property thereunder. On the contrary, it clearly imports a summons in the usual and ordinary form. When the attachment was dissolved the suit was stripped of all the properties and incidents applicable to the attachment.</p>
