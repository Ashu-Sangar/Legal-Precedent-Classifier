Taylor, against the president, managers and company of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company to recover damages for injuries received by her by being struck by a train of cars while she was crossing the railroad track of the defendant along an alleged foot path in the city of Scranton. The defendant pleaded not guilty. After the plaintiff had closed her case the defendant moved the Court to grant a compulsory nonsuit. The motion was granted and a nonsuit entered.

As she reached the track, a train of cars was standing upon the switch with a locomotive at the head, blowing off steam. She passed immediately in front of the locomotive and around it, and as sbe went to step upon the main track of the railroad, was struck by a passing passenger train, thrown down and her foot was crushed; her foot had to he amputated, and it is for this injury that suit is brought.</p>

The railroad of the defendant at this point is the main line of railroad, not near a depot, and in no yard of the defendant; the switch being used for holding the freight train there while the passenger train passed upon the regular track. The alleged foot path went from the schoolhouse to the brow of the cut, tbe railroad being in a cut a few feet in depth, and the path passed down diagonally along the bank, and diagonally across the track. This path <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>was used, so far as the testimony shows, by persons not for the purpose of crossing directly across the track to reach a point, but for the purp'ose of going along the track itself, and within the right of way of the railroad, for the purpose of reaching Phelps street, some of the witnesses stating that it was a shorter cut than tó pass by the regular streets and alleys of the city. There was an alley running parallel with the railroad, a short distance from it, entirely outside of the right of way of the railroad, which parties could use and reach Phelps street, as the map shows, by as short if not shorter distance than by the railroad track.</p>

Durkin, one of the witnesses who saw the accident and picked the child up, says he saw her running down the bank, saw the train coming, shouted to her, to no avail. The accident took place a few feet from him. Some of the witnesses testified that the train was stopped at Phelps street, some just passed it. The evidence was that the girl could not see the approaching train, and that the engineer of the train could not see her; that immediately as she passed in front of the standing train she was struck.</p>

The evidence is that it was not a path leading to any of the works of the company, or that they directly or indirectly acquiesced in it, by any proof except such use of it as the evidence shows. P. M. Walsh, a witness for the plaintiff, who-made the map put in evidence, testified that for fourteen years he knew well the locality and made surveys of that locality for Mr. Phelps and the property owners of New .street before he made the surveys for the purpose of this trial, that he was acquainted with the houses in the vicinity of that place about the time of the accident. He says: “ I didn’t know the fact of a crossing above Phelps street until my attention was called to it after the accident, and I was employed to make a survey.” “I found that there was a foot path ■there, a well-defined, well beaten foot path leading from No. 9 school house across the Delaware and Pludson track up towards Phelps street. After it crossed the track, the children I presume used it to go up across Phelps street along parallel with the track of the railroad.” “ The double dotted line upon this map represents the foot path leading across the railroad; then it ceased to be well defined there; people used sometimes to go to Phelps street this way, and at other times <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>they would not cross it, but would go that way ’’ — meaning the east side.</p>

One witness, Mr. Hull, testified that he saw some cross the track and go up. the other side of the bank ; he is the only witness who testified to that. There is no evidence of any other use of the path directly across the track. Some witnesses testify to the use of the track itself at times between the rails. At the time of this accident there was no flagman stationed at Phelps street, but there was one stationed there subsequently to the accident. The little girl testified that she heard no bell or whistle; some of the passengers on the train stated they heard no boll or whistle before reaching the pathway. The distance of Phelps street was about one hundred and twenty.-seven feet from the place of the accident, and the train was approaching Phelps street.</p>

It is a path used almost entirely by school children to reach Phelps street. The track and path are in the cut with banks on both sides. The path goes down the bank not at right angles but diagonally, and so far as it crosses the track at all it crosses it diagonally, for the purpose of walking down the track and along it within the railroad right of way. The evidence shows that after leading into the cut, the path was used more upon the east side of the track than upon the west, but used some upon both sides and some times in the middle. There is no such use of this path as to constitute a presumption of permission on the part of the company; its use is entirely within a period when continued trespasses could not ripen into a right; it is just such use of <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>the railroad, track as is sometimes common in the outskirts of the city, and such as <em>we </em>consider the law severely condemns.</p>

The evidence is, that she was running; she herself says she was hurrying past the train with the locomotive standing on the switch; she could not see the approaching train; the engineer could not see her; she darted in front of the standing engine, not over ten feet from it, into the approaching train. Her impetuosity and thoughtlessness, common it is true to a child, put her into a place, in disregard of the shout of her teacher, who warned her without hearing, where no care nor possible foresight of the company could have prevented the.accident. The question of speed and signal is out of the case. It is not the case of a trespasser walking on a track in sight of an approaching train.

If he is correct in this, the nonsuit was rightly entered. But, plaintiffs’ contention is that the jury would have been warranted in finding negligence of the company defendant, from which the injury complained of resulted; that the testimony tended to prove such facts and circumstances as bring the case within the general principle recognized and approved by this Court in The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Trautman, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20W.N.C.%20453" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="11 W.N.C. 453">11 W. N. C., 453</a>, in which it is ruled that where a person crossed a railroad track by a common and well-known footpath used by the public for many years without let or hindrance on the part of the railroad company and its employés, <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>he cannot be regarded as a trespasser ; and, where it is shown, as was done in this ease, that the footpath, across the company’s land, has been habitually used by the public for many years without objection, it is for the jury to say whether the company 1ms not acquiesced in such use.</p>
    <p id="b191-6" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[255,674,1171,1285]]]'>'While such use does not convert the company’s right of way into a public highway, it certainly does relieve persons passing-on the same from being treated as trespassers on the company’s premises ; and there is a manifest distinction between the degree of care which a railroad company is bound to exercise towards mere trespassers and those who may be using the right of way by tacit consent or Implied permission of the company. In the case of such long continued use by the public, the company and its employes are charged with notice of the fact, and therefore cannot with impunity neglect precautions to prevent danger to persons thus using the same. In Benny <em>v. </em>The Railroad Company, 92 N. Y., it is said : “ The acquiescence of defendant for so long a time, in the crossing of the tracks by pedestrians, amounted to a license and permission, by defendant, to all persons to cross the tracks at this point. These circumstances imposed a duty on tbe defendant, in respect of persons using the crossing, to exercise reasonable care in the movement of its trains. The company had a lawful right to use the tracks for its business, and could have withdrawn its permission to the public to use its premises as a public highway, assuming that no public right therein existed; but, so long as it permitted the public use, it was chargeable with knowledge of the danger to human life from operating its trains at that point, and was bound to such reasonable precaution in their management as ordinary prudence dictated to protect wayfarers from injury. ..... The company, in such cases, is an actor at the time in creating the circumstances which imperil human life, and it would be alarming doctrine tliat it was under no duty to exercise any care in the movement of its trains.”</p>
    <p id="b191-8" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[260,1970,1167,342]]]'>Tbe principle clearly settled by tbe foregoing, and many otlier eases that might be cited, is, that when a railroad company has for years, without objection, permitted the public to cross its tracks at a certain point not in itself a public crossing, it owes the duty of reasonable care towards those using tbe crossing] and whether in a given case such reasonable care has been exercised, or not, is ordinarily a question for tbe jury under all the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b191-9" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[263,2308,1164,178]],["BL_192.1",192,[238,440,1182,127]]]'>Without undertaking to review the testimony on which plaintiff relied, we think the evidence is quite sufficient to warrant the submission of ber case to a jury on tbe questions of permissive crossing at the point where she was injured, and <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>whether in the movement of its train the company exercised that degree of care, which, under the circumstances, it was in duty bound to do.</p>
    <p id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[232,564,1189,958]]]'>There was testimony tending to show the whistle was not sounded, bell not rung, nor any warning given of the approach of the train by which plaintiff was struck. This was properly for the consideration of the jury; and in view of all the circumstances, including the fact that the siding was occupied by a standing train of cars and the main track thus out of view, we have no right to say the jury would not have found negligence in not warning those who might be in the act of crossing that the train was approaching. If plaintiff had been duly warned, either by sounding the whistle or ringing the bell, it is not at all probable she would have attempted to cross the track in the face of known danger. The question of contributory negligence does not arise in the case. The age of plaintiff at the time of the accident precludes that. If, under the evidence, she was not a trespasser on the premises of the company, the question is whether it was not their duty to give suitable warning of the approach of their train ; and, failing to do that, whether they were not guilty of negligence which was the proximate cause of the injury. The first and second specifications of error are sustained. There was no error in refusing to receive the evidence specified in the third and fourth assignments, and hence they are not sustained.</p>
