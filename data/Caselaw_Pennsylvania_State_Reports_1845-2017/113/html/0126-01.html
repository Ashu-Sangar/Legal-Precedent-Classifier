The principles of law involved in this case have been settled by the several decisions of the Supreme Court already made in this case, (5 Norm, 401; 13 Norris, 302; 6 Out., 307.) The facts in the case, or the questions of fact upon which you will have to pass, are not many, although it has been necessary in order to throw light upon them to introduce <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>a great number of witnesses who have been heard by yon, and the discussion of the many facts that have been put in evidence to illustrate these several questions of fact which I shall submit to you. [It appears from the evidence, that in 1868, Mrs. Sanderson purchased .some land in that part of the city whieli is now known as Green Nidge, with a view of erecting a residence there. Through a portion of this land flowed this stream, which is known as Meadow Brook. The fact that this stream flowed through the land was, as it appears, one of the inducements which led this lady to look at that spot, and to make that purchase for the purposes of a residence, in the hope that the waters of the stream might be utilized for domestic purposes, and other useful purposes about the ground. With a view to determine that fact, her husband, Mr. J. Gardner Sanderson, made an examination of the stream, following it up from where it ran through these grounds, all along its course, and noting its condition as he went. He followed it all the way up, found that it was covered over, as he says, more or less, with willows, hazels and other shrubbery that is customarily growing along a stream, and went away up to the Gipsy Grove swamp, and still further <em>beyoml that </em>toward the Tuttle Roaring Brook. He examined especially, as he says, to see if there was anything deleterious corning from any place about there that might vitiate the waters of this stream, lie was satisfied, and this plaintiff, as it appears, was satisfied from that examination, that the water in the stream was pure, and that it would be lit for such uses and purposes as they designed to make of it.] Accordingly the various water-works and apparatus that you have heard described, were put in there; a dam was erected upon the land purchased of Van Fleet, in order to get a sufficient head ; from that a conduit pipe was laid which led to the cistern and hydraulic ram; that, as you know, is a simple mechanical appliance frequently used for the purpose of raising water from a lower to a higher level, and often for just such purposes as it was put to, according to the evidence, in this case. From that ram the water was forced up through pipes leading to a tank in the attic of Mrs. Sanderson’s house, and from there it was distributed through the house, to the boilers, for the purpose of being heated, and to the water-closets, and to a bath-room, and it was also taken to a steam apparatus, which was pub in the house for the purpose of heating tlie house through steam radiation, as it is called. Still further down upon the stream, and within the very grounds of Mrs. Sander-son, a large dam was erected. This served several purposes, ornamental as well as useful. If was stocked with fish; galvanized iron screens were put at the head and at the foot of <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>this dam so as to prevent the fish escaping, and from this was laid another pipe, also leading to an hydraulic ram, which forced the water upon the lawn for the purposes of irrigation there, and for the purpose of supplying a fountain. Also from this dam, as I remember the testimony, there were water-pipes leading to the barn, for the purpose of using the water there to water the horses and cattle; also to the house of Mr. Sanderson’s gardener, for use there.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[243,748,1179,386]]]'>They continued, it seems, in the use of this water, after the erection of the house, for some two or three years, when the character of the water, as they say, became changed, so completely changed as to be unfit for ordinary domestic use ; they had to abandon it for washing and cleaning purposes, for culinary purposes, and in general for all useful purposes in the house; the fish were killed in the pond, and if I remember the evidence in 1874, it was abandoned finally for any purpose connected with the house.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b144-6" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[240,1136,1181,904]]]'>Now let us turn our attention to some of the other facts as they appear in the evidence. It seems about the same time, in 1867 or 1868, the Pennsylvania Coal Company,- who owned large tracts of land near the head of this stream (some sixteen hundred acres, it is said) began excavating certain tunnels about the Gipsy Grove swamp with the intention of erecting a breaker there and making developments of the coal property. They first drove in 1867, I think one tunnel; and in 1868 other tunnels, until they finally had four tunnels opened there. These, if you believe the evidence, were opened until they struck the coal, the coal being piled outside the tunnel awaiting the erection of a breaker there. The company also sunk a shaft perpendicularly down into the earth, for the purpose of raising coal from a lower vein, and began building their breaker. That was built, I believe, in about the year 1870. They encountered water in the sinking of this shaft, and they had to raise that water to the surface. After they had reached the vein it was pumped from the mine, as opened to that vein, thrown upon the ground, or into a ditch and conveyed away, until it finally reached the waters of Meadow Brook somewhere in this swamp.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b144-7" data-blocks='[["BL_144.6",144,[241,2040,1174,85]]]'>Now the several questions of fact upon which you will have to pass are these: The first is, has Mrs. Sanderson suffered</p>

The question of <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>how, or from what occasion, is a more difficult question, but if you believe the evidence here, she has not voluntarily abandoned the use of this water. She has been actually prevented, from its character, from using it for any of the purposes for which she had originally designed to use it. Now, then, what was the cause of this loss to her? Upon that question, gentlemen, you will have to consider what was the condition of this stream at the time she put her waterworks up there for t he purpose of using the water from it. If you find that it was in a pure condition, or sufficiently pure for ordinary domestic use, that is one side. On the other hand, if you find that it was then vitiated, even though not observed by Mr. Sander-son, so vitiated or so surrounded by that which would eventually vitiate it, then so far as it was disturbed by these circumstances existing around it, at the time she began there in 1868, for that loss of the water, or the loss of the water occasioned by anything of that kind, there could be uo recovery against this defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[222,1198,1173,1247]],["BL_146.1",146,[252,427,1180,130]]]'>Now let us look at the circumstances bearing upon and surrounding the question of the purify of this stream. We have decided testimony that this stream, in its original condition, was a pure mountain stream, not very long in its course — a couple of miles or more, if you believe the evidence, arising in this swamp above, from the accumulation of water there, flowing down through land more or less cleared, prevented somewhat from evaporation by shrubbery growing around its banks and along its banks; that there were fish in it, bullheads or catfish, eels, minnows and chubs, also originally trout, a fish, which it is well known, requires a very pure water to live and thrive in. That was its condition, originally. Now was that changed at the time Mrs. Sanderson began her improvements there, and asserted her intention, by the erection of these waterworks, to use that stream? We have the testimony of parties that at about that time they made use of it; the testimony of several witnesses that it was soft in character, that they were able to drink it, except in warm weather when it got somewhat low. And Mrs. Robinson and Richard Robinson, her husband, who were in the employ of Mr. Sanderson, stated that they used it for ordinary domestic purposes ; had no trouble with it; washing and cleaning with it, making tea and coffee, and using it for the ordinary purposes of the kitchen. Mr. Brundage, who lived along the stream, testified to about the same facts, also Mr. Long. Dr. Fordham made use of it for a while until he discovered a spring in his cellar. We have in addition, to that the testimony of <em>J. </em>Gardner Sanderson and George Sanderson, and I think of Mr. Robertson, all bearing upon this question, that in the ordinary <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>condition of the stream it was of pure character, entirely fit for the use they would ordinarily make of such water, or for such uses as Mrs. Sanderson designed to make of it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.4",146,[242,557,1188,993]]]'>On the other hand, you have the testimony that this was coal land ; that there were boreholes opened along this stream, from which flowed water, more or less impregnated with the same qualities that would come from water that had passed through a mine. That in this little branch that ran into this stream at Forest Hill there were openings, opened a great many years before this; that there was an out-cropping along on the Dickson property, some little ways above, although there is contradictory testimony as to this; that this was only opened as the result of a freshet; also, that there was water coming from tunnels at Gipsy Grove ; yon have the testimony of parties that water was even then, in 1868,.coming from these into the stream; also the filling of the Jessup railroad — the old abandoned Jessup road — reaching across this swamp, made up largely of culm. It is answered to that, that the deleterious substances existing in this culm would, in the long lapse of years, by the action of the sún and wind and rain, become purified. These are questions for you bearing upon the one side or the other, either that this was in a proper condition, a pure condition, or that it was not. It is not for me to suggest at all which has the weight of evidence ; that is for you; these facts are facts that you, gentlemen, must pass upon and not the court.</p>

It must not only guide me in my announcement of the law to you, but it must guide you also, because it is not for you to say what the law is; you must receive the law from the Court as it is laid down, and if we make any error the Supreme Court will correct that, and it would be a very unsafe rule if tlie jury in the jury-box could say what the law ought to be.</p>

Wherever in the anthracite coal region mines are oj&gt;ened, water percolates into them and must flow out. This affects the streams more or less everywhere in the mining regions, and mine water always follows as an inevitable and certain consequence of coal mining. This is so notorious that this Court has taken judicial notice of the fact and its effects. Judge Read, in New Boston Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Pottsville Water Co., 4 P. F.

The very operations now complained of have induced the population that now fills the region.

It is not possible that in a state producing, over 30,000,000 tons of anthracite coal yearly, and 100,000,000 of anthracite and bituminous coal, every ton of which must come from mines which discharge mine water, and from which mine water must be discharged if the indispensable mineral is produced, that it can be just that this great industry is to be crippled if the mine water affects to any extent a stream into which it must flow in its natural state when brought to the surface. The right to mine coal is not a nuisance : the exercise of that right is so far from being a nuisance that it has always been the policy of our state to encourage it, and if the natural courses for drainage are affected by the natural drainage of these mines, the consequence is inevitable and must be submitted to.

The company first opened the coal seams on this land by a drift, or tunnel, in the year 1867 or 1868: they drove three other tunnels and <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>sunk a shaft, and thereafter mining operations were extensively engaged in: the establishment being known as the Gipsy Grove Coal Works. From the time the first tunnel was driven, the mine water flowed, by the natural course of gravity, into the Meadow Brook; as the operation of the mines was increased, the volume of mine water increased. The water which percolated into the shaft was by powerful engines pumped therefrom, and, as it was brought to the surface, it passed with the flow from the tunnel, by an artificial water course, over the defendant’s own land, into the Meadow Brook, which, we have said, was the natural water course for drainage of the entire basin.</p>

She began, and in the year 1870 finished,the erection of a house upon the land; in connection therewith, dams were built across the brook, to form a fish and ice pond, and to supply a cistern; the water was forced by a hydraulic ram from the cistern to a tank in the house, and was used for domestic purposes and for a fountain.</p>

For, if damages may from time to time be recovered, either in the present form or as for a nuisance, punitive sums may be resorted to, to prevent repetition,‘or to compel the abatement of the nuisance. Indeed, if the right to damages in such cases is admitted, equity may and under the decisions of this Court undoubtedly would, at the suit of any riparian owner, take jurisdiction, and upon the ground of a continuous and irreparable injury, enjoin the operation of the mine altogether. Whatever rights Mrs. Sanderson may have to the use of this water, and whatever remedy she may have in this case, or in any other form, in law or in equity, is the right and remedy of every other riparian owner, along Meadow Brook, and whatever maybe the rights and remedies of the owners on Meadow <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>Brook, are, of course, the rights and remedies of all other riparian owners throughout the Commonwealth. It may be that Mrs. Sanderson adopted a more extensive arrangement for the use of this water than any other person, and is consequently more inconvenienced on that account; but the law is the same in her case as in all other cases; if she may recover damages in a large amount, others similarly but less affected, may recover in a less sum. Besides, these riparian owners are not limited to their present modes of enjoyment; it is impossible to foresee what other modes of enjoyment they, or their successors in title, may adopt; or to estimate the extent of damages to which the continued pollution of the stream might proceed; hence, if the responsibility of the operator of a mine is extended to injuries of the character complained of, the consequence must be that mining cannot be conducted, except by the general consent of all parties affected.</p>

It must be conceded, we think, that every man is entitled to the ordinary and natural use and enjoyment of his property ; he may cut down the forest trees, clear and cultivate his land, although in so doing he may dry up the sources of his neighbor’s springs, or remove the natural barriers against wind and storm. If, in the excavation of his land, he should uncover a spring of water, salt or fresh, acidulated or sweet, he will certainly not be obliged to cover it again, or to conduct it out of its course, lest the stream, in its natural flow, may reach his neighbor’s land.

So, too, we think, according to the present practice of mining, the working of the lower strata by shaft, in the usual and ordinary way, must be considered the natural user of the land, for the taking out of the coal, which can be reached by shaft only; and, as the water cannot be discharged by gravit]*-alone, it must necessarily, as part of the process of mining, be lifted to the surface by artificial means, and thence be discharged through the ordinary natural channels for the drainage of the country.</p>

A rule which casts upon an innocent person the responsibility of an insurer is a hard one at the best, aud will not be generally applied unless required by some public policy, or the contract of the parties. The later decisions in the English Courts, seem to encourage rather than to discourage exceptions to it. But we regard the rule in Fletcher <em>v. </em>Rylands as wholly inapplicable to the case under consideration. Referring to the judgment we find the facts of that case to have been as follows : The plaintiff was damaged by his property being flooded with water, which without any fault on his part, broke out of a reservoir, constructed and maintained on the defendant’s land, by the defendant’s orders. The coal under the defendant’s land had, at some remote period been worked out, but this was unknown at the time the defendants gave directions to erect the reservoir. Although the persons employed did not in fact use proper care and skill to provide for the sufficiency of the reservoir, with reference to these old shafts, the defendants were personalty free from all blame. The consequence was that the reservoir, when filled with water, burst iuto the shafts ; the water flowed down through them into the old workings and thence into the plaintiff’s mine, and there did the mischief. “We think that the true rule of law is,” says Blackburn, J., “ that the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief, if it escapes, must keep it in at his peril, and if he does not do so, is <em>prima facie </em>answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. He can excuse himself by showing that the escape was owing to the plaintiffs default; or perhaps that the escape was the consequence of <em>vis </em>major, or the act of God; but as nothing of this sort exists here, it is unnecessary to inquire what excuse would be sufficient. The general rule, as above stated, seems on principle just.”</p>

In the first head note, of the case as reported in L. B., 3 H. L., 330, the general legal proposition, embodied in the judgment of the House of Lords is thus stated: — “Where the owner of land, without wilfulness or negligence, uses his land, in the ordinary manner of its use, though mischief should thereby be occasioned to bis neighbor, be will not be liable for damages.” Thus it seems that the liability, even under the ruling of Bylauds <em>v. </em>Fletcher, is rested on the manifestly hazardous state of things artificially maintained on the land, and not on the natural user of it.</p>

It was held that the rule referred to did not apply, in the operation of natural forces so violent and unexpected that human foresight could not have been reasonably expected to anticipate it.

Under such circumstances we could hardly expect the English judges to lay down a rule suited to the rough mountain lands, which in the main constitute the mining regions of Pennsylvania. We must not overlook the further fact that in England the costly improvements of the country antedate mining operations in many instances for centuries, while here, for the most part, the mining region was a wilderness at the commencement of mining operations. The population, wealth and improvements are the result of mining, and of that alone. The plaintiffs knew, when they purchased their property, that they were in a mining region; they were in a city born of mining operations, and which had become rich and populous as a result thereof. They knew that all the mountain streams in that section were affected by mine water, or were liable to be.

There is no principle of natural law better settled than that water will seek its level according to the law of gravity. There is no rule of human law <em>more </em>firmly established than the principle incorporated into the jurisprudence of all civilized nations, that the water which falls upon the earth, or comes out of its bosom from springs, must follow its natural channel. Hence no Court has ever decided that the owner of mountain lands was responsible for the torrents which at times pour down the mountain sides, to the devastation of tlie plain below. In towns and cities the rule is different. They have, as a general rule, no natural drainage. It is all artificial. Of course, in cities, a man may not throw the water from bis roof upon his neighbor’s roof or yard. In ibis the law is but common sense, or, as Blackstone puts it, “ tlie perfection of reason.”</p>

The right to work mines is a right of property, which, when duly exercised, begets no responsibility. Wilson <em>v. </em>Waddell, L. R., 2 App. Cas., 95. It is also settled, that the disturbance or destruction of subterranean springs, or streams in a proper course of mining, is not a ground of action : Trout <em>v. </em>McDonald, 2 Norris, 144. In Wheatley <em>v. </em>Baugh, 1 Casey, 528, it was held that where a spring depends for a supply upon percolations through the land of the owner above, and, in the use of tlie land for mining or other lawful purposes, the spring is destroyed, such owner is not liable for the damages thus done, unless the injury was occasioned by malice or negligence. Says Lewis, C. J., at page 582: “Percolations spread in every direction through the earth, and it is impossible to avoid disturbing them without relinquishing the necessary enjoyment of the land. Accordingly, the law has never gone so far as to recognize in one man the right to convert another’s farm to his own use for the purpose of a filter. The Roman law, founded on enlightened consideration of the right of property, declared that he who in making a now work upon his own estate, uses his right without trespassing either against any law, custom, title or posses<a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>sion which may subject him to any service towards his neighbors, is not answerable for the damages which they may chance to sustain thereby, unless it be that he made that change merely with a view to hurt others without any advantage to himself.” Again, at page 535, “In conducting extensive mining operations, it is, in general, impossible to prevent the flow of subterranean waters through the interstices in which they have usually passed, and many springs must be necessarily destroyed in order that the proprietors of valuable minerals may enjoy their own. The public interest is greatly promoted by protecting this right, and it is just that the imperfect right and lesser advantage should give place to that | which is perfect, and infinitely the most beneficial to in- ' dividuals and the community in general.” So, if in sinking a 'swell upon one’s own land it destroys the well of his neighbor, jit is <em>damnum absque injuria: </em>Washburne on Easements, 369; Angell on Watercourses, 183; Frazier <em>v. </em>Brown, <a href="/ohio-st/12/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="12 Ohio St. 294" data-case-ids="520282" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/12/0294-01">12 Ohio St., 294</a>; Roath <em>v. </em>Driscoll, <a href="/conn/20/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="20 Conn. 533" data-case-ids="6756278" data-case-paths="/conn/20/0533-01">20 Conn., 533</a>. It is clear, under the authorities in this state and elsewhere, that if the defendants, in proper course of mining, had destroyed the subterranean springs which supply the plaintiff’s stream, and thus destroyed the stream itself, it would have been a loss for which they would not have been entitled to damages, while Kauffman <em>v. </em>Griesemer, 2 Casey, 407, and Martin <em>v. </em>Riddle, Id., 415, distinctly recognize the principle, that in favor of agricultural and mining operations, the volume of the water may be increased by the owner of the upper or superior heritage, and thrown upon the lower or siibservient heritage by its natural or accustomed channels. The plaintiffs have no cause to complain of the increased volume of water. In fact, they do not complain of such increase. They object to nothing but the change in the character and quality of the water. Are they entitled to recover damages for this? I would answer this question affirmatively if the defendants had fouled the water which is discharged from their mine. But, as before said, they have not. They pump it out or allow it to flow from the mine without any admixture of any kind. As Nature created it so they discharge it, leaving it to seek its natural channel. The answer is found in Prescott <em>v. </em>Williams, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Metc.%2C%20429" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="5 Metc., 429">5 Metc., 429</a>, recognized in Kauffman <em>v. </em>Griesemer, <em>supra. </em>Because water is descendible by nature, the owner of a dominant or superior heritage has an easement in the servient or inferior tenements for the discharge of all waters which by nature rise in, or flow or fall upon the surface. Hence, the owner of a mill has an easement in the land below, for the free passage of the water from the mill, in the natural channel of the stream, accompanied with a right to enter upon the land for the pur<a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>pose of cleaning out the stream and removing obstructions to the free flow of tho water. This decision is undoubted law. In terms it applies to all waters which by nature rise in, or flow or fall upon the surface. It applies with equal force to such subterranean springs in a man’s land as, in the pursuit of his lawful use of his land, are brought to the surface. They then rise in his land and flow upon the surface. In such case it is beyond his control. Water is said to be a common enemy. It -passes from the superior to the servient heritage, and so on by the irresistible law of gravity, to the ocean, where it finds its level. Each riparian owner has the use of it, but no right of property beyond the use. It literally has no owner.</p>
    <p id="b177-6" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[211,1007,1178,476]]]'>If damages are to be recovered from the mere flow of water, where no act has been done to change its character or diminish its purity, it is manifest that results of a serious character must follow to the mining and other industrial interests of tho country. If the plaintiffs have a right to recover in this suit, they have a right, under all the authorities, to an injunction to restrain the defendants from the pumping, or even permitting the flow of water for the future. Such an injunction might be effective, at the cost of the destruction of the mine, so ñuas the pumping is concerned, but how the defendants are to stop the natural flow from the drift is not clear to my mind.</p>

    <p id="b177-8" data-blocks='[["BL_177.6",177,[211,1789,1176,552]]]'>If a Court of Equity should refuse to grant an injunction against the defendants to restrain the flow of the mine water for the future, the same result (stoppage of the mine) can be compelled by the common-law action of ease for a nuisance. A recovery in the present action would be no bar to a subsequent suit for continuing the flow of water; and if the first verdict should be for a nominal sum, the second and subsequent verdicts would be such as to empty the cash box of.' any coal company, and make mining practically impossible. For in such cases the jury would be instructed to give such, damages as would punish the defendants, and secure the abatement of the nuisance. Of the readiness of a jury to comply with such instructions I entertain no doubt.</p>

They have made a dif<a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>ferent use of the water and have been more inconvenienced by reason thereof. But that does not affect the principle. If the flow of mine water is an injury for which tlie owner of the mine is responsible in damages, I am unable to see how such mines can be operated in the future, except by the consent of the riparian owners. It is impossible, under any system of government, or any code of laws, that equal and exact justice should be meted out in all cases. Under no state of society, save the savage, can a man enjoy all his natural rights. He is compelled to relinquish a portion of them for the common good. There are many instances in which the prosecution of a man’s lawful business occasions annoyance and loss to some one. The law compels compensation for some ; others, if unaccompanied with negligence, it regards as <em>damnum absque injuria. </em>The distinction between the two classes of cases is very narrow, and it sometimes requires the highest order of wisdom to properly define it. In the present case I think a broader view might have been taken of the question under discussion, which would have been entirely in harmony with well-settled principles of law. The trifling inconvenience to particular persons must sometimes give way to the necessities of a great community. Especially is this true where the leading industrial interest of the state is involved, the prosperity of which affects every household in the Commonwealth.</p>
