The purchase money was payable, twenty-five dollars in hand, and seventy-five dollars in two equal annual instalments with interest; the deed to be delivered, free from incumbrance, upon pajmient of the purchase money. The hand money was paid at the execution of the contract, but the residue of the purchase money still remains unpaid. After his purchase, Ward had a trial survey made to ascertain the lines approximately; a re-survey, however, by a regular surveyor was contemplated. He cut some timber, but never went into the actual possession by residence or cultivation.

Bell, by articles dated July 1st, 1870, agreed with Adaline Clark, on payment of $732.48 within two years, to convey certain lands to her, of which in the meantime she was to have possession. This possession she took and maintained until within four years before suit brought, but paid no purchase money. Bell, finding the premises vacated, entered into the possession, wherefore Mrs. Clark brought ejectment. Mr. Justice Gordon, delivering the opinion of the Court, says: “Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that in thus resuming dominion over the property, the vendor was guilty of either a fraudulent or unlawful act.” “ The rule may be stated thus: where the possession of the vendor is lawful, his vendee cannot maintain ejectment against him, without proof of previous tender of the purchase money, and he must also maintain that tender, by producing the money in court.”</p>
    <p id="b664-8" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[232,1813,1181,473]]]'>In the case at bar, there is no express covenant on part of the vendor to deliver the possession to the vendee. “As a general rule,” says Agnew, J., in Weakland <em>v. </em>Hoffman, 14 Wr., 517, a contract to sell does not, <em>ipso facto', </em>carry a right of possession until conveyance, in the absence of a covenant, to let the party into possession. It is very common, it is true, to let the purchaser in upon a sale, but we know of no rule of law by which the possession, so important a security to the rights of the vendor, shall pass from him without his covenant or his consent.” See also Smith <em>v. </em>Patton, 1 S. &amp; R., 84; Baum <em>v. </em>Dubois, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20260" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="7 Wright 260">7 Wright, 260</a>; Irwin <em>v. </em>Bleakly, 17 P. F. S., 28.</p>

It appears that after his purchase Ward made a trial survey, to ascertain the probable boundaries of his purchase, and cut some timber; <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>whether those acts were known or approved by St. John does not appear. It is clear, however, that Ward never assumed the actual possession of the land. A mere temporary occupancy for the purpose of making a surve or taking off timber, by one having no right of possession, Is not such an actual occupancy as defeats the constructive possession, which the law casts upon the owner: Harlan <em>v. </em>Harlan, 8 Harris, 607; Brower <em>v. </em>Fleming, 1 P. F. S., 115.</p>
    <p id="b665-6" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[245,840,1173,345]]]'>The defendant was the legal owner of the land, and as he had not conveyed or yielded the possession to any other person, he was at all times constructively in the possession, under his title; he had a right at any time to enter and occupy the laud, subject of course to the equity of the vendee, to lyhom for any injury to the freehold, he might under some circumstances be answerable ; not as a trespasser, but in another form of proceeding: Edelman <em>v. </em>Yeakel, 8 Casey, 26.</p>
    <p id="b665-7" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[244,1187,1175,819]]]'>To maintain trespass, the plaintiff must either have actual possession or the immediate right to it, flowing from the right of property, and it is plain that he had neither. It is not pretended that he was at any time in the actual occupancy of the land, and he could only be entitled to that right, upon the footing of a specific performance of his contract. The contract of purchase was made in the year 1854, at which time only twenty-five dollars of the purchase money was paid; no part of the residue has ever been paid, or offered to be paid ^ almost thirty years had elapsed before tbe alleged trespass was committed; during all that time the laud remained unoccupied and unimproved, and since 1867 until the bringing of this suit, no act appears to have been done or words spoken in assertion of the plaintiffs right. Prior to that time the lands were, to some extent, stripped of the timber, yet the unpaid purchase money, by the interest since accrued, has tripled in amount. Under such circumstances, the vendor might well suppose the contract to have been abandoned, and a chancellor would certainly hesitate to decree a specific performance.</p>
    <p id="b665-8" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[242,2008,1173,517]],["BL_666.1",666,[229,424,1180,302]]]'>A vendee, by articles, cannot experiment with his purchase ; he will not he allowed to pursue a course of conduct calculated to mislead the vendor into the belief that the contract is abandoned, and when the development of the resources of the country makes it bis interest to demand performance. Lapse of time, change of circumstances, and indifference on the part of a vendee of land, are circumstances to induce a chancellor to refuse a decree of specific performance: Patterson <em>v. </em>Martz, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20874" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="8 Watts 874">8 Watts, 874</a>. “If a party seeking a specific execution has been guilty of gross laches, or has been inexcusably negligent in performing the contract on his part; or if, in the intermediate period, there has arisen a material change of circum<a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>stances affecting the rights, interests and. obligations of the parties, a court of equity will refuse to decree a specific performance.” This rule 'is held with more strictness against a party out of possession: Russell <em>v. </em>Baughman, 13 Norris, 400. Specific performance is within the sound discretion of the chancellor; there must be no default in the plaintiff, which would render performance inequitable.</p>
    <p id="b666-6" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[228,726,1179,174]]]'>The plaintiff’s claim under his contract has been too long neglected; it has by this neglect lost its vitality, and become stale; it cannot now, after this great lapse of time, be resurrected, to harass the title of the legal holder.</p>
    <p id="AnqL" data-blocks='[["BL_666.5",666,[488,899,917,88]]]'>We are of opinion that the plaintiff has no case, and the judgment is therefore reversed.</p>
