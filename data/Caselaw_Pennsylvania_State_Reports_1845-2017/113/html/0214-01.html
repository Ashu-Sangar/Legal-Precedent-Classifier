A small triangular portion of this lot, covered by the marble mill on the corner of the streets named, was appropriated by the company for the use of its tracks, and it is claimed, on part of the plaintiffs, that by the appropriation of this particular portion of the lot, the residue is greatly depreciated in value, not only to Hiram S. Getz, the owner in fee, but to H. S. Getz &amp; Co., who, as tenants from year to year, were occupying the premi ses, and prosecuting the business aforesaid. The jury found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $6,900; $2,760 of this sum iu favor of H. S. Getz, and $4,140 in favor of H. S.

What was its value as affected by the injury? The difference is the true measure of compensation. The damages must be measured according to the market value for any useful purpose, and the estimate both before and after the injury must embrace all the buildings, machinery, etc., which gave to the property its distinctive character as a marble mill. It was proper, therefore, to inquire what the property of H. S. Getz <em>&amp; </em>Co., not only the lease, but the machinery and fixtures used in connection therewith, was worth before and after it was affected by the injury. This was the only way the jury could accurately ascertain the true amount of damages to which the tenants were entitled.</p>

It is true the tenancy might have been terminated at the end of the current year, and a removal thus compelled at the expense of the tenants, but under the special circumstances of this case, we cannot assume that it would have been terminated; in fact, it was not, and the company cannot be absolved from the direct and necessary consequence of their own act, because of a contingency that might or could have happened at the end of the year. The determination of the lease, as an estate in the land was of course to be estimated upon the residue of the current year only, and of the machinery as it was connected with the. leasehold property at the time, according to the value thereof before and after the injury; and as to the latter, the expenses of a compulsory removal, upon failure of the remedy by injunction were, we think, properly considered.</p>
