Bender, a farmer, living in the vicinity of New Holland, Lancaster county, Pa., was called upon at his place’by Matthias Bush, a dealer in horses, who purchased from him three horses for the sum of $355. Ten dollars was paid that day as earnest. The balance of $345 was to be paid on the following Monday at the Black Horse Hotel in Lancaster, when delivery was to be made. Bender brought the horses, in pursuance of the agreement, to the said hotel. Upon their arrival in the hotel yard Mr. Bender refused to deliver them until he was paid, and ordered them to be tied in the yard, which was done. Bush, Bender and a few others then went into the hotel to pay over and receive the money. When they got into the bar-room Bush, or some one for him, proceeded to count down money in one and two dollar bills to Bender, and when the sum reached about $40, pro<a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>dnccd two notes of Bender’s to Bansing, one for $150, dated September 18th, 1882, for sixty days, and the other for $152.20, dated November 22d, 1882. Bender refused to receive said notes in payment, and started immediately to the yard for his horses, when they were gone — Bush having got some person or persons to take the horses away in the meantime, which was unknown to Bender. The same day Bender issued a writ of replevin for the horses and Bush entered bond with the sheriff and claimed property. On the trial in Court, Bush, the defendant below, offered the two notes above referred to in evidence and tried to have the damages reduced to the extent of the amount of the same with interest, which was refused.
