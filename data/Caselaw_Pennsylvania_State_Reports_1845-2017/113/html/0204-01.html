She gave birth to a child, which he claimed and recognized to be his. There is evidence that at times he declared she was his wife, and introduced her as such. On one occasion, when he conve}ed some real estate, she joined in the deed as his wife. At other times, when asked whether he <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>was married to her, he would give evasive answers, neither admitting or denying that he was or was not. At the time the child was born, Rebecca Forney swears they were not married, that witness asked each of them about that time. “He said he was not married, that he would take her for a housekeeper.” “ He said he would never marry her.” “ She said she was long ago married.”</p>

    <p id="b223-7" data-blocks='[["BL_223.7",223,[212,1589,1175,767]]]'>She was afterwards called and testified in her own behalf.

She did not swear that she was ever married to Riegel, or that there was any agreement between them under which they lived together as husband and wife. On the argument of the case in the Court below, it appears by the opinion of the Court that the appellant asked why she was not examined with reference to her marriage with the decedent. The answer was that she was called and testified only in rebuttal. The learned judge says “ the question why she was not called and did not testify in chief, still remains unanswered, and I submit that I am not able to answer it.”</p>

    <p id="b224-6" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[238,1026,1182,466]]]'>Here the evidence establishes with sufficient certainty that in its inception the relation between the appellee and Riegel was illicit, and there is no sufficient evidence to create a legal presumption of any subsequent marriage. In arriving at this conclusion we do not doubt the correctness of the law as declared in Richard <em>v. </em>Brehm, 73 Id., 140, and numerous kindred eases. Many times marriage may be proved by acts of recognition, continued matrimonial cohabitation, and general reputation. Here, however, the evidence falls far short of satisfying the mind that there was ever any actual agreement to form the relation of husband and wife.</p>
    <p id="b224-7" data-blocks='[["BL_224.6",224,[238,1501,1184,519]]]'>There is another feature in the case, which, if proved, would establish that she is the wife of another man who is still living. The appellant gave evidence tending to prove that before the appellee formed any relations with Riegel she lived and cohabited with one Jeremiah Ribble, and was reported to be his wife, and he is still living. Some eight witnesses testify that Ribble and she were living together, keeping house and reputed to be husband and wife. Four of these witnesses were neighbors living on the same street with them ; one was a cousin of the appellee ; and three of them were brothers of Ribble. Two of the brothers testify that he told them he and she were married and were living together or keeping house.</p>

If, in fact, she lived and cohabited with him as his mistress, the reputation proved, and his declarations would not make her his wife. They would not be sufficient to establish the existence of a valid marriage with him. They do however tend to <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>strengthen the probability that she may have formed the same kind of meretricious relation with Riegel.
