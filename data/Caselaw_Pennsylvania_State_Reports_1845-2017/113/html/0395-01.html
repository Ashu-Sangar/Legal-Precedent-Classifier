The Court held that the “defendant having excused the plaintiff for good and sufficient reasons from a temporary discharge of duty, and failing to take any action indicating an intention to relieve him from bis office, must be regarded as assenting to his absence, and is estopped from insisting or claiming that the plaintiff was not in its employment.”</p>

That would be true if the Constitution itself did not make the exception. In that city the office of alderman is abolished, certain courts created, and the power of Hie legislature to change the civil jurisdiction of, or confer political powers on, said courts, is prohibited. But that city is excepted, and the power of the legislature to enlarge the civil jurisdiction of aldermen and justices of the peace in other parts of the State is unrestrained, save that it shall not be done by a local or special jaw. It must be general for all the State, except as otherwise provided in the Constitution.</p>

That the legislature intended by the proviso, in pursuance of the Constitution, merely to except Philadelphia, cannot bo doubted. Surely they did not intend that the Act should not apply to cities of the first class, should there be others besides Philadelphia some time in the future. They intended to enact a law; not to do a vain thing. In the attempt to obey the Constitution and to except Philadelphia out of the statute, they used a periphrasis instead of the proper name ; and the phrase, “ cities of the first class,” may not always mean only Philadelphia. Having reference to the Constitution, and to prior statutes classifying cities, and to the fact that Philadelphia alone is in the first class, can the proviso be construed according to the obvious intent, to save the Act from being a nullity ?</p>
