That no such claim would have been set up before the adoption of the new Constitution of 1874, and the Act of Assembly passed May 14th, 1874, is conceded, but it is argued that the law is now different, made so, it is urged, by the first and second sections of the ninth Article of the Constitution, and by the first section of the statute referred to. The language of the Constitution is as follows: “All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws; but the General Assembly may, by general laws, exempt from taxation public property used for public purposes, actual places of religious service, places of burial not used or held for private or corporate profit, and institutions of purely public charity.

Hospitals, universities, and other institutions of benevolence or charity, although they might be public property, are evidently not included for that reason, but because of their being benevolent or charitable enterprises. The argument is that all public property not covered and exempted by the spécifie terms of the Act must be taxable. In this view I cannot agree. It is, as appears by its title, an Act to exempt from taxation, and can only he held to have reference to the property therein specifically enumerated. It cannot affect other property not mentioned.

Municipal corporations, counties, cities or townships are parts of the state government. They are local depositories of limited and prescribed political powers to be exercised for the public good within their respective boundaries. Why should they tax the property of each other any more than each should tax its own property, or that the property of the state itself should pay taxes ?

Most certainly not, unless there be some very express enactment authorizing it. If there can be any common law relative to taxation, this must be one of its most elementary precepts ; because it is a manifest dictate of common sense and because the contrary is absurd, unless under very special circumstances.</p>

Why this would be to take the poor taxes to support the schools : and the people must be taxed to pay the officers who perform such foolish service. If we require the townships, counties, towns, cities and state, and the road, school and poor authorities to tax each other, we shall furnish fees enough for several hundred officers engaged in transferring from one public body to another the taxes which it has collected for its public purposes. Then poor taxes must be collected to support the school and roads, and school taxes to support the poor, and so all around. Surely it is not too much to say that this is absurd. The public is never subject to tax laws, and no portion of it can be without express statutes.' No exemption law is needed for any public property held as such.”</p>

Public property was before the adoption of the new Constitution exempt from taxation, not by statute or by constitutional provision, but from the reason and necessity of things. As said in the case of Directors of the Poor of Schuylkill County <em>v. </em>School Directors of North Mauheim Township, <a href="/pa/42/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="42 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="481491" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0021-01">42 Pa. St., 21</a>, already cited : “ If there can be any common law relative to taxation this must be one of its most elementary principles.” The exemption did not depend upon any statute. The cases referred to by counsel for plaintiff, in which it has been held that this section of the Constitution was a repeal of certain statutes exempting private property from taxation, can have no bearing on the question here involved. There was no statutory provision to be repealed, either by implication or otherwise. I am of the opinion that the law remains as it was prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1874, and that the Act of Assembly of that year contains nothing to justify the imposition of the tax sought to be enforced by the plaintiff. It was an exempting Act, and it would be strange indeed if an enactment which, by its title and entire tenor, was meant to define what property should be exempt froiii <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>liability, could be so construed as to subject public property to taxation which was not so liable before the Constitution of 1874, which was not made liable by that instrument, and which is not even referred to by the terms of the Act of Assembly under which it is claimed that the alleged new liability has attached. Article IX. of the Constitution defines clearly in general terms what kind of property may be exempted, and names, first in the list “ public property used for public purposes.” The second section provides that all laws exempting property from taxation, other than the property enumerated, shall be void. Certainly the legislature could then have included without violation of the Constitution municipal property, which is in every respect quite as much public property as a court house or a jail, in the enumeration of exempt property in the Act of 1874. That it was not so specifically included should not subject it to liability in the entire absence of any express or affirmative provision making it so subject. The vague and obscure proviso at the close of the first section of the Act can hardly be held sufficient to revolutionize all previous practice and the common and longstanding invariable consent and usage by which such public property has always been held not to be subject to taxation. And in this connection it is well to recur to the general rule already referred to, and which is - supported by abundance of authority, viz.: That the general statutes of a state on the subject of taxation are to be considered as having reference to private property and not to that owned by the state or by counties, cities, towns, or other divisions of the general body politic. I am of the opinion that on the facts presented in the case stated the property described is not liable to taxation for county purposes, and accordingly judgment is hereby entered in favor of the defendant for costs.</p>

      <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>In Cooley on Taxation, 180, it is said, “ It is always to be assumed that the general language of statutes is made use of with reference to taxable subjects, and the property of municipalities is not in any proper sense taxable. It is therefore by clear implication excluded.”</p>
    <p id="b383-6" data-blocks='[["BL_383.4",383,[245,648,1172,1148]]]'>This being so the property in question was not taxable at the adoption of the Constitution of 1874. Hiere is no legislation since that which makes it taxable. The Act of May 14th, 1874, P. L. 158, contains no provision subjecting such property to taxation. Unless therefore Article IX. § 1 of the Constitution changes the law and makes such property taxable, it is not taxable at all simply because there is no law making it so. The language of the section is as follows : <em>“ </em>All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax and shall be levied and collected under general laws; but the General Assembly may, by general laws, exempt from taxation public property used for public purposes, actual places of religious worship, places of burial not used or held for private or corporate profit, and institutions of purely public charity.” This section does not declare that all property whether public or private shall be subject to taxation nor does it contain any equivalent provision. It docs however direct that “ all taxes ..... shall be levied and collected under general laws.” This certainly means that the legislative power of the Commonwealth shall provide the necessary legislation for levying and collecting all taxes: In Lehigh Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Lower Macungie Twp., 31 P. F. S., 482, and in Coatesville Gas Co.v. County of Chester, 1 Out., 476, we held that these provisions of the Constitution do not execute themselves but were simply mandatory to the legislature to enact laws to carry them into effect.</p>
    <p id="b383-7" data-blocks='[["BL_383.5",383,[248,1808,1172,503]]]'>The provision of section 1, therefore, can not operate to repeal any pre-existing law exempting public property from taxation because there was no such law. Such property was not taxable because there was no law which made it so. It was the absence not the presence ox law which made it nou-taxable. The new Constitution might have made it taxable but did not, and as the legislature has failed to make it taxable, there is no law for its taxation and it is not taxable at all. It is true the legislature of 1874 did exercise its power and exempt certain property which does not include this, but the fact still remains that they did not impose any taxation upon this and hence there is none.</p>
