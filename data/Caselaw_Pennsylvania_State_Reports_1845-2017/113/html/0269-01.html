A few day's after, on the afternoon of Thursday, May 16th, 1882, two of these patrolmen, Hutchinson and Koockogey, went to the store with a one-horse wagon to bring the tarpaulins away. They were folded up into bundles in the fourth story of the store. Instead of putting them on a hoist which ran up and down a large hatchway alongside of these tarpaulins, they were pitched out of the window upon the pavement.

The amount of the verdict, even if paid, would be an inadequate compensation to his wife and children, left without means. The judgment will probably be of no value whatever, but it may serve to indicate that Courts and juries estimate at its true value the life of a citizen so recklessly and wantonly taken. The defendant is fortunate that he is not being tried for murder. There are no mitigating circumstances in his case; neither he nor his companion took the stand to justify or excuse his conduct in any way whatever. No reason could be urged why the jury should not give to the widow and children the pecuniary loss sustained by them. We think the verdict should not be disturbed.</p>

The managers of a corporation instituted for gain are punished when their corporate gains are taken, bat what does the manager of a charity care if the trust funds are made responsible for his fault ? it is not he who is injured, but the deaf, the halt and the blind, whoso funds are dissipated for his misconduct.</p>

The ability of the trustees to make contracts is promotive of its purpose, under the supervision of our Courts, who see that they are not fraudulently made, while their liability for the misconduct of those managers would be destructive of its purpose.

Lord Campbell said (page 518): “ It seems to have been thought that if charity trustees are guilt}*- of a breach of trust, the <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>persons damnified thereby have a right to be indemnified out of the trust funds. That is contrary to all reason, justice and common sense. Such a perversion of the intention of the donor would lead to most inconvenient consequences. The trustees would in that case be indemnified against the consequences of their own misconduct, and the real object of the charity would be defeated......Damages are to be paid from the pocket of the wrong-doer, not from a trust fund. A doctrine so strange as the Court below has laid down in the present case ought to have been supported by the highest authority. There is not any authority, not a single shred here to support it. No foreign or constitutional writer can be referred to for such a purpose.” The concurring opinions of Lord Cottenham and Lord Brougham were equally strong. .....This we think should rule the present case, the two corporations being almost identical in object and mode of support.</p>

It is true that he might have known that his companion would throw the tarpaulin from the window, for he had already thrown two without injuring any one. Could we assume from .that he ought to have known that he would act in the'reckless way that he did ? In fact Koockogev himself might have been the victim of it.

Granted ; but he did not direct the men to throw them upon the heads of passers-by. They might have been thrown out with perfect safety, and had been on former occasions. Had he directed the men to take them down the stairway’ and an accident occurred, would he have been responsible? This is not pretended, yet there would be as much reason to hold him in the one case as the other.

In order to protect the property therein from injury by water, tarpaulins were spread by the patrol upon the upper floor of the building. On 6th May, following, Andrew C. Koockogey and James A. Hutchinson, two of the employés of the patrol, came to remove the tarpaulins, which had remained there from the time of the fire. They backed a wagon to the curb to receive them ; Koockogey stood upon the sidewalk, whilst Hutchinson pitched the tarpaulins from the window to the pavement below. One of the bundles, in its <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>descent, struck Mr. Charles A. Boyd, who was at the timo passing on the sidewalk, injured his spine, and from the effects of the injury he,in a few days died.</p>

He and Hutchinson, it is true, came together to remove the tarpaulins from the fourth story of the store, and it was doubtless the duty of each, in so doing, to exercise due diligence and care for the safety of those passing, but unless their negligence was joint or concurrent, each was liable for his own negligence only. Koockogey was the driver; he stood at the horses’ head, during the entire transaction, and although they may have together determined to throw the bundles out of the window upon the pavement, lie had no reason to suppose that Hutchinson would recklessly throw the bundles upon the heads of the passers by. There is no evidence that Koockogey was stationed below to give notice, or that they divided the dangers between them. The case is in this respect, similar to McCullough <em>v. </em>Shoneman, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20W.N.C.%20397" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="14 W.N.C. 397">14 W. N.

The officers of the municipality have been held to be quasi civil officers of the government, although appointed by the corporation; they are themselves <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>personally liable for their malfeasance or nonfeasance in office, but for neither is the corporation responsible. The corporation appoints them to office, but does not in that act sanction their official delinquencies, or render itself liable for their official misconduct: Prother <em>v. </em>City of Lexington, 18 B. Munroe, 559. In order to charge a municipal corporation for negligence in the performance of a public work, the law must have imposed a duty on it, so as to make that neglect culpable : Elliott <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 25 P. F. S., 847. Thus, the municipality is charged with the grading and repair of the highways, and the negligence of the officers of the municipality, in this respect, may be visited upon the municipality itself; but unless a duty has been thus imposed, the corporation can not be held.</p>

Cases, 641. A subordinate officer, when he is an independent officer, must stand or fall by himself; and to him, unless otherwise provided by statute, the maxim <em>respondeat superior </em>does not apply: Wh.

The following cases, with others, are relied upon as supporting this view of the law: Russell <em>v. </em>Men of Devon, 2 T.

    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[246,1063,1178,215]]]'>Upon this assumption as to the law, however, it is contended that the Insurance Patrol, whether regarded as a public agent auxiliary to the city of Philadelphia, or to the government, or as a public charitable Institution, is not liable for the malfeasance or negligence of its employes.</p>
    <p id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[248,1280,1180,823]]]'>But the Fire Insurance Patrol is of course neither a municipal corporation nor a public officer, nor can we say with certainty, from the charter alone, that it is a public agent, auxiliary to the city government of Philadelphia, or to its fire department, or that it is even a public charitable institution. It will be observed that there is no proof whatever as to whether or not the Insurance Patrol has any working capital; whether any, and if any what,incomes or sources of revenue it may have, as means of conducting its business, or as to the manner in which its business is or has been conducted, whether as a general or public charity or otherwise; the only evidence on the subject is the charter, under which it is authorized to act. There is, it is true, no provision in the charter for capital stock, for dividends of profits, or for rates of charge. On the other hand the charter contains no express provision that the corporation, is to be conducted wholly in the public interest or as a public charity, it is not stated that it will be supported by voluntary contribution, or by appropriation, for the state or the city, or that its services will be gratuitously rendered.</p>

But when the capital is not restricted, and tbe number of shares is not defined in the charter, these matters will depend upon the subsequent agreement of the corpora-<a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>tors, who may in their “rules, regulations and by-laws for the well ordering of the business and affairs of the corporation,” determine not only the amount necessary to conduct the business, and adjust the number and value of the shares, as they may deem best for their own convenience and interests, but also the rates of charge and the method of dividing the profits. The operation of a society for the protection of life and property at fires might perhaps be regarded as exercising a public function. Such a society would certainly be the proper object of a gift for charitable uses. For as this Court said in Price <em>v. </em>Maxwell, 4 Casey, 35, adopting the language of the late Horace Binney, whatever is given for the love of God, or for the love of your neighbor, in the catholic and universal sense —given from these motives and to these ends — free from the stain or taint of every consideration that is personal, private or selfish, is a gift for charitable uses, according to that religion from which the law of charitable uses has been derived.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[215,1144,1183,423]]]'>But that which is the purpose of a public charity may be the distinctive purpose of a trading corporation, out of which it is proposed to realize profits; it is not the object alone of a corporation which makes it charitable within the meaning of the law, it is the mode in which that object is sought to be attained, as well as the purpose for which it is pursued. A private corporation, exercising a public function, or engaged in charitable work for private gain, can certainly in no sense be characterized either as a public agent or as a public charitable institution.</p>

Thus in Humane Fire Co.’s Appeal, 7 Norris, 389, the object of the corporation was the protection of property from fire, but the fact was assumed, and the case considered upon the ground,that the company was in fact not a trading corporation designed to make money for its shareholders, but a charity incorporated as a public benefaction ; it was therefore held that the assets were held in trust for the public, and were not distributable among the members at dissolution. So in Bethlehem Bor. <em>v. </em>Perseverance Fire Co., 31 P. F. S., 445, the charter declared the object of the corporation to be “the protection of the property of our fellow-citizens from fire,” but the proof exhibited the fact that the corporation was conducted as a 'charity, that its property had been acquired by voluntary subscription, by public entertainments, &amp;c., and it was held that the organization was not for the private gain of its members, and the property in aid of the object was for charitable uses.</p>

If it were shown that, although the charter is silent on the subject, the corporation was in fact conducted as a public charity, that its services were gratuitously rendered to the public for the public good, then the question which has been so ably discussed in this case, would be raised for our consideration.</p>
