I collected the premiums and remitted the same to the company, less my commissions. I received this policy from the company direct by mail, and delivered it to Thomas J. Lancaster. I had a running account with Mr. Lancaster. In March, the day before the fire at the Elkins’s property, he paid me $100 on account.”</blockquote>

Ninety-nine times out of one hundred I signed as agent.”</blockquote>

      <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>From this it appears that Crane had power, on receipt of a policy, to deliver it to the assured, or to his agent, and to collect the premiums. The company looked to Crane, either for the return of the policy, or for the premium. Upon delivery of the policy, he was obligated to pay the premium, as for his own debt. He, therefore, kept an account with the company, and charged himself with the premiums, as the policies were delivered, and took credit with any remittances he might make.</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[248,816,1174,343]]]'>Now if it be true, that an arrangement to this effect existed between the company and Crane, and that may be fairly inferred from the evidence, the arrangement would seem to indicate that the company was content to accept the responsibility of their own agent for such sums.as he might receive, or otherwise provide for, on delivery of the policies, and to substitute the personal liability of the agent in the place of the securitj which the suspension clause in their contract afforded.</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[248,1161,1176,427]]]'>This implication is greatly strengthened by the course of business which the agent pursued in the conduct of the company’s business. He delivered such policies as he chose, and charged the premiums in an account which he kept. He had a running account with Lancaster, and the premiums for this insurance were charged up to Lancaster when the policy in suit was delivered to him. The effect of such a course of business as respects Crane certainly was to substitute the liability of Lancaster for that of the assured, and Lancaster says he usually rendered bills to Mr. Elkins once in three months.</p>
    <p id="b410-6" data-blocks='[["BL_410.6",410,[247,1590,1171,684]]]'>In view of the course of business pursued by this company with Crane, and by this agent in the consummation of their contracts, we think the implication might fairly arise that any absolute requirement of the policy, as to the actual prepayment of the premiums, had been dispensed with, and that the obligation of the agent to pay'the premium was in effect the payment of it by the assured. If Crane had advanced the money to the company, and delivered the policy, no one can doubt that it would have taken immediate effect, and in what respect can there be any difference, in principle, if Crane, with the company’s consent, assumed the payment, thus substituting his personal liability in place of the money? Lancaster became debtor to Crane and Crane to the company, and this, in view of the course of business pursued by the company, would, as between the insurer and the insured, we think, be equivalent to actual payment.</p>
    <p id="b410-7" data-blocks='[["BL_410.7",410,[247,2275,1165,85]]]'>We think there was enough in this case to require its submission to the jury.</p>
