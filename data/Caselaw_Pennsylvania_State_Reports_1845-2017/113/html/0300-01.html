      <em>(b) </em>The testimony on the part of the plaintiff, however, contained sufficient evidence of negligence in the defendant to send the case to a jury.

If, under any circumstances, permitting an unnecessary occupation of the car platform would amount to negligence, unless it would under all circumstances, the jury alone can determine whether in a particular case it was justifiable. For a carrier to permit its ear platform to be unnecessarily crowded in such a way as to directly cause the injury of'a passenger attempting to alight, can hardly be claimed to reach - the extraordinary degree of care required of it; and unless that proposition can be broadly affirmed, the question is always one for the jury, where it is shown that an unnecessary occupation of the platform contributed to an injury.</p>

    <p id="b319-10" data-blocks='[["BL_319.13",319,[230,2037,1174,427]]]'>This accident occurred on an evening in the month of February. The plaintiff testified substantially, that when she got out of the car she was carrying her child on her left arm ; she tried to get hold of the dasher with the other hand ; she could not do so as a passenger standing on the platform was leaning against it. There were two passengers on the platform, one on each side of the conductor, and some four or five passengers in the inside of the car. In getting down her foot slipped on the step by reason of ice thereon, and she fell and was injured.</p>

The first is, that when there was ample room for all the passengers to ride in the car, the defendant permitted one to stand on the platform in such a position that she could not avail herself of the security and protection which she otherwise would have enjoyed; the other, the omission to remove from the step the ice formed during the storm of the previous day.</p>

If, in this case, the defendant permitted a passenger to remain standing on the platform in such a position as to deprive the plaintiff of that reasonable support which would have protected her from injury, and did not furnish other suitable protection, we think the jury is the proper tribunal to find whether the defendant was thereby guilty of negligence.</p>

It may be impossible in the winter to prevent deposits on the step by falling snow, or from the feet of persons entering the car, and which in either case may result in the formation of ice. The main question in regard to this is whether it remained there for such time and in such form as to establish the negligence of the defendant, and that this negligence contributed to the injury of the plaintiff.</p>
