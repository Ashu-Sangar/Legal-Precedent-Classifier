The spirit of the Constitution must be followed in legislation as well as its letter.

The decisions of tbe Supreme Court upon the constitutionality of the Act of 1874, when closely examined, will be found to furnish no precedent for such legislation. The Act of 1874 when applied to certain subjects, has been declared constitutional, but it can hardly be said to follow that any Act which may be passed containing the same option clause as the Act of 1874, can shield itself under the pale of these decisions. Both Wheeler <em>v. </em>Pliila., 27 P. F. S., 338, .and Kilgore <em>v. </em>Magee, 4 Norris, 401, arose upon questions concerning legislation affecting all cities of the first and second classes respectively. A statute which should at the time of its approval apply to all cities of the third class would have for its support the precedent of these decisions. The Act of 1875 goes further than this; under its provisions there may be a further division of cities of the third class into those which have accepted the Act of 1875, and those which have not, and this irrespective of their acceptance of the Act of 1874 to which the Act of 1875 is called a supplement. Some cities may accept the Act of 1874 and reject the supplement, while others accept the supplement and reject the Act of 1874. Thus by a juggle between the legislature and the municipalities special legislation is obtained, .and the Constitution is evaded. The wisdom of special legislation for cities is not now <em>in </em>question. It is enough to <em>say </em>the Constitution prohibits it. To support that Constitution, in its letter and spirit, is the duty of courts of justice. If it is wise and just to levy an unequal rate of taxation upon separate classes of property in cities throughout this Commonwealth, the legislature have the power to enact a law for that purpose ; they have no power under the Constitution to enact a law which shall permit the various cities to choose for themselves whether they will have an equal or an unequal rate ; if this could be done, the same principle would permit every subject of municipal regulation to be virtually enacted by the several municipalities, and an era of special legislation inaugurated, tenfold worse than that which existed before the present Constitution was adopted.</p>

The prohibition against local or special laws upon this subject includes the command that whenever laws relating thereto are passed, they shall be general in their application. Anything which defeats or limits their general application is obnoxious to the prohibition. If certain counties or cities cannot be specially legislated for by name, they cannot be thus legislated for by including them in an exception to a general law. ' The inhibition is against passing laws that will operate upon them alone to the exclusion of others in the same general legal category. Again, the fact whether a law is general or special is to be determined by the force of its operating words at the time of its passage, and cannot be made to depend upon the happening of any such contingency as the desire or action of the councils of a city or the act of a board of county commissioners. If the legislature cannot give a particular county immunity from the operation of a general law, it cannot depute to the city or county the privilege of giving itself such immunity. The power denied to the superior body cannot be vested by it in the subordinate. Neither can the intendment of a broad constitutional provision be defeated by any mere juggle of words. If the law only recognizes cities of given classes, the legislature cannot further divide those classes into those accepting and those not accepting legislation. Neither can such a division be set up as counties governed by special laws and those not governed by special laws. If this could be done, the whole purpose of the constitutional prohibition would be defeated. Some counties or cities in given classes would be governed by one law, and some by others. If the bills now objected to should be signed, the extent or generality of their application would be dependent entirely upon the willingness or unwillingness of certain counties or cities to be governed by them. Surely, this cannot be done, and the purpose of the Constitution be defeated in such an indirect and specious manner. The tendency of this sort of legislation has become so great that I think it is time to assert rigidly the spirit and letter of the Constitution. It is true that many laws containing option clauses have been enacted in the past, and some may have received the sanction of the present executive. The recur<a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>renco of this character of enactments, however, has become so frequent as to induce me to attempt to out-root the practice, if possible.</p>

The rate claimed by plaintiff is less than the full rate levied upon the adjusted valuation made for city purposes upon which the defendant has caused the school tax to be assessed. The proviso to the fifth section of the Act of the 18th March, 187,5, excludes from the operation of the Act all cities of the third class and all cities containing less than ten thousand population previously incorporated, which do not accept, by an ordinance duly passed, the provisions of the Act.

Whether the methods prescribed by the Act <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>shall be the law,will depend,not upon the terms of the legislation, but upon the will of others who are not law-makers at all; and what may be the law in one city of the third class may not be the law in another city of the same class. In other words, a majority of the members of the city councils in any one city of the third class may impose upon the inhabitants of that city a method of taxation which may not prevail in any other city of the Commonwealth. A law which authorizes this to be done is, in our judgment, clearly obnoxious to the seventh section of the third article of the Constitution, which prohibits the General Assembly from passing any local or special law regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs or school districts.</p>

The practical result is the same, the law of 1875 will be limited to the one or more cities that do accept, and that makes it local. All our recent decisions are to the effect that if local results either are or may be produced by a piece of legislation, it offends against this provision of the Constitution,' and is void: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Patton, 7 Norris, 258 ; Scowden’s Appeal, 15 Id., 422; Davis <em>v. </em>Clark, 15 W. N. (3., 209; McCarthy <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, Id., 497. In the first of these cases the method employed was to limit the application of the Act which ostensibly embraced “all counties ” by a geographical description which confined it to one. In the next case the attempt was made to produce the same result by describing two concurrent populations of county and city of such figures as to confine the operation of the Act practically to but one county, and it was condemned for the same reason. In the last two of the cases named, the objectionable limitation restrained the operation of the Act to counties of prescribed population, and in both cases the legislation was condemned because it embraced less than the whole of the counties of the state. In Davis <em>v. </em>Clark the present Chief Justice said: “It was not then a general Act, applicable to every part of the Commonwealth. It did not apply to a great number of counties, but there is no dividing line between a local and a general statute. It musj; be either one or the other. If it apply to the whole state it is general. If to a part only, it is local. As a legal principle it is as effectually local when it applies to sixty-five counties out of the sixty-seven as if it applied to one only. The exclusion of a single county from the operation of this Act makes it local.” We see no difference in principle between the foregoing cases and the present. It is the duty of the Court to enforce the Constitution as they find it. Attempts in covert modes to defeat its plain provisions, must be <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>set aside with the same certainty as when the methods are open. Even if the intention be innocent, and yet the legislation comes within the constitutional prohibition, it must not be tolerated. We are of opinion that the second conclusion of law found by the Master should have been sustained and the bill dismissed. The other matters discussed do not require consideration.</p>
