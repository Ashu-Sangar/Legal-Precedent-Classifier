    <p class="summary" id="b386-4" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[238,590,1190,1730]]]'>In the opinion filed in No. 172, February Term, 1886, County of Erie <em>v. </em>City of Erie, and which case involved the question of the right of the county to levy a tax upon the fire engine houses, etc., owned by the city, I took occasiop to go pretty fully into the general subject, and it is not necessary to repeat what was then said, or to do more than to refer to the authorities and legal doctrine and rules there cited. It has been insisted upon by counsel for the plaintiff that even if it be the correct view that municipal property such as that involved in the other case mentioned is exempt from taxation, that the water works must stand in a different position because they are within the proviso in the first section of the Act of Assembly passed May 14th, 1874, which it is contended subjects all property to taxation “from which any revenue or income is derived,” “except where exempt by law for state purposes.” Whether this clause means a sweeping inclusion of all property not specially mentioned in the preceding portion of the section, or whether it was intended only to prevent the exemption from attaching to property coming within the enumerated classes which should be made in any way a source of pecuniary profit or revenue, may well be doubted. The sentence has the vice of obscurity so often found in our statutes and which arises probably from the insertion of different amendments from different hands during the process of enactment. But conceding that it was intended, as agreed, to cover all and every species of property not mentioned as exempted, can it be held to apply to public property such as that here in question merely because the public pay water rates in proportion to the amount of water used. The rule of law is that general words of description of property to be held liable under a tax law are to be held to have reference to private property only, and not to that owned by the state or by counties, cities, or townships. This seems to be well settled law, and it is not necessary to cite again the numerous authorities referred to in the other case already mentioned. Municipalities are only subordinate parts of the state for public purposes and for public convenience, and it is not to be presumed that it was the intention either of the framers of the 'Constitution or of the legislature that they should tax the property of each other.</p>

    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.6",388,[263,518,1187,1550]]]'>The difference between this case and that of The County of Erie <em>v. </em>The Cit}^ of Erie is, that the Act of 1874 does contain a clause which directs that “ all property real or personal other than that which is in actual use and occupation for the purposes aforesaid and from which any income or revenue is derived shall be subject to taxation,” and it is the fact that the property in question here does yield a large revenue to the defendants. It seems to us that the legislature, possessing the power, as it does, by section 1 of Article IN, to provide for the levying and collecting of all taxes, has exercised its power and in such language as to embrace the property here in question. When it says “all property real or personal” which yields revenue shall be subject to taxation, we think the words used must be literally read. Water works are not essential to the administration of municipal government. They are incidental to it and possibly advantageous. If they are conducted without exacting revenue for the water furnished, they would not come within the language of the Act and would not be taxable, but as revenue is derived, the necessary meaning of the language employed embraces them. The fact of municipal ownership is the only matter that creates any doubt, but the provision is so broad and so peremptory that we think the liability to taxation was intended to be created without any regard to the public or private character of the ownership. It can not be said that there was any want of consciousness of the fact on the part of the legislature, that they were dealing with public property, for that was one of the classes of property which they were exempting, and in contrast with this they provide that <em>all </em>property, real or personal other than that which is in actual use and occupation for the purposes aforesaid and from which any income or revenue is derived shall be subject to taxation. The excepted property referred to includes certain kinds of public property but does not include the particular kind in question here, hence it is not embraced within the exception and is included in the general designation <em>all property.</em>
