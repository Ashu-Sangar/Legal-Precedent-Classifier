If the whole or a part of the land be allotted to the debtor and charged with owelty, the owelty is a prior lien to the lien he had given for his undivided interest: McCandless’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/98/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="98 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="496909" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0489-01">98 Pa.

That Act applied in Lucas’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/53/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="53 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1004718" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0404-01">53 Pa. St., 404</a>.

The money does not arise from sale. The Court decreed that it should be paid to Charles Egner. Owelty is somewhat in the nature of purchase money for land, and the party who pays it, the purchaser. • The paramount rights of tenants in common may compel conversion, and the mortgage <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>becomes a lien on the proceeds of sale; or on the owelty, if no sale. While it is true that the tenants in common derive title from Charles Egner, each knew that his co-tenants could create liens on their respective interests. When one acquired title to all the land, he acquired the titles that had been vested iu his co-tenants. The decree determined the value of the respective shares, and the sum to be paid for owelty; and it deprives the mortgagee of all remedy on his mortgage, if: the lien on the money is discharged. Without a similar statute to the Act of 1882, Courts of equity are not prone to despoil persons who have had no opportunity to be heard, nor will such effect be given to their decrees, unless in obedience to plain rules of law.</p>

He was resting on his recorded security, and no person could acquire the title of Charles H. Egner without notice of that security. It is the duty of a tenant who takes the land divested of a lien against his co-tenant, either to make application to pay the money into Court because of the lien, or pay the lien itself. lie holds the money subject to the lien. It is not a good answer to the lien-creditor to say, “ I paid the money to your debtor, on a decree in a suit where he, and I were parties, without notice to you, and without advising the Court of your lien.”</p>

His name appears in the plea, as printed, the person to whom the money was owing for his interest in the premises. A search for liens against Charles H. Egner, devisee of Charles Egner deceased, was all that was necessary. The omission of a letter from his name, by mistake, or design, in the partition proceeding, did not change his name, as devisee or heir, in the line of title.</p>
