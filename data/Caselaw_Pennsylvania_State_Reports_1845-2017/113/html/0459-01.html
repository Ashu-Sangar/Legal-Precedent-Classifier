The contention is now before us, and must be determined by a proper construction of the will. The legacy given to Mabel by the clause or item: “ I give and bequeath to my granddaughter, Mabel M. Coleman, only surviving daughter of my son, Peter Coleman, deceased, $300,” is a gift to the granddaughter (for a legacy is a gift or gratuity). Did it disinherit her?

Judged of exclusively by the words of the instrument as applied to the subject matter, and the surrounding circumstances, keeping in view the rule, the heir is not to be disinherited unless the intent to do so is very clearly expressed, or appears by necessary implication, thus avoiding the two extremes, the first that of arbitrary conjecture —for the court cannot make a will — and the other that of strictness. As we view the will, the letter of the will does not exclude the granddaughter — and devising to his five daughters equal shares of his estate is not, when there is another heir at law, the same as devising to them all the residue of his estate in equal shares; the latter by the letter would exclude the granddaughter, and disinherit her; the former would not, because the five daughters can be made to share alike in his estate, even though the granddaughter shall in right of her father share with them. These five daughters would be receiving equal shares of his estate, whether the granddaughter does or does not take an equal share. But what was the intention of the testator ? Counsel for the daughters say the intention of the testator, as discovered from the preamble, was to dispose of all, and not die intestate ; be it so. Does the will dispiose of the whole estate ? The preamble or introduction shows an expressed intention to do so, but does the will by a devising clause dispose of the whole ? If so, it must be by the clause, “ I give and bequeath ..... equal shares of my estate.” If, instead of a legacy of §300 given to the granddaughter, the clause giving her the legacy had been omitted and the granddaughter had not been named at all, would the clause, “I give my five daughters equal shares of my estate,” have disinherited the granddaughter, who could only be disinherited as heir at law by express devise, a necessary implication when no negative words appear.</p>

A plain reading of the will seems to be : I give and bequeath to my granddaughter $300, and to my five daughters equal shares of my estate. There is no repugnancy or contradiction in its natural sense as a gift of $300 to the granddaughter above the share of each of the daughters without doing violence to the language of the will, or to any intention of the testator discoverable from the will. If there were any doubt as to the'intention of the testator, or as to the proper construction of the will, the Court would adhere as closely as possible to the general rules of inheritance, and this would result in the same distribution as that we have suggested, and as resulting from the view herein expressed.</p>

    <p id="b482-6" data-blocks='[["BL_482.8",482,[229,889,1185,510]]]'>This contention .is whether Philip Coleman’s will disposed of - his whole estate ? In the introductory part thereof he clearly expresses his intention to dispose of the whole. He says, “And as to my worldly estate, and all the propertjn real, personal and mixed, of which I shall die seised and possessed, or to which I shall be entitled at the time of my death, I devise, bequeath and dispose thereof, in the following manner, to wit.” Language more explicit and comprehensive, evincing an intention to dispose of all his property could not be used. It is true, notwithstanding all this the testator may, by apt words or by clear inference, have refrained from disposing of all his estate.</p>
    <p id="b482-7" data-blocks='[["BL_482.9",482,[228,1409,1183,172]]]'>No words following, expressly indicate an intention to dispose of anything less than his whole property. Are there any words therein from which a limitation or exception may reasonably be implied ?</p>
    <p id="b482-8" data-blocks='[["BL_482.10",482,[227,1582,1181,433]]]'>After directing that all his debts shall be paid, he gives to his wife three hundred dollars of his personalty, and one third of his real estate during her life. Then he gives “to his granddaughter, Mabel M. Coleman” (the appellee), “only surviving daughter of my son, Peter Coleman, deceased, three hundred dollars.” In the next, and only remaining devise, he gives “ to my daughters, Mary C. Miller, wife of Noah S. Miller; Peoebe J. Pile, wife of George A. Pile; Matilda S. Coleman, Annie E. Coleman and Maggie V. Coleman, equal shares of my personal, real or mixed estate.”</p>
    <p id="b482-9" data-blocks='[["BL_482.11",482,[227,2016,1179,260]]]'>Considering the whole will there is no reason to infer that the testator inadvertently omitted from this paragraph the name of his granddaughter. He had just given to her by name a specific legacy, but had withheld all such legacies from his daughters. He then proceeded to give to his daughters only, carefully excluding his granddaughter therefrom.</p>

Why not? The plain import of the words is such as to reasonably and presumptively <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>pass all his remaining property. This paragraph, however, does not stand by itself alone. It must be read in-connection with the introductory part of the will. He therein expressly declares his intention to dispose of all his property. No subsequent words modify or change that intention. His daughters were one degree nearer to him than his granddaughter was. He had an undoubted right to discriminate between them. He did so for reasons satisfactory to himself.</p>

The intent of the testator is to be deduced from the language of the will taken'as a whole. The inquiry is not necessarily limited to a consideration of the particular devises, but includes the whole instrument. Hence, when the language in a specific devise by itself alone might give a life estate only, yet, as was declared by Mr. Justice Duncan in Cassel <em>v. </em>Cooke, 8 S. &amp; R., 289, the words “ worldly estate in the beginning of a will, though not of themselves sufficient to pass a fee, are always carried down to the devising clause, to show the intention.” Harden <em>v. </em>Hays, <a href="/pa/9/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="9 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="960789" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0151-01">9 Pa.
