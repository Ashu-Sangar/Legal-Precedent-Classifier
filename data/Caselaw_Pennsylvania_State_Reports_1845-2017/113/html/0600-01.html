Where one negligently and without excuse places himself in a position of known danger and thereby suffers an injury at the hands of another, either wholly or partially by means of his own act, he cannot recover damages for the injury sustained.

Pie and other employes had made an arrangement with one of the engineers, and a fireman of the company, who had charge of a shifting engine, by which the hitter, after their clay’s work was done, carried the men down to their respective homes between the shops and South Wilkes-Barre, a distance of about two miles. For this service the men paid a small sum monthly to the engineer and fireman. but nothing to the company. The company knew of and permitted this, and Mr. Drumheller, the master mechanic, in charge of the shops, usually rode down on the engine, going to his own home. The train was an irregular one, without scheduled time. At the time of the accident, and for a long time before, it consisted of the engine, tender (or tank car) and a “gondola” or box ear, a long open car, supplied with seats of two and a half inch plank fastened and secured at the sides. This car stood on a truck eleven inches higher than the truck of the tender, or tank car. Greiner was in the habit of riding on the rear end of the tender, sitting on the platform, ten inches wide, with his feet dangling over the side or placed in the iron step depending from the side of the platform. He had been repeatedly warned that this was a dangerous place. Drumheller had ordered him off and told him not to sit there. The other men who used the train had also warned him that this was a dangerous place. He was so told by seven witnesses, and told in both German and English. His general reply was that he could take care of liimself, could get off easier, that it was nobody clse’s business, etc. On the afternoon of the day when the accident happened, the train started from the shops as usual except that it was about an hour earlier. There was room in the gondola car and in the tender where some of the men, then, and habitually, sat. The engine stopped as usual at the places where the men got off, not at any regular stopping place or stations. It stopped at the intersection of Northampton street and let some of the men off, and then went on past the station of the company, which then stood a short distance below Northampton street. The plat<a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>form, beginning near this street, extended to and beyond tbe station proper, and to and beyond a small dwelling, and ended at tbe private telegraph office of the company, a distance of about two hundred feet below the station. At this last named boint the train stopped to take off certain articles that had peen brought down from the shops. Following this train was an engine, No. 134, which had been taken from the shops without authority, by a fireman (one Carman,) who was running it down for his own accommodation to a switch below the station. He was travelling very slowly, saw the train ahead, but supposed it to be moving slowly also, reversed his engine some forty yards off, but miscalculated his distance, and the grade being a down grade at that point, came on and struck the train, with (as he testified) not as much force as is usually, or frequently, used in coupling cars. The gondola, or box-car, being higher than the tank-car, was tilted up so that its forward bumpers were pushed over and upon the platform of the latter, and Greiner, who was sitting in the position already described, upon the platform, with his feet dangling over the side, was caught between the side of the car and the bumpers of tbe gondola, and so injured that he died within a few hours. No one else on the train was hurt, although some of the men were thrown off their seats. The engine struck with so little force that it did not rebound, and neither it nor the gondola or tank car was injured in the least.</p>

C. 97</a>, an employé of a mining company, whilst engaged in the performance of his duties, fell into a hole in the ground caused by steam escaping from an underground wasteway, and it was held (Gordon J.) that if at the time and place of the injury, the plaintiff saw the steam issuing from the ground, and deliberately walked into it, and was thus precipitated into the excavation, he was as matter of law, guilty of negligence, which contributed to the accident, and that he could not recover.</p>
    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[233,1367,1177,347]]]'>In Phila. Wilra. &amp; Balt. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Stinger, 28 P. F. S., 219, it is declared to be the duty of an engineer, when his train is approaching a public highway, if danger is to be apprehended, to give "a proper warning by the whistle or otherwise, and that a failure so to do is negligence <em>per se. </em>On the other hand, in Penna. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Barnett, 9 P. F. S., 265, it was said to be negligence to sound the alarm whistle under a bridge, whilst a traveller was in the act of passing over it.</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[229,1711,1179,261]]]'>In all these cases the act complained of, whether of omission or commission, was an act unaffected by any circumstance which might vary or shift the standard or degree of care, and in cases of this character when the facts and the inferences fairly arising therefrom are undisputed, the question of negligence is one for the court and not for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b622-7" data-blocks='[["BL_622.7",622,[224,1970,1180,479]],["BL_623.1",623,[236,497,1172,604]]]'>In the case at bar, it is undisputed that Greiner at the time of the injury, was riding on the rear end of the tender, sitting upon the platform, which was only ten inches wide, with his legs and feet extending down over the end of the platform at the side of the tender. This was, of course, a place of known danger; any man of common sense must have known that this was a place of great peril, and especially was this so, on account of the peculiar construction of the gondola and of the tender, of which the deceased had been informed; the former stood upon a truck eleven inches higher than the latter; so that in the event of a slight collision, the truck of the gondola was <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>liable to mount and ride upon the truck of the tender. As was said in Little Rock, etc. R’y Co. <em>v. </em>Miles, 13 Am. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cases, 10, “there are certain portions of every railroad train which are so obviously dangerous for a passenger to occupy, and so plainly not designed for his reception, that his presence there will constitute contributory negligence as a matter of law, aud preclude him from claiming damages for injuries received while in such position ; a passenger who voluntarily and unnecessarily rides upon the engine or the tender, or upon the pilot or bumper of the locomotive, or upon the top of a car, or upon the platform, cannot be said to be in the exercise of that caution and discretion which the law requires of all persons who are of full age, of sound mind, and of ordinary intelligence.</p>
    <p id="b623-6" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[236,1101,1173,819]]]'>The gondola had been fitted up expressly for the purpose ; it was provided with seats for the workmen to occupy, and it is not alleged, that there was insufficient room for all; there was no necessity and therefore no excuse for any one, to leave the place provided, to sit upon the narrow platform of the tender. Nor is it disputed, that Greiner had been warned, repeatedly warned, of the danger he incurred. His fellow workmen, on many different occasions, some of them referring to their experience as railroad men, told him not to sit there ; that it was a dangerous place; to some, he said he could get off easier, to others, that he could take care of himself, and to others, it was none of their business. Matthew Watt told him it was a dangerous place: he showed him how little it required to raise the gondola over the bumper or platform of the tender in front of it, not more-than a couple of inches, and that if the engine should run off the track, or any accident occur, and he should happen to lose his hold and fall off, he was in a place of the greatest danger. The answer he made to this was, “mind your own business.”</p>

He put himself in this place of danger voluntarily, and recklessly and persistently continued to occupy it, in violation of the express direction of Mr. Drumheller, and in disregard of the often repeated warnings of his friends and fellow workmen. It is beyond all contradiction that the occupancy of this place of danger caused or contributed to his death; if he had been sitting on the gondola, or even upon the engine or the tender, he could not have been harmed, the only effect of the collision being to cause the gondola to ride on the platform of the tender, where the deceased was sitting.</p>

Although on several occasions forbidden to do so, and warned of the danger, A., on returning from work one evening, rode on the pilot or bumper of the locomotive, when the train, in passing through a tunnel, collided with cars standing on the track, and he was injured. There was ample room for him in the box-car; all in it were unhurt. It was held, that, as A. would not have been injured liad he used ordinary care and caution, he is not entitled to recover against the company.”</p>
    <p id="b625-6" data-blocks='[["BL_625.4",625,[218,887,1175,1077]]]'>■ Mr. Justice Swayne, delivering the opinion of the Court, says : — “ The plaintiff had been warned against riding on the pilot and forbidden to do so. It was next to the cow-catcher, and obviously a place of peril, especially in case of collision. There was room for him in the box-car. He should have taken his place there. He could have got into the box-car in as little, if not less, time than it took to climb to the pilot. The knowledge, assent, or direction of the Company’s agent, as to wliat he did, is immaterial. If told to get on anywhere, that the train was late, and that be must hurry, this was no justification for taking such a risk. As well might he have obeyed a suggestion to ride on the coweatcher, or put himself on the track before tlio advancing wheels of the locomotive. The company though bound to a high degree of care, did not insure his safety. He was not an infant nor <em>non compos. </em>The liability of the company was conditioned upon the exercise of reasonable and proper care and caution on his part. Without the latter, the former could not arise. He and another who rode beside him were the only persons hurt upon the train. All those in the box-car, where be should have beeu, were uninjured. He would have escaped also if he had been there. His injury was due to his own folly and recklessness. He was himself the author of his misfortune. This is shown with as near an approach to a demonstration as anything short of mathematics will permit.”</p>
