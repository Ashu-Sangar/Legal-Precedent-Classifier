Their business, so far as it can be gathered from the pleadings, was that of selling real estate, or real estate brokers. The first item manifestly means cash paid for numbering houses. The same is true of the four items for advertising houses. That cash payments cannot be proven by books of original entry is too well settled to admit of discussion. The only other item in this account is the 4 per cent, commission on the sale of the Walnut street house. The amount of these commissions depended upon the contract between the parties, and could not be proven bjr entries which one party chose to make in his books.

When the attempt is to charge the real estate of a married woman by a mechanic’s lien, the same rule applies : Shannon <em>v. </em>Shultz, <em>supra; </em>Kuhns <em>v. </em>Turney, Id., 497 ; Loomis <em>v. </em>Fry, 91 Id., 396.</p>
    <p id="b285-6" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[216,593,1178,217]]]'>A judgment against a married woman which does not affirmatively show her liability on a contract within the statute, is void, and a sheriff’s sale of her property on execution issued thereon will confer no title on the purchaser : Hecker <em>v. </em>Haak, <em>supra, </em>238; Hugus <em>v. </em>Dithridge Glass Company, 96 Id., 160.</p>
    <p id="b285-7" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[217,811,1179,431]]]'>Applying these rules of law to the record in this case we find it clearly defective.- It contains no averment that the debt was contracted for any act done that was necessary for the use, enjoyment or preservation of her property, or that its condition or value was such as to make a sale thereof necessary or even advisable for her advantage or profit. It is not sufficient to allege it was done for her use, and at her instance and request. In some suitable language the necessity therefor must also be averred in the statement or <em>narr. </em>No such language is contained in this statement.</p>
    <p id="b285-8" data-blocks='[["BL_285.6",285,[218,1244,1180,682]]]'>We also think the items contained in the copy of the alleged book account filed, are not within the meaning of the rule requiring an affidavit of defence to be put in. The principal item is for commission on sale of a house. This is not a proper subject of a book charge to be proved by the production of the book as one of original entry: Hale’s Executors <em>v. </em>Ard’s Executor’s, 48 Id., 22. Other items are manifestly for money paid. The fact that tlie statement of the account is copied from hooks which the plaintiff below avers to be his books of original entries, does not cure the defect. If the entries had no legal standing there to charge the defendant, a copy thereof cannot give to them additional force. If they were not originally proper subjects of book account, they have not become so since, and therefore are not within the rule requiring an affidavit of defence when “ a copy of the book entries ” is filed.</p>
    <p id="b285-9" data-blocks='[["BL_285.7",285,[480,1939,870,44]]]'>Judgment reversed and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>
