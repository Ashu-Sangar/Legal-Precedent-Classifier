W. Bennetch, residing near Richland, Lebanon county, Pa., and asked him whether he did not know somebody who would have his life insured in his (the stranger’s) favor, and would support him after he was unable to work. Bennetch said that he would ascertain. He then talked with his father-in-law, John Schmoltz, Sr., the defendant, after which, at the instance of Schmoltz, Bennetch went to Jacob Seigrist and began to negotiate with him for Schmoltz, for a policy on his (Seigrist’s) life, by ask<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>ing Seigrist what he wanted out of the money to be secured in the policy. The negotiation resulted in an arrangement whereby a policy for $8,000 was to be taken out on Seigrist’s life in favor of John Schmoltz as beneficiary. Of this $3,000, the sum of ©2,800 was to be for the benefit of and paid to John Schmoltz, Sr., and ©200 to pay the funeral expenses of said Jacob Seigrist after his death. It was also contracted at the same time between Seigrist and Bennetch for Schmoltz, that Schmoltz would keep Seigrist out of the poor house by providing for him after he was unable to earn a living, as long as the policy remained in force, or as tlie language of the policy lias it, “$200 to pay the funeral expenses of said Jacob Seigrist : J. Schmoltz also agrees that Jacob Seigrist shall not become a pauper as long as this certificate is in force.” Benneteh then returned to his father-in-law, the defendant, and reported to him the result of his negotiations with Seigrist, and the terms of tlie bargain, and as Bennetch testified, “ and the old man (Schmoltz) agreed to do it.” “Thereupon the application was made and the policy taken out,” for $8,000, and John Schmoltz held the policy and paid all the assessments and dues thereon down to the time of Seigrist’s death. Seigrist continued working and supporting himself nearly, if not fully, two years after tlie policy was taken out, when the man with whom he was staying, on complaining to Schmoltz that the old man was sick, and that his house was uninhabitable, secured from Schmoltz the loan of ©300 on a mortgage with interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum, from liis wife to Schmoltz, on a house which she bought with this money. The mortgage was not fettered or cumbered with any conditions, but was a simple security for the loan of money. After Seigrist’s death and the payment of the insurance money to Schmoltz, he paid the mortgage with interest for one year — ©318—in settlement of the claim for keeping Seigrist, and retained the balance of the ©2,800. This ©318 is the entire amount paid by Schmoltz, besides the premiums, out of the ©2,800. Schmoltz was neither a relative nor a creditor.</p>
