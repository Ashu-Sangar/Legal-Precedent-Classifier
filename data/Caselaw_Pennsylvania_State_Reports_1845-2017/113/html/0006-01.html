The evidence is uncontradicted that it was the money of Mr. and Mrs. Thompson (the mortgagors) that paid the first mortgage. That the money actually came from Conrad Brown’s estate is of no consequence. It was paid by said estate at the request of Mr. Thompson, with the understanding that such payment would settle a claim which Mr. and Mrs. Thompson held against the estate of Conrad Brown’s father and mother. It was an indirect mode of doing it, but the result is the same. The money paid was in fact the money of the mortgagors.

Thus it may be kept on foot for the protection of a paying surety, and other cases which it is not necessary to name.

When the mortgagors procured the payment of the first mortgage with what was admittedly their own money, it extinguished, that mortgage at law and in equity as between it and the second mortgage, and the latter took its place. We do not deny the right of the mortgagors to have procured some friend to have bought the mortgage and taken an assignment of it. Such a transaction would have been legal and would have kept it alive. But when they procured it to be done with their own money, the assignment of the mortgage is of no validity as against the younger mortgage. This principle is too familiar to need the citation of authority.</p>
