We will not stop to inquire whether or not the defendant can have specific performance of the contract which he asks us to interpret differently from its reading by the aid of extrinsic evidence, and in effect to alter the contract. If the defendant's case turned upon that, we think we would be obliged to refuse a decree of specific, performance : Jones <em>v. </em>Pennel, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phila.%20539" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Phila. 539">1 Phila., 539</a>; Hammer &amp; Dauler <em>v. </em>McEldownev, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20334" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Wright 334">10 Wright, 334</a>; McCann <em>v. </em>Pickup, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Leg.%20Int.%20286" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="42 Leg.

It is contended by the defendant that he understood by the terms of the written agreement that he was to give the plaintiff “ all the timber” on the undivided half part of the 200 acres of land. It is as strenuously contended on part of the plaintiff that he understood that the defendant was to convey or cause to be conveyed to him, “ all the timber ” on all the 200 acres of land. Each testifies to his understanding of what was in his own mind intended by the agreement. There is not, to our mind, that “clear, precise and convincing proof” of a mistake, that the law requires, so as to require us to reform the instrument. But the evidence offered by the plaintiff and defendant, if there is not downright, bold perjury on the one side or the other, indicates clearly that at the time of contracting, their minds did not meet understandingly. This we believe to be the correct conclusion, and there is much in the evidence on both sides to sustain this view. It reconciles the testimony and imputes perjury to neither. It is consistent with what occurred on the last of March or first of April, 1881, when they first met, five months after the agreement was written, and before tliey bad time to “ act a part ” upon assumed facts, which did not in truth exist.</p>

This has been frequently done both in the courts below and in the Supreme Court. In Byrne <em>v. </em>Crossman, 15 P. F. S., 319, it is said, “ the court had an undoubted right to mould the verdict according to the requirements of the law, and therefore their order in setting aside that part relating to costs was not error.” In Whiting <em>v. </em>Lake, 10 Norris, 349, the court below submitted the case to the jury, and after the jury had retired and returned to court with a verdict for the plaintiffs, the court refused to receive the Aerdict and instructed the jury to find for the defendant. This was assigned for error, but the court beloAV Avas sustained. In Pardee <em>v. </em>Orvis, 7 Outer-bridge, 451, the court beloAV did substantial^ the same thing as was done in Whiting <em>v. </em>Lake, supra, and the Supreme Court affirmed its action. If we are correct in our construction of this Avritten agreement, then under the evidence in this case the plaintiff was entitled to recover the premises sued for Avithout conditions, the evidence offered on the part of the defendant not being sufficient in our judgment to move a Chancellor to reform the contract and decree specific performance of it as reformed. Our error was, in not giving binding instructions to the jury to find for the plaintiff for the premises sued for in the Avrit. To grant a new trial would require the attendance of the parties with their vritnesses and would result in no different conclusion. For under the same evidence, with our views of the law, we would feel it our duty to give a binding instruction to the jury to find for the plaintiff. If, however, our construction of this Avritten agreement is error, or if our amending the verdict is error, these errors can be corrected by a simple reversal, without a <em>venire de novo, </em>and thus all litigation be ended.</p>

If the said written article of agreement is doubtful or uncertain in its terms, or if the parties did not meet understandingly when they made it, but at the time understood •it differently, no specific performance would be decreed by a Court of Equity, and in such ease it could not avail Eberts as a defence in this case.</p>

Had its meaning been dependent upon extrinsic facts requiring the verdict of a jury to determine it, the construction contended for by the defendant should have prevailed, because the jury after a very careful charge found in the defendant’s favor. Upon that aspect of the case the merits of the controvers3 must be considered as having been determined against the plaintiff and against his theory that he was entitled to have more timber than was to be found on the land sold. But the learned court holding, after the verdict, that a mistake was made in submitting the caso to the jury at all, struck off the conditional part of the verdict and entered an absolute judgment for the plaintiff. We do not think this was in the power of the court, the action being ejectment and no question of law reserved, but we differ witli the court upon a more radical question, and prefer to dispose of the cause upon our view of that subject. The agreement upon which the suit was founded stipulated for the sale of “the one undivided half of grist mill situated on Morgan run Boggs, with the 200 acres of land connected therewith, for the sum of twelve hundred dollars,” etc. Undoubtedly the subject of the sale was “tlie undivided half” of the mill and 200 acres. This was all the plaintiff sold and it was, all the defendant bought. No other land could pass to the defendant under this agreement than <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>the undivided half of the premises described. Had the agreement stopped there it could not have been questioned that the defendant took only the undivided half of the mill and land, and of course he could only take the timber that stood upon that half. Certainly the defendant would have had no right to take the timber belonging to the other half owner, Smith, under this contract with Thompson. When, therefore, the agreement further provided that Ebert, the purchaser, was “ to let said Thompson have all the timber on said land,” he surely did not agree “to let” Thompson have the timber on Smith’s half of the land. The words “to let” clearly mean “ to allow,” “to permit” that is, that Eberts, the purchaser, would permit Thompson to have the timber upon the land sold because that was something which Eberts <em>could </em>permit. No mere permission of his could possibly authorize Thompson to take the timber from Smith’s half of the land, and there are no words in the agreement by which Eberts contracts that he will buy the timber on Smith’s half so that Thompson may take that also. The expression “ said land ” necessarily refers to the subject matter previously described which was the undivided half of certain land, and according to our view of the instrument it means that Thompson the vendor, thereby had permission from Eberts the vendee, to take from the land sold the timber growing upon it down to a certain size. This was all that Eberts <em>could </em>give, and therefore it was all that Thompson could take under this contract. If it was intended that the timber that was owned by Smith should be included so as to pass to Thompson, the instrument should, and necessarily would, have contained some words expressive of the further obligation which then would have rested upon Eberts to acquire the right to Smith’s timber and to give that also to Thompson. In the absence of any words expressing such a meaning we find it quite impossible to impute such an intent to the parties or to place such a construction upon the language actually employed. If Thompson had himself been the sole owner of the entire property and had made the identical agreement with Eberts which he did make, it would seem absurd to contend that the timber upon the unsold half of the land was divested from Thompson and vested in Eberts by anything contained in this paper. If it did have such a meaning Eberts would yet have to acquire from Thompson the right to the remaining half of the timber for no other purpose than to give it back to him. If it did not have such a meaning as to Thompson’s ownership, it could not have as to Smith’s. While parties might make so remarkable a contract as that it can not be done by implication.</p>
