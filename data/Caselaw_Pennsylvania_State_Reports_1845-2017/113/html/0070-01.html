On the 8th day of August, 1884, Nimick &amp; Co. obtained a judgment against the Kemble Coal &amp; Iron Company, for $132,734.84 and immediately issued a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>on the same. On the 9th day of August, John Cessna for himself, and in trust for some clients, obtained a judgment for $14,548.60 and issued a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>on the same. Nimick and Co. levied on all the personal property of the defendant except seventeen hundred tons of pig iron which became the subject of contention in this case. The sheriff levied upon these seventeen hundred tons of pig iron upon the writ of <em>fieri facias </em>in favor of John Cessna, and also levied upon the other personal property of the defendant, the levy of Cessna being subsequent in date to that of Nimick &amp; Co.
