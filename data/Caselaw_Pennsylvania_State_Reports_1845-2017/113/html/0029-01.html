The judgment stands against Thomas Conlyn and Margaret Barber, simply, and is, on its face, a perfectly good judgment, which for anything appearing of record therein would not be reversed. Instead of joining issue with the defendant on the plea of coverture, as was done in Seymour <em>v. </em>Hubert, 11 Norris, 499, this plaintiff moves to strike off the plea, and demands judgment under the rules, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. This he may do. On a <em>scire facias </em>to revive a judgment, no defence can be made except for matters arising subsequent to the judgment, the merits of the original judgment cannot be inquired into so as to admit a defence which might have been set up in the original suit: Seymour <em>v. </em>Hubert supra, 1 Trickett on the Law of Liens, sections 227, 228 and 229. In Seymour <em>v. </em>Hubert, it was said: “Instead of an application to open the original judgment,- the coverture of each of the makers of the note was severally pleaded and denied in the replication. The defendant in error did not demur to the sufficiency of the plea, nor move to strike it off, but accepted the issue tendered. It was substantially the same as if it had been framed in the original judgment. The defendant in <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>error thereby waived her right to exclude the evidence of coverture.” But here the plaintiff declines to accept the issue tendered and moves to strike off the plea, and this he is entitled to have done, for he has not in any way waived his right to exclude the evidence of coverture. The plea being stricken off, the plaintiff will be entitled to judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. The affidavit sets up nothing more than the coverture of Margaret Barber as a defence, and as has been seen this is clearly insufficient on a <em>scire facias </em>to revive a judgment, the coverture having existed at the time of the giving of the original judgment and the fact nowhere appearing in the record thereof or of its revival.</p>

When the purchaser at a sheriff’s sale on such judgment would take no title; when a married woman could take advantage of coverture even against such innocent purchaser for value, without notice, why should she be compelled to ask that to be opened, which unopened is void. It is only when a <em>scire facias </em>is issued, as in this case, after the death of the husband, <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>that she has,.for the first time, her day in court, and is called upon to answer.
