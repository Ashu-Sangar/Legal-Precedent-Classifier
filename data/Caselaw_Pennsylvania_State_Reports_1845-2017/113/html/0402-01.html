Mat-tern to recover on book account of the decedent, against this defendant. A copy of the account was made out and sworn to by the administrator, and filed with the declaration in this suit. That copy of account under the Rules of Court in this county, has been admitted as evidence in this case. That is the evidence which is before you, and upon which you are to found your verdict. It appears from this account that it commenced as early as November 21st, 1867, and closed on June 1st, 1879. - There are no credits entered upon this account. The defendant has put in the plea of payment, with the right to give in evidence any other special matter, and the plea of the Statute of Limitations. The plea of the Statute of Limitations is a legal plea. The Act of Assembly gives a man a right to interpose that plea against all accounts over six years old. The Statute of Limitations assumes that all accounts over six years standing are liquidated and thus are barred, unless a new promise is shown within six years, or some other transaction took place between the parties, which would stop the running of the statute. It is a purely legal plea, and all men do not admit that it is an honest one, in all cases, but with such opinions Courts have nothing to do; it is the law of the Commonwealth and we must administer it as we find it.</p>

If he were here there would be less difficulty in arriving at what is the truth and real facts connected with the account, and these receipts, if produced, might thro'w much light upon it. But the receipts were not produced. He admitted on the stand that he had them, and on request of counsel for plaintiff to produce them, refused to do so. This conduct we say, gentle<a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>men of the jury, is for your consideration. It is a very pertinent inquiry in a case like this, we think, whether it is honest and fair for a lawyer, who is the defendant, to go upon the stand and admit under oath that he has receipts in his possession of a man that is dead and refuses to deliver them in court at the trial. It certainly does not go to show that he desired a fair and equitable trial of the case. [Where a man admits that he has papers in his possession that will throw light upon and explain accounts and papers of a dead man’s estate, and refuses to produce them when called upon for the purpose, such conduct is neither fair, just nor honest; and we say to you that we have no patience with such conduct and think it is highly reprehensible.] (First assignment of error.) Courts cannot and will not, we think, encourage any such eouduct as that. There was, however, no way, as the case was presented, to compel the defendant to produce the receipts, or it would have been done. We do not think it is creditable in anybody to withhold that which might throw light on a case of this kind on the one side or the other. It is a question whether jurors of Huntingdon county want estates of decedents settled up in that way. If the accounts between a decedent’s estate and Huntingdon county lawyers are to be settled as is attempted in this case, the farmers and citizens of the county, who bring produce here to market, will hereafter carefully avoid selling to lawyers, and if they do, will require them to pay for it when the goods are delivered, or take their notes or equivalent in cash, and not leave such accounts for their administrators or executors to settle — and we say frankly to you it should not be tolerated if it can be prevented.</p>

He is entitled to set up such a claim, and it would be a legal defence to the amount, whatever you find those services to be worth. I do not propose to pass any opinion upon the value of those services, because that is a question for you under the evidence; [but we say according to the record and evidence those services closed on the 12th January, 1880; at that time John W.

Now, we sav to you, gentlemen of the jury, that on the 12th January, 1880, John W. Mattern, this defendant, had a claim for his services against this estate for whatever they were worth. That must be applied as a set-off against the claim which the plaintiff had against him, if you believe the evidence of the defendant.

This limitation in the statute of 1713 is in identical phrase with the statute of 21 James I., c. 16, upon the same subject, and had the Courts construed it in accord with the legislative will as expressed, there would have been no difficulty in tinderstanding it in the same way as it was finally understood in England when it was settled that a transaction will not constitute an account, within the meaning of the exception, unless it is such that it would sustain an action of account, or an action on the case for not accounting: Inglis <em>v. </em>Haigh, 8 M. &amp; W., 769 ; Cottam <em>v. </em>Partridge, 4 Scott N.

Be this as it may, the words certainly require that the action should be founded on account. The account must-be one which concerns the trade of merchandise. It is notan exemption attached to the merchant merely as a personal privilege, but an exemption which is conferred on the business as well as on the persons between whom that business is carried on. The account must concern the trade of merchandise; and this trade must be not an ordinary traffic between a mer<a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>chant and any ordinary customers, but between merchant and merchant. This trade of merchandise which can furnish an account protected by the exception, must be not only between merchant and merchant, but between the plaintiff and defendant : ” Spring <em>v. </em>Gray’s Executors, 6 Peters, 151.</p>

    <p id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[245,824,1182,896]]]'>Among the cases relied on by the plaintiff to sustain the ruling of the Court below, is Van Swearingen <em>v. </em>Harris, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20856" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 856">1 W. &amp; S.. 856</a>, where the entire opinion touching the interpretation of the statute is as follows: “ Where there are mutual demands, if any item of such account be within six years before the commencement of the suit, such item is deemed equivalent to a subsequent promise reviving the debt......It takes the case out of the statute, and it is immaterial whether the parties are merchants or not, as it goes on the ground of implied promise.” The latest case cited by him, Adams <em>v. </em>Carroll, <a href="/pa/85/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="85 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="440492" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0209-01">85 Pa. St., 209</a>, rules “ that to constitute mutual accounts there must be mutual demands. And the exception to the statute has no application where the demand is altogether on one side, although payments on account have been made. He also refers to Chambers <em>v. </em>Marks, 25 <a href="/pa/85/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="85 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="440492" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0209-01">Id., 296</a>, which reiterates that where there have been mutual accounts between two persons within six years, the statute does not apply to any part of either account; and it is added that a credit to have the effect of taking an account out of the operation of the statute must be proved to have been intended as a payment on the account.</p>
    <p id="b426-9" data-blocks='[["BL_426.6",426,[246,1731,1180,731]],["BL_427.1",427,[248,431,1169,259]]]'>It is manifest that the word demand in the eases cited is used in the sense of “ account.” It was never meant that when there was an account on one side that a demand on the other, founded on note, bond, record, or the like, constituted mutual accounts between the parties within the exception. In Lowber <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/pa/7/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="7 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="957787" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0381-01">7 Pa. St., 381</a>, the subject of the exception is defined thus : “ A mutual account is when each has a demand or right of action against the other, as, for example, when A. and B. dealing together, A. sells B. an article of furniture, or any other commodity, and afterwards B. sells A. property of the same or a different description; this constitutes a reciprocal demand, because A. and B. have a demand or right of°action against each other. But this is not so when the sale is only by one to the other, whether it is to be paid for in cash or in kind; the manner of payment can surely make no difference. Nor will an overt payment alter this result.” As defined, the account on each side relates to trade <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>in merchandise. This may include labor, or anything that is provable by book of original entry. Such account on one side is not enough. A demand on the other side founded on anything else “ than such accounts as concern the trade of merchandise,” is not sufficient to bring the account of the other within the exception.</p>
    <p id="b427-6" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[249,690,1176,1123]]]'>The plaintiff’s account consists of more than two score of items, beginning November 21st, 1867, and ending June 18th, 1879. There is no proof that during all that time the defendant sold and delivered anything to the'plaintiff, which is the subject of account as the word is used in the statute. There is testimony tending to show that the defendant performed professional services, as attorney at law, for the decedent in bis lifetime, the value of which he claims as a set-off. These services were rendered in suits at law, begun in 1877, and the Court below assumed that the relation of attorney and client ceased on January 12th, 1880. If this was so, the defendant’s right of action for the value of the services accrued on that date : Foster <em>v. </em>Jack, <a href="/watts/4/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="4 Watts 384" data-case-ids="1842685" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0384-01">4 Watts, 384</a>; Lichty <em>v. </em>Hugus, <a href="/pa/55/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="55 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="1470734" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0434-01">55 Pa. St., 434</a>. Is such a demand an account that concerns the trade of merchandise ? No decision of this Court compels us to say so, and in the teeth of the statute to declare that it takes the plaintiff’s account out of its operation. The plaintiff’s demand is for a particular service which no more constitutes an account than would a demand for loaned money. If not sued, or pleaded as a set-off. within six years from the time it became due, the statute would bar recovery. It had no effect upon the running of the statute against the plaintiff’s account. Mutual demands, or debts, do not extinguish each other. Nor does either prevent the statute running against the other, unless both are such accounts as bring the case within the exception.</p>
    <p id="b427-7" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[252,1815,1176,292]]]'>We discover no evidence to justify the Court in instructing the jury that the defendant’s services closed and he had a right of action on the 12th of January, 1880.

The portion of the charge where these extracts occurred was well calculated to lead the jury to consider the Court’s opinion of the defendant’s conduct, that it was unfair, unjust, dishonest and highly reprehensible, and that Courts will not encourage any such conduct. Moreover, the jury must have understood <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>that there was no way to compel .the defendant to produce books-and papers containing pertinent evidence, “ or it would have been done.” Of course, the learned judge knew that the plaintiff had been content in serving a notice on the defendant to produce books and papers, which merely laid ground for him to prove contents in case the3 were not produced ; and no steps had been taken for an order to produce such books or papers. The denunciation of the defendant by the learned judge was uncalled for by anything in the testimony or record, and must have had a tendency to mislead the jury from the evidence to the Court’s expressions respecting the defendant’s conduct: Stokes <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%20241" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 241">10 W.
