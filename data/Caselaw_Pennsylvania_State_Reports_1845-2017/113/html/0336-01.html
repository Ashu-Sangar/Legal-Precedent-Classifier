It is true that the defendant’s evidence of such sales goes against him as an admission, even though rejected as evidence on his behalf; but it seems insufficient to show even <em>prima facie </em>value of the whole, taken in connection with the testimony of Stoeckle that they picked out the best and sold <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>it to the parties named, and in view of the deterioration of the cheese, which is not shown to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant. Plaintiffs might have shown the market value of cheese of this quality, and that its spoiling was caused by defendant’s default or negligence, and thus thrust upon him the burden of showing the actual loss. Not having done so, in my opinion, in the light of all the authorities cited, the actual price realized at the sales, including the auction, is presumably the market value, and is the rate at which the defendant must account to the plaintiff.</p>

The farm appears to have been owned, at least carried on, by her husband at one time. He failed in business, and some personal property he had there, including some Limberger cheese, was purchased by his wife, Mrs. Noedel, who continued the busi-. ness of manufacturing this species of cheese in connection with the farm. It was found by the Referee that she had sufficient separate estate to make the purchase. The $402 note referred to grew out of this transaction. Prior to her giving it she had applied to the Court of Common Pleas for the benefit of the Act of April 3d, 1872, which secures to a married woman her separate earnings. This brings the case within the ruling of Bovard <em>v. </em>Kettering, <a href="/pa/101/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="101 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="500928" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0181-01">101 Pa. St., 181</a>. The <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>learned Judge below held that Bovard <em>v. </em>Kettering did not apply, for the reason, in part, that the proceeds of the $402 note were not traced, directly into the manufacture of the cheese consigned to the plaintiff in error. We think this was error. The money was borrowed to enable her to engage in the business which her husband had previously followed. She did so engage, and as a result thereof shipped a large amount of cheese to the plaintiff in error, who had advanced the $402. In her letter of February 12th, 1876, she authorized the plaintiff in error to retain out of the proceeds of the consignment the interest on the $1,500 judgment, and all disbursements and advances. She was not obliged to pay the principal or interest of this judgment for the reason already given, yet she had a right to do so, and it is no part of our duty to prevent a married woman from being honest. Her consignee held this judgment against her, and her letter to him was an appropriation of so much of her money in his hands to the payment of this interest.</p>
