        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice CAPPY.\nPetitioners in these matters challenge the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board\u2019s (\u201cBoard\u201d) grant of a slot machine license to PITG Gaming, LLC (\u201cPITG\u201d). For the following reasons, we affirm.\nThe genesis of these matters lies in the Legislature\u2019s July of 2004 enactment of the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act (\u201cAct\u201d). The Act established the Board, granting it general jurisdiction over all gaming and related activities including the licensing of gaming facilities.\nUnder the Act, the Legislature provided for legalized slot machine gaming at a limited number of licensed facilities throughout the Commonwealth. Three categories of slot machine gaming facilities are authorized under the Act. 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1801. A Category 1 license authorizes the placement and operation of slot machines at existing horse racing tracks; a Category 2 license authorizes the placement and operation of slot machines in stand-alone facilities; and a Category 3 license authorizes the placement and operation of slot machines in resort hotels. 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1302-1305. Within Category 2 licenses, the Board is authorized to award two facilities in a city of the first class, one facility in a city of the second class, and the remaining two facilities in a revenue- or tourism-enhanced location. 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1304(a)(1). The subcategory with which these matters are concerned is the one that provides that the Board may grant a single license for a slot machine facility to be located in a city of the second class namely, in Pittsburgh (\u201cPittsburgh slot machine license\u201d). With regard to the Pittsburgh slot machine license, the Board received applications from IOC Pittsburgh, Inc. (\u201cIOC\u201d), Station Square Gaming LP (\u201cStation Square\u201d), and PITG. After receiving the applications, the Board engaged in extensive review and investigation of the applicants through its Bureau of Licensing, Investigation and Enforcement (\u201cBureau\u201d). The Bureau, along with the Financial Suitability Task Force, investigated the financial suitability of the three applicants. The Board also conducted various hearings at which, inter alia, input was received from the public and financial data were examined.\nOn December 20, 2006, the Board met in open session and voted upon all pending applications. The Board voted unanimously to award the Pittsburgh slot machine license to PITG.\nOn February 1, 2007, the Board issued an Order and Adjudication granting the Pittsburgh slot machine license to PITG. In its Adjudication, the Board emphasized that it had \u201cbeen presented with three very competent proposals, all of which are eligible and suitable for licensure under the terms of the Act.\u201d Adjudication at 7. Yet, as there was only one Pittsburgh slot machine license to award, the Board necessarily had to deny two of the applications. Id. The Board emphasized that IOC\u2019s and Station Square\u2019s applications were denied \u201cnot because the unsuccessful applicants were found unsuitable, but because the Board had the difficult task of choosing among three suitable candidates and proposals.... \u201d Id.\nThe Board detailed its reasons for selecting PITG for the Pittsburgh slot machine license. The Board determined, inter alia, that PITG was financially suitable for licensure. It also found that PITG\u2019s proposed facility was the most aesthetically pleasing; its ability to deal with traffic concerns was superior; and the facility had great potential for stimulating economic rebirth of the North Shore area where the facility was to be located. The Board also found Don Barden (\u201cBarden\u201d), the owner of PITG, himself to be a huge factor: Barden had shown an impressive level of personal commitment to the project and Pittsburgh in general; the Board also emphasized that Barden would bring \u201cintegration of diverse representation in the gaming industry in Pittsburgh----\u201d Adjudication at 55.\nIOC and Station Square filed petitions for review with this court. PITG filed a notice of intervention in both matters per Pa.R.A.P. 1531(a).1 *\nOur appellate review of these matters is carefully defined by the Act. The Legislature provided that this court \u201cshall be vested with exclusive appellate jurisdiction to consider appeals of any final order, determination or decision of the board involving the approval, issuance, denial or conditioning of a slot machine license.... \u201d 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1204. We are directed to affirm orders of the Board unless we find that the Board \u201ccommitted an error of law or that the order, determination or decision of the board was arbitrary and there was a capricious disregard of the evidence.\u201d Id. With questions of law, our review is de novo and the scope of our review is plenary. Commonwealth v. Bortz, 589 Pa. 431, 909 A.2d 1221, 1223 (2006).\nWith regard to the directive that we are to uphold orders of the Board unless such orders are arbitrary or the result of a capricious disregard of the evidence, our case law provides guidance as to the parameters of our appellate review. We have defined a capricious disregard of the evidence to exist \u201cwhen there is a willful and deliberate disregard of competent testimony and relevant evidence which one of ordinary intelligence could not possibly have avoided in reaching a result.\u201d Arena v. Packaging Systems Corp., 510 Pa. 34, 507 A.2d 18, 20 (1986); see also Leon E. Wintermyer, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Marlowe), 571 Pa. 189, 812 A.2d 478 (2002). Furthermore, under the capricious disregard standard, an agency\u2019s determination is given great deference, and relief will rarely be warranted. Wintermyer, 812 A.2d at 484. Under this standard, an appellate tribunal is not to substitute its judgment for that of the lower tribunal and the standard \u201cis not to be applied in such a manner as would intrude upon the agency\u2019s fact-finding role and discretionary decision-making authority.\u201d Id. at 487-88.\nThe primary argument of both Station Square and IOC is that the Board incorrectly concluded that PITG had demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it was financially suitable for licensure under the Act.\nThis issue references the requirements set forth by \u00a7 1313 of the Act. In brief, that section requires that an applicant for a slot machine license must show by clear and convincing evidence \u201cthe financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant\u201d and related entities and that the \u201capplicant has sufficient business ability and experience to create and maintain a successful, efficient operation.\u201d 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1313(a) and (d). That section also requires that in assessing the financial viability of an applicant\u2019s proposed facility, the Board must determine whether \u201cthe applicant is likely to maintain a financially successful, viable and efficient business operation and will likely be able to maintain a steady level of growth of revenue to the Commonwealth.... \u201d 4 Pa.C.S. 1313(e). The applicant must also post a letter of credit or bond in the amount of $50 million to prove it has the ability to pay the slot machine license fee. 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1313(c).\nFirst, we address Station Square\u2019s argument that the Board erroneously examined PITG\u2019s ability to generate revenue after it receives its license. The Board predicted that the PITG facility would earn $482.8 million annually in a stabilized year in 2005 dollars. Board\u2019s Brief at 25, citing R. 6746a. The Board concluded that PITG \u201cis likely to maintain a financially successful, viable and efficient business operation, which would maintain a steady level and growth of revenue.\u201d Adjudication at 21. Station Square objects to this analysis, asserting that the Board should not have looked at projected revenue in determining whether PITG was financially suitable for licensure. Contrary to Station Square\u2019s argument, the Board in no fashion acted improperly when it calculated PITG\u2019s projected revenues in determining PITG\u2019s financial suitability. In fact, the Act requires the Board to consider projections of future revenue. 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1313(e) (the Board shall determine whether \u201cthe applicant is likely to maintain a financially successful, viable and efficient business operation and will likely be able to maintain a steady level of growth of revenue to the Commonwealth....\u201d). Thus, we reject this argument.\nNext, Station Square and IOC assert that the evidence as presented to the Board revealed that PITG was not financially suitable for licensure. In support of their argument, Station Square and IOC rely heavily on the PITG Financial Suitability Report (\u201cPITG FSR\u201d) that the Financial Suitability Task Force prepared. The Board and PITG respond that Station Square and IOC waived any challenge to the Board\u2019s finding that PITG was financially suitable because neither Station Square nor IOC raised such an objection before the Board.\nIn analyzing this waiver issue, we turn to the seminal decision of Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974). In Dilliplaine, this court made clear that the general policy was that no question would be heard by an appellate court that was not objected to and raised before the lower court. The purpose of requiring such an objection was to ensure that the lower tribunal had the first opportunity to correct any such alleged error as well as providing an efficient use of judicial resources. Id. at 116-17. Such reasoning was extended to administrative agencies, like unemployment compensation proceedings, in Wing v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review, 496 Pa. 113, 436 A.2d 179, 181 (1981) (\u201c[T]he administrative law tribunal must be given the opportunity to correct its errors as early as possible; diligent preparation and effective advocacy before the tribunal must be encouraged by requiring the parties to develop complete records and advance all legal theories; and the finality of the lower tribunals\u2019 determinations must not be eroded by treating each determination as part of a sequence of piecemeal adjudications.\u201d). Pa.R.A.P. 1551 codifies this case law with respect to petitions for review, providing that \u201c[njo question shall be heard or considered by the court which was not raised before the government unit except: ... (3) Questions which the court is satisfied that the petitioner could not by the exercise of due diligence have raised before the government unit.\u201d Pa.R.A.P. 1551(a)(3); see also Goods v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation & Parole, 590 Pa. 132, 912 A.2d 226 (2006) (holding that, while Dilliplaine waiver may be utilized in the administrative context, it does not apply to administrative proceedings absent statute or regulation providing for preservation and waiver within the administrative framework).\nThe instant licensing proceedings are distinct from any other proceedings in this Commonwealth \u2014 indeed, they are sui generis. Certainly, the proceedings before the Board are neither a trial nor are they akin to unemployment or workers compensation proceedings. While the proceedings of all applicants are related inasmuch as the parties are all vying for the same thing, i.e., the award of a gaming license, there are also many aspects of the application process in which the Board deals with each applicant individually. The other applicants are not necessarily privy to such one-on-one interactions except their own. The applicants that were denied a license must be given an opportunity to challenge the Board\u2019s decision, since the Act provides as much under \u00a7 1204.\nThe Board has not pointed this court to anything reassuring us that Station Square or IOC had a way in which to lodge such objections to the financial suitability inquiry conducted by the Board vis-\u00e1-vis PITG. Indeed, neither the Board nor PITG adequately explain how Station Square or IOC could have identified or raised these issues before the Board at any time materially sooner than they did. Accordingly, we hold that Dilliplaine and its progeny do not apply to Board proceedings as they currently are structured and reject the Board\u2019s waiver argument.\nThe PITG FSR is the principal focus of Station Square\u2019s and IOC\u2019s financial suitability arguments. The Financial Suitability Task Force focused on the financial condition of Majestic Star Casinos, LLC (\u201cMajestic Star\u201d), an entity which is wholly owned by Barden Development, Inc. (\u201cBarden Development\u201d). The Financial Suitability Task Force did so because PITG, which is also wholly owned by Barden Development, is a newly formed entity and has no financial history of its own. Thus, the Financial Suitability Task Force examined the sister-entity to PITG-i.e., Majestic Star-to render its conclusions regarding PITG\u2019s financial health. Station Square and IOC forcefully argue that the PITG FSR revealed that Majestic Star is financially unsound. For example, the PITG FSR revealed that Majestic Star operates with a high leverage ratio. See Board\u2019s Brief at 27, referencing PITG FSR, R. 6744a.\nSecondarily, Station Square Gaming and IOC contend that the Financial Suitability Task Force, and hence the Board, failed to consider documents pertaining to Majestic Star\u2019s performance in and around 2006 that were publicly available prior to the Board\u2019s decision to award the license to PITG. Station Square and IOC contend these omitted documents allegedly would establish or reinforce PITG\u2019s poor financial performance in gaming. On these bases, Station Square and IOC urge this court to find that the Board erred as a matter of law, acted arbitrarily and in capricious disregard of the evidence and thus violated its fiduciary duty to act as a \u201cprudent man\u201d when it determined that PITG was financially suitable for licensure.\nIn arguing that we should employ the \u201cprudent man\u201d standard in performing our appellate review, IOC and Station Square are not referencing the appellate review provision contained in \u00a7 1204. Rather, they are harking back to a separate section, namely 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1201. Section 1201 is entitled \u201cPennsylvania Gaming Control Board established\u201d. Within this particular section of the Act, the Legislature, in pertinent part, has listed the \u201cQualifications and restrictions\u201d of Board members in subsection (h). Via amendments promulgated in November of 2006, the Legislature added the following provisions to \u00a7 1201:\n(h.l) Fiduciary relationship. \u2014 A member or employee of the board shall serve as a fiduciary of the Commonwealth.\n(h.2) Standard of care. \u2014 Members shall exercise the standard of care required by 20 Pa.C.S. Ch. 73 (relating to municipalities investments) in the performance of their duties under this part.\n(h.3) Liability. \u2014 Members shall not be personally liable for any of the following:\n(1) Obligations of the board.\n(2) Actions which were within the scope of their office and made in good faith.\nTo summarize, in these separate provisions, \u00a7 1201(h.l) imposes upon Board members the duty to act as fiduciaries; \u00a7 1201 (h.3), in turn, insulates Board members from liability with regard to any obligations of the Board. It also provides that Board members shall not be personally liable for all actions taken within the scope of their office so long as those actions meet the bare standard of having been made in good faith.\nSection 1201(h.2), in turn, references the standard of care contained in Chapter 73 of 20 Pa.C.S., namely, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7302(b)\u2019s \u201cprudent man rule\u201d. That provision states that\nAny investment shall be an authorized investment if purchased or retained in the exercise of that degree of judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income to be derived therefrom as well as the probable safety of their capital. The authorization to make and retain investments pursuant to this subsection shall be in addition to, and independent of, authorizations to make investments pursuant to other provisions of this chapter and requirements applicable under other provisions of this chapter shall not affect investments also authorized by this subsection.\n20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7302(b).\nWhile the recently added provisions of \u00a7 1201(h.l), (h.2), and (h.3) inform the Board as to the manner of their decision-making process and provide considerable protection to the Board members with regard to personal liability, these provisions do not channel this Court\u2019s appellate review. As stated supra, the Legislature quite narrowly confined our appellate review.- See 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1204. The November 2006 amendments to the Act in no fashion augmented our \u00a7 1204 review such that this Court is permitted to determine, via our own application of the prudent man standard, whether PITG should have been awarded the license. The confines of \u00a7 1204 clearly limit and channel our appellate review of Board decisions, and that narrow review simply does not allow us to reverse on the basis that this Court believes that a prudent man would have come to a decision other than that arrived at by the Board.\nThe next stage of our analysis brings us back to \u00a7 1204\u2019s definition of our appellate review. To wit, we must determine whether Station Square and IOC\u2019s claim that the Board improperly determined that PITG was financially suitable for licensure truly raises both an error of law issue as well as a claim that the Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in making this determination. IOC and Station Square both argue that PITG\u2019s financial suitability is an \u201cerror of law\u201d-type of claim. We are unpersuaded. IOC\u2019s and Station Square\u2019s arguments focus on the Board\u2019s alleged failure to place proper weight on evidence that they believed ostensibly showed Majestic Star to be financially unstable. The essence of such an argument, however denoted by IOC and Station Square, is that the Board acted arbitrarily and with capricious disregard of the evidence. Accordingly, we will examine whether there was \u201ca willful and deliberate disregard of competent testimony and relevant evidence [by the Board] which one of ordinary intelligence could not possibly have avoided in reaching a result.\u201d See Arena, 507 A.2d at 20.\nIn commencing our analysis of whether the Board arbitrarily or capriciously disregarded information contained in the PITG FSR, we acknowledge that that report reveals some less than optimum facets of Majestic Star\u2019s finances. Yet, as noted by the Board, the Director of the Bureau herself testified under oath that \u201cthe Financial Suitability Task Force is not aware of any financial material issues that would preclude licensure\u201d of PITG. Board Brief at 24, citing R. 4679a (testimony of Denyse Miskin); see also Adjudication at 20. Furthermore, with regard to one of the more significant negative aspects of Majestic Star\u2019s financial health, namely that it has a high leverage ratio, the Board countered that the Financial Suitability Task Force \u201crecognized that \u2018Majestic Star has shown that it can operate with an elevated ratio.\u2019 \u201d Board\u2019s Brief at 27 (quoting PITG FSR, R. 6744a). Furthermore, the Board favorably noted that Barden Development owns several gaming facilities and \u201chas been financially stable enough to operate in the gaming industry for approximately 11 years.\u201d Board\u2019s brief at 27, citing Adjudication at 17-18 and 20; R. 6721a and 6743a.\nStation Square and IOC contend that the Board should have considered, in addition to the financial information encompassed in the PITG FSR, information pertaining to Majestic Star\u2019s allegedly poor performance in and around 2006. Although the information in question has been submitted to this court under the rubric of a Judicial Notice Reproduced Record, we need not determine whether such notice is appropriate in this context. Rather, two related matters compel our rejection of this claim.\nFirst, although Station Square and IOC appear to be correct that this public information was accessible to the Board before it awarded PITG the gaming license, that does not change the fact that it was necessary for the Board to limit the timeframe for the gathering of information. An entity like Majestic Star collects reams of financial information pertaining to its operations on a daily basis, and not infrequently aggregates and submits such information to various state and federal administrative bodies. Were the Board to demand the up-to-the-day financial information Station Square and IOC argue that it must, the Board would never have a closed record based upon which it might gauge financial suitability and award a license.\nSecond, even if we agreed with Station Square and IOC that the Board should have considered the information in question, nothing in Station Square\u2019s or IOC\u2019s proffers regarding these records suggests any revelation that would have changed the picture the Board had of Majestic Star\u2019s financial health. The information in question does not create a picture of Majestic Star divergent from that reflected in the PITG FSR, which plainly recognized, inter alia, Majestic Star\u2019s mixed financial record but nevertheless deemed it financially suitable for licensure.\nOf critical note to the Board was that the capital markets have clearly evidenced that they are comfortable with the financial positions of Majestic Star and PITG. The Board noted that the \u201ccapital markets are reasonably comfortable with [Majestic Star\u2019s] financial profile\u201d as Majestic Star has been able to obtain financing through the public debt market and bank market. Board\u2019s Brief at 28 (citing Adjudication FF No. 66 at 20 and PITG FSR, R. 6745a). With regard to PITG in particular, PITG had obtained commitment letters fully financing the PITG project through all three phases of development. Board\u2019s brief at 25, citing R. 4629a-30a. By focusing on whether the capital markets-neutral entities motivated wholly by their own financial self-interest-found Majestic Star and PITG to be worthy entities to which to loan substantial sums of money, the Board in no fashion acted in an arbitrary or capricious fashion. Thus, we conclude that the Board did not act arbitrarily or in capricious disregard of the evidence when it found PITG financially suitable for licensure.\nNext, IOC argues that the Board erred as a matter of law when it considered PITG\u2019s amendments to its application. IOC\u2019s original application to the Board included a proposal to provide financing for a new arena for the Pittsburgh Penguins, a professional hockey team, as well as a commitment to revitalize the Hill District. Subsequently, PITG amended its application, adding its own funding scheme for the Pittsburgh Penguins\u2019 arena as well as redevelopment plans for the Hill District area of Pittsburgh. IOC expresses indignation over PITG being allowed to propose such an amendment. IOC asserts that PITG could have made similar proposals in its initial application but did not do so. Instead, IOC argues, PITG acted unfairly: after the application deadline passed, PITG \u201cpirated\u201d IOC\u2019s proposals to fund the arena and donate money to the Hill District community by submitting a revamped application which included community-enhancements proposals similar to those IOC had previously advanced.\nIOC states that the Board erred as a matter of law when it allowed PITG to submit this \u201cme too\u201d, revamped proposal. IOC\u2019s brief at 32. It provides two supports for this argument. First, it references the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision in Bedford Downs Management Corp. v. State Harness Racing Comm\u2019n, 901 A.2d 1063 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006). In that matter, a license applicant submitted a proposal to the Harness Racing Commission to build a racing facility with only one main entrance. The Harness Racing Commission rejected the application partly due to the Harness Racing Commission\u2019s conclusion that having only one entrance would not advance the interests of harness racing. The applicant appealed, arguing that the Harness Racing Commission was in error as the applicant had provided evidence showing that it could have built a second entrance. The Commonwealth Court found that there was no error in the Harness Racing Commission\u2019s failure to consider what the applicant theoretically could have done. The Commonwealth Court observed that \u201cin reaching its conclusion, the [Harness Racing] Commission simply considered the proposal before it, which is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. at 1072. As an aside, the Commonwealth Court mused that \u201cif the Commission had allowed applicants to revise their proposals to reflect the best features of the other facilities, there would not have been a true comparison of proposals.\u201d Id. at 1072 n. 9.\nWe find Bedford Downs to be very flimsy support for IOC\u2019s argument. First, the situation presented in Bedford Downs is quite distinct from the one at issue sub judice. In Bedford Downs, the rejected applicant was requesting leave to amend after the Commission issued an adjudication in the matter. In contrast, PITG\u2019s amendment occurred while the Board was still conducting its review of this matter. Furthermore, Bed-ford Downs is a decision from an inferior court regarding statutory material distinct from the Act; it is clearly not a controlling decision. Furthermore, the comment made by the Commonwealth Court was dicta, lacking any type of discussion or analysis. Accordingly, we do not perceive how Bedford Downs militates in favor of finding that the Board erred in allowing PITG to amend its application.\nNext, IOC cites to a Board regulation that states that \u201c[i]f there is any change in the information provided to the Board, the applicant must promptly file a written amendment in a form prescribed by the Board.\u201d 58 Pa.Code \u00a7 423.1(f). IOC claims that this language bars an applicant from amending its application to include new information. This argument is unavailing. There is simply nothing in \u00a7 423.1(f) which can be read to bar such amendments.\nWe find that there is no provision or common law authority that barred PITG from amending its application in this fashion. Furthermore, a flat ban on such amendments would not be consonant with the application process. This process was a fluid, ongoing dialogue between the Board and the applicants. In keeping with that dialogue, the Board properly welcomed the submission of additional material, including material which was responsive to information contained in competitors\u2019 applications. As noted by PITG, \u201cthe very purpose of having a competitive application process is to encourage such \u2018oneupsmanship\u2019 as it results in stronger applications from all parties, thus benefiting both the public at large and the residents of Pittsburgh in particular.\u201d PITG brief at 9. IOC\u2019s view that the first applicant to propose a community-enhancement funding scheme essentially stakes out territory with regard to that idea is unsupportable. There is nothing in the Act that would grant a \u201cquasi-patent\u201d in an idea regarding development and charitable giving to the first applicant who proposes it.\nNext, in a cursory argument, IOC claims that the Board committed an error of law when it stated that \u201c[t]he Board finds that IOC did not fulfill its burden to the Board\u2019s satisfaction of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that it had the best quality gaming facility in this competitive slot machine licensing environment.\u201d Adjudication at 61 n. 8. IOC states that while the Board may consider the quality of the proposed facility, the Act does not require that the applicant establish via clear and convincing evidence that it had the best quality gaming facility. The Board argues that at most, the Board committed harmless error with regard to this comment.\nIOC is correct in stating that while the Board is certainly permitted to consider the quality of the proposed facility in making its licensure decision, 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1325(c)(1), the Act does not impose upon an applicant the burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that its proposed facility was the best quality. Thus, the Board\u2019s comment in footnote 8 to the Adjudication was an incorrect recitation of the law.\nWe do not believe, however, that this constituted reversible error. As noted supra, the Board did not find IOC unacceptable for licensure. In fact, the Board specifically stated that IOC and Station Square were both also suitable for licensure. Adjudication at 7. Yet, as there was only one Pittsburgh slot machine license to award, the Board was forced to deny two of the applications. Id. The Board selected PITG for licensure (and thus concomitantly denied IOC and Station Square a license) because PITG\u2019s application was, overall, the strongest one. Thus, the Board\u2019s denial of IOC\u2019s application was not a result of any inappropriate application of the clear and convincing evidence standard to IOC\u2019s application. Thus, a remand on this point would serve no purpose as the Board\u2019s improper recitation of the clear and convincing evidence standard in footnote 8 of its Adjudication did not drive the Board\u2019s denial of IOC\u2019s application.\nNext, IOC and Station Square raise a series of arguments relating to the Board\u2019s calculations of anticipated revenue for each of the three proposed casinos. Station Square asserts that the Board blindly concluded that Station Square and PITG\u2019s proposed facilities would generate the same revenue. We disagree. The Board did not ham-fistedly and nonsensically assume that Station Square and PITG would generate the same revenue. First, the Board did not in fact predict that Station Square and PITG would generate the same revenue. The Board calculated that the PITG casino would generate \u201c$482.8 million annually ..., with a $265 win per position per day at 5,000 machines.\u201d Adjudication at 21. In contrast, the Board found that the Station Square facility would generate \u201c$426.3 million annually ... with a $292 win per position per day at 4,000 machines.\u201d Adjudication at 44.\nFurthermore, while the Board did conclude that the three different proposed casinos would generate \u201csimilar\u201d amounts of revenue, Adjudication at 62, it carefully considered a variety of different factors in arriving at its calculations. See, e.g., Adjudication at 11-12 and 62-64. There was no thoughtless, one-size-fits-all calculation for projected revenue.\nNext, Station Square and IOC assert that the Board erroneously determined that neither IOC nor Station Square had fully committed to operating 5,000 slot machines in their respective facilities. This argument fails. In testimony offered by Station Square\u2019s witnesses, Station Square firmly committed to operating only 4,000 slot machines. See Board Public Hearing, 11/20/2006, at 88, 91, and 138. Station Square was equivocal, at best, as to whether it would ever operate 5.000 slot machines. In a similar vein, the record also does not support IOC\u2019s contention that it was firmly committed to operating 5,000 slot machines. Instead, the record establishes that IOC would not commit to Phase II (i.e., the phase at which it would expand to 5,000 machines) prior to licensure. See Board Public Hearing, 11/20/2006, at 123-124. See also Adjudication at 35. Rather, IOC wanted to delay that determination until a future date dependent upon the market and economy. In contrast, PITG firmly committed to expanding to 5,000 machines. Thus, the Board did not capriciously disregard the evidence when it failed to find that IOC and Station Square would operate with 5,000 slot machines.\nFinally, Station Square contends that the Board erred when it projected PITG\u2019s revenue based on PITG operating 5.000 slot machines. Station Square asserts that the Board should have instead used the 3,000 slot machines figure as the Act limits a licensee to only 3,000 slot machines for the first six months of operation. See 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1210(a). While Station Square acknowledges that following this initial six-month period a licensee can apply to operate up to 2,000 additional slot machines, see 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1210(b), it observes that there is no guarantee that a licensee would indeed receive permission to operate these additional slot machines. The Board in no fashion erred as a matter of law when it calculated future revenue based on slot machine figures in excess of 3,000. While it is true that the Act does limit newly opened slot machine casinos to 3,000 machines, that cap is in place for only the first six months following licensure. After that, the licensee may request to be permitted to operate up to 5,000 slot machines. Considering that the Board was calculating future revenues beyond the first six months of the casino\u2019s operation, there was no error in the Board utilizing the 5,000 slot machine figure.\nStation Square and IOC\u2019s final set of arguments address the discretionary factors that the Act states that the Board \u201cmay\u201d consider in awarding a license. 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1325. The first factor that IOC and Station Square take issue with is the Board\u2019s finding with regard to 1325(c)(1), the factor which allows the Board to consider the \u201clocation and quality of the proposed facility....\u201d Included within this factor are not only aesthetic factors but also considerations such as traffic flow.\nIOC argues that with regard to traffic issues, PITG\u2019s facility was not advantageously located. IOC contends that the Board capriciously disregarded evidence establishing the IOC\u2019s facility would be able to address any traffic and transportation issues far better than the PITG facility.\nThis argument fails. While the Board found that \u201ctraffic is a concern at all three properties!,]\u201d Adjudication at 56, the problems sparked by the Station Square and IOC sites were far more significant. With regard to the Station Square site, the Board noted that there is already \u201csevere congestion\u201d in that area and that Station Square had not provided adequate assurances that traffic problems could be mitigated. Adjudication at 56-57. With regard to the IOC site, the Board found it particularly significant that casino traffic would have to wend its way through residential neighborhoods. Adjudication at 57. In contrast, the PITG site is well-serviced by existing major thoroughfares and there would be limited traffic impact on residential neighborhoods. Adjudication at 58. We perceive no capricious disregard with regard to the Board\u2019s determination on the proposed casinos\u2019 impact on traffic.\nContinuing with the \u00a7 1325(c)(1) factor, IOC also asserts that the Board capriciously disregarded evidence when it found that PITG\u2019s proposed facility was a better quality casino for the Pittsburgh area than the IOC facility. IOC asserts that its facility was of cutting-edge design and that some local Pittsburgh officials found the IOC proposal to be pleasing.\nAs to the aesthetic component of the \u00a7 1325(c)(1) factor, the Board acknowledged that \u201call three proposals include state-of-the-art architectural designs, all of which have their own unique nuances.\u201d Adjudication at 61. Furthermore, in selecting the PITG facility as the one which is most appealing for the Pittsburgh area, the Board evidenced that it was attuned to a variety of aesthetic factors, including the natural topography as well as existing manmade structures. The Board noted that the PITG facility\u2019s glass walls, outdoor dining and amphitheater areas \u201cproviding panoramic views of the river and sunsets [complement] the upscale design of a modern gaming facility-all while being careful not to overshadow the skyline or other area architecture.\u201d Adjudication at 61. We perceive no arbitrariness or capricious disregard in this determination.\nStation Square and IOC both challenge the Board\u2019s findings with regard to their potential to generate tourism in the area, see 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1325(c)(6), versus what PITG could do in that regard. IOC and Station Square argue that they would be better equipped to generate tourism than PITG. The Board considered this argument and found that \u201cnone of the applicants have engaged in the development of tourism facilities to gaming development which the Board finds so significant as to weigh in any applicant\u2019s favor.\u201d Adjudication at 68-69. Station Square argues forcefully against this conclusion, asserting that its proposed management partner, Harrah\u2019s Entertainment, has extensive experience in developing tourism facilities. The Board\u2019s Adjudication adequately disposes of this claim, stating that as Harrah\u2019s Entertainment does not have an ownership interest in Station Square and is not an \u201capplicant\u201d, its experience was not considered with regard to the \u00a7 1325(c)(6) factor. Adjudication at 68 n. 9. This reasoning is sound.\nIOC also argues that the Board placed too much weight on the fact that the largest negative public comment concerned IOC\u2019s proposal. This argument is without substance. The Board did not place undue emphasis on the fact that the largest negative public comment was with regard to IOC, but rather logically and properly weighed the negative comments from the public in rendering its decision.\nNext, IOC asserts that the Board incorrectly credited PITG\u2019s commitments to donate money to Hill District revitalization projects. IOC stridently calls PITG\u2019s commitments nothing more than \u201cempty promises\u201d. IOC Brief at 54. This argument fails. Barden detailed under oath what his commitment would be in that regard. The Board did not act improperly in crediting this testimony.\nIOC also objects to the Board\u2019s finding that PITG\u2019s pledge to fund the building of a new arena for the Pittsburgh Penguins \u201cprovided some degree of neutralization to IOC\u2019s arena building commitment.\u201d Adjudication at 66. IOC rails against this conclusion and contends that its arena funding scheme was far superior to anything offered by PITG. In making this argument, IOC ignores the key component of the Board\u2019s discussion of this point. Namely, the Board cogently stated that \u201c[wjhile the issue of the arena and the Penguins remaining in Pittsburgh reflect on economic development and tourism and are an issue considered by the Board, the Board is not swayed that the Penguins are or should be an overriding factor in the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d Adjudication at 66; see also Adjudication at 61 n. 8 (the applicants\u2019 primary focus before the Board should have been on gaming and the proposed casinos; IOC\u2019s devotion of a \u201csubstantial amount of time\u201d to the Penguins arena proposal \u201cdetracted from what should have been the primary focus of the casino project and gaming.\u201d). Furthermore, IOC\u2019s Penguins arena proposal was not as sterling as IOC portrays it. As noted by the Board, there was uncertainty about IOC\u2019s proposal, with major components of the IOC-Penguins deal being thrown into flux even the day before the Board issued its adjudication. See Adjudication at 67.\nStation Square and IOC challenge the Board\u2019s emphasis on Barden personal level of commitment to the project, a level of commitment that the Board found significant. Station Square and IOC are referencing the Board\u2019s comment that\nthe personal commitment of Mr. Barden to the PITGMajestic Star project was evident at every step of the licensing proceedings. The Board notes Mr. Barden\u2019s personal presence at all proceedings and his unwavering commitment to PITG Gaming\u2019s project as his \u201cflagship\u201d property. The calm intensity which Mr. Barden brought to this project and his undeniable dedication to make this project a success for all of Pennsylvania speaks volumes of his character and suitability for this license.\nAdjudication at 71-72. IOC and Station Square find the Board\u2019s appreciation of Barden\u2019s personal commitment to the PITG project to be distasteful and employ quite strident language in protesting it. IOC goes so far as to call the Board \u201csilly\u201d and accuse it of \u201cengaging in a cult of personality\u201d in its display of regard for Barden. IOC\u2019s brief at 38 and 62.\nThe Board\u2019s cognizance of Barden\u2019s personal commitment to the PITG project, and what that personal commitment revealed about Barden\u2019s \u201ccharacter and suitability for this license,\u201d was in no fashion bizarre or peculiar. It was a sensible factor to consider when determining which entity should be awarded the license to build such a substantial gaming facility. Furthermore, the Board noted that it in part considered Barden\u2019s personal involvement significant; the Act specifically directs the Board to consider diversity issues when it awards licenses and Barden is an African-American. See Adjudication at 53 and 55; see also 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1212 (goal of the Act is to ensure diversity in all aspects of gaming, including ownership of facilities).\nAt bottom, IOC and Station Square\u2019s argument regarding the \u00a7 1325(c) factors is that they would have weighed the factors differently than did the Board. For example, they did not mention the diversity factor found at \u00a7 1325(c)(4) as this factor, which weighed so clearly in favor of PITG, was of no support to IOC and Station Square. This selective analysis of the \u00a7 1325(c) factors understandable coming from applicants who were denied a highly lucrative license. Yet, it is an analysis in which this court cannot engage. Our \u00a7 1204 appellate review does not grant us authority to act as a super-Board, employing our own discretion in determining which applicant we believe was the best applicant. We are not empowered to sift through the voluminous evidence, reweighing it. Our review in these matters is to determine whether the Board acted arbitrarily or in capricious disregard of the evidence when it considered these factors. IOC and Station Square have not established that the Board acted in an arbitrary fashion when it weighed the discretionary \u00a7 1325(c) factors.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the Board is affirmed.\nJustice EAKIN and FITZGERALD join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BALDWIN files a joining concurring opinion.\nJustice CASTILLE files a dissenting opinion.\n. The Legislature authorized the Board to create the Bureau. 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1517(a). Furthermore, the Legislature directed the Board to \"promulgate regulations pertaining to the operation of the bureau to insure separation of functions between the bureau and the board.\u201d 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1202(b)(25).\n. Rule 15 31 (a) states in pertinent part:\n(a) Appellate jurisdiction petition for review proceedings. A party to a proceeding before a government unit that resulted in a quasijudicial order may intervene as of right in a proceeding under this chapter relating to such order by filing a notice of intervention (with proof of service on all parties to the matter) with the prothonotary of the appellate court within 30 days after notice of the filing of the petition for review.\n. IOC contends that we should not employ the Wintermyer decision in resolving this matter. IOC asserts that Wintermyer cannot be used in defining capricious disregard since \u00a7 1204 of the Act specifically excludes \u00a7 704 of the Administrative Agency Law from the standard of review and Wintermyer was based upon the interpretation of \u00a7 704. We reject this argument. Wintermyer\u2019s articulation of general concepts regarding the capricious disregard standard is applicable as such general statements would apply to any discussion of the capricious disregard standard.\n. We note that in reviewing this issue, we will examine only the evidence that was before the Board prior to its December 20, 2006 vote. Below, we consider and reject, on the merits, Station Square\u2019s and IOC's contention that the Board capriciously disregarded public financial information detailing PITG\u2019s performance and status through 2006, but we need not consider any extra-record evidence in rejecting this contention.\n. 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1313 is entitled \"Slot machine license application financial fitness requirements\u201d and provides in its entirety:\n(a) Applicant financial information. \u2014 The board shall require each applicant for a slot machine license to produce the information, documentation and assurances concerning financial background and resources as the board deems necessary to establish by clear and convincing evidence the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, its affiliate, intermediary, subsidiary or holding company, including, but not limited to, bank references, business and personal income and disbursement schedules, tax returns and other reports filed with governmental agencies, and business and personal accounting and check records and ledgers.

Any such banking or lending institution and institutional investors may be waived from the qualification requirements. A banking or lending institution or institutional investor shall, however, produce for the board upon request any document or information which bears any relation to the proposal submitted by the applicant or applicants. The integrity of the financial sources shall be judged upon the same standards as the applicant. Any such person or entity shall produce for the board upon request any document or information which bears any relation to the application. In addition, the applicant shall produce whatever information, documentation or assurances the board requires to establish by clear and convincing evidence the adequacy of financial resources.\n(c) Applicant\u2019s ability to pay license fee. \u2014 The board shall require each applicant for a Category 1 or 2 slot machine license at the time of application to post a letter of credit or bond in the amount of $50,000,000 to demonstrate the financial ability to pay the slot machine license fee as required in section 1209 (relating to slot machine license fee) if issued a slot machine license by the board. Each applicant for a Category 3 slot machine license at the time of application shall be required to post a letter of credit or bond in the amount of $5,000,000 to demonstrate the financial ability to pay the Category 3 slot machine license fee as required in section 1305 (relating to Category 3 slot machine license) if issued a slot machine license by the board.\n(d) Applicant\u2019s business experience. \u2014 -The board shall require each applicant for a slot machine license to produce the information, documentation and assurances as the board may require to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant has sufficient business ability and experience to create and maintain a successful, efficient operation. Applicants shall produce the names of all proposed key employees and a description of their respective or proposed responsibilities as they become known.\n(e) Applicant\u2019s operational viability. \u2014 In assessing the financial viability of the proposed licensed facility, the board shall make a finding, after review of the application, that the applicant is likely to maintain a financially successful, viable and efficient business operation and will likely be able to maintain a steady level of growth of revenue to the Commonwealth pursuant to section 1403 (relating to establishment of State Gaming Fund and net slot machine revenue distribution). Notwithstanding any provision of this part to the contrary, an applicant that includes a commitment or promise to pay a slot machine license fee in excess of the amount provided in section 1209 or a distribution of terminal revenue in excess of the amounts provided in sections 1403, 1405 (relating to Pennsylvania Race Horse Development Fund) and 1407 (relating to Pennsylvania Gaming Economic Development and Tourism Fund) shall not be deemed a financially successful, viable or efficient business operation and shall not be approved for a slot machine license.\n(f) Additional information. \u2014 In addition to other information required by this part, a person applying for a slot machine license shall provide the following information:\n(1) The organization, financial structure and nature of all businesses operated by the person, including any affiliate, intermediary, subsidiary or holding companies, the names and personal employment and criminal histories of all officers, directors and key employees of the corporation; the names of all holding, intermediary, affiliate and subsidiary companies of the corporation; and the organization, financial structure and nature of all businesses operated by such holding, intermediary and subsidiary companies as the board may require, including names and personal employment and criminal histories of such officers, directors and principal employees of such corporations and companies as the board may require.\n(2) The extent of securities held in the corporation by all officers, directors and underwriters and their remuneration in the form of salary, wages, fees or otherwise.\n(3) Copies of all management and service contracts.\n. Every page of the PITG FSR has been stamped \"confidential\u201d. See also 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1206(f) (confidentiality of information obtained by the Board or Bureau). In making their argument on this issue, we note that IOC and Station Square assiduously honored the confidentiality of the PITG FSR. Our opinion will be in keeping with Petitioners' approach; we will address the argument raised with as much specificity as we can without disclosing information that has not otherwise been made public.\n. The waiver analysis that follows is materially identical to the analysis contained in our companion gaming case issued contemporaneously with this case. See Pocono Manor Investors v. Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, 592 Pa. 625, 643-52, 927 A.2d 209, 220-25, 2007 WL 2004483, 30 MM 2007.\n.

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\nconcurring.\nPetitioners\u2019 arguments are, in my view, somewhat weightier than the majority portrays. For example, Petitioners contend that the Board\u2019s alleged failure to act as a \u201cprudent man\u201d in awarding the Pittsburgh license constituted an error of law. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner (Station Square Gaming, LP) at 57 n. 33. The majority rejects this claim by stating that the Gaming Act\u2019s requirement that the Board use the prudent man standard has no effect upon the review that this Court must undertake in determining whether the Board erred in the award of a gaming license. See Majority Opinion, op. at 679, 927 A.2d at 242 (asserting that the Gaming Act\u2019s directive to apply the prudent man rule \u201cdo[es] not channel this Court\u2019s appellate review\u201d). It would appear, however, that if it were evident that the Board failed to apply such a standard as required by statute, this would constitute an error of law, thus providing possible grounds for reversal. See 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1204 (stating that this Court must affirm the Board\u2019s order unless it finds, inter alia, that the Board committed an error of law). Under the facts of this case, moreover, Majestic Star\u2019s troubled financial history does raise a legitimate question as to whether a \u201cprudent man\u201d would have selected PITG over its competitors for licensure. Still, as the majority points out, the record contains evidence of some positive indicators. For example, the financial suitability task force found that PITG had the resources to build its casino, and the Board determined that the project would be very profitable. Therefore, given this Court\u2019s highly deferential review as prescribed by the Legislature, I must ultimately conclude that the Board\u2019s actions did not constitute reversible error under the prudent man standard.\nStation Square also contends that the Board should have used a baseline of 3,000 slot machines for its revenue-generation comparison of all applicants. The majority dismisses this argument by pointing out that, after six months, \u201cthe licensee may request to be permitted to operate up to 5,000 slot machines. Considering that the Board was calculating future revenues beyond the first six months of the casino\u2019s operation, there was no error in the Board utilizing the 5,000 slot machine figure.\u201d Majority Opinion, op. at 688, 927 A.2d at 247. This disposition seems non-responsive, as Station Square concedes that it is possible to request expansion after six months, but highlights that there is no way to know whether such a request will be granted.\nWhile I ultimately do not agree with Station Square for reasons discussed below, I find its argument more plausible than the majority. In particular, Station Square points out that the Board has taken the position that market conditions favorable to slots expansion are always a necessary precondition to expanding beyond 3,000 machines, and hence, there is no assurance that the Board will approve such a request. In its decision regarding slot licenses for Philadelphia, the Board stated:\nAt first glance ... it appears that Riverwalk will be more profitable than the other casinos. Based upon an examination of evidentiary records, the Board finds there is no significant difference in the revenue estimates. Riverwalk\u2019s revenue generation estimates were based upon an assumption that 5,000 machines would be operational by the stabilized year. The number of machines is based upon that number for which financing was in place at the time of the hearing. The other casino applicants\u2019 projections were based upon 3,000 machines because that is the number of machines in the committed-to phases of the building projects. Each of those applicants provided credible testimony that they would proceed to their subsequent expansion phase and increase up to 5,000 machines with Board approval if the market supports that expansion. Even Riverwalk could not unilaterally expand from 3,000 to 5,000 machines without Board approval. The Board must approve that expansion.... Although they have the financing in place, if Riverwalk did not show usage and economic activity sufficient to support 2,000 additional machines, the Board would not be obligated to permit the expansion. Likewise, if another casino demonstrated that 3,000 machines were utilized to such an extent that expansion was warranted, then market conditions would warrant an expansion for their facility as well. In sum, market conditions will dictate the number of machines over the 3,000 threshold number at any of the properties. This was illustrated by testimony that more machines do not necessarily translate into more revenues if the market demand is not present for the additional machines.\nAdjudication of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board in the Matters of the Applications for Category 2 Slot Machine Licenses in the City of the First Class, Philadelphia, at 94-95 (emphasis added), quoted in Brief for Petitioner (Station Square Gaming, LP) at 63.\nWhile it may be difficult to reconcile the above reasoning with the Board\u2019s comparative approach in the present case, it does not follow that the Board may not make comparisons based upon later stages of the submitted proposals which subsume more than 3,000 slot machines. The applicants each included phased augmentations moving beyond the 3,000 number, with the general expectation that the Board would take into account the circumstances of all phases of the proposals when making its decision as to which proposed casino would best serve the Commonwealth\u2019s interests. Thus, regardless of the Board\u2019s disposition in the Philadelphia matter, Station Square has little firm ground to maintain that, here, the Board was legally required to make its revenue comparisons using only a 3,000 slot machine basis for each applicant. Moreover, I do not read the adjudication as placing sufficient weight upon the revenue generation factor to support a conclusion that the Board might have reached a different result if it had assumed only 3,000 slot machines relative to all of the proposals.\nFor these reasons, I am able to join the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the Board\u2019s order.",

That is, this Court is not to apply the standard of care itself, but rather, to review whether the Board acted in an arbitrary manner or with capricious disregard for the evidence, a finding which could be supported by the Board\u2019s failure to apply the prudent man standard of care.
