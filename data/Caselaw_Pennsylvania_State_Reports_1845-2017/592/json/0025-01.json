The Commonwealth Court\u2019s order denying reconsideration states as follows:\nTo the extent that petitioner requests this court to address the claims he raises in connection to his parole revocation and respondent's denial of administrative relief, such claims must be raised in a timely petition for review addressed to this court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. Pa.R.A.P. 1503, however, embodies a safe-harbor rule that requires the court to treat an improvidently filed original jurisdiction action as a matter raised within the court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, assuming that it was filed within the relevant appeal period. To the extent that there are ambiguities in the original filing, under the rule, the appellate court may require that the papers be clarified by amendment.",
