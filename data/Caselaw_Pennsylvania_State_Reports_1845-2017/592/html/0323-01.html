The appellant, Will Salley, Jr., a low-income homeowner in Philadelphia, applied for and received a residential mortgage loan from the appellee, Option One Mortgage Corp., a sub-prime lender. As part of the application process, Mr. Salley was required to enter into a written “Agreement for the Arbitration of Disputes.” That agreement mandated arbitration of most disputes upon any party’s request, indicating that the claims were to be administered by the American Arbitration Association and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9, U.S.C., with the arbitrator being authorized to award any remedy or relief that a court of appropriate jurisdiction could order or grant. The agreement, however, excepted some remedies from arbitration, largely, at least, creditor remedies including foreclosure, as follows:</p>

He alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that, through material misinformation and nondisclosures, Option One baited him with promises of debt relief through consolidation and low fixed monthly payments, then switched him into a high-cost, variable-rate refinancing, in violation of various federal and state laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201601" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="15 U.S.C. §§ 1601">15 U.S.C. §§ 1601</a>, <em>et seq., </em>Pennsylvania Usury Law, 41 Pa.C.S. §§ 502, <em>et seq., </em>and Pennsylvania Unfair Trade and Consumer Protection Law, 73 P.S. §§ 201-1, <em>et seq., </em>and asserted common law theories including breach of contract and fraud. Further, Mr. Salley asserted that Option One failed to deliver funds to him at closing as represented on the settlement documents, and to completely pay bills and satisfy mortgages for purposes of debt consolidation as it had promised, and as a result, foreclosure proceedings were initiated by the assignee of another lender. According to the complaint, Option One’s purported conduct is an instance of predatory lending, in which unscrupulous lenders use deceptive and high-pressure marketing techniques targeting poor, elderly, and minority populations to advance secured loans carrying inflated costs and obligations, and which are made without regard to the ability to repay, in anticipation of eventual foreclosures that will strip borrowers of their equity. Mr. Salley sought rescission of the loan transaction, termination of any security interest created in his property, return of monies that he paid in connection with the transaction, forfeiture and return of the loan proceeds, actual <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>and statutory damages, and an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.</p>

On the matter of substantive unconscionability, Mr. Salley contends that <em>Lytle </em>reflects the appropriate conclusion that the exceptions to mandatory arbitration for foreclosure and other creditor remedies unreasonably favor Option One. In this regard, he suggests that there is nothing at law that prevents an arbitrator from adjudicating <em>in rem </em>or equitable claims concerning secured property or administering an effective foreclosure proceeding. As to the Third Circuit’s <em>Harris </em>decision, Mr. Salley’s position is that the federal court placed undue reliance on the fact that Pennsylvania law does not require mutuality of remedy to support a contract. <em>See Harris, </em><a href="/f3d/183/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="183 F.3d 173" data-case-ids="11544075" data-case-paths="/f3d/183/0173-01">183 F.3d at 183</a>.

First, <em>amici </em>contend that the agreement requires that the parties pay exorbitant costs and fees to the arbitral forum, making it impossible for an indigent person facing foreclosure to afford arbitration. Second, <em>amici </em>take the position that the agreement has the effect of requiring consumers facing a home foreclosure to litigate nearly identical statutory claims twice, once in state court against the foreclosing entity (to whom the loan has been sold/assigned in a secondary market), and a second time in an arbitral forum against Option One as the lender.

The court noted that it was beyond dispute that the borrower would be entitled to an award of costs if she prevailed in her federal Truth-In-Lending or state-consumer-protection-law claims. <em>See, e.g., </em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201640" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 1640">15 U.S.C. § 1640</a>(a)(3) (reflecting a mandatory award of attorneys’ fees and costs for a Truth-In-Lending violation). If the borrower did not prevail on those claims, however, the arbitration agreement permitted the arbitrator to allocate costs, and they might be assessed against the borrower. The New Jersey Supreme Court therefore expressed the concern that such a fee-shifting provision, which reached beyond frivolous or bad-faith claims, could deter consumers from vindicating statutory rights through mandatory arbitration. In this regard, the court explained that some other courts have considered the possible chilling effect in invalidating cost-splitting and/or cost-shifting provisions in arbitration agreements. <em>See Delta Funding v.

      <p id="b397-7" data-blocks='[["BL_397.8",397,[239,1748,1120,587]]]'>Madame Justice Baldwin appears to draw substantial significance from the preservation of self-help remedies. <em>See </em>Dissenting Opinion, at 131. However, like Mr. Salley, she fails to identify any form of creditor self-help remedy that would be available in a residential mortgage setting. We do not dispute Justice Baldwin's assertion that all of the lender’s claims that can, as a practical matter, yield full recourse, are excluded from arbitration under the Option-One/Salley agreement. This is not, however, because there is some greater range of non-arbitration remedies that the lender has available and is exclusively preserving, as the dissent appears to suggest. Rather, we do not take issue with the dissent’s assertion in this regard because, in the face of substantial arrearages, foreclosure may very well represent the sole practical avenue for a sub-prime lender to secure full recourse. The apparent business justification for reserving the judicial forum for such remedy is developed in the text above.</p>

I believe the majority is mistaken. I see Mr. Salley’s challenge as going solely to the arbitration provision within his contract with Option One. His lawsuit is based not on the illegality of <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>his contract with Option One, but rather on Option One’s predatory “bait and switch” lending tactics as violations of the Truth in Lending, Usury and Unfair Trade and Consumer Protection Laws. The argument is not that the contract is invalid, but that the enforcement mechanism, i.e. the arbitration clause, is unconscionable and thus unenforceable. Thus, I do not believe that the United States Supreme Court decisions in <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em><a href="/us/388/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="388 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="6168709" data-case-paths="/us/388/0395-01">388 U.S. 395</a>, <a href="/us/388/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="388 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="6168709" data-case-paths="/us/388/0395-01">87 S.Ct. 1801</a>, <a href="/us/388/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="388 U.S. 395" data-case-ids="6168709" data-case-paths="/us/388/0395-01">18 L.Ed.2d 1270</a> (1967); <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.

Those decisions do not permit a challenge to the parties’ overall agreement in contravention of an arbitration provision. In <em>Prima Paint, </em>the plaintiff claimed that a consulting agreement was fraudulently induced, when one of the contracting parties falsely represented itself to be solvent and capable of meeting its contractual obligations. The United States Supreme Court found that the plaintiff was challenging the entire contract, and not just the arbitration clause. Thus, the Court concluded, the issue must be presented in the first instance to the arbitrator, based upon the parties’ agreement to arbitrate any disputes arising under the contract. In <em>Buckeye, </em>consumers alleged that the contracts they entered into with Buckeye check casing were illegally usurious, and the Court similarly . held that the challenge was to the contract itself, not solely to the arbitration clause it contained.</p>

This policy, though, should never extend to approving an arbitration agreement that is in any manner unconscionable, just as we would view any other unconscionable contract with disfavor.</p>
    <p id="b401-5" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[197,952,1153,641]]]'>Secondly, I find the arbitration provision in question both procedurally (unfairness in formation of the contract) and substantively (terms disproportionately favorable to the more powerful party) unconscionable. The majority seems to recognize the undisputable fact of procedural unconscionability in that Option One possessed a vastly superior sophistication, and virtually all of the bargaining power in this “take it or leave it” contract. As Mr. Salley’s <em>Amici </em>point out, a low-income borrower in need of a loan is extremely unlikely even to notice the existence of a lopsided arbitration agreement in the closing process, and even less likely to question such a provision, for fear that the loan would not be granted.</p>
    <p id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.7",401,[196,1617,1155,364]],["BL_402.1",402,[293,286,1156,675]]]'>As for substantive unconscionability, the fact that, pursuant to the arbitration provision, Mr. Salley is required to pay arbitration fees to initiate his claims against Option One is enough to render the provision unreasonable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Arbitration fees are privately set, and significantly exceed fees for filing a civil action in state or federal court.

As the United States Supreme Court has noted, “the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant ... from effectively vindicating [his] federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum.” <em>Green Tree Financial v. Randolph, </em><a href="/us/531/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="531 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="9505413" data-case-paths="/us/531/0079-01">531 U.S. 79</a>, 90, <a href="/us/531/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="531 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="9505413" data-case-paths="/us/531/0079-01">121 S.Ct. 513</a>, 522, <a href="/us/531/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="531 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="9505413" data-case-paths="/us/531/0079-01">148 L.Ed.2d 373</a>, 383 (2000). Here, there is no specific evidence about the costs of arbitration. Thus, at a minimum, I would propose that the district court should be required to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the costs are prohibitive and thus unconscionable such as to invalidate the arbitration provision.</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[288,985,1159,1040]]]'>In addition, I would find the part of the arbitration provision that excludes creditor remedies to be substantively unconscionable. The majority quotes with approval the New Jersey Supreme Court’s finding that a similar provision may be oppressive to the borrower but is not unconscionable. Setting aside for the moment the issue of judicial foreclosure actions, creditor self-help remedies are also excluded from arbitration. This means that, for all practical purposes, <em>all </em>of borrower’s claims must be arbitrated, and <em>all </em>of lender’s claims are excluded from arbitration. This does not support lender’s notions that they support arbitration; to the contrary, Option One is availing itself of a judicial forum while blocking their borrowers from the same. Without expressing an opinion as to whether arbitration or a judicial forum is preferable, an agreement such as this is one-sided. Parties are free to contract for asymmetrical remedies, but when the stronger party imposes the forum restriction on the weaker party without accepting that forum for itself, that provision is problematic. <em>See e.g. Ting v.
