In this direct appeal, the Pennsylvania State Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police (“State Lodge”) challenges the dismissal of its declaratory judgment and mandamus action asserting that the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (“DCNR”) is in violation of statutes establishing a minimal level of training for certain police officers. <em>See </em>53 Pa.C.S. §§ 2161-2171. In particular, the State Lodge averred that DCNR’s failure to secure adequate training for rangers at Pennsylvania state park lands, who have, <em>inter alia, </em>the powers of police officers of cities of the first class, violated its statutory obligation to provide police protection for Commonwealth parks and forest lands.</p>
