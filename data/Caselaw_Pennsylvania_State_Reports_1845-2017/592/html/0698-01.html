Briefly, the killing occurred on January 23, 1993, when Appellant and his co-defendant Derrick Teagle drove to a Sav-A-Lot supermarket in Philadelphia with the intention of robbing it. Both men were armed with handguns, but Teagle’s was not functioning due to a broken firing mechanism. After pretending to be customers, Appellant and Teagle left the store, only to return a few minutes later. Teagle pointed his gun at the store manager, Anne Marie Buchanan, and Appellant ordered her to open the store’s safe. Meanwhile, Teagle went to empty the cash register. When Juana Robles, a customer, <a id="p709" href="#p709" data-label="709" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*709</a>attempted to leave the store, Appellant pointed his gun at her and ordered her not to leave.</p>
    <p id="b761-5" data-blocks='[["BL_761.5",761,[187,409,1153,852]]]'>Tracey Lawson, the store’s unarmed security guard, was in the parking lot while the robbery was taking place. When he noticed what was going on inside, he pulled down the metal grate that secures the front entrance to the store. Appellant and Teagle were able to escape under the grate as it was coming down, and entered the parking lot. Lawson went into a nearby store and alerted the store’s manager and the security guard, Gerard Smith, who was an off-duty Philadelphia police officer. All three men ran into the parking lot after Appellant and Teagle, where Officer Smith ordered the fleeing men to halt. As Appellant and Teagle fled, Appellant fired his weapon at Officer Smith, who fired back. Lawson began to chase after Appellant. When he saw Lawson pursuing him, Appellant turned and fired, hitting Lawson in the head. Appellant and Teagle then fled the scene in a get-away car. Lawson died in the hospital three days later.</p>

Thus, at the very latest, Appellant was aware of Teagle’s assertion at the time of the penalty phase hearing.

Trial counsel stated that he knew the photographs were mug shots, as did the prosecutor, as did the trial court, to which the trial court interjected that the jury was not aware they were mug shots and that they could have been collected from his mother’s bedroom. The trial court questioned the Commonwealth’s strategy of introducing the photographs on direct examination rather than waiting for trial counsel to challenge the identification on cross-examination.

The third prong requires defendant to make a record specifically identifying the race of all the venirepersons removed by the prosecution, the race of the jurors who served and the race of the jurors acceptable to the Commonwealth who were stricken by the defense. After such a record is established, the trial court must consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether challenges were used to exclude venirepersons on account of their race.

Particularly in light of the fact that the mental-health proffer expressly relates the life-history mitigation to specific mitigating factors, I believe that the post-conviction court should have entertained this evidence as well and made the requisite factual findings and legal conclusions concerning its impact. Although the PCRA court repeatedly stated that these proofs would not have changed the outcome of the trial, its findings in this regard are in the context of an undeveloped record and are set forth in a conclusory fashion with little or no supporting analysis. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Teagle now claims that he, and not Appellant, was the shooter, and that he falsely testified otherwise in order to avoid the death penalty. <em>See </em>Affidavit/Declaration of Derrick Teagle, at 1 ¶ 2.</p>

For one thing, contrary to the prosecutor’s representation, it simply is not true that the defendant has any burden of proof unless the Commonwealth first establishes at least one aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, the prosecutor misstated the jury’s task by indicating that it must find the mitigating circumstances to "outweigh the aggravating circumstances” to impose a life sentence. To the contrary, if even one juror deems the mitigating and aggravating factors to be in equipoise, the sentence must be life. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 971 l(c)(iv).</p>
      <p id="b806-8" data-blocks='[["BL_806.8",806,[362,1932,1121,383]]]'>Along these lines, I am also more troubled than the majority by the prosecution’s argument to the jurors that they should find no mitigation, and hence impose the death penalty, in order to "make [their] job easier.” <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 744, 927 A.2d at 613. The jury must, of course, follow the law in determining whether to sentence a defendant to death, independent of considerations such as whether ignoring mitigating evidence might be an “easier” way to complete its task. I would require the PCRA court in the first instance to assess the effect of these improper statements in disposing of Appellant’s layered ineffectiveness claim.</p>
