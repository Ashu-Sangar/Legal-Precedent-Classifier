The applications within this subcategory were to be submitted to the Board by December 28, 2005. The Board then gave the applicants a “deemed completion date” of November 14, 2006, the date by which proposals were to be finalized. As of December of 2006, the Board had five applications pending before it under this subcategory.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The five applicants were Crossroads Gaming Resort &amp; Spa, Mount Airy # 1 (hereafter “Mount Airy”), Pocono Manor Investors (hereafter “Pocono”), Sands Bethworks Gaming, and Tropicana Pennsylvania. After receiving the applications, the Board engaged in extensive review and investigation of the five applicants through the BIE and Bureau of Corporate Compliance and Internal Controls. During the course of its investigations, the bureaus submitted various reports to the Board detailing their findings as to each applicant, including the ownership structure of the proposed casinos, financial suitability of the applicant, the impact on the local areas, the location and zoning status of the facility, a review of key employee qualifiers, and the diversity plan. <em>See, e.g., </em>R. 579a. The Board also held public input hearings related to the proposed facilities as well as permitted a public comment period. Consistent with its mandate, the BIE also conducted background investigations of the applicants, licensees, principals, key employees, or permittees of the proposed facilities. <em>See 4 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1202(b)(9). The background investigation and suitability <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>report issued by the BIE raised questions concerning the character of the sole owner of Mount Airy, Louis DeNaples. Following the completion of the investigations, the Board conducted public sessions related to the licensing of Mount Airy on December 4-5, 2006. The purpose of the hearings was to provide the applicant with a final opportunity to demonstrate its suitability for the license. The Board also conducted closed executive sessions on December 4-6, 2006 related to the licensing of Mount Airy, at which time matters related to the suitability of Louis DeNaples were heard by the Board.</p>

Subsequently, the Board filed an order approving the licenses as well as a published adjudication supporting its decision on February 1, 2007. In the published adjudication, the Board reiterated the relevant law that it used in making its determination. <em>See </em>Adjudication at 2-4; <em>see also </em>Public Hearing, 12/20/2006, at 33 (listing the relevant statutory provisions of the Act).

The Board reviewed the process it followed in making its decision, including making requests for information from a number of law enforcement agencies, conducting database searches, conducting personal interviews, establishing a Financial Suitability Task Force, hiring an independent firm to review traffic study plans submitted by each of the applicants, conducting public input hearings, and providing the public with a public comment period.

The location of Mount Airy in the Pocono Mountains will provide a location conducive to economic development and gaming without overburdening local services. The design of the facility is consistent with the local atmosphere and region and it promises to restore the once-famed Mount Airy Lodge to the Pocono Mountains, which will enhance the draw of tourists to the region and generate gaming revenue for the Commonwealth. The Mount Airy structure is presently under construction, other approvals have been obtained and the prospect of bringing gaming to the Poconos is accelerated substantially over any other proposal. As such, the economic benefits will flow to Pennsylvania’s citizens sooner for the betterment of the Commonwealth. Furthermore, in comparing to other applicants, the fact that Mount Airy is locally owned by a lifelong resident of the area who has demonstrated a lifetime commitment to the development of businesses in the area and the growth of the community through his charitable endeavors, is seen as a positive factor for Mount Airy since the profits from the venture will remain in Pennsylvania as an <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>asset to other economic development and community commitments.</blockquote>

Specifically, the Board points out that Pocono was present at the December 5th Mount Airy hearing, but said nothing. Furthermore, the Board asserts that Pocono’s failure to file written objections between the December 5th public hearing on Mount Airy’s application and the December 19th final hearing before the Board operated as a waiver of these issues.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Board also relies on Pocono’s failure to raise any such objections during the December 19th oral argument, at which time all of the applicants were given the opportunity to make a final plea. Finally, the Board points to its Adjudication, wherein it stated that “[n]o applicant filed any written objection to the Board docket, or raised any objection orally or in writing to the Board during the course of its hearing, relating to the procedure utilized by the Board for the conduct of the hearing process generally or to any particular allegation of error.” Adjudication at 16, ¶ 40. Based upon these failures, the Board concludes that Pocono waived any challenges to the procedures the Board followed in evaluating Mount Airy’s application. Notably absent from the Board’s argument, however, is whether the Act permitted Pocono to participate in the Mount Airy hearing or the Board’s regulations by which Pocono could have raised objections regarding the Mount Airy proceedings. Thus, while the Board proposes <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>various avenues by which an applicant could have raised a challenge to the procedures the Board followed in another applicant’s case, we do not know how Pocono would have been aware that these avenues for raising objections existed.</p>

The other applicants are not necessarily privy to such one-on-one interactions with the Board. Indeed, although the Board asserts that Pocono could have raised an objection since it was present at the December 5th proceedings, other than the Board’s argument, we are unsure that if Pocono had raised such an objection it would have been recognized.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The applicants that were denied a license must be given an opportunity to challenge the Board’s decision, since the Act provides as much under § 1204.

In reality, however, Pocono’s objection must be that Mount Airy was allowed to make last minute changes to its organizational structure, since the ownership structure had never changed — Louis DeNaples was always and continues to be the sole owner of Mount Airy. Accordingly, any reference to the October 13th deadline is misplaced.</p>

Pocono asserts that the idea of an “unnamed audit committee” to manage the facility was introduced for the first time at the December 19th hearing. Pocono implies that this last minute change was to marginalize the presence of Mr. DeNaples in the management of the operation and was inconsistent with prior representations by Mount Airy that Mr. DeNaples would be involved in the day-to-day management of the facility. Pocono contends that this last minute change was proeedurally unfair and more importantly, meant that no background investigation of the members of the audit committee occurred.

There was no question that an “audit committee” was identified as overseeing certain operations of the facility on the organizational chart that was submitted with the Mount Airy December 21, 2005 application. Furthermore, Mount Airy’s prior representations that DeNaples would be “in his truck driving over, saying what’s going on, how are things going ...,” or the fact <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>that he would retain some power to hire and fire employees, certainly did not amount to asserting that DeNaples would be managing the day-to-day operations of the facility.

    <p id="b695-4" data-blocks='[["BL_695.5",695,[187,1059,1157,1123]]]'>Pocono next argues that the Board provided procedural advantages to Mount Airy by permitting it to make changes to the physical design of its proposal following the November 14, 2006 “deemed completion date.” Specifically, Pocono asserts that Phase I of the project had grown to include a 400-room hotel, an additional stand-alone parking garage, as well as a new 31,000 square foot retail bridge. Likewise, Phase II was expanded to include two sub-phases (A &amp; B). Phase IIA included an additional 2,000 slot machines, 1,172 additional food and beverage seats, and an additional 1,200 parking spaces. Phase IIB included an additional 3,400 parking spaces, an additional 41,500 square feet of retail space, and a conference and banquet facility of 174,000 square feet. In support of its challenge, Pocono points to a statement by a Board member at the December 5th public session raising concerns that the scope of Mount Airy proposal was much larger than that previously submitted.

R. 179a. Therefore, we conclude that the Board viewed the process as more fluid than Pocono is willing to acknowledge. Clearly, by the verbiage of the October 4th letter, the Board believed that the process would include an ongoing dialogue between itself and the applicant, which included the submission of additional material as necessary beyond the “deemed completion date.” Accordingly, we reject Pocono’s broad assertion that the Board <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>committed a procedural error in taking additional evidence from Mount Airy beyond the “deemed completion date.”</p>

Significantly, the original application submitted to the Board represented that Phase 1 would contain a 198-room hotel and Phase II would add another 200+ rooms. Thus, Mount Airy always envisioned that a 400-room hotel would be constructed, but by November of 2006, Mount Airy proposed to construct a 400-room facility in Phase 1 rather than spreading the construction over two phases. <em>See </em>R. 235b, Letter to Board dated November 9, 2006, reflecting 401 rooms to be built in Phase I.

While Pocono attempts to shoehorn this inquiry into an “error of law,” we decline Pocono’s invitation to review this claim <em>de novo. </em>In fact, <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>under our limited review granted under § 1204, it would not be our role to step into the shoes of the Board and determine whether the evidence of record met the clear and convincing evidence standard in the first instance. Moreover, even if that was our role, it is unclear whether a <em>de novo </em>standard of review would ever apply to this inquiry.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> We need not address this facet of Pocono’s argument, however, as the essence of Pocono’s argument is that the BIE’s report uncovered too much negative evidence regarding the character of Louis DeNaples, which the Board simply could not have ignored in reaching its decision. Pocono’s argument is none other than a challenge asserting that the Board capriciously disregarded the evidence of record in concluding that Mount Airy met the character suitability requirement.</p>

In fact, unlike the prior claims, when we concluded that objections to alleged unfair procedural advantages to the Mount Airy proceeding were not waived, we are very concerned that Pocono acquiesced in the Task Force’s projections at the December 5th hearing, R. 756a-57a, but now seeks to complain about those very same numbers.</p>

In two sentences, Pocono also asserts that the Board misstated that Pocono did not have local approvals and capriciously disregarded Pocono's evidence of community commitments. Again, however, the Board did not deny Pocono’s license on the basis that it did not have local approval and reviewed the community commitment of Pocono concluding that no applicant’s community commitments were "significantly better than another that would sway the Board to consider this criteria as a substantial factor in choosing one applicant over another.” <em>See </em>Adjudication at 103-04. Pocono has not established that the Board capriciously disregarded any evidence of record.</p>

As Pocono is asserting that the Board erred in applying the facts of the Mount Airy matter to the clear and convincing evidence standard, it is raising a mixed question of law and fact. We have previously indicated that the standard for reviewing mixed questions of law and fact is not settled in Pennsylvania. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Crawley, </em><a href="/pa/592/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="924 A.2d 612" data-case-ids="3555094,8305672" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0222-01,/a2d/924/0612-01">924 A.2d 612</a>, 615-16, <a href="/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201583583" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="2007 WL 1583583">2007 WL 1583583</a>, *3-*4 (May 31, 2007); <em>see also Warehime v. Warehime, </em><a href="/pa/563/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="563 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="1366949" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0400-01">563 Pa. 400</a>, <a href="/a2d/761/1138-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="761 A.2d 1138" data-case-ids="11162866,1366949" data-case-paths="/a2d/761/1138-01,/pa/563/0400-01">761 A.2d 1138</a>, 1146 n. 4 (2000) (Saylor, J. concurring). And, the question presented is what level of deference the suitability determination by the Board should be given. The answer to this question must be evaluated on an issue-by-issue basis, since some mixed questions are more heavily weighted toward fact, while others are more heavily weighted towards law. <em>See generally Warehime, supra. </em>The more fact intensive a determination is, the more deference a reviewing court should give the conclusion below.</p>
      <p id="b711-6" data-blocks='[["BL_711.7",711,[213,2057,1123,271]]]'>While we believe that the question presented by Pocono would most likely be viewed as heavily fact-intensive, because of the nature of the proceedings before the Board, we need not reach this question in this case, since as discussed <em>infra, </em>we believe that the essence of Pocono’s assertion is that the Board capriciously disregarded the character evidence in determining that Louis DeNaples met the suitability requirement.</p>
