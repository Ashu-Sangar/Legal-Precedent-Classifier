While on probation, appellee failed to report to his probation officer and also failed to pay his restitution, fines, and costs. Appellee was subsequently apprehended and a brief VOP hearing was held on December 18, 2000 before the Honorable Rayford A. Means of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.

He also claimed that the sentence imposed was excessive. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence on February 26, 2002. <em>Commonwealth v. Reaves, </em>No. 299 EDA 2001 (memorandum).

The amended petition raised a layered claim of counsel ineffectiveness, <em>i.e., </em>appellee alleged both that (1) VOP hearing counsel “failed and refused” to file a motion to modify sentence, and (2) VOP appeal counsel was ineffective for failing to claim that VOP hearing counsel was ineffective in defaulting sentencing issues. In an accompanying letter brief, appellee identified the defaulted sentencing errors available to VOP counsel as including that the sentence was excessive, the VOP court failed to state the reasons for the sentence, the court abused its discretion in failing to inquire into the reasons why appellee violated his probation, the court failed to order a presentence investigation report, and the court failed to consider appellee’s ability to pay the fines and costs imposed.</p>

On August 22, 2003, Judge Means heard argument. Appellee argued a <em>per se </em>ineffectiveness theory at the hearing, a theory that was not set forth in his written pleadings, <em>i.e., </em>he claimed that VOP counsel’s failure to file a motion for reconsideration was the equivalent of failing to file a direct appeal, and therefore, VOP counsel should be deemed ineffective <em>per se, </em>thus removing appellee’s burden to prove the actual prejudice required by <em>Strickland v.

The Commonwealth responded that classifying VOP counsel’s actions as implicating <em>per se </em>professional incompetence would be making new law. The PCRA court agreed that the failure to file a motion for reconsideration of sentence does not implicate <em>per se </em>ineffectiveness. Judge Means then dismissed the PCRA petition on the ground that appellee failed to prove actual preju- • dice resulting from VOP counsel’s omission because, speaking as the actual VOP sentencing judge, he would not have altered the sentence had a motion for reconsideration been filed.

The panel found that appellee’s claim that VOP counsel should have objected to the VOP court’s failure to state the reasons for the sentence imposed had arguable merit because Pa.R.Crim.P. 708 requires VOP courts to make such a record statement.

The court then summarily concluded that counsel’s inaction lacked a reasonable basis because it limited appellee’s options on appeal, and caused appellee prejudice because counsel “effectively waived [appellee’s] right to challenge this issue on appeal.” Accordingly, the panel found that appellee had “successfully established an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.” Super. Ct. Op. at 4-5. In sustaining appellee’s claim of ineffective assistance, the panel did not purport to depart from <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Pierce, i.e., </em>it did not indicate that it accepted appellee’s claim of <em>per </em>se/presumed prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[187,880,1156,793]]]'>After finding VOP counsel ineffective, the panel turned to what it called “the merits” of the defaulted sentencing claim, quoted the VOP hearing transcript, found that the VOP court did not state the reasons for its sentence, and ultimately concluded that it therefore was “constrained” to vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for resentencing. The panel confined itself to the failure to raise an objection premised upon Rule 708; it did not address appellee’s claim respecting other objections counsel could have made. Moreover, although the panel had recognized at the outset that appellee raised a layered claim of ineffective assistance, it failed to discuss the performance of appellee’s VOP appeal counsel in failing to pursue the claim of VOP hearing counsel ineffectiveness on direct appeal, but instead granted relief premised upon its finding respecting VOP counsel alone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The Commonwealth contends that appellee failed to prove that VOP hearing counsel’s lapse prejudiced him, and indeed, the absence of prejudice is demonstrated by the fact that Judge Means stated that he would not have reduced the sentence even if counsel had asked for reconsideration. Because the outcome of the VOP sentencing proceeding would have been the same even if counsel had timely complained about the court’s failure to state the reasons for the sentence on the <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>record, the Commonwealth contends, appellee’s claim respecting VOP hearing counsel fails for want of a showing of prejudice.</p>

The Commonwealth notes that the panel focused on the effect of counsel’s default upon the direct appeal, <em>i.e., </em>the fact that the default at sentencing led to the claim being unpreserved (as a direct review claim; it could have been raised as a derivative ineffectiveness claim) for appeal. The proper inquiry for <em>Strickland </em>prejudice purposes, the Commonwealth contends, is whether the outcome of the proceeding <em>before the VOP sentencing court </em>would have been different if counsel had filed for reconsideration. The Commonwealth notes that it is common for an attorney’s actions to limit the issues available for appellate review, but that fact does not render the attorney ineffective. Because the PCRA court specifically found that the result at sentencing would not have been different if counsel had performed what he is faulted for not performing, the Commonwealth reiterates, appellee’s VOP counsel cannot be deemed ineffective, and his derivative claim respecting VOP appeal counsel necessarily fails.</p>

A criminal defendant, the Commonwealth notes, may preserve sentencing challenges by raising them at the sentencing hearing itself, thereby rendering the filing of a motion for reconsideration optional. Moreover, even a failure to file a motion for reconsideration after failing to object at sentencing does not completely foreclose all appellate review, but only operates to waive issues relating to the discretionary aspects of sentencing. Appellate review of other issues is still viable, the Commonwealth explains, as demonstrated by appellee’s ability to raise claims challenging the validity of the revocation proceeding itself and the legality of his sentence. The Commonwealth concludes that this Court has specifically held that presumed prejudice does not apply in instances where counsel’s actions did not completely preclude appellate review, but “merely narrowed its ambit.” Appellant’s Brief at 18 (citing <em>Halley, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellee argues that although the presumed prejudice approach is appropriate here, he can also demonstrate actual prejudice arising from VOP counsel’s lapse. With respect to <em>Strickland </em>actual prejudice, appellee disputes the relevance of the trial court’s statement indicating that it would not have reduced the sentence if reconsideration had been sought. Appellee submits that the court’s hindsight analysis demonstrates that the court based the sentence on what the court, knew about itself rather than what it knew about appellee. Appellee further contends that, although Judge Means did say that he would not have altered the sentence, Judge Means could not possibly know what he would have done given the new factors he would have had to consider if appellee had sought reconsideration. Appellee goes on to suggest that he was subjected to “unwarranted and excessive punishment” and that the VOP court based the sentence on its “frustration” with him. Appellee contends that sentencing him in this manner was an abuse of discretion.</p>

Appellee alleges that he instructed his VOP counsel to file for reconsideration and counsel did not do so, knowing that such failure would result in the waiver of appellate claims that needed to be preserved by such a motion. Appellee then argues that his VOP appeal counsel knew or should have known that his appeal could not succeed due to the procedural default, yet did not assert that VOP hearing counsel was ineffective. Appellee argues that the <em>per se </em>prejudice approach is appropriate in instances affecting the right to a meaningful direct appeal. When an error is not <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>preserved, as his current claim was not, appellee contends, the result is “tantamount to a refusal to file a direct appeal.” Appellee’s Brief at 20.

The Superior Court faulted VOP hearing counsel for failing to seek to vindicate a Rule of Criminal Procedure, <em>i.e., </em>Rule 708(C)(2), which states that the VOP sentencing judge “shall <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>state on the record the reasons for the sentence imposed.” This Rule is not an end in itself, at least for the purposes of collateral attack. Requiring the VOP sentencing court to state the reasons for its sentence provides a procedural mechanism for the aggrieved party both to attempt to rebut the court’s explanation and inclination before the sentencing proceeding ends, and to identify and frame substantive claims for post-sentence motions or appeal. The Rule creates a procedural right of immediate, contemporaneous complaint if no judicial explanation was forthcoming. In a preserved-issue, direct appeal context, if the aggrieved party contemporaneously objects to a failure to comply with the Rule, as it is supposed to, and the court responds by still refusing to state the reasons for the sentence in violation of the Rule, it is proper for the appellate court to remand for a new sentencing procedure, even in the absence of the aggrieved party identifying something substantively erroneous with the sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Thus, in a direct review context, Rule 708 operates in a fashion which is not unlike <em>Cronic: </em>prejudice (or rather the absence of harmless error) will be presumed from the failure to comply.</p>

Derivative claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are analytically distinct from the defaulted direct review claims that were (or could have been) raised on direct appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.

This Court has long recognized the distinction between <em>Strickland </em>prejudice and the harmless error standard applicable in the direct review context, and this distinction can be outcome-determinative. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

A similar showing must be required here. To hold otherwise would encourage VOP sentencing defendants, who often have no legitimate substantive complaint since the proceeding emanates from a breach of the sentencing court’s trust, to remain silent at sentencing, in the hopes of securing “automatic” relief on collateral review on mere procedural grounds.</p>

It is clear from the transcript of the VOP hearing that Judge Means did not state the reasons for the specific sentence imposed. Indeed, the only comments made by the court were during an exchange with appellee that appeared to be concerned with the fact of the violation: <em>ie., </em>that appellee had been on the court’s probation since 1997 and did not turn himself in when he stopped reporting to his probation officer.

In analyzing the claim of ineffective assistance, the first point worth noting is that counsel did not raise the Rule 708 objection at the hearing itself. The proper time for a Rule 708 objection, if one was to be made, was at the sentencing proceeding. The point of requiring contemporaneous objection is to afford the tribunal an opportunity to remedy the error or complaint immediately. Requiring contemporaneous objection when Rule 708 is implicated is particularly salutary because the best time for the court to explain its sentence is at the moment of imposition. The Commonwealth, however, does not press an argument concerning whether the Superior Court focused on the proper timing of the objection perhaps because the fact remains that counsel raised no objection at any time before the VOP sentencing judge. Counsel certainly had grounds and opportunity to forward a Rule 708 procedural objection, and thus, we agree with the panel below that appellee’s underlying claim, if viewed broadly, has arguable merit.</p>

Appellee’s allegation that counsel “failed and refused” to seek reconsideration appears to have been conceded by the Commonwealth below only for purposes of its motion to dismiss, a concession which was not unusual since the motion was based upon a theory that there was no prejudice as a matter of law. However, the Commonwealth’s motion concluded with an “Answer” which stated that, “Defendant’s factual allegations and claims for relief are specifically denied.” Meanwhile, the PCRA court’s analysis was limited to an examination of prejudice and thus it did not specifically address the question of reasonable basis. On such a record, where VOP hearing counsel was never heard from and there was no finding by the PCRA court, it was premature for the Superior Court to conclude or assume that counsel in fact was asked and refused to seek reconsider<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>ation, and that counsel lacked a reasonable basis.

The Commonwealth argues that the Superior Court’s prejudice analysis misses the mark because the panel improperly focused on the effect of counsel’s inaction upon the VOP appeal, rather than looking to the outcome of the underlying VOP proceeding itself. The Commonwealth is correct. Although contemporaneous objections operate to preserve issues for appellate review, they serve an equally important function in obviating appeals by affording the trial court a timely opportunity to correct mistakes and/or to reconsider decisions. Whether VOP counsel can be deemed ineffective, then, depends upon whether appellee has proven that a motion to reconsider sentence, if filed (or more properly, a Rule 708 objection forwarded at the hearing itself), would have led to a different and more favorable outcome at VOP sentencing. In this context, the only way the proceeding would have been more favorable would be if counsel’s objection secured a reduction in the sentence. The Superior Court panel erred as <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>a matter of law in failing to appreciate the actual focus of the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice inquiry.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

We agree that appellee has failed to prove actual prejudice. On this record, there is no reason to believe that, if only counsel had asked for a statement of reasons for the sentence at the VOP proceeding, that statement of explanation alone would have led the court to reduce the sentence as well.

Moreover, much of appellee’s current argument focuses on disputing the VOP court’s global finding that none of the sentencing grounds alleged, if raised in timely fashion, would have led it to impose a lesser sentence. <em>See </em>footnote 9, <em>supra. </em>Thus, for example, appellee argues that it is impossible for the PCRA hearing judge to say with certainty what he would have done if faced with focused advocacy at the appropriate time. Given its resolution of the Rule 708-based claim, the Superior Court did not pass upon these additional claims. Accordingly, we remand the matter to that court to consider appellee’s remaining claims, reminding the court only that it must engage in a more precise analysis, and one that accounts for the layered nature of the ineffectiveness claims being pursued.

The Dissenting Opinion, like the Superior Court, focuses on the effect of the failure to raise the Rule 708 objection upon appellee’s prospects on direct appeal, and then relies upon the cases involving total defaults at the appellate level as if the situations were equivalent. There are multiple difficulties with this approach. If Rule 708 were designed as a trap for sentencing judges to be sprung by the aggrieved party for the first time on appeal, there might be something to this theory. But Rule 708 applies at sentencing. In virtually all cases, a timely Rule 708 objection at sentencing will remove Rule 708 as a viable appellate issue, since the court will respond with a record statement of reasons. And in a case such as this one, where appellee’s proper sentencing exposure exceeded thirty to sixty years, but he received a sentence of only four to eight years, it is highly unlikely that anything the judge would say would reveal a substantive abuse of his VOP sentencing discretion. The proper initial focus in assessing prejudice is upon the proceeding where counsel defaulted the objection.</p>

Furthermore, following <em>Grant, </em>almost all claims of ineffective assistance of counsel must be litigated only after direct review has failed to secure relief. Record-based claims of ineffectiveness always include an implicit element that the underlying defaulted claim is better than the failed claims litigated at trial and/or on direct appeal. If the Dissent’s theory — that prejudice must be presumed from a trial waiver if the “best” prospective appellate claim was defaulted by counsel — then the <em>Strickland </em>test for prejudice disappears as to record-based claims. Nothing in the Sixth Amendment jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, or this Court, supports such a drastic extension of <em>Cronic </em>and elimination of <em>Strickland.</em>

Restoration of appellate rights is the proper remedy where a defendant has been deprived of appellate review because of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Halley, </em>582 Pa. at 171, 870 A.2d at 801; <em>Liebel, </em><a href="/pa/573/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="573 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="197215" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0375-01">573 Pa. at 385</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="825 A.2d 630" data-case-ids="197215,9116632" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0375-01,/a2d/825/0630-01">825 A.2d at 636</a>.

Mr. Justice Saylor, in dissent, acknowledged his view that deprivations of such constitutionally-guaranteed rights require a presumption of prejudice without commenting that no such presumption is appropriate in a non-constitutional claim. I note this because the majority opinion here emphasizes that presumed <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>prejudice is inapplicable where the deprivation at issue is a procedural claim.

The majority speculates that there are practical reasons for not pursuing a Rule 708 objection, including the short length of violation of probation (VOP) hearings, the defendant’s weak position as a litigant in such hearings, and the vast discretion bestowed upon the court to impose sentence. Although it is obvious that a defendant's disadvantage at VOP hearings is frequently a result of his own actions, and that a sentencing court is vested with wide discretion in fashioning an appropriate sentence for those actions, the exercise of that discretion is quite simply not immune from review. The defendant has a right to explain to the sentencing court why the sentence imposed is not appropriate, and to appeal the exercise of that discretion to the appellate courts. Where the sentencing court abuses its discretion, the defendant may gain relief. Thus, beyond Judge Means’ assertion that he would have issued the same sentence one way or the other, Appellee was denied the benefit of the other purpose of Rule 708, which is to provide the appellate court with a record upon which it may assess the efficacy of the sentencing court's exercise of its discretion. Whether the defendant chooses to forgo that right is his decision and may be determined following the hearing. In my view, the unlikelihood of a successful challenge to the discretionary aspects of the sentence <em>at the hearing, </em>or <em>on reconsideration, </em>does not provide a reason to fail to preserve appellate review of those aspects of the sentence. An attorney’s obligation is to preserve his or her client's rights. Together, attorney and client may well decide against raising an appeal, but at least the option to do so remains.</p>
