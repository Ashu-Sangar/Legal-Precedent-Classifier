The officer suspected the men were gambling, in violation of Philadelphia City Code § 10-612(2). He approached, but appellee fled, despite the officer’s instructions to stop. The officer pursued appellee and attempted to apprehend him, but appellee punched the officer in the face and chest several times and got away. The officer gave chase and caught appellee again, but appellee kneed the officer in the groin, knocking him to the ground. While the officer was down, appellee tried to take the officer’s gun-with his hands on the gun, appellee threatened, “You’re done,” N.T. Trial, 10/24/00, at 26-27, but was unable to remove the gun. The officer eventually forced appellee to the ground and arrested him. Appellee was convicted and sentenced for aggravated assault on a police officer, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, and resisting arrest.</p>

Clearly appellee could be prosecuted for other crimes he committed while resisting an unlawful arrest, <em>see Biagini, </em>at 493, 499; his new criminal activity would establish cause to arrest him, lawfully, for these new crimes. The initial illegality does not give the arrestee a free pass to commit new offenses without responsibility. Neither does that initial illegality “poison the tree,” preventing lawful police conduct thereal'ter-the new crimes are new trees, planted by appellee, and the fruit that grows from them is not automatically tainted by the initial lack of probable cause.</p>

As noted, under § 5104, once a particular set of <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>circumstances gives rise to a lawful arrest, if there is ongoing resistance that meets the defined threshold in § 5104; thus, resisting arrest is implicated on the face of § 5104. A decision to foreclose a conviction in such circumstances because there may have been a prior attempt by police to effectuate an unlawful arrest would not be a direct application of § 5104, but would represent a judicial prophylactic rule.</p>
