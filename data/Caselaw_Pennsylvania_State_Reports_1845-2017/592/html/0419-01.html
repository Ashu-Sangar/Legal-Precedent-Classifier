In this regard, the common pleas court relied on <em>Hogan, Lepore &amp; Hogan v.

Township of Nether Providence, </em>124 Pa. <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>Cmwlth. 595, 601, <a href="/pa-commw/124/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="556 A.2d 947" data-case-ids="1385197" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/124/0595-01">556 A.2d 947</a>, 949-50 (1989) (holding that the term “hearing” includes specially scheduled sessions for argument by counsel). The court observed that the <em>Hogan </em>court derived support for this proposition from Section 908(5), which, in describing zoning hearings, prescribes that “[t]he parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel and shall be afforded the opportunity to respond and present evidence and <em>argument </em>and cross-examine adverse witnesses on all relevant evidence.” <em>Id. </em>at 290, <a href="/pa-commw/162/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="638 A.2d 464" data-case-ids="1458275,7363295" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/162/0282-01,/a2d/638/0464-01">638 A.2d at 468</a> (quoting 53 P.S. § 10908(5)) (emphasis added).

    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[307,1035,1155,953]]]'>Further, the court expressed the belief that its ruling in no way impeded the entitlement to timely decisions on zoning applications as provided by Section 908(9), since other terms included within Section 908 ensure the continued progress of serial hearings where necessary. Additionally, the court observed that, if it accepted the position that the September 30 hearing was the final one, the Board would have forfeited a significant portion of the forty-five days to which it was entitled under Section 908(9), which could have yielded a hurried decision, or one made without the benefit of significant legal argument. The court recognized that, under its reasoning, one alternative would be to measure the forty-five day window from the date on which written brief were due or received; however, it concluded that a meeting of the Board was necessary to constitute a hearing for purposes of Section 908(9). Thus, it determined that “the final hearing for § 10908(9) is the hearing after which no further substantive evidence or argument of parties or counsel is received.”</p>

In this regard, the court again relied upon <em>Hogan, </em>in which the Commonwealth Court set out an alternative waiver disposition. <em>See Hogan, </em>162 Pa.Cmwlth. at 291, <a href="/pa-commw/162/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="638 A.2d 464" data-case-ids="1458275,7363295" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/162/0282-01,/a2d/638/0464-01">638 A.2d at 469</a> (“even if Hogan otherwise would have been <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>entitled to a deemed approval of its special exception application, it waived its right to that deemed approval by failing to object to the previously announced argument date.”).

Concerning the waiver question upon which the majority grounded its holding, the dissent opined that Appellant was under no obligation to raise the question of the running of the forty-five-day limitations period before the Board. In this regard, the dissent observed that the matter of the forty-five day period was never raised by the Board solicitor, or anyone else for that matter, on the record of the September 30 hearing. Thus, Judge Friedman found it insignificant that neither Appellant nor her counsel objected to the scheduling of a Board meeting for deliberation purposes within the forty-five-day period. <em>See <a href="/a2d/887/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="887 A.2d 343" data-case-ids="8999473" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0343-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/887/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="887 A.2d 343" data-case-ids="8999473" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0343-01">at 350</a>. The dissent also distinguished <em>Hogan </em>on the basis that, during the last hearing in that case, all counsel were consulted concerning the application of the forty-five-day requirement, and acquiescence to a deviation was discerned from the record. <em>See Wistuk, </em><a href="/a2d/887/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="887 A.2d 343" data-case-ids="8999473" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0343-01">887 A.2d at 350-51</a> (Friedman, J., dissenting). Here, however, Judge Friedman noted that the Board solicitor did not suggest that more hearings would be needed after the September 30 hearing; rather, he simply announced that the Board would meet to deliberate and render a decision on October 22, 2003, a date only twenty-two days later. Because Section 908(9) is specific about the need for a written or recorded agreement by the applicant for an extension of time for the zoning board’s written decision after the last hearing in a matter, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 10908(9), Judge Friedman found no written or recorded waiver. <em>See <a href="/a2d/887/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="887 A.2d 343" data-case-ids="8999473" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0343-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/887/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="887 A.2d 343" data-case-ids="8999473" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0343-01">at 351</a>.</p>

Because the Board still would have had twenty-three days to issue a written decision, the trial court suggests that [Appellant’s] counsel needed to express his view that the forty-five days began to run from the September 30, 2003, hearing date. However, as the trial court itself noted, no counsel for any of the parties even appeared at the October 22, 2003, meeting, having been assured that their presence would not be necessary. Further, and more important, there is no case law that provides a duty to remind the Board of the forty-five day rule.

We agree, however, with Judge Friedman and President Judge Emeritus Colins that such a general rule is not appropriate, as the plain language of Section 908(9) controls over this judicial pronouncement. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a), (b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As previously noted, Section 908(9) allows for an exception to the forty-five day requirement where “the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an extension of time.” 53 P.S. § 10908(9); <em>accord Weber, </em>140 Pa.Cmwlth. at 183, <a href="/pa-commw/140/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="592 A.2d 127" data-case-ids="1417634" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/140/0177-01">592 A.2d at 130</a> (adopting a common pleas court’s conclusion that “[t]he code is specific about the need for a written or recorded agreement by the applicant for an extension of time for the board’s decision after the ‘last’ hearing in the matter”).</p>

However, in line with Judge Friedman’s rationale, we find no such extension or waiver presented on the record of this case. Here, nothing in writing or of record fairly reflects any kind of affirmative agreement on Appellant’s part to an extension of the forty-five day period. Further, at the September 30 hearing, the Board’s solicitor all but stated that the hearings on the matter were concluded. <em>See </em>N.T., September 30, 2003, at 133 (reflecting the solicitor’s advice, as follows: “So for those of you who can’t come back, you can have some assurance that <em>there’s nothing going to change about the hearing </em>” (emphasis added)). Moreover, the session for Board deliberations was scheduled well within a forty-five-day period following the conclusion of the evidentiary proceedings on September 30, with no contemporaneous suggestion that the Board did not intend to issue its written decision within such period. In light of this background, Appellant cannot be shown even to have been placed on fair notice that the forty-five-day requirement would be deemed by the Board to run from some later date, let alone to have expressed agreement with such an understanding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Initially, relevant provisions of the Municipalities Planning Code define the term “hearing” very broadly, as “an <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>administrative proceeding conducted by a board pursuant to section 909.1[, 53 P.S. § 10909.1].” 53 P.S. § 10107(b). Section 908, however, prescribes that a zoning hearing board “shall conduct hearings and make decisions in accordance with the following requirements,” to include that “[t]he parties shall ... be afforded the opportunity to respond and present evidence and argument and cross-examine adverse witnesses on all relevant issues.” 53 P.S. § 10908(5). None of these features was attendant to the October 22 meeting in this case. Although the Board considered the parties’ briefs at the session (which obviously contained “argument”), the briefs were not presented to the Board on October 22; rather, the protocol established by the Board solicitor was that the briefs were to be submitted in advance to him and circulated by him to the Board. Like Judge Friedman, therefore, we consider the circumstances to be similar to those presented in the <em>Weber </em>and <em>Quality Food Markets </em>decisions. <em>See Wistuk, </em><a href="/a2d/887/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="887 A.2d 343" data-case-ids="8999473" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0343-01">887 A.2d at </a>350 n. 7 (Friedman, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Weber, </em>140 Pa.Cmwlth. at 180-81, <a href="/pa-commw/140/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="592 A.2d 127" data-case-ids="1417634" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/140/0177-01">592 A.2d at 129</a>, and <em>Quality Food Markets, </em>50 Pa.Cmwlth. at 572, <a href="/citations/?q=413%20A.2d%201168" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="413 A.2d 1168">413 A.2d at 1169</a>).</p>

On this record, we conclude that it would strain the relevant statutory language to find that the Board’s October 22 session convened solely for purposes of deliberation and decision represented a hearing, or, again, that Appellant waived her entitlement to a decision within forty-five days after the final Board hearing on September 30.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

To the extent that <em>Hogan </em>reflects the general approach described in <em>Southeastern Chester County Refuse </em>that any failure to object to scheduling will result in a waiver, it is disapproved in line with our present reasoning. <em>Hogan's </em>rational is also questionable upon consideration of the portions of the record quoted in the opinion. The <em>Hogan </em>court found that the applicant "did ... expressly refuse to grant the Board an extension to the 45-day period in which to issue a written decision <em>after </em>the last hearing,” but that the applicant nevertheless waived its entitlement to a deemed approval by failing to object to an announced date for argument of September 19, 1991, that was beyond the forty-five day period.

There is nothing presented on the face of the <em>Hogan </em>opinion indicating that the zoning hearing board agreed to such condition; indeed, the board issued its written decision on October 28, 1991, more than thirty days after September 19. <em>See Hogan, </em>162 Pa.Cmwlth. at 287, <a href="/pa-commw/162/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="638 A.2d 464" data-case-ids="1458275,7363295" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/162/0282-01,/a2d/638/0464-01">638 A.2d at 467</a>.
