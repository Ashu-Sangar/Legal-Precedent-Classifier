The Board notes that Section 10-1080 provides that a school board may only remove an appointed superintendent for “neglect of duty, incompetency, intemperance, or immorality.” That restriction is contrary to the general and unrestricted power plainly granted by Article VI, Section 7 to remove a superintendent, like any other appointed civil officer, for any reason deemed appropriate by the appointing authority. The Board further contends that the decision of a school board to fire a superintendent involves the exercise of an essential governmental function constitutionally conferred upon a school board.</p>

As part of this scheme, PASA submits, the General Assembly logically provided for conditions addressing the removal of superintendents. According to PASA, the statutory scheme reveals a legislative intention to prevent the removal of a superintendent absent due process and proof of specific misconduct. PASA further posits that the limited job security thus statutorily provided to school superintendents is designed <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>to allow a superintendent to act as a source of independent professional advice to the school board. PASA notes that school superintendents are charged with monitoring academic programs to insure that state requirements are met and to report deficiencies to the school board and then ultimately to the Superintendent of Public Instruction if the deficiencies are not corrected. As a consequence of these duties, the superintendent is always in a position of potential conflict with the school board. In such a construct, it is essential to maintain the independence of superintendents; and, in PASA’s view, the limited job security provided by Section 10-1080 grants superintendents the independence needed to perform their statutory duties without fear of reprisal.</p>

The trial court focused on that part of the constitutional provision stating that, “Appointed civil officers, other than judges of the courts of record, may be removed at the pleasure of the power by which they shall have been appointed” (emphasis added). There is no dispute that appellant was a civil officer appointed by the School Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The trial court found that the constitutional grant of <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>authority conferred upon the appointing power to remove an appointed civil officer by the above sentence is absolute, thereby permitting no limitations on that authority. Section 10-1080, on the other hand, explicitly provides that superintendents and assistant superintendents may only be removed after a hearing, a specific type of notice, and only for neglect of duty, incompetency, intemperance or immorality. The trial court thus concluded that Section 10-1080 is unconstitutional because it places limitations on the otherwise absolute authority of the School Board to remove a superintendent, such as appellant, from office.</p>

The provision that such civil officers shall hold their offices on the condition that they “behave themselves well while in office,” and that they shall (not may) be removed “on conviction of misbehavior in office or of any infamous crime” contemplates an affirmative limitation (good behavior) upon removal. Thus, the authority to remove such officers cannot be said to be absolute. Moreover, that the power of removal is not unlimited is a matter of common sense, since none could seriously dispute that an officer cannot be removed for an unconstitutional reason, such as a decision premised upon the race or gender of the officer. We therefore hold that, as a matter of plain meaning, the Constitution does not vest in the appointing power unfettered discretion to remove. Instead, valid removal depends upon the officer behaving in a manner not befitting the trust placed in him by the appointing authority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

So long as the statutory limitations concern matters bearing on the officers’ “behaving themselves well while in office,” we see no constitutional restriction upon the legislative prerogative. Moreover, the limitations in Section 10-1080 square with the constitutional command. Section 10-1080 has both a procedural and a substantive dimension. The substantive limitations — conditioning removal upon proof of neglect of duty, incompetency, intemperance or immorality — are all related to the officer’s behavior while in office. Thus, we see no tension between the substantive limitation and the constitutional provision. The procedural aspects of the statute, envisioning basic notice and a hearing, likewise are not in conflict with the constitutional provision, as these guarantees simply provide a mechanism to ensure that a meaningful constitutional process occurs. Accordingly, we hold that Section 10-1080 survives constitutional muster.</p>

In December of 1935, however, charges were filed against Weiss that subsequently resulted in the school board’s decision to remove him from office. Weiss sought injunctive relief prohibiting the removal. The trial court recognized that, pursuant to Section 1061 of the then-applicable School Code, 24 P.S. 1061, a superintendent could only be removed “after hearing, by a majority vote of the board of school directors of the district, for neglect of duty, incompetency, intemperance, or immorality,” and that the evidence did not justify Weiss’s removal from office under that standard. The trial court nevertheless dismissed Weiss’s bill for injunctive relief because then-Article VI, Section 4 of the Pennsylvania Constitution — the materially-identical predecessor of Article <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>VI, Section 7 — provided that an appointed civil officer may be removed at the pleasure of the appointing power.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Article 12, section 1, provides: “All officers, whose selection is not provided for in this Constitution, shall be elected or appointed as may be directed by law.” The authority so conferred to provide for the election or appointment of other officers necessarily involves and implies legislative power to annex conditions of tenure.

As I read the first sentence of Article VI, Section 7, it appears that “good behavior” is a necessary condition of maintaining office, but not a sufficient one. Thus, it should not be understood to limit the at-pleasure removal power set forth in the second sentence. Therefore, I agree with Mr. Justice Eakin that the majority’s interpretation appears to render the second sentence of questionable significance. <em>See </em>Dissenting Opinion, at 215-16, 923 A.2d at 1168 (Eakin, J.). Indeed, the insertion of this sentence into Article VI, Section 4 of the Constitution of 1874 (from which the present Section 7 was derived almost verbatim) was debated at length, and the delegates who spoke in favor of it expressed their intent that it should preclude the imposition of any delay or procedural safeguards relative to an appointing authority’s ability to expeditiously remove an appointed official that was dishonest or otherwise unfit for office. They reasoned that the public interest required prompt removal powers without the invocation of potentially time-consuming procedural safeguards, and that this outweighed any potential harm occasioned by possible misuse of the removal power. <em>See, e.g., </em>Debates of the Constitutional Convention of 1873, Vol. VII at 561 (remarks of Mr. Littleton); <em>id., </em>Vol. VIII at 124 (remarks of Mr. White); <em>Id. </em>at 124-25 (remarks of Mr. Biddle).

If indeed Section 7 affirmatively permits the General Assembly to limit a school board’s removal powers in the manner stated, there is no apparent principled basis to support a different construction as to the Governor or any other state-level appointing authority.

However, although the board is also created by statute, its <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>removal power is conferred by the Constitution; therefore, any conflicting statutory provisions may not stand. <em>See In re Petition to Recall Reese, </em><a href="/pa/542/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="542 Pa. 114" data-case-ids="458354" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0114-01">542 Pa. 114</a>, <a href="/pa/542/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="665 A.2d 1162" data-case-ids="458354,7880491" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0114-01,/a2d/665/1162-01">665 A.2d 1162</a>, 1164 (1995) (legislation’s presumption of constitutionality can be rebutted where statute clearly, palpably, and plainly violates Constitution).</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[224,610,1156,1031]]]'>Turning to the language of Article VI, § 7, the majority reads the phrases “behave themselves well while in office” and “on conviction of misbehavior in office or of any infamous crime” as imposing an affirmative limitation on the board’s removal power, <em>i.e., </em>the board may only exercise its removal power if the superintendent “misbehaves.” <em>See </em>Majority Op., at 206, 923 A.2d at 1162. However, I interpret this language not as a restriction upon the board’s removal power, but rather as merely a condition imposed upon the appointee, who will certainly be removed for misconduct while in office. In addition to being removed for misbehavior while in office, the appointee may also be removed at the sole discretion of the board. Article VI, § 7 provides the appointing authority (the board) may remove the appointed authority (the superintendent) at its pleasure; to read circumstantial limitations into this broad grant of removal power is to eviscerate the constitutional grant of authority. The majority’s interpretation nullifies the meaning of “at the pleasure of the [appointing] power,” Pa. Const, art. VI, § 7, and permits the legislature to qualify the Constitution’s absolute grant of removal power.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>
