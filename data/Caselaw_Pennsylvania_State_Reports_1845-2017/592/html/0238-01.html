At 8:55 a.m., she came in contact with a man identified as “Boyer.” Officer Wallace asked Boyer if he had any pills for sale; Boyer indicated he did not, and that he needed to wait for a friend to get the pills. Boyer left the scene, returned 15 to 20 minutes later, and handed Officer Wallace eight Xanax<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> pills. Officer Wallace handed Boyer a pre-recorded $20 bill and asked Boyer if he could get her more pills. Boyer indicated he could, and Officer Wallace handed him a pre-recorded $10 bill. Boyer walked to a blue Pontiac, sat in the passenger’s seat, and spoke to the person sitting in the driver’s seat. Officer Wallace notified back-up officers that she believed a narcotics sale was in progress in the vehicle.</p>

He was also aware of the statement by Boyer telling Officer Wallace that he could get more pills and would be right back just prior to entering [[a]ppellant’s] vehicle.

This standard, therefore, contains three prongs: (1) the police must be at a lawful vantage-point; (2) the incriminating character of the object must be immediately apparent; and (3) the police must have a lawful right of access to the object. The court suggested that although this Court adopted the standard announced in <em>Horton, see Commonwealth v.

More specifically, the court stated that <em>Petroll </em>provides there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy for an object in plain view, and <em>Colon </em>suggests that, while the police might be prohibited from searching a vehicle once the occupants have been removed, they may nonetheless seize contraband that is in plain view inside the vehicle. <em>See McCree, </em>at 191 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

As articulated in <em>Horton, </em>prior to the finding of a valid warrantless seizure of an item pursuant to the plain view exception: (1) the police must not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the location from which the item could be viewed; (2) the item must be in plain view; (3) the incriminating character of the item must be immediately apparent; and (4) the police must have a lawful right of access to the item itself.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Boyer walked to a blue Pontiac, entered and sat in the front passenger seat of the automobile, and joined McCree, who was sitting in the driver seat of the automobile. Officer Wallace relayed this information to her back-up, Officers Cujdik and Kovacs, and instructed them to stop a male inside the Pontiac. Trial Court Opinion at 2-3; N.T.

As to the justification under Article I, § 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the lead opinion declines the Commonwealth’s offer to adopt the federal automobile exception as the law in our Commonwealth, but contends that we have adopted a “limited automobile exception” under Article I, § 8. The lead opinion goes on to apply this “limited automobile exception” in addressing the lawful right of access prong, and concludes that because the officer had probable cause to search the automobile, the police officer could lawfully access the interior of the automobile under the automobile exception.</p>

As such Officer Cujdik properly seized the pill bottle from under the seat cushion pursuant to the plain view exception to the warrant requirement.
