He arrived at the scene two minutes later and spoke to Appellee, who had been driving one of the vehicles. In doing so, he noted a moderate odor of alcohol about Appellee and observed that his eyes appeared “glassy” and that he had a staggered gait. The officer administered several field sobriety tests which Appellee failed to perform to his satisfaction. Accordingly, Appellee was arrested and transported to police headquarters for breath testing.

Thus, in the court’s view, a person of ordinary intelligence would likely be confused as to what conduct was prohibited, because he or she would not know the exact level of alcohol permitted in the blood while in operation of the vehicle. Furthermore, in the court’s view, subsection (a)(2) sweeps too broadly as it includes within its proscription the activity of driving with a BAC of less than 0.08 percent so long one’s BAC reaches 0.08 percent within two hours after driving, thereby criminalizing activity that would otherwise be lawful.</p>

Thus, to support a conviction under subsection (a)(4), the BAC reading obtained from the test was required to be extrapolated, or “related back,” to the time of driving. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Because, however, the police will not generally know when the driver’s BAC peaks, expert evidence was, in some instances, required to satisfy the Commonwealth’s burden of proof. This, in turn, led to disputes concerning whether or not expert relation-back testimony was always needed to prove the Commonwealth’s case, particularly as prosecutions were brought that subsumed evidentiary factors that varied from case to case — such as the time delay between driving and BAC testing, whether the test revealed a BAC substantially or only minimally over 0.10 percent, whether the defendant’s driving had been erratic, and whether there was testimony concerning the number of alcoholic drinks that the defendant ingested before driving.</p>

In particular, the court quoted a passage from the <em>Band </em>decision in which this Court faulted the former Section 3731(a)(5) for not requiring proof that the defendant exceeded a BAC of 0.10 at the time of driving, thus implicating conduct which had not otherwise been declared unlawful in Pennsylvania. In this respect, <em>Band </em>posited that, if a driver were stopped and detained before his BAC reached the 0.10 legal limit, and testing several hours later revealed a BAC above the legal limit, the defendant would be subject to criminal liability although the Commonwealth never proved that he drove while his BAC exceeded the threshold. Furthermore, <em>Band </em>determined that the addition of Section 3731(a)(5) had created confusion as to precisely what conduct was prohibited, since it would be less than apparent to the ordinary citizen whether the proscribed activity was driving with a BAC above 0.10 percent, or having a rising BAC that may be below that threshold level at the time of driving but meets or exceeds that level at the time of testing. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In the Commonwealth’s view, the General Assembly sought, through enactment of the new DUI statute, to unequivocally shift the focus of the prohibited conduct to the act of driving after drinking excessively, irrespective of the driver’s actual BAC level while driving. According to the Commonwealth, this new statutory scheme eliminates the presumptions involved in the statute struck down in <em>Barud </em>because the fact-finder is no longer required to draw any inference concerning the defendant’s BAC level at the moment of driving; rather, to show that the defendant drank “too much” and then drove in violation of the statute, the prosecution need only demonstrate that the individual’s BAC was at least 0.08 percent within a time certain <em>after </em>driving. The Commonwealth maintains that the Legislature acted within its authority in specifically prohibiting driving after drinking excessively, as opposed to having a certain BAC level while actually driving, as such proscription targets a public danger that undoubtedly follows from drinking excessively and then driving, particularly as the driver is unable to know with certainty when he will reach his destination due to the possibility of construction, heavy traffic, accidents, or other roadway obstructions. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 23. The Commonwealth additionally proffers that the new statute is salutary in that it: (a) eliminates “the battle of the experts in a quest for pinpointing the BAC level” at the moment of driving; and (b) removes the prior statute’s “deadly loophole” which made criminal liability depend upon fortuitous circumstances such as whether the driver was able to hurry home <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>before the alcohol was absorbed into his system, or whether an officer stopped his vehicle and tested him “a little ‘too soon’ ” before his BAC reached the legal threshold. This, in the Commonwealth’s view, cures any overbreadth problem that the prior law may have suffered from, and furthermore, makes it sufficiently clear to persons of ordinary intelligence that they must “count their drinks” before driving a car. <em>See id. </em>at 12, 23-24.

As set forth above, Section 3802(a)(2) states that an individual “may not drive” a car “after imbibing” enough alcohol “such that” he has a BAC level of at least 0.08 percent and less than 0.10 percent within two hours after driving. Hence, as noted, the <em>actus reus </em>is the act of driving after drinking a sufficient amount of alcohol, where a sufficient amount of alcohol, for present purposes, is that quantity which will cause the person’s BAC level to reach the statutorily <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>prohibited range within two hours after driving, regardless of the actor’s BAC level at the actual time of driving. <em>See generally City of Fargo v.

      <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>In surveying other state appellate courts that have dealt with this question, we find that virtually all have upheld the challenged law. The only exception is the Supreme Court of Delaware, which invalidated a four-hour rule contained in a statute similar to the one this Court declared unconstitutional in <em>Barud. See State v. Baker, </em><a href="/a2d/720/1139-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="720 A.2d 1139" data-case-ids="11814127" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/1139-01">720 A.2d 1139</a> (Del.1998). The <em>Baker </em>court initially reasoned that the enactment, as written, would allow a conviction even where the individual’s BAC level was elevated due to the consumption of alcohol <em>after </em>driving, whereas it was evident that the “evil” which the legislature sought to curtail pertained to the dangers of drinking <em>before </em>driving. <em>See id. </em>at 176-78, 923 A.2d at 1145-46. The court then observed that liability could be imposed upon a driver whose BAC was less than 0.05 percent while driving, but then rose to over 0.10 percent at the time of testing. The court found this to be irreconcilable with the statute’s independent prescription that evidence of a BAC below 0.05 while driving constitutes <em>prima facie </em>proof of not being under the influence within the meaning of the statute. <em>See id. </em>at 180, 923 A.2d at 1147. In the present case, because Section 3802(a)(2) expressly defines the prohibited conduct in terms of driving “after” drinking enough alcohol to reach the prohibited BAC level at the time of testing,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> and does not include a similar provision concerning <em>prima facie </em>evidence of innocence, we are more persuaded by the decisions of other jurisdictions that have upheld DUI laws similar to the one under review.

Traffic safety is clearly an important state interest. Accordingly, the State has a legitimate <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>interest in preventing people from driving after ingesting any substance that will render them incapable of driving safely at any time in the following several hours. When people step behind the wheel of a car, they have no certain knowledge of the time that will be required to reach their destination. Although they may have an idea of the time usually involved, they lack the clairvoyance necessary to forecast delays due to any number of common occurrences. We also conclude that promotion of the rising blood alcohol defense, and the concomitant practice of rushing to one’s car immediately after ingesting alcohol so as to get home before the alcohol is fully absorbed, is contrary to good public policy. Because drivers have little control over traffic conditions and delays to which they are subject, the state has a legitimate interest in prohibiting people from driving at the onset of inevitably impending intoxication. We find that [the Nevada DUI statute] is rationally related to this legitimate state interest, and is, therefore, not overbroad with respect to the rising blood alcohol defense.</blockquote>

In the Majority’s view, Section 3802(a) “represents a legislative enlargement of the prohibited conduct so that it is now unlawful, not only to drive while under the influence, but also to ingest a substantial amount of alcohol and then operate a motor vehicle before the alcohol is dissipated to below a defined threshold.” Majority Slip Op. at 15 (internal citation omitted). Unlike former Section 3731(a)(5), the Majority posits, Section 3802(a)(2) requires two elements: (1) “that the individual drove after drinking alcohol”; and (2) “that the amount of alcohol ingested <em>before </em>driving was enough to cause the individual’s BAC level to be at least 0.08 percent and below 0.10 percent within two hours <em>after </em>driving.” <em>Id. </em>The Majority concedes in a footnote that “similar elements could have been gleaned from the face of the provision struck down in <em>Band.” Id. </em>at n. 9. Nevertheless, the <em>Band </em>Court, we are told, “understood [former SJection 3731(a)(5) differently, i.e., as <em>not </em>defining a new offense with these two elements, but providing an alternate method of proving the pre-existing offense.” <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Majority concludes that, because Section 3802(a)(5) has redefined the offense so as to include these two elements and thereby shifts the focus away from the <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>individual’s actual BAC while driving, the reasoning and holding of <em>Bamd </em>do not apply here.</p>

However, I cannot reconcile it with <em>Barud’s </em>interpretation of former Section 3731(a)(5), which I find materially indistinguishable from the statute before us. To begin with, if the General Assembly had intended to redefine the offense so as to prohibit conduct in addition to merely driving under the influence, I suspect that it would have changed the name of the offense to reflect as much. Yet the heading prefixed to Section 3802 remains, like that of its predecessor, “Driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 3802; 75 Pa.C.S. § 3731 (repealed); <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1924 (instructing that section headings may be used as an aid to statutory construction).

Under former Section 3731(a.l), it was an affirmative defense to prove that the individual drank a sufficient amount of alcohol after driving such that his BAC would not have exceeded 0.10% at the time of the test but for such consumption. Instead of providing an affirmative defense, Section 3802(a)(2) establishes as an element that the individual drove “after imbibing” a sufficient amount of alcohol. The prosecution, of course, should have no problem proving this element through the testimony of the arresting police officer so long as the defendant fails to come forward with affirmative evidence of consumption after driving. Thus, the effect of the two statutes is indistinguishable: unless the defendant can somehow affirmatively prove that the fact that his BAC test results exceeded the maximum percentage was due to his consumption after driving, then he may be convicted of the offense. Under either statute, however, a person who drinks (or drinks to .08% excess) only after driving does not have fair notice <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>that he is committing the offense of “[d]riving under influence of alcohol.”</p>
