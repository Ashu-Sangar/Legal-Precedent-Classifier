    <p id="b361-10" data-blocks='[["BL_361.11",361,[199,1305,1155,743]]]'>On August 3, 2002, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department (the “Department”), announced that it was beginning a review process regarding the surplus and reserve levels maintained by the Pennsylvania Blue Plans, including Capital Blue Cross (“CBC”), Highmark, Inc. (“Highmark”), Hospital Service Association of Northeastern Pennsylvania (“NEPA”), and Independence Blue Cross (“IBC”). Upon analysis of some initial data submitted by the Blue Plans, the Department concluded that the Blue Plans collectively held substantial reserve and surplus amounts. The Department further found that there was a level at which accumulating additional surplus would be inefficient. Pursuant to this finding, the Department requested that the Blue Plans submit applications for approval of their reserve and surplus levels.</p>

Ins. Dep’t February 9, 2005). The Commissioner defined the <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>term “surplus” as “what a Plan has in capital after all liabilities have been deducted from assets.” <em>Id. </em>at 10. She then described three categories of surplus levels: efficient, sufficient, and inefficient. The Commissioner explained that if a plan was operating with a “sufficient” level of surplus, that plan should not include a premium for a risk and contingency factor in filed rates for the next calendar year. She announced that in calendar year 2003, Highmark, CBC, and NEPA operated within their “sufficient” surplus operating ranges, while IBC operated at an efficient level. <em>Id. </em>at 37. Observing that the Department received many public comments discussing the possibility of rate relief in the form of rebates or premium reductions, the Commissioner noted that retroactive rate relief was not an appropriate method of handling excess surplus:</p>

In their complaint, Appellants asserted causes of action grounded on breach of contract and unjust enrichment theories. Specifically, Appellants contended that the Commissioner did not fully approve Highmark’s and NEPA’s applications for approval of their 2003 surplus levels, as it found that both companies were operating with a “sufficient” level of surplus. Relying upon the Commissioner’s order, Appellants alleged that Highmark and NEPA should not have included a risk and contingency factor in their filed premium rates for 2004. Arguing that the Commissioner’s February 9, 2005 determination and order were incorporated into the contracts between Appellants and these companies, Appellants asserted that Highmark and NEPA were in breach of contract for failing to refund moneys received for any risk and contingency factor in their filed premium rates for 2004. In addition, Appellants contended that the companies had no right to keep any funds that they received relating to the inclusion of this factor. As Highmark and NEPA retained all funds that they received, Appellants concluded that the companies were unjustly enriched at their expense. As a remedy, Appellants sought a refund relative to the risk and contingency factor in the premium rates for 2004.</p>

The court determined that Appellants, while couching their argument in terms of excess surplus, were actually challenging the Commissioner’s determination that retroactive rate relief is inappropriate. The court indicated that the proper procedure for contesting the Commissioner’s determination was to appeal the decision pursuant to the Commonwealth Court’s appellate jurisdiction. The court noted that Appellants had previously filed such an appeal, <em>see City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/a2d/889/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="889 A.2d 664" data-case-ids="8994252" data-case-paths="/a2d/889/0664-01">889 A.2d 664</a>, in which it had held that Appellants did not have a protected property interest in their rates and, therefore, did not have standing to appeal the findings made by the Insurance Commissioner. <em>See <a href="/a2d/889/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="889 A.2d 664" data-case-ids="8994252" data-case-paths="/a2d/889/0664-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/889/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="889 A.2d 664" data-case-ids="8994252" data-case-paths="/a2d/889/0664-01">at 672</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Connecting Appellants’ lack of standing in that case to a lack of standing in the present one, the court stated the following: “[I]f [Appellants] lack standing to assert their challenge in the proceeding where it would properly be heard, their standing is not enhanced by bringing it in a <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>procedurally improper venue.” <em>Old Forge Sch.

The court further reasoned that even if Appellants had standing, and if the court treated this action as being filed in its appellate jurisdiction as an appeal of the Commissioner’s determination, the court would still have sustained the preliminary objections on the basis that Appellants’ complaint was untimely, as it was not filed within thirty days from the date of the Commissioner’s order. Finally, the court granted NEPA’s motion for counsel fees, reasoning that Appellants had engaged in “obdurate and vexatious litigation”:</p>

We view Highmark’s motion for attorneys’ fees as a separate “matter” from the court’s order dismissing Appellants’ complaint. As such, the Commonwealth Court was not precluded from deciding Highmark’s motion under Rule 1701(a). Treatment of Highmark’s motion for attorneys’ fees as a separate matter is supported by this Court’s recent decision in <em>Miller Electric Company v. DeWeese, </em><a href="/pa/589/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="589 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="2572055" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0167-01">589 Pa. 167</a>, <a href="/pa/589/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="907 A.2d 1051" data-case-ids="2572055,8937371" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0167-01,/a2d/907/1051-01">907 A.2d 1051</a> (2006). In <em>Miller Electric, </em>this Court concluded that a garnishee that was denied its entitlement to attorney’s fees under Section 2503(3) could appeal within thirty days of the date of denial, regardless of when the final judgment was entered in the underlying matter. <em>See Miller Electric, </em><a href="/pa/589/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="589 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="2572055" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0167-01">589 Pa. at 176</a>, <a href="/pa/589/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="907 A.2d 1051" data-case-ids="2572055,8937371" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0167-01,/a2d/907/1051-01">907 A.2d at 1057</a>. The Court reasoned that a motion for attorney’s fees under Section 2503 is connected to, but separate from, the underlying action. In this regard, the motion for attorney’s fees was not disposed of when final judgment was entered in the underlying matter. <em>See <a href="/pa/589/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="907 A.2d 1051" data-case-ids="2572055,8937371" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0167-01,/a2d/907/1051-01">id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/589/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="907 A.2d 1051" data-case-ids="2572055,8937371" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0167-01,/a2d/907/1051-01">907 A.2d at 1057</a>. Applying the reasoning of <em>Miller Electric </em>to the present case, Highmark’s motion for attorneys’ fees constitutes a separate matter that was properly addressed by the Commonwealth Court while the underlying matter was on appeal.</p>

Noting that Highmark moved for fees under both Sections 2503(7) and 2503(9), Appellants maintain that Section 2503(7) is not relevant here because High-mark has not asserted that Appellants engaged in “dilatory, obdurate or vexatious conduct during the pendency of a <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>matter.” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 2503(7).
