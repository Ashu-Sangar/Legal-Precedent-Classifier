Three categories of slot machine gaming facilities are authorized under the Act. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1801. A Category 1 license authorizes the placement and operation of slot machines at existing horse racing tracks; a Category 2 license authorizes the placement and operation of slot machines in stand-alone facilities; and a Category 3 license authorizes the placement and operation of slot machines in resort hotels. 4 Pa.C.S. §§ 1302-1305. Within Category 2 licenses, the Board is authorized to award two facilities in a city of the first class, one facility in a city of the second class, and the remaining two facilities in a revenue- or tourism-enhanced location. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1304(a)(1).

The Board concluded that PITG “is likely to maintain a financially successful, viable and efficient business operation, which would maintain a steady level and growth of revenue.” Adjudication at 21. Station Square objects to this analysis, asserting that the Board should not have looked at projected revenue in determining whether PITG was financially suitable for licensure. Contrary to Station Square’s argument, the Board in no fashion acted improperly when it calculated PITG’s projected revenues in determining PITG’s financial suitability. In fact, the Act requires the Board to consider projections of future revenue. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1313(e) (the Board shall determine whether “the applicant is likely to maintain a financially successful, viable and efficient business operation and will likely be able to maintain a steady level of growth of revenue to the Commonwealth....”).

IOC and Station Square both argue that PITG’s financial suitability is an “error of law”-type of claim. We are unpersuaded. IOC’s and Station Square’s arguments focus on the Board’s alleged failure to place proper weight on evidence that they believed ostensibly showed Majestic Star to be financially unstable. The essence of such an argument, however denoted by IOC and Station Square, is that the Board acted arbitrarily and with capricious disregard of the evidence. Accordingly, we will examine whether there was “a willful and deliberate disregard of competent testimony and relevant evidence [by the Board] which one of ordinary intelligence could not possibly have avoided in reaching a result.” <em>See Arena, <a href="/pa/510/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="510 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1796937" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0034-01">507 </a></em><a href="/pa/510/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="510 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1796937" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0034-01">A.2d at 20</a>.</p>

Board Brief at 24, citing R. 4679a (testimony of Denyse Miskin); <em>see also </em>Adjudication at 20. Furthermore, with regard to one of the more significant negative aspects of Majestic Star’s financial health, namely that it has a high leverage ratio, the Board countered that the Financial Suitability Task Force “recognized that ‘Majestic Star has shown that it can operate with an elevated ratio.’ ” Board’s Brief at 27 (quoting PITG FSR, R. 6744a).

The Board noted that the “capital markets are reasonably comfortable with [Majestic Star’s] financial profile” as Majestic Star has been able to obtain financing through the public debt market and bank market. Board’s Brief at 28 (citing Adjudication FF No. 66 at 20 and PITG FSR, R. 6745a). With regard to PITG in particular, PITG had obtained commitment letters fully financing the PITG project through all three phases of development. Board’s brief at 25, citing R. 4629a-30a. By focusing on whether the capital markets-neutral entities motivated wholly by their own financial self-interest-found Majestic Star and PITG to be worthy entities to which to loan substantial sums of money, the Board in no fashion acted in an arbitrary or capricious fashion. Thus, we conclude that the Board did not act arbitrarily or in capricious disregard of the evidence when it found PITG financially suitable for licensure.</p>

Subsequently, PITG amended its application, adding its own funding scheme for the Pittsburgh Penguins’ arena as well as redevelopment plans for the Hill District area of Pittsburgh. IOC expresses indignation over PITG being allowed to propose such an amendment. IOC asserts that PITG could have made similar proposals in its initial application but did not do so.

IOC rails against this conclusion and contends that its arena funding scheme was far superior to anything offered by PITG. In making this argument, IOC ignores the key component of the Board’s discussion of this point. Namely, the Board cogently stated that “[wjhile the issue of the arena and the Penguins remaining in Pittsburgh reflect on economic development and tourism and are an issue considered by the Board, the Board is not swayed that the Penguins are or should be an overriding factor in the Board’s decision.” Adjudication at 66; <em>see also </em>Adjudication at 61 n. 8 (the applicants’ primary focus before <a id="p692" href="#p692" data-label="692" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*692</a>the Board should have been on gaming and the proposed casinos; IOC’s devotion of a “substantial amount of time” to the Penguins arena proposal “detracted from what should have been the primary focus of the casino project and gaming.”).

For example, Petitioners contend that the Board’s alleged failure to act as a “prudent man” in awarding the Pittsburgh license constituted an error of law. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief for Petitioner (Station Square Gaming, LP) at 57 n. 33. The majority rejects this claim by stating that the Gaming Act’s requirement that the Board use the prudent man standard has no effect upon the review that this Court must undertake in determining whether the Board erred in the award of a gaming license. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 679, 927 A.2d at 242 (asserting that the Gaming Act’s directive to apply the prudent man rule “do[es] not channel this Court’s appellate review”). It would appear, however, that if it were evident that the Board failed to apply such a standard as required by statute, this would constitute an error of law, thus providing possible grounds for reversal. <em>See </em>4 Pa.C.S. § 1204 (stating that this Court must affirm the Board’s order unless it finds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Board committed an error of law). Under the facts of this case, moreover, Majestic Star’s troubled financial history does raise a legitimate question as to whether a “prudent man” would have selected PITG over its competitors for licensure. Still, as the majority points out, the record contains evidence of some positive indicators. For example, the financial suitability task force found that PITG had the resources to build its casino, and the Board determined that the project would be very profitable. Therefore, given this Court’s highly deferential review as prescribed by the Legislature, I must ultimately conclude that the Board’s actions did not constitute reversible error under the prudent man standard.</p>

The majority dismisses this argument by pointing out that, after six months, “the licensee may request to be permitted to operate up to 5,000 slot machines. Considering that the Board was calculating future revenues beyond the first six months of the casino’s operation, <a id="p695" href="#p695" data-label="695" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*695</a>there was no error in the Board utilizing the 5,000 slot machine figure.” Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 688, 927 A.2d at 247. This disposition seems non-responsive, as Station Square concedes that it is possible to <em>request </em>expansion after six months, but highlights that there is no way to know whether such a request will be granted.</p>

In particular, Station Square points out that the Board has taken the position that market conditions favorable to slots expansion are always a necessary precondition to expanding beyond 3,000 machines, and hence, there is no assurance that the Board will approve such a request. In its decision regarding slot licenses for Philadelphia, the Board stated:</p>

Based upon an examination of evidentiary records, the Board finds there is no significant difference in the revenue estimates. Riverwalk’s revenue generation estimates were based upon an assumption that 5,000 machines would be operational by the stabilized year. The number of machines is based upon that number for which financing was in place at the time of the hearing. The other casino applicants’ projections were based upon 3,000 machines because that is the number of machines in the committed-to phases of the building projects. Each of those applicants provided credible testimony that they would proceed to their subsequent expansion phase and increase up to 5,000 machines with Board approval if the market supports that expansion. <em>Even Riverwalk could not unilaterally expand from 3,000 to 5,000 machines without Board approval. The Board must approve that expansion.... Although they have the financing in place, if Riverwalk did not show usage and economic activity sufficient to support 2,000 additional machines, the Board would not be obligated to permit the expansion. </em>Likewise, if another casino demonstrated that 3,000 machines were utilized to such an extent that expansion was warranted, <a id="p696" href="#p696" data-label="696" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*696</a>then market conditions would warrant an expansion for their facility as well. <em>In sum, market conditions will dictate the number of machines over the 3,000 threshold number at any of the properties. </em>This was illustrated by testimony that more machines do not necessarily translate into more revenues if the market demand is not present for the additional machines.</blockquote>

    <p id="b748-5" data-blocks='[["BL_748.6",748,[324,957,1155,1004]]]'>While it may be difficult to reconcile the above reasoning with the Board’s comparative approach in the present case, it does not follow that the Board may not make comparisons based upon later stages of the submitted proposals which subsume more than 3,000 slot machines. The applicants each included phased augmentations moving beyond the 3,000 number, with the general expectation that the Board would take into account the circumstances of all phases of the proposals when making its decision as to which proposed casino would best serve the Commonwealth’s interests. Thus, regardless of the Board’s disposition in the Philadelphia matter, Station Square has little firm ground to maintain that, here, the Board was legally required to make its revenue comparisons using only a 3,000 slot machine basis for each applicant. Moreover, I do not read the adjudication as placing sufficient weight upon the revenue generation factor to support a conclusion that the Board might have reached a different result if it had assumed only 3,000 slot machines relative to all of the proposals.</p>

That is, this Court is not to apply the standard of care itself, but rather, to review whether the Board acted in an arbitrary manner or with capricious disregard for the evidence, a finding which could be supported by the Board’s failure to apply the prudent man standard of care.
