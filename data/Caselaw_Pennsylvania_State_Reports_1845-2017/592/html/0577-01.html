First, relying on <em>Commonwealth v. Barud, </em><a href="/pa/545/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="545 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="465078" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0297-01">545 Pa. 297</a>, <a href="/pa/545/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="681 A.2d 162" data-case-ids="465078,7859172" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0297-01,/a2d/681/0162-01">681 A.2d 162</a> (1996), the trial court indicated that the DUI statute is overly broad because it criminalizes conduct that is not otherwise unlawful, namely, driving with a BAC below the statutory threshold, so long as the driver tests above that level within two hours after driving. Additionally (and relatedly), the trial court interpreted Section 3802(c) as creating an improper “conclusive presumption” that, if the defendant’s BAC is above the threshold at the time of testing, then it must also have been above the threshold at the time of driving. This, in the trial court’s view, operated to relieve the Commonwealth of its constitutionally-imposed burden to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The Commonwealth filed a timely direct appeal to this Court, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 722(7) (giving the Pennsylvania Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final common pleas court orders that declare a statute <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>unconstitutional), raising two issues: whether the trial court erred in declaring Section 3802(c) overbroad for punishing constitutionally protected activity, and whether that court erred in concluding that the same provision is unconstitutional because it creates a mandatory presumption by relieving the Commonwealth of the burden of proving that the defendant’s BAC level was above the statutory threshold at the time of driving.</p>
    <p id="b632-5" data-blocks='[["BL_632.5",632,[305,712,1155,740]]]'>The two questions raised by the Commonwealth correspond with the two bases for the trial court’s decision, as discussed above. Both of these grounds depend upon the trial court’s interpretation of the DIJI statute as reflecting a legislative intent to criminalize the act of driving while the individual’s BAC level is above the statutory threshold. The correctness of such interpretation was an issue presented to this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Duda, </em><a href="/pa/592/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="592 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="3556578" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0164-01">592 Pa. 164</a>, <a href="/pa/592/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="923 A.2d 1138" data-case-ids="3556578,8311638" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0164-01,/a2d/923/1138-01">923 A.2d 1138</a> (2007) in which the common pleas court of Allegheny County invalidated Section 3802(a)(2) on a similar basis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Therefore, we held the present appeal pending our disposition of <em>Duda. </em>As our decision in that matter has now been announced, <em>see Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, it does not raise a conclusive presumption, and it is distinguishable from the statute invalidated in <em>Barud. See Duda, </em><a href="/pa/592/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="592 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="3556578" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0164-01">592 Pa. at 180</a>, <a href="/pa/592/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="923 A.2d 1138" data-case-ids="3556578,8311638" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0164-01,/a2d/923/1138-01">923 A.2d at 1147</a>. Furthermore, it survives rational-basis judicial scrutiny and is not overbroad. <em>See Duda, </em><a href="/pa/592/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="592 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="3556578" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0164-01">592 Pa. at 188-89</a>, <a href="/pa/592/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="923 A.2d 1138" data-case-ids="3556578,8311638" data-case-paths="/pa/592/0164-01,/a2d/923/1138-01">923 A.2d at 1152</a>. Although subsection (c) of Section 3802 employs a higher BAC threshold <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>than subsection (a)(2) (which pertains to “DUI-general impairment” rather than “DUI-highest rate of alcohol”), it is in all other respects identical to subsection (a)(2). The difference in the statutory BAC threshold is immaterial to the analysis employed in <em>Duda. </em>That reasoning fatally undermines the trial court’s disposition in the present case.</p>
