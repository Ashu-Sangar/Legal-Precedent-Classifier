Reportedly, the conversation was part of a three-way telephone call initiated by Ms. Brown and which included Ms. Brown’s boyfriend, who was incarcerated in the Allegheny County Jail. The recording occurred pursuant to the facility’s policy, under which all calls to or from inmates are preserved via audiotape.

Applying these principles to the present matter, the court concluded that the audiotape in question was a public judicial record for which the presumption of access had not been overcome and emphasized that the tape had been “played out in the open” during the preliminary hearing. <em>Commonwealth v.

Additionally, the court emphasized that there were serious questions as to the admissibility of the recording at trial due to a possible violation of the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5701-5782.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Given the likely inflammatory effect of the tape should it be broadcast and the fact that transcripts of the proceedings, including the contents of the recording, were <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>available, the court determined that access to an audio copy of the tape itself was not mandated.</p>

    <p id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[305,847,1155,1104]]]'>The Court granted WPXI’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal to determine whether an audiotape played at a preliminary hearing is a public judicial record or document to which the common law right of access attaches and, relatedly, whether the common pleas court abused its discretion in granting access in the present matter. As the court did not develop its reasoning with regard to the latter issue in its Rule 1925(a) opinion, however, we remanded the case for preparation of an opinion specifying the rationale, together with any necessary factual findings, supporting the discretionary component of its ruling. In this subsequent opinion, the court explained that access to the tape recording was presumed, as it had been played at the preliminary hearing. To overcome this presumption, the court observed that the Commonwealth must present compelling reasons warranting denial of access to the audiotape. <em>See Fenstermaker, </em><a href="/pa/515/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="515 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1806062" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0501-01">515 Pa. at 514</a>, 580 A.2d at 421. However, because the Commonwealth raised the sole issue of contamination of the jury pool, which could be adequately addressed by <em>voir dire </em>or a change of venue, and did not play the tape or offer it as evidence at the hearing, the common pleas court permitted WPXI to obtain a copy of the recording.</p>

Quite frankly, I do not believe the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court’s balancing analysis is more persuasive than the expression of view by the Honorable Justin M. Johnson, writing for the Superior Court majority below. I do not believe that disclosure of a copy of the recording, as opposed to the transcript equivalent, selves as “an important check on the criminal justice system, ensuring not only the fair execution of justice, but also increasing public confidence and understanding.” OAJC Op. at 282, 924 A.2d at 647. In my judgment, the effect on the public’s confidence and understanding has nothing to do with the tape vs. transcript issue, and everything to do with the context (or lack of context) in which the media ultimately elect to portray the matter. Further, I have difficulty believing that the tape does anything greater than the transcript to operate as a legitimate “check” on the criminal justice system, much less does it “ensure the fair execution of justice.” These openness concerns are more than adequately met by substantive access.</p>
