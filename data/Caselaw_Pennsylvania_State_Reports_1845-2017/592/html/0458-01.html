Appellant Robin Weaver is an East Lampeter Township police officer in Lancaster County. In 1991, he investigated the murder of sixteen-year-old Laurie Show. The next year, Lisa Michelle Lambert was convicted of the murder of Show. The conviction was affirmed by the Superior Court, and this Court declined Lambert’s petition for allowance of appeal. However, Lambert successfully petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>The district court granted Lambert’s <em>habeas </em>petition and ordered that she be released. <em>Lambert v. Blackwell, </em><a href="/f-supp/962/1521-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="962 F.

In the published opinion of the court, Judge Stewart Dalzell accused the officers of the East Lampeter Township Police Department, including Officer Weaver, of fabricating and destroying evidence and perjury. Additionally, during the proceeding, Lambert accused Weaver and two other officers of raping her. No charges were filed in connection with this allegation.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[290,1381,1157,304]]]'>The federal court’s opinion generated a great deal of media coverage and an influx of public commentary. Among such was a letter to the editor of the <em>Intelligencer Journal </em>of Lancaster, Pennsylvania authored by Brownstein. The following excerpt from the letter published on June 23, 1997 is at issue in this case:</p>

Of course, maybe Lambert just made up the whole story, knowing that five <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>years later Weaver would be arraigned for the sexual abuse of women and children.

In his complaint, Weaver averred that he had not raped Lambert and he was never charged with doing so. Further, he had never been arraigned for the sexual abuse of women and children. Additionally, three months after Weaver filed the initial compliant claiming that he had not been arraigned for sexual molestation, Brown-stein’s letter was reprinted on the “Free Lisa Lambert” website in <em>toto. </em>Brownstein then filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that Weaver failed to prove that Brown-stein had acted with actual malice. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed Weaver’s complaint with prejudice.</p>

With respect to the allegations that Weaver had been arraigned for the molestation of women and children, the court found that there was no evidence that Brownstein actually knew that his allegation was false, but rather he had merely confused Weaver’s name with the name of another officer who had been arraigned for those crimes. <em><a href="/a2d/875/1093-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="875 A.2d 1093" data-case-ids="8972681" data-case-paths="/a2d/875/1093-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/875/1093-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="875 A.2d 1093" data-case-ids="8972681" data-case-paths="/a2d/875/1093-01">at 1099</a>.

Brownstein claims that in this case, abuse of privilege was not even at issue. In order to survive summary judgment, Weaver had the burden of showing that Brownstein acted with actual malice, that is, with knowledge that his statement was false or that he acted with reckless disregard to its falsity, before republication could even be considered.

He argues that this independent determination is appropriate at the summary judgment phase, so that the trial court may act as a gatekeeper by making a threshold assessment concerning the presence of actual malice.

The Restatement instructs that, “Republication of a statement after the defendant has been notified that the plaintiff contends that it is false and defamatory may be treated as evidence of reckless disregard.” In this case, Brownstein received notice that his allegations were potentially false when Weaver filed his lawsuit and brought to Brownstein’s attention that he had not in fact been arraigned on sexual molestation charges. This notice would make any republication of the statement relevant to an inquiry of actual malice at the time of initial publication because it tends to indicate a disregard for the truth that may have been present at the time of initial publication.

Once a court rules that evidence is relevant to an ultimate threshold of proof, in this case actual malice, any question of weight requires an assessment of the credibility of testimony and is, therefore, a question for the jury. Such considerations, however, have no role at summary judgment where the focus is whether the proffered evidence, if credited by a jury, would be sufficient to prevail at trial. This brings us to the second legal question presented by this case of whether there are genuine issues of material fact that should be decided by a jury. The Superior Court found that there were no disputed facts. However, once it is clear that the republication is relevant, the record demonstrates that there is at least one fact in dispute that could support a finding of actual malice — the fact of republication itself.

Brownstein is correct that the court acts as a gatekeeper in a summary judgment posture, but this function is purely intended to prevent issues from reaching the factfinder when there are no material facts in dispute. Brownstein has conflated this gatekeeping function with the concept of independent appellate review of constitutional issues. As part of the scope and standard of review in constitutional cases, the United States Supreme Court has directed appellate courts to engage in independent review of the entire record to ensure that constitutional principles have been properly applied. <em>Times v. Sullivan, </em><a href="/us/376/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="376 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="379234" data-case-paths="/us/376/0254-01">376 U.S. at 285</a>, <a href="/us/376/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="376 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="379234" data-case-paths="/us/376/0254-01">84 S.Ct. 710</a>. In a defamation case where the inquiry involves the line between “speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>legitimately be regulated,” the Court demands fully independent review of the evidence adduced to avoid any “forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.” <em><a href="/us/376/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="376 U.S. 254" data-case-ids="379234" data-case-paths="/us/376/0254-01">Id.</a> </em>The United States Supreme Court affirmed this concept in <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., </em><a href="/us/466/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="466 U.S. 485" data-case-ids="6202607" data-case-paths="/us/466/0485-01">466 U.S. 485</a>, 499, <a href="/us/466/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="466 U.S. 485" data-case-ids="6202607" data-case-paths="/us/466/0485-01">104 S.Ct. 1949</a>, <a href="/us/466/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="466 U.S. 485" data-case-ids="6202607" data-case-paths="/us/466/0485-01">80 L.Ed.2d 502</a> (1984), stating, <em>“Appellate </em>judges in such a ease must exercise independent judgment and determine whether the record establishes actual malice with convincing clarity.” <em><a href="/us/466/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="466 U.S. 485" data-case-ids="6202607" data-case-paths="/us/466/0485-01">Id.</a> </em>(Emphasis added). Ultimately, Brownstein misapprehends the law when he suggests that this independent constitutional review should occur in the summary judgment phase. Rather, it is clear that the independent review is an assessment made by appellate courts only <em>after </em>the jury has made findings of fact, whereas summary judgment exists to stop cases from proceeding if there are no material factual disputes for the jury to consider.</p>
