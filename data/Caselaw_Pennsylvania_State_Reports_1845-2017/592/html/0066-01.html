      <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>Appellant, American Future Systems, Inc., doing business as Progressive Business Publications, publishes specialized “fast-read format” newsletters targeted to career-oriented individuals. These newsletters focus on business-related topics such as sales, marketing, advertising, financial management, business management, human resources, and safety and regulatory compliance. Appellant sells its newsletters through direct mail solicitations and a sales force of approximately 500 telemarketers from fifteen separate offices across the nation, and solicits 15,000 new subscriptions each week. The telemarketers call customers at their place of employment during regular business hours to offer them “no-risk” trial subscriptions to the newsletters. If a customer agrees to the trial offer, the telemarketer obtains the customer’s date of birth (excluding year) for verification purposes. According to Appellant, it confirms each order by sending a fax or email to its customer within twenty-four hours after the order.</p>
    <p id="b121-4" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[187,1246,1154,1086]]]'>The trial subscription includes two issues of the newsletter free of charge, but to cancel, the customer must write “cancel” on the first invoice. Invoices are sent monthly and, although they request payment, they do not state the cancellation policy and do not contain Appellant’s phone number. If the first invoice is not returned to Appellant with “cancel” written upon it and no payment is immediately forthcoming, Appellant sends a second invoice, not to the customer, but to the accounts payable department of the customer’s employer. Consistent with the trial offer, Appellant’s policy is to terminate, without further obligation, any subscription for which a cancelled invoice is received within six months after the initial phone call. After six months of non-payment, however, past-due accounts are sent to a collection agency. A typical annual subscription price is approximately $300.00, and ninety-two percent of the subscriptions are cancelled. Appellant has its headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania, and is owned by Edward Satell (“Satell”), who retains a 98 percent interest in the company. According to Satell, the company’s gross revenues have risen every year and totaled $29 million in 2002.</p>

In particular, Satell explained that Appellant records its telemarketers’ calls for training purposes, and, because Appellant collects customers’ birthdates, it can disprove claims of unordered merchandise. Satell also noted that, in view of the 15,000 new subscriptions received each week, the number of complaints that the Bureau receives is extremely small by comparison.</p>

The company sells its publications through telemarketing solicitations. It claims that it tape records telephone solicitations for quality control purposes. The company states that it obtains the ordering person’s birthdate to verify the order at a later date. According to the correspondence, orders are confirmed by fax within 24 hours, giving the orderer an opportunity to respond. The company claims it has a liberal cancellation policy permitting the customer to cancel anytime within the first three months of the telephone order and receiving a refund on all unsent issues.

Further, Appellant alleged that the Bureau failed to determine whether the complaints were representative of the company as a whole, considering the size of its business.

Other witnesses stated that Appellant had billed them for newsletters they did not order; the newsletters arrived in an envelope resembling junk mail, as did the invoices; the invoices did not include Appellant’s phone number or cancellation policy; after discarding such items believing them to be junk mail, they began receiving calls from a collection agency and were thereafter unable to cancel their subscriptions; and their subscriptions were only cancelled after they either complained to the <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>Better Business Bureau or had an attorney contact Appellant. <em>See id. </em>at 99-106, 118-22, 131.</p>

Because the Bureau is a consumer reporting agency, the court stated that the disputed publication clearly met this standard. The court additionally explained that, once it found that a conditional privilege applied, whether such privilege was abused was a factual question for the jury. <em>See generally Bargerstock v.

As for the plaintiffs burden of proof on that issue, the court referenced Section 600 of the Second Restatement of Torts for the position that the plaintiff must show that the defendant published the allegedly false and defamatory statement with actual malice (as opposed to mere negligence). On this topic, the court recognized that both the comment to the Restatement and the subcommittee note to Section 13.09 of the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instructions explain that, if mere negligence were sufficient to abuse a conditional privilege, the policy on which the conditional privilege was based would no longer be served. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 600 (1977), official cmt. b; Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instructions § 13.09, subcommittee note 2 (2003).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Therefore, the trial <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>court stated that it had correctly omitted any reference to negligence in its jury instructions regarding abuse of a conditional privilege, and had properly instructed the jury that the privilege should only be deemed abused if malice was proven. <em>See American Future Sys. v.

While the panel acknowledged that negligence may be sufficient to defeat a claim of conditional privilege where the plaintiff is a private figure and the speech does not involve a matter of public concern, it indicated that statements on topics involving a recognized public interest are at the heart of the First Amendment’s protections. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. I (“Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.... ”). Thus, the panel ultimately agreed with the trial court that malice was required to abuse the conditional privilege in the present case, because the Better Business Bureau’s statements pertained to consumer complaints about Appellant’s sales practices, which the panel deemed to touch upon a matter of public concern. <em>Cf.

Since these were the topics of the contested statements issued by the Better Business Bureau, Appellant argues that any comparison between the present matter and <em>NFCR </em>is misplaced, particularly as <em>NFCR </em>premised its holding on the fact that the plaintiff had employed its advertising campaign to highlight its careful use of donated funds, which was the very topic of the contested report in that matter. In this regard, Appellant also points out that the Fourth Circuit has since clarified that the designation of NFCR as a limited-purpose public figure was based, not only on the fact of extensive promotional advertising, but upon a “direct relationship between the promotional message and the subsequent defamation (indicating plaintiffs pre-existing involvement in the particular matter of public concern and controversy).” <em>Blue Ridge Bank v.

While we recognize, as Appellant argues, that <em>Blue Ridge Bank </em>limited <em>NFCR’s </em>holding to cases in which there is, <em>inter alia, </em>a subject-matter nexus between the content of the plaintiffs public solicitations and advertisements on the one hand, and the allegedly defamatory report at issue on the other, we believe that such is the case here. For present purposes, we may assume that Appellant is correct in asserting that its telephone solicitors neither promoted its business performance record nor denied that consumers occasionally complain about its order-cancellation policy. Nevertheless, it is undisputed that the telemarketers touted the cancellation policy and the purported lack of any risk in ordering a subscription; the Bureau’s reports had at their core these same issues, as they reflected consumer complaints regarding such things as Appellant’s alleged failure to honor cancellation requests and its decision to omit its phone number or cancellation policy from its invoices, thus depriving the employer’s corporate offices (which may not know whether the order is valid, <em>see, e.g., </em>N.T. October 9, 2003, at 139) of a readily available means to request cancellation or inquire as to the validity of the invoice. Accordingly, here, as in <em>NFCR, </em>there is a subject-matter overlap between the promotional message and the allegedly defamatory speech. This, in turn, militates in favor of a determination that Appellant became a public figure for the limited purpose of commenting upon its sales practices under the <em>NFCR/Blue Ridge Bank </em>framework.</p>

Its campaign employed a force of 500 telemarketers at fifteen locations throughout the country to solicit 15,000 customers each week. Appellant’s telemarketing director testified that these employees made approximately 25 million phone calls per year and actually spoke with 2.2 million business executives annually. <em>See </em>N.T. October 7, 2003, at 138-39.

As a result of these practices, hundreds of complaints were sent to the Better Business Bureau, and the statements of the Better Business Bureau were limited to reporting its receipt of such complaints and concluding that Appellant’s business record was “unsatisfactory” on the basis of this pattern of complaints. Thus, we find that Appellant’s national sales campaign and its “no-risk” offer resulted in a controversy concerning the authenticity of such practices, which invited comment regarding those aspects of its business.</p>
