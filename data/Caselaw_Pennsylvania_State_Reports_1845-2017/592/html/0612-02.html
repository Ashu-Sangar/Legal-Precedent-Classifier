The Board issued orders related to approximately eighty of these vehicles concluding that many of the requested refunds were time-barred under Section 3003.1(a).

Appellant asserted that application of the limitations period violated due <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>process by reducing the amount of time in which it could seek a tax refund and, in some cases, eliminating its ability to do so altogether.

Appellant therefore urged the court to utilize the doctrine of equitable tolling to permit its refund petitions to go forward.</p>

Here, several of Appellant’s vehicle repurchases occurred after the three-year time limit had expired and before Appellant’s right to a refund accrued. Appellant was therefore without recourse under the refund statute. In such circumstances, it seems to me that the procedural due process concerns raised by Appellant are at least facially present.

The Board has subsequently issued decisions regarding Appellant’s other refund claims, determining that many of them were also time-barred. Appellant appealed these decisions to the Board of Finance and Revenue, which stayed them pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>

I offer this perspective primarily as I believe that various judicial decisions categorizing statutory provisions as periods of repose versus limitations are sometimes confusing and inconsistent. <em>See, e.g., Romaine, </em><a href="/pa/587/0471-02" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="587 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="3466937,3467766" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0471-02,/pa/587/0471-01">587 Pa. at 489</a>, <a href="/pa/587/0471-02" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="901 A.2d 477" data-case-ids="3466937,8415823" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0471-02,/a2d/901/0477-01">901 A.2d at 487</a> (Saylor, J., concurring) (observing that the <em>Romaine </em>Court majority effectively recast as a statute of repose a provision that was previously understood as a statute of limitations, without reference to the previous decisions).</p>

As noted, the record consists primarily of a stipulation of facts delineating the dates on which Appellant repurchased several of the automobiles in question and the corresponding dates on which it filed <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>refund petitions for those vehicles. It shows that three of the buy-backs occurred after expiration of the time limit. <em>See </em>Reproduced Record at 39a, 56a. The stipulation, however, provides no background information regarding the course of the underlying litigation, including due diligence on the part of Appellant and/or its agents or affiliates.</p>
