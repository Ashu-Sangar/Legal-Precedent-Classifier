Briefly, Appellant presented testimony from a medical doctor who studies birth defects, a neuropsychologist, and an educator and learning disabilities specialist, all of who concluded that he is mentally retarded. Several of the witnesses traced Appellant’s condition to fetal alcohol syndrome, a debilitating condition resulting from maternal alcohol consumption and characterized by impairments in the development of the brain. The witnesses highlighted that Appellant had been identified as a mentally retarded person in the elementary school system and was always placed in special education classes, with a recorded notation of an IQ score of 67 and his psychological record placing him below the third percentile for academic performance. Multiple adaptive deficits were discussed, including impairments in learning, executive function, problem-solving, memory, intellectual skills, work skills, communications, functional academics, health, safety, self-direction, and attention. The expert testimony indicated that Appellant functions at a second-to-third grade level, demonstrates an inability to manage money, and lacks the capacity to hold a steady job or maintain stable relationships. Various of the deficits, including those in academic skills and self-direction, were described as severe. One expert reported an IQ test score of 81 but indicated that this was not a true score, and it was a consensus of the defense experts that Appellant’s IQ was 70 to 75 or below. Appellant also presented testimony from two of his secondary school teachers, who explained that he was properly placed in the special education program, as he could not function in a regular classroom. Finally, Appellant presented affidavits from several other experts that were consistent with the live testimony. <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>These were admitted into evidence, although the Commonwealth did not agree to their veracity.</p>
    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[204,402,1156,727]]]'>The Commonwealth offered testimony from a board-certified forensic psychologist who concluded that Appellant had an IQ of approximately 74 and did not fall within the DSM-IV classification for mental retardation. The Commonwealth’s expert conceded, however, that Appellant was severely impaired. He also acknowledged that an IQ test score of between 70 and 75 could indicate mental retardation, depending on the degree of adaptive deficits. It was his opinion, however, that Appellant functions in a borderline range, and his adaptive deficits are not so significant as to implicate mental retardation. Further, the expert explained that school systems in the past had sometimes used relaxed criteria for mental retardation to facilitate the provision of educational services.</p>
    <p id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.6",469,[205,1161,1152,460]]]'>The PCRA court did not find a great deal of difference in the testimony of the witnesses, except in terms of their ultimate conclusions. As between Appellant’s and the Commonwealth’s respective experts, the court noted that the real difference was the significance of the level of Appellant’s cognitive abilities and adaptive functioning. Considering the DSM-IV and AAMR standards, the PCRA court found that the adaptive skills and behaviors in relation to Appellant’s IQ indicated mental retardation.</p>

Dougherty, PhD., that Appellant “was identified actually in the first grade as being mentally retarded by the school system”).

      <em>See id. </em>at 60, 118-19. Given that Appellant’s IQ is apparently above 70, this is a close case; however, both parties agree that it is possible for a person with an IQ ranging from 70 to 75 to suffer from mental retardation, depending upon the degree of adaptive deficits. In this regard, the testimony of Appellant’s expert witnesses was consistent with the PCRA court’s understanding that, in Appellant’s case, such deficits were on a scale supporting the finding of mental retardation. Appellant was evaluated, <em>inter alia, </em>via a formal assessment instrument called the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, identifying severe deficits in functional academic skills, self-direction, and work skills, as well as significant impairments in other areas, which, according to the expert testimony, meet the criteria for mental retardation in terms of severe impairment in at least two out of ten identified areas of adaptive skills and behaviors. <em>See </em>N.T., April 24, 2004, at 95-98; <em>see also id. </em>at 100 (testimony of Edward J. Dougherty, PhD., that Appellant, at 48 years of age, functions at a third-grade level and at a mental age of a nine-year-old child). Again, Appellant’s three testifying mental health experts specifically opined that he meets the criteria for mental retardation under the DSM-IV and AAMR standards. <em>See id. </em>at 20, 59,120-21.</p>
