Specifically, Walls’ granddaughter would sleep on the floor of her grandparents’ bedroom on a bed made of piled blankets. On certain occasions when the victim’s grandmother awoke and left the bedroom, Walls would leave his bed and lie down next to his granddaughter and sexually assault her. Typically after lying next to his granddaughter, Walls would pull down his pajamas and underpants and rub her vagina and anus. He would then place his erect penis between her legs and/or up against her vagina and anus and then often proceed to penetrate his granddaughter either vaginally or anally until reaching climax. Walls may have also improperly touched his granddaughter in his wood-shop and in his automobile while his wife was in a store. After a report of abuse was made to the police, an investigation ensued during which Walls purportedly admitted that he had sexually assaulted his granddaughter several times. Walls was charged with a variety of counts relating to sexual abuse of a minor.</p>

Walls received the statutory maximum for each offense, which was ten to twenty years of imprisonment. Thus, the sentencing court imposed a sentence outside of the sentencing guidelines. With respect to the incest count, Walls received a sentence of one to ten years of imprisonment, a sentence within the standard range. All sentences were ordered to run consecutively. Walls filed a motion to modify sentence which was denied on April 22, 2003. Walls then appealed to the Superior Court.</p>

The sentencing court found that the factors which led to the maximum sentences were legal, that the reasons for the sentence were stated on the record, and that this statement of reasons on the record reflected consideration of the nature of the sentence.</p>

At that time, sentencing guide<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>lines were formulated which, according to the Superior Court, restricted sentencing discretion and increased appellate review of sentences.

The Superi- or Court proceeded to reject the factors which led the sentencing court to deviate from the guidelines. Specifically, the Superior Court found that the fact that Walls held a position of trust and was responsible for caring for the victim, are factors not uncommon in cases of this type. With respect to the tender age of the victim, the Superior Court noted that the crime itself made a distinction with respect to certain classes of victims, such as minors and the elderly, and thus, the sentencing guidelines reflect the Crimes Code’s provision of greater punishment of certain crimes committed against cer<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>tain victims.

Simply stated, the sentencing court sentences flesh-and-blood defendants and the nuances of sentencing decisions are difficult to gauge from the cold transcript used upon appellate review. Moreover, the sentencing court enjoys an institutional advantage to appellate review, bringing to its decisions an expertise, experience, and judgment that should not be lightly disturbed. Even with the advent of the sentencing guidelines,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the power of sentencing is a function to be performed by the sentencing court. <em>Ward, </em><a href="/pa/524/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="524 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1822842" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0048-01">568 A.2d at 1243</a>.

While a general understanding of unreasonableness is helpful, in this context, it is apparent that the General Assembly has intended the concept of unreasonableness to be a fluid one, as exemplified by the four factors set forth in Section 9781(d) to be considered in making this determination. Indeed, based upon the very factors set out in Section 9781(d), it is clear that the General Assembly intended the concept of unreasonableness to be inherently a circumstance-dependent concept that is flexible in understanding and lacking precise definition. <em>Cf.

Consultation of the guidelines will assist in avoiding excessive sentences and further the goal of the guidelines, viz., increased uniformity, certainty, and fairness in sentencing. Guidelines serve the laudatory role of aiding and enhancing the judicial exercise of judgment regarding case-specific sentencing. Guidelines may help frame the exercise of judgment by the court in imposing a sentence. Therefore, based upon the above, we reaffirm that the guidelines have no binding effect, create no presumption in sentencing, and do not predominate over other sentencing factors — they are advisory guideposts that are valuable, may provide an essential starting point, and that must be respected and considered; they recommend, however, rather than require a particular sentence. So the Superior Court erred to the extent that it understood that the sentencing court was bound by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See also Commonwealth v.

As noted by the Commonwealth, the suggestion of a parsimony requirement with respect to sentencing is refuted by the General Assembly’s excising of the language requiring a mini<a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>mum sentence from the Sentencing Code. Prior to its 1978 amendment, the Sentencing Code at 18 Pa.C.S. § 1321 (b), now found at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9721(b), provided that offenders receive the “minimum amount of confinement that is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense, and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant.” In 1978, however, the Code was amended by deleting the “minimum amount of’ language to now only require that confinement be consistent with concern for public protection, the gravity of offense and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant. Thus, under the current Sentencing Code there is no requirement that a sentencing court’s imposition of sentence must be the minimum possible confinement and any suggestion by the Superior Court to the contrary is hereby rejected.</p>

Moreover, the Commonwealth noted the fact that the victim was entrusted to Walls’ care was not subsumed within the sentencing guidelines and was therefore a legitimate reason to impose an above-guideline sentence.

As noted by the Commonwealth, the sentencing court considered a number of factors which led it to sentence outside of the guidelines and these factors were specific to Walls.

While the Superior Court found that this factor could not justify the sentence in this case, in light of the deferential standard of review, we disagree. Additionally, we agree with the Commonwealth that Walls has offered no legitimate basis to presume that these factors, the victim being entrusted to Walls’ care and was his granddaughter, are subsumed within the sentencing guidelines. Thus, we conclude that the findings upon which Walls’ sentence was based were legally permissible. As to the sentencing guidelines, they set forth a standard range sentence of sixty to sixty-six months of imprisonment and an aggravated range sentence of <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>sixty-six to seventy-eight months of imprisonment. Walls’ sentence exceeded those guidelines. While the guidelines are an important factor in sentencing, they are but only one factor when determining individualized sentences.

However, I write separately to express my concern regarding the Majority’s decision to “decline to fashion any concrete rules as to the unreasonableness inquiry for a sentence that falls outside of applicable guidelines.” Majority Op. at 568, 926 A.2d at 964. I fear that the decision will be interpreted to provide near limitless discretion for trial courts in the sentencing context. The Majority’s decision may indeed negate the intended effect of the guidelines, which, as the Majority acknowledges, “were designed to bring greater rationality and consistency to sentences and to eliminate unwarranted disparity in sentencing.” Majority Op. at 565 n. 3, 926 A.2d at 961-62 n. 3. While I fully agree that the sentencing guidelines are merely guidelines, rather than requirements, the General Assembly’s enactments nonetheless require trial courts to provide reasons in support of any deviation from the guidelines, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9721(b), and require appellate courts to vacate sentences deemed unreasonable, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9781. These provisions require an appellate court to determine whether the reasons given by a trial court provide a reasonable rationale for deviating from the guidelines. An appellate court should vacate a sentence where the trial court provides no basis, or an unreasonable basis, for the deviation.</p>
