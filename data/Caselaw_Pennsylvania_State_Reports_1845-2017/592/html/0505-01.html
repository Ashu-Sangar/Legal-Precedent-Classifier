In reaching this conclusion, the Board has examined and weighed the various factors cited above. However, there were several factors that, in the Board’s opinion, made HSP and Philadelphia Entertainment’s projects stand out above the remaining applicants. First, both HSP and Philadelphia Entertainment are located on the riverfront and have excellent design plans for their facilities. Neither have riparian rights issues because if they are not successful in securing riparian rights, they both have alternate plans to build quality facilities without the need for these rights. The synergy provided by the riverfront locations and the proximity to Center City and the downtown area were positive factors.</blockquote>

Both locations are largely separated from primary residential areas by Interstate 95 and it is anticipated that a significant amount of the patrons coming to the casinos will use Interstate 95 to access the sites. In addition, siting one location in the North Delaware Avenue corridor and the other location farther south and below the Ben Franklin Bridge, will spread out the patron traffic and avoid the traffic congestion that having two casino sites located close together would invariable [sic] bring to Philadelphia.</blockquote>

Likewise, the Board finds applicants without Atlantic City connections are more strongly motivated to compete directly against the Atlantic City competition because they have no interest in diverting patrons to the casino which has a better tax structure for the casino.

The Act assigned the task of accommodating the new industry to the newly-created Board, which consisted of seven members: three appointed by the Governor and four appointed by legislative leaders (one each by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, and the Minority Leader of the House). <em><a href="/citations/?q=250%20A.2d%20172" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="250 A.2d 172">Id.</a> </em>§ 1201(a), (b).

In particular, I will address three of appellant’s inter-related complaints: (1) that the Board illegally deliberated in a non-public executive session, in violation of the Sunshine Act, 65 Pa.C.S. § 704; (2) that the Board’s finding concerning the feasibility of two casino sites on North Delaware Avenue was arbitrary and capricious, as it was premised upon a controlling “concern” that the Board never identified to appellant Riverwalk at a time when appellant could have addressed the concern; and (3) that the private deliberation process was tainted by the incomplete recusal of Board members.

On the other hand, there was nothing to prevent the Board from opening up its processes and deliberations more, and such a policy of openness may well have avoided the procedural complaints now at issue in this matter — complaints exposed only after the Board announced its licensing decisions and, still later, articulated for the first time the reasons for its decision in its loquacious 113-page adjudication. Nor did the Board adopt the equivalent of a post-verdict procedure so that a party, once finally provided with the Board’s reasoning and explanation for the licensing decisions it reached in private deliberations, might bring procedural and substantive complaints to the Board’s attention.

Appellant notes that the Board’s adjudication revealed that it deemed this factor — the traffic impact of two casinos on North Delaware Avenue — to be a disqualifying one for the proposal of two casinos in that locality. <em>See </em>Riverwalk’s Brief at 25 (“According to the Board, ‘if the Board approved one of the North Delaware Avenue locations for a license, then the Board is constrained to eliminate the two other locations in the same general vicinity for reasons of traffic management as discussed below [in the Adjudication].’ ”) (quoting Adjudication at 83). Appellant complains that the Board reached this dispositive conclusion, which reduced appellant’s prospect for obtaining a license by half, without any affirmative evidence that additional traffic problems would occur if two licenses were awarded in the northern corridor.

Respectfully, the Adjudication says otheiwise. The Board flatly declared that, if it “approved one of the North Delaware Avenue locations for a license, then the Board is constrained to eliminate the two other locations in the same general vicinity for reasons of traffic management.” Adjudication at 83. That clearly constitutes a dispositive conclusion. The Board repeatedly referred to its not receiving evidence to address its concern in this regard, a concern which significantly reduced the chances of each of the North Delaware Avenue applicants, as they were effectively competing for one license, not two. Since the Board’s actual deliberations were not held before the public, we have only its Adjudication by which to assess the role this factor played in its final licensing decision. Taking the Board at its word, I believe that due process requires a remand to allow appellant to address the Board’s late-disclosed, dispositive concern, which I view as an error of law.</p>

Viewing the issue in isolation, and given the structure in which the statute is drafted, and the fact that the licensing votes were unanimous, I would tend to agree that the failure of conflicted Board members to recuse from the entirety of the deliberation was harmless. In addition, Chairman Decker and Commissioner Marshall made clear that their recusals were in an abundance of caution, to avoid even the appearance of any <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>impropriety. But the broader question is what concerns me: what is the proper scope of a recusal when a comparative, rather than a distinct and absolute, decision is being deliberated? I respectfully disagree with the notion that a selective recusal is sufficient in such a situation.</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[309,559,1155,1370]]]'>For purposes of addressing that legal question, we should take the fact of recusal at face value: <em>i.e., </em>the member recused because, as to that applicant, his or her objectivity could reasonably be questioned. Selective recusal does not eliminate the possibility of taint. A vote, or an argument or position, made in confidential deliberations against an applicant obviously operates to the good of the other applicants, and vice versa. Take, for example, a situation where an actual conflict exists, and say that the board member had a financial stake in one of the proposed casinos. Even if the member selectively recused from the deliberations and voting as to that applicant, he could in theory advance that applicant’s chances, and his own financial interests, by opposing other applicants. Being privy to all other deliberations, the conflicted member could assess the relative prospects of other candidates, and then cast his lot in such a way as to maximize the prospects for the entity in which he had an interest. Private deliberations, such as were engaged in by the Board here, facilitate the potential for taint even further. Thus, in my view, when recusal is required in a situation involving a comparative assessment of multiple candidates, recusal should be required as to all deliberations affecting the prospects of that candidate. I would so hold, and because I would remand the matter for further consideration of appellant’s traffic impact/due process claim, I would direct that any recusal should be total as to the award of the Philadelphia casino licenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
