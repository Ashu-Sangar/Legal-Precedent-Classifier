During one incident, in 1998, appellant broke K.’s leg. Appellant claimed that K. was injured as the two were wrestling, but K. told L.P. during his hospitalization for his broken leg that appellant had intentionally injured him.

The trial court ruled that the Commonwealth could introduce evidence of appellant’s physical assaults against L.P., but not evidence of his physical abuse of L.P.’s mother and brother unless appellant first attempted to refute L.P.’s allegations of sexual abuse by arguing her lack of prompt complaint. The trial court realized that the evidence concerning L.P.’s family could be relevant to establish that appellant forced L.P. into participating in the alleged sexual assaults. But the trial court noted, force was not an element of any of the charged offenses because L.P. was a minor when the offenses occurred. Consequently, the trial court determined that evidence of appellant’s abuse of L.P.’s family was inadmissible unless and until the defense argued the lack of prompt complaint. The Commonwealth then appealed to the Superior Court, certifying that the trial court’s exclusionary order terminated or substantially handicapped the prosecution in accordance with Rule 311(d) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

Dillon, </em><a href="/a2d/863/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="863 A.2d 597" data-case-ids="9168557" data-case-paths="/a2d/863/0597-01">863 A.2d 597</a>, 600 (Pa.Super.2004).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> The court then proceeded to <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>review the merits of the Commonwealth’s claim, acknowledging the difficulties in prosecuting sexual assault cases, such as the lack of corroborating witnesses to the crime and the jury’s frequent need to rest its decision solely on a determination of the relative credibility of the victim and the defendant. Courts of this Commonwealth, the panel noted, permit evidence of a victim’s prompt complaint to be offered as substantive evidence for the prosecution, just as the defense is permitted to introduce evidence of a victim’s lack of prompt complaint in order to cast doubt upon the accusation. Contrary to the trial court, the Superior Court panel interpreted <em>Commonwealth v. Barger, </em><a href="/a2d/743/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="743 A.2d 477" data-case-ids="11488664" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0477-01">743 A.2d 477</a> (Pa.Super.1999) <em>(en </em>banc), as expressly allowing the Commonwealth’s introduction of evidence during its case-in-chief of a defendant’s physical abuse against a minor sexual assault victim and her family. <em>Barger, </em>according to the panel, authorizes the presentation of evidence of prior physical abuse and intimidation to provide the jury the benefit of the full <em>res gestae</em>

The Superior Court found the trial court’s ruling in this case antithetical to <em>Barger’s </em>precepts. Moreover, the court reasoned that the trial court’s ruling would lead to an illogical result, namely, allowing the accused to control whether the jury could hear evidence as to why an intimidated victim of sexual abuse did not promptly report her abuse. <em><a href="/a2d/863/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="863 A.2d 597" data-case-ids="9168557" data-case-paths="/a2d/863/0597-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/863/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="863 A.2d 597" data-case-ids="9168557" data-case-paths="/a2d/863/0597-01">at 603-04</a>. Accordingly, the Superior Court ruled that the trial court had abused its discretion in denying the Commonwealth’s motion <em>in limine, </em>and it therefore vacated the trial court’s order and remanded the case for trial.

Appel<a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>lant argues that the trial court’s reading of the <em>Barger </em>case was a correct interpretation because defense counsel in <em>Barger </em>made the evidence of prior physical abuse relevant by casting doubt on the allegations given the victim’s failure to make a prompt complaint. The evidence that the Commonwealth seeks to admit, appellant adds, does not fall under any specific exception to Evidence Rule 404(b). Moreover, appellant maintains that the Commonwealth failed to establish that the evidence was more probative than prejudicial. Regarding the specific evidence of K.’s broken leg, appellant asserts that the incident only marginally helps to show why L.P. failed to report the alleged abuse by appellant, because the incident occurred during the last four months of the alleged four-year period of sexual abuse. Because his breaking K.’s leg offers little support for the instant charges, appellant argues, the evidence of prior assaults would contribute to the jury’s willingness to believe that appellant sexually abused L.P. as a matter of criminal propensity or bad character, outweighing any marginal probative value of the evidence. Finally, appellant stresses that the trial court did not completely foreclose admission of prior physical abuse; rather, it prudently decided to wait until it heard the defense presentation at trial before it ultimately would determine if the evidence could be introduced.</p>

Therefore, the Commonwealth argues that it should be permitted to rebut that natural inference in its case-in-chief. The Commonwealth submits that the law recognizes the relevance of such evidence, since it permits the introduction of other crimes evidence if introduced for some relevant purpose other than to show bad character or a defendant’s criminal propensity. Here, the evidence was proffered to show how appellant coerced L.P.’s silence and delayed her report. Excluding an explanation for the delayed abuse report, contends the Commonwealth, is tantamount to blocking the Commonwealth from affirmatively discharging its burden of proof because the <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>integrity of the trial is undermined by the misleading suggestion created by a child victim’s unexplained delay in reporting.</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[293,405,1159,516]]]'>The Commonwealth also argues “strong policy reasons” for permitting evidence of other crimes to explain a failure to timely report a sex crime. The Commonwealth echoes the Superior Court’s concern that preventing the admission of prior physical abuse of family members will allow sexual abusers to intimidate their victims into silence. Furthermore, the absence of evidence to explain a delayed report creates a “false impression” on the jury which serves to undermine the jury’s assessment of a victim’s sincerity, which in turn undermines the integrity of the trial.</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.6",410,[292,946,1159,1044]]]'>The Commonwealth also emphasizes the teachings of <em>Commonwealth v. Minerd, </em><a href="/pa/562/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="562 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="225939" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0046-01">562 Pa. 46</a>, <a href="/a2d/753/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="753 A.2d 225" data-case-ids="11205798,225939" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0225-01,/pa/562/0046-01">753 A.2d 225</a> (2000), where this Court permitted the Commonwealth to introduce evidence that an absence of signs of physical harm does not disprove rape. In <em>Minerd, </em>this Court reasoned that a jury might expect to see physical evidence of an assault presented at trial, in the absence of which the jury is likely to raise doubt as to the victim’s accusations and punish the Commonwealth for failing to present such evidence. The circumstance here is similar, the Commonwealth argues, as the jury will inevitably doubt L.P.’s testimony because of the simple historical fact of the length of time she waited to report appellant’s abuse. Because the trial court failed to appreciate the relevance of the physical abuse evidence to the Commonwealth’s ultimate burden, the Commonwealth alleges, it could not and did not conduct a proper balancing test. Simply stating that the evidence may possibly be more prejudicial than probative does not constitute a proper weighing of the evidence, the Commonwealth notes; the prejudice must be undue to warrant its exclusion.</p>

Corbett, Jr., the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, has filed an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief in support of the Commonwealth. The Attorney General argues that it is vital in cases such as the one <em>sub judice </em>to permit evidence of the accused’s physical abuse of the child victim’s family to explain the delayed report of sexual abuse. No decision of this Court, <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>according to the Attorney General, has ever conditioned the admissibility of such evidence on a defendant having “opened the door” to its admission. Evidence explaining a delayed report of sexual abuse should be treated identically to, for instance, evidence of motive, which, the Attorney General notes, is admissible even though motive is not an element of the charged crime.</p>

Evidence of separate or unrelated “crimes, wrongs, or acts,” however, has long been deemed inadmissible as character evidence against a criminal defendant in this Commonwealth as a matter not of relevance, but of policy, <em>i.e., </em>because of a fear that such evidence is so powerful that the jury might misuse the evidence and convict based solely upon criminal <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>propensity. <em>See Commonwealth v.

But any such broad proscription fails to account for the teaching of <em>Minerd. </em>Certain points need not be specifically made to jurors by the advocates in order for them to be on the minds of the jurors. The usefulness of an absence of prompt complaint as a defense point is that it resonates with our understanding of human behavior to suggest that an unexplained failure to complain raises suspicion about the validity of the complaint.

The necessity for the party with the burden of proof to address that speculation cannot be a function of whether the defense decides to pursue it affirmatively. To allow the natural inference to go unrebutted can mislead the jury. Moreover, if the Commonwealth were forced in all instances to introduce the explanation for the delay only in response to the defense litigation strategy, the Commonwealth’s rebuttal may appear unpersuasive precisely because of its timing: ie., it may seem to be an attempt to save a flawed presentation of its case-in-chief, or, at worst, a fabrication to save the victim’s credibility after defense counsel’s emphasis on a legitimate pitfall in the victim’s version of the facts.

The probative value of the evidence might be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, pointlessness of presentation, or unnecessary presentation of cumulative evidence. Pa.R.E. 403. The comment to Pa.R.E. 403 instructs that: “ ‘Unfair prejudice’ means a tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to divert the jury’s attention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” Pa.R.E. 403 cmt.

In a proper balancing inquiry, of course, the court should also consider the scope and contour of the proffered evidence, to minimize its potential for unfair prejudice. We stress this point because it is important to recognize that, although the court erred in deeming the evidence irrelevant except as rebuttal, our finding of error in that regard does not mean that upon remand, the court is obliged to allow unlimited evidence along these lines. The trial court rather retains its discretionary power to determine the proper effect of evidence that may be introduced to support the point the Commonwealth pursues. It may be that, in the court’s judgment, not every incident that is proffered needs to be recounted for the jury to understand that L.P. allegedly feared appellant and the general severity of the violence causing that fear. There may certainly be a point at which the quantity and quality of evidence regarding L.P.’s fear of physical abuse may become <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>more unfairly prejudicial than probative, and the trial court may avoid crossing that boundary by carefully tailoring how and to what degree evidence of the reasons for L.P.’s delayed report is introduced at trial, and via appropriate limiting instructions. The point of our ruling today is that the trial court failed to comprehend the relevance of the disputed evidence, and in doing so erroneously limited presentation of it to rebuttal, and thereby failed to undertake a proper balancing. Following our direction that the evidence at issue is relevant and admissible in the Commonwealth’s case-in-chief, it is for the trial court to manage the Commonwealth’s presentation of the evidence establishing the reasons for the timing of L.P.’s report.</p>

I write to emphasize that while our holding allows the Commonwealth to introduce evidence in its case-in-chief to explain a lack of prompt complaint, this rule is limited to sexual assault cases. In this type of case the judiciary can rightly take note of the fact that the jury may make a natural inference against the credibility of a witness for a failure to report promptly consistent with the policy that underlies the legislation at 18 Pa.C.S. § 3105. Section 3105 instructs that a prompt complaint is not required for the prosecution of sexual offenses. This reflects the Legislature’s response to the common law assumption of “hue and cry” which presupposes that a victim of sexual assault will immediately cry out, and if he or she does not, a negative inference can be drawn against the credibility of the complaint and against whether or not the incident in fact occurred. <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>

The Court states that “[t]he necessity for the party with the burden of proof to address that speculation cannot be a function of whether the defense decides to pursue it affirmatively.

If the defendant fails to raise the issue, which, as the majority points out, would be a rare situation, <em>see </em>Majority Op. at 367, 925 A.2d at 141, the Commonwealth can inform the jury during closing arguments that it need not consider the lack of a prompt complaint because Pennsylvania law does not require it as an <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>element of any sexual crimes. More importantly, the Commonwealth can request that a jury instruction be given that tracks the language of Section 3105, and the trial court <em>should </em>so instruct them. The result would eradicate any lingering concerns that the jury would have regarding the necessity of an explanation regarding the victim’s failure to promptly report the alleged abuse. We routinely presume that jurors follow the court’s instructions regarding the law. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Therefore, an instruction to this effect would dispel the notion that the jurors would penalize the Commonwealth for not offering evidence to explain the speculation possibly lingering in their heads. The burden then lies with the defendant. The Commonwealth need not explain the issue; thus, if the defendant desires the benefit of the negative inference about the complainant’s credibility that historically accompanies the victim of a sexual assault’s failure to immediately report the abuse, he must raise it or suffer the consequences of having the judge instruct the jury not to consider it.</p>

This would be even more so where the judge instructs the jury that the Commonwealth need not prove, or explain, anything with regard to the issue to sustain a conviction. Thus, I conclude that the prejudicial impact of the proffered evidence here outweighs its minimal probative value.</p>
