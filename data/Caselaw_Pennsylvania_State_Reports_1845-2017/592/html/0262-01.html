Contrary to the Commonwealth’s contention, we disagree that the Legislature’s omission of a “mistake of age” defense indicates its intent that the age requirement in Section 2910 be strictly enforced. Instead, when the Legislature has intended that an offender is to be strictly liable for a crime regardless of his or her knowledge of the victim’s age, it has done so explicitly. 18 Pa.C.S. § 3102 (making clear that “mistake of age” defense will not be available to any crimes in subchapter involving rape for victims less than 14 years of age)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a>; 18 Pa.C.S. <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>§ 5902(c) (“[T]he actor promotes prostitution of a child under the age of 16 years, whether or not he is aware of the age of the child”). Indeed, in Section 2910, the Legislature could have indicated its intent by making clear that “mistake of age” will not be a defense for any offenders of this subsection. The legislature, however, did not do so. In fact, there is nothing in the plain language of Section 2910 evidencing a legislative directive to dispense with a <em>mens rea </em>requirement with regard to the age requirement. Rather, this task is properly accomplished according to the Crimes Code’s express, default culpability scheme at Section 302(c).</p>
