Customers can access the services of an ISP on a dial-up basis using an ordinary analog voice-grade local telephone line that they lease from a telecommunications carrier. If the customer accesses the Internet through such method, the customer must use a modem to convert the computer’s digital signals into analog signals in order for the information to travel over the analog telephone lines. Once the signal reaches the ISP’s digital transport network, the customer’s information is converted back to digital format to travel across the ISP’s network. This conversion is performed by a modem at the ISP’s point of presence (“POP”), which is the physical place where the ISP operates and maintains the routers, servers, and other facilities necessary to perform its various service functions. As an alternative to dial-up service, a customer may purchase a dedicated data transport service to connect with the ISP, which provides the customer with “full-time” Internet access at higher speeds than the customer would experience using a dial-up access line.</p>

This amendment was directly relevant to the issue in <em>Bell Atlantic, </em>namely, whether the production of cellular telecommunications service constituted manufacturing. While the <em>Bell Atlantic </em>court acknowledged that the definition of “tangible personal property” included telecommunication services, the court nonetheless declined to read this amendment in conjunction with the manufacturing definition.

It is evident from the regulations that any operation that effects a change to tangible personal property is a sufficient activity. I agree with Appellant that its conversion of electronic signals fits within the catch-all activity of “other operations.” <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 7201(c).</p>

In the present matter, the issue is whether Appellant’s conversion of electronic signals from one form into another form constitutes a change in form for purposes of the manufacturing exclusion. The parties have stipulated that Appellant converts analog signals into digital signals in order for the signals to be transmitted across Appellant’s network. This conversion places the signals into a different form that have a distinctive use, as only digital signals can pass through the ISP’s server. It is evident that Appellant’s activities effect a change in the form of the electronic signals.</p>

The statute defines manufacturing as the performance of an operation that “placets] any tangible personal property in a form, composition or character different from that in which it is acquired whether for sale or <em>use by the manufacturer.” See </em>72 P.S. § 7201(c) (emphasis added). Under the statute, therefore, an intermediate step in the taxpayer’s process that changes the property’s form for “use by the manufacturer” may constitute manufacturing under the statute. <em>See Commonwealth v.
