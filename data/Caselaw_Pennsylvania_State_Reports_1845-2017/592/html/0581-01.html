In this regard, both inquiries employ a threshold assessment concerning the weight to be ascribed to the parental interest to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny, and both employ a balancing formulation in the application of such scrutiny in which the government’s interest is tested, on the one hand, to determine whether it represents an acceptable infringement on the parental interest (for purposes of substantive due process), and on the other hand, whether it is sufficient to support a particular classification (for equal protection purposes). Additionally, Sections 5311 and 5312, addressing grandparent visitation and partial custody in circumstances involving the death of a parent and divorce, respectively, are both concerned with protecting the health and emotional welfare of children under the state’s <em>parens patñae </em>interest in circumstances where the child’s family continuity is disrupted. Finally, in <em>Hiller, </em>Section 5311 was able to withstand the due process challenge only because the statute employs a classification scheme restricting its reach to a limited class of grandparents (those whose children have died) — in other words, the <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>classification was at the heart of the determination that the statute was narrowly tailored to serve the compelling state interest in protecting the health and emotional welfare of children. <em>See Hiller, </em><a href="/pa/588/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="588 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="3788399" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0342-01">588 Pa. at 359-60</a>, <a href="/pa/588/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="904 A.2d 875" data-case-ids="3788399,8473694" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0342-01,/a2d/904/0875-01">904 A.2d at 886</a>.

In doing so, Justice Baldwin incorrectly suggests that we have ignored the presumption in favor of a fit parent (when we have specifically indicated that such presumption must be given full effect in a merits assessment), and concludes that Grandparents have failed to overcome the presumption (although they have not had the opportunity to do so, because their petition was dismissed by the trial court based on its determination that Section 5312 was facially unconstitutional). <em>See </em>Dissenting Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 605-06, 927 A.2d at 197.</p>

It also properly asserts the state’s legitimate interest in the welfare of children. However, the focus of the inquiry under equal protection is the legitimacy of the classification created by the statute. The majority correctly states the law in this area on one hand, but then asserts that the equal protection inquiry is “essentially identical” to an inquiry of substantive due process. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion p. 589, 927 A.2d at 187 <em>supra. </em>In fact, the caselaw cited by the majority does not refer to the inquiries as “essentially identical” but rather as “substantially similar” and while it is true that due process and equal protection involve a <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>substantially similar inquiry in that the concepts are very much alike, the analyses do differ in what I believe to be a critical aspect. Both consider whether the government action is necessary to promote a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest, but substantive due process applies this test to the legislation, whereas under equal protection we apply that test to the classification created by the legislation. <em>Compare Khan, </em><a href="/pa/577/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="842 A.2d 936" data-case-ids="91658,9289383" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0166-01,/a2d/842/0936-01">842 A.2d at </a>947 <em>with Commonwealth v.

In other words, strict scrutiny under due process tests the government’s interest to determine if the statute represents an acceptable infringement, whereas equal protection, the concept at issue here, considers whether the government’s interest is sufficient to support a particular classification. I may seem to quibble over the precise language that the majority chooses to use, however, I believe that there is a real risk that the two inquiries will be conflated. This is problematic because distinct analyses may lead to divergent results. This concern is borne out by a careful reading of <em>Blixt v.

Under due process, the court found that the statute satisfied strict scrutiny because “our construction narrowly tailors it to further the compelling [sjtate interest in protecting the welfare of a child who has experienced a disruption in the family unit from harm.” <em>Id. </em>at 660, <a href="/citations/?q=774%20N.E.2d%201052" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="774 N.E.2d 1052">774 N.E.2d 1052</a>.

Without making any distinction as to marital status, we have held that there is a presumption that parents will act in a child’s best interest. <em>Hiller v.

That statute classified parents into two groups. One group where both parents were alive, and the other, where one parent had died. This Court found that these two groups of parents were not similarly situated and that the classification was necessary to the compelling state interest of the welfare of children.

The prohibition against treating people differently under the law does not preclude the Commonwealth from resorting to legislative classifications, provided that those classifications are reasonable rather than arbitrary and bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation. In other words, a classification must rest upon some ground of difference which justifies the classification and have a fair and substantial relationship to the object of the legislation.

Specifically, unlike <em>Hiller, </em>we are dealing with a divorced family with living parents who have different opinions as to the children’s visitation with their grandparents. I believe this alters the landscape considerably, for I cannot accept that divorce alone diminishes the fundamental interest of parents who are making caretaking decisions. In particular, I do not believe that the statute can survive the scrutiny involved in comparing two otherwise fit parents who happen to be divorced to two similarly situated parents who are not divorced. In the instant case, the section 5312 classification of parents as married or divorced does not provide a real and genuine distinction upon which to permit state interference with the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. If Father lived with Mother, the present controversy would not be before this Court.

Divorce proceedings alone do not threaten the health, safety, morals or welfare of children to constitute a compelling reason for state interference.

      <em>Troxel </em>made it clear that when a forum has been created for a court to consider grandparent visitation, the judge must presume that a fit parent acts in the best interests of his or her children. “So long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent’s children.” <em>Troxel, </em><a href="/us/530/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="530 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="9413198" data-case-paths="/us/530/0057-01">530 U.S. at 68-69</a>, <a href="/us/530/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="530 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="9413198" data-case-paths="/us/530/0057-01">120 S.Ct. at 2061</a>. This presumption is not simply applicable to joint decisions of fit married parents but applies to the decisions of all fit parents. <em>See Stanley v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/405/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="405 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="11723248" data-case-paths="/us/405/0645-01">405 U.S. 645</a>, <a href="/us/405/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="405 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="11723248" data-case-paths="/us/405/0645-01">92 S.Ct. 1208</a>, <a href="/us/405/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="405 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="11723248" data-case-paths="/us/405/0645-01">31 L.Ed.2d 551</a> (1972) (holding that the state may not interfere with an unwed father’s custody rights absent proof of unfitness). It is parental fitness, not mere marital status that gives rise to the presumption. Divorce does not diminish the fundamental interest of a parent in parenting and does not make a father or mother less capable.</p>
