The Superior Court held that the constitutional right of access was satisfied when the press attended the proceedings and did not separately guarantee the press access to the jurors’ names and addresses. For the reasons detailed herein, we disagree with the Superior Court’s conclusions. Accordingly, the Order of the court is reversed.</p>

The jury selection process was open to the public and at least one reporter of WPXI, Inc., a TV station, and the Tribune-Review Publishing Company, a local newspaper, (hereafter “Appellants”) was present in the courtroom. During jury selection, the potential jurors were referred to only by number. At no time during jury selection did Appellants raise an objection to the process the court employed.</p>

The court also raised concerns about the requests for the jurors’ names and addresses by the press. N.T., 8/15/2003, at 1962-63. The court tentatively arranged to sequester the jury because of its concerns for “protecting the jury as much as I can.

While particularized findings of fact may support such closure in an appropriate case, including concerns when the jurors have been or are likely to be harassed by the public, press, or defendant’s family or friends, the reasons given by the trial court in this case, were unsubstantiated. Furthermore, general concerns for harassment or invasion of privacy would exist in almost any criminal trial. Rather, the closure must be supported by specific findings demonstrating that there is a substantial probability that an important right will be prejudiced by publicity and that reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the right. <em>Press-Enterprise II. </em>The trial court did not make any specific findings in this case.

We have held that the public has a right to observe criminal proceedings under this section. <em>Fenstermaker <a href="/pa/515/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="515 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1806062" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0501-01">supra.</a> </em>Nevertheless, we have also indicated that Article 1, Section 11, did not provide a greater right of access to the public in criminal trials than the public trial provision of the federal constitution. <em>Commonwealth v. Hayes, </em><a href="/pa/489/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="146" data-cite="489 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1762402" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0419-01">489 Pa. 419</a>, <a href="/pa/489/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="489 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1762402" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0419-01">414 A.2d 318</a>, 322 (1980). In fact, Appellant-WPXI asserts that we have held Article 1, Section 11 and the First Amendment to be "co-extensive." <em>See </em>Appellant's Brief at 16 n. 9. Because we believe that the federal Constitution only provides the public with a right of access to jurors’ names, we see no need to look at this provision further.</p>

We merely note, however, that the Rule can be read consistently with our conclusion today, if the confidentiality requirements are construed to relate to the substance of the jurors’ responses, rather than to the identifying information contained therein.</blockquote>
