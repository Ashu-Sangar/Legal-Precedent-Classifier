In rejecting Crawley’s claim, the PCRA court concluded that Crawley was required to prove his claim by a preponderance of the evidence. The court also held that for purposes of collateral review, it was appropriate for a judge to make the determination as to mental retardation. With regard to the definition of mental retardation, the court employed the definition set forth in the Pennsylvania Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966 (“MHMRA”) as it did not have the benefit of our <em>Miller </em>decision. The court noted that the MHMRA definition “contains some ambiguity in interpreting the parameters of ‘sub-average’ intellectual functioning.” PCRA court opinion, 4/30/2004, at 13. Ultimately, however, the court determined that the MHMRA required Crawley to demonstrate “significantly sub-average” intellectual functioning, which was consistent with the definitions set forth in the DSM-IV and the AAMR. Utilizing this definition, the court held that Crawley did not meet his burden of showing that he was mentally retarded.</p>

Crawley argues that we did not foreclose such a possibility in <em>Miller </em>and that we should adopt* the Pennsylvania definition of mental retardation as set forth in the MHMRA. Turning to the PCRA court’s opinion, Crawley contends that the court erred in requiring that he demonstrate a “significantly” sub-average general intellectual functioning rather than merely “sub-average” intellectual functioning. This difference is important because sub-average <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>intellectual functioning only requires demonstrating an IQ at 1 standard deviation below the norm (which is an IQ of approximately 85 or below), while “significantly sub-average” intellectual functioning requires demonstrating an IQ at 2 standard deviations below the norm (which is an IQ of approximately 70 or below). In this regard, Crawley urges this court to consider the plain meaning definition, as it exists in the MHMRA rather than considering the slant placed on the term by the Department of Public Welfare in interpreting its own regulations. Finally, Crawley requests that we review the evidence he presented under the broader standard and conclude that he is, in fact, mentally retarded.</p>

Second, it recognized that the PCRA court judge was the appropriate party to make the determination for purposes of collateral review.

This narrow focus may be improper in a situation in which the IQ is borderline, i.e., 70-75, and does not clearly indicate mental retardation. <em>See Miller, </em><a href="/pa/585/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="888 A.2d 624" data-case-ids="2473196,8997708" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0144-01,/a2d/888/0624-01">888 A.2d at </a>631 n. 9.

The DSM-IV generally defines mental retardation as a disorder that is “characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning (an IQ of approximately 70 or below).” <em>See Miller, </em><a href="/pa/585/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="888 A.2d 624" data-case-ids="2473196,8997708" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0144-01,/a2d/888/0624-01">888 A.2d at 630</a>; DSM-IV at 37.

Thus, while we did not adopt a “cutoff” IQ level in <em>Miller, </em>the IQ must at least fall within the range of intellectual functioning that could be considered “mentally retarded” as defined in the DSM-IV or the AAMR. Both diagnostic tools envision an upper limit on the range of intellectual functioning fitting within the definition of mental retardation that takes into consideration the standard error of measurement.</p>

    <p id="b282-11" data-blocks='[["BL_282.12",282,[292,1751,1156,583]],["BL_283.1",283,[221,289,1153,204]]]'>As the Majority notes, appellant here essentially asks this Court to revisit <em>Miller </em>and adopt a standard for evaluating mental retardation that is more to his liking. In my view, appellant is in the wrong forum to forward such a request. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania never embraced, as an expression of its own sovereignty, the limitation on the death penalty that was adopted in <em>Atkins. </em>Instead, <em>Atkins </em>is a federal constitutional decision, rendered by the highest court in the land, which binds the states via the Supremacy Clause, irrespective of whether the individual states agree with the interpretation as a matter of policy or constitutional history or <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>principle. <em>Atkins </em>left it to the states to struggle with the practical implications of its broad decision, and it is not yet clear which state responses to the decision will be deemed to pass constitutional muster by that Court.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[221,515,1158,898]]]'>It obviously would be salutary for the legislatures of the states to thrash about with the definitional and implementation issues arising in the wake of <em>Atkins, </em>since the broad subject implicates questions of social policy and it is no easy task to devise a workable and rational standard, given the mysteries of the human mind and the litigation incentives. Moreover, although state legislatures must do the minimum that <em>Atkins </em>would command (vague as that command is), they are free to do more, even going so far as to insulate a broader group of marginally impaired capital murderers. In <em>Miller, </em>this Court stepped in because the General Assembly had not adopted responsive legislation and because the issue presented was ripe for decision. Faced with Pennsylvania legislation that did not contain any <em>Atkins </em>restriction, and obliged and authorized only to do the constitutional minimum required by <em>Atkins, </em>this Court rendered its considered decision on the standard to govern <em>Atkins </em>challenges in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[224,1438,1157,899]],["BL_284.1",284,[308,290,1155,517]]]'>Having spoken in <em>Miller </em>only because the issue was defaulted to us, and bound only by those federal constitutional restrictions which are clearly articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court, I would not “revisit” the <em>Miller </em>standard upon mere request, or because a particular defendant thinks he has conjured a better policy argument. This Court is not a legislative body, much less a super-legislature. Our role is not to tinker with the <em>Miller </em>test for tinkering’s sake or for policy’s sake. In my view, there are only three possible cognizable challenges a capital defendant can forward in the wake of <em>Miller: </em>(1) I am ineligible for the death penalty under <em>Miller, </em>(2) the <em>Miller </em>standard as stated or applied to me violates the federal Constitution as articulated in the following, specific ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States (this would have to be <em>Atkins </em>or a post-Affcms decision of the High Court); or (3) the General Assembly has enacted a statute addressing <em>Atkins, </em>it constitutionally displaces <em>Miller, </em>and it <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>entitles me to death ineligibility whether <em>Miller </em>would or not. None of these scenarios is presented here. As such, this challenge, and any like it, should be speedily and summarily denied. The only proper forums for appellant’s “policy” arguments are the U.S. Supreme Court, which innovated the <em>Atkins </em>restriction in the first instance and imposed it against the states, or the Pennsylvania General Assembly, which certainly has the power to go further than <em>Miller </em>and <em>Atkins, </em>if it chooses to do so. The frivolous filing in this case should not be permitted to delay the administration of justice.</p>
