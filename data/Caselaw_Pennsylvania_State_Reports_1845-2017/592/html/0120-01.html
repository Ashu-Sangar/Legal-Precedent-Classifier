He claims that the standard sentencing range, not the statutorily-prescribed maximum sentence, is the actual “statutory maximum” under <em>Blakely </em>for Sixth Amendment purposes because it is the maximum sentence that a defendant may receive without additional fact-finding by the judge. Like the defendant in <em>Blakely, </em>he argues that he was entitled to no greater than the standard range under the Sentencing Guidelines. Thus, in order to sentence him beyond the range recommended in the Guidelines, the facts supporting the enhancement must be found by a jury. Because the factors explained by the judge went beyond those admitted to in his plea, he received more punishment than he was entitled to based upon judicially-determined facts. Thus, he contends that his sentence is illegal and should be vacated.</p>

Any enhancement made by a trial judge will affect only the minimum sentence, not the statutory maximum. As such, this does not implicate the concerns addressed in <em>Blakely. </em>The Commonwealth also argues that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Blakely </em>specifically declared that the Sixth Amendment has no impact on indeterminate sentencing schemes.

    <p id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[294,769,1156,306]]]'>Sentencing schemes may also be discretionary or nondiscretionary.

In <em>Apprendi </em>the Court struck down a portion of the New Jersey hate crimes statute that provided for an enhancement of a criminal sentence if a trial judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant committed the crime with the purpose to intimidate a person or group based on enumerated characteristics, such as race. Apprendi was <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>charged with a variety of crimes for discharging a gun into the home of an African-American family that had recently moved into his neighborhood. He pled guilty to two counts of possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose and one count of unlawful possession of an antipersonnel bomb. These crimes carry a statutory penalty range of 5 to 10 years and 3 to 5 years, respectively. At sentencing, the judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Apprendi’s crimes were motivated by a racial bias. As such, pursuant to the hate crime enhancement, the judge sentenced Apprendi to 12 years of imprisonment for one count of possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose and shorter concurrent sentences for the other two charges.</p>

It is equally clear that such facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>Apprendi, </em><a href="/us/530/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="120 S.
