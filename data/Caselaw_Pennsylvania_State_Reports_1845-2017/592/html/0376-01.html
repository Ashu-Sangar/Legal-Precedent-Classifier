In this appeal, a panel of the Superior Court held that: (1) the trial prosecutor’s discussion, in summation but not at trial, of the substance of the nontestifying co-defendant’s confession (a confession which had been redacted to remove references to appellee and then admitted into evidence against the co-defendant) violated <em>Bruton </em>when the prosecutor referred to appellee by name; (2) because the prosecutor’s comment violated <em>Bruton, </em>the cautionary charge proposed by the trial court upon defense objection was insufficient as a matter of law to dissipate prejudice to appellee; (3) the error was not harmless; and (4) the trial court abused its discretion in denying severance based upon the <em>Bruton </em>issue. This Court granted review to consider the propriety of the Superior Court’s extension of <em>Bruton </em>to an instance involving the prosecutor’s argument, the panel’s concomitant holding that a cautionary charge was <em>per se </em>inadequate to dissipate the potential for prejudice, and the panel’s finding that severance was required. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the prosecutor’s comment in closing in this case, though improper, does not trigger <em>Bruton’s per se </em>exception to the general rule that cautionary charges may be adequate to eliminate spillover prejudice in joint trials. We also hold that the potential for prejudice arising from the prosecutor’s comment was curable by the cautionary charge that trial counsel declined. Finally, we find that the panel’s ruling on the severance question was erroneous. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of a new trial and reinstate the judgment of sentence.</p>

Between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m., Garcia stopped to talk to appellee and introduced appellee to Cheatham. Cheatham moved to the back seat of the car and appellee entered the front passenger seat. Appellee informed Garcia that “he wanted to get high.” During the ensuing drive to North Philadelphia, Garcia stopped the car and purchased Xanax pills, which all three men then shared. The pills made Cheatham sleepy and he asked Garcia to take him home. Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 6/4/02, at 95-99.</p>

Garcia then drove about half a block when appellee asked him to stop the car. Appellee exited the car and Garcia followed. Cheatham remained in the back seat and heard a gunshot, which sounded like it was fired nearby. Appellee returned to the car, followed by Garcia. Appellee had a gun in his hand and Garcia asked him, “what the f[ — ] did you just do?” Appellee responded, “Shut up and drive the f[ — ]ing car.” Cheatham told Garcia that he wanted to be dropped off immediately. Garcia drove around for about five minutes before stopping to let Cheatham out of the car. Cheatham went to a friend’s house where he went to sleep. <em><a href="/citations/?q=160%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2032" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="160 L.

At the station, the officers found Mary Edmund laying face up near a gasoline pump, where Fire Department paramedics were attempting to resuscitate her. Ms. Edmund was taken to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at approximately 9:40 p.m. The victim died from a single bullet which had caused multiple injuries, as it entered Ms. Edmund’s right upper breast, exited the lower breast, entered the abdomen, and then became lodged behind her left hip. <em><a href="/citations/?q=160%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2032" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="160 L.

At approximately 3:00 a.m., Philadelphia Police Lieutenant Daniel MacDonald and Officer Brian Gress were in a marked police vehicle and noticed the black Monte Carlo driving with its lights out. Lieutenant MacDonald activated his overhead lights and shined a spotlight on the car. The car initially pulled over but then sped off, with the officers in pursuit. The chase ended when the Monte Carlo hit a patch of ice, careened onto the sidewalk, hit a couch and a trash pile, and came to a halt. Garcia jumped from the car with a silver handgun and fled, with Officer Gress in pursuit. Appellee and Weary also attempted to flee, but kept slipping on ice and were promptly arrested by Lieutenant MacDonald. Officer Gress apprehended Garcia a block away and also retrieved a .38-caliber revolver Garcia had abandoned in the backyard of a nearby home.

On July 20, 2001, appellee motioned to sever his trial from Garcia’s, claiming inconsistent defenses. He also alleged that his confrontation rights would be violated by a joint trial because Garcia did not plan to testify and the Commonwealth planned to introduce Garcia’s redacted statement to police. The trial court denied the motion. Although the record contains no pre-trial order or other pre-trial reference to redacting Garcia’s police statement, it is apparent from what transpired at trial that the court and counsel had edited the statement to remove references to appellee by name and replace all references "with neutral phrases such as “another guy” or “the <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>other guy.” Appellee lodged no Sraion-based objection to the adequacy of the redaction.</p>

If, however, the co-defendant’s statement is properly redacted, such that it removes the defendant’s name without obviously revealing the omission, a jury instruction to consider the statement only against the co-defendant who made it is presumptively sufficient to protect the defendant’s confrontation rights.

The Commonwealth notes that such an instruction has been held to be sufficient under <em>Bruton </em>even where other evidence may lead the jury to speculate or infer that the defendant is the unnamed person referred to in the co-defendant’s statement. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Commonwealth argues, the redaction of Garcia’s statement was proper, as any reference to appellee by name was replaced with neutral phrases like “one guy” or “the other guy.” This redaction, along with the trial court’s accompanying jury instruction to consider Garcia’s statement only against Garcia, the Commonwealth contends, satisfied <em>Bruton </em>and its progeny-</p>

      <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>Because the redaction and jury instructions were proper, the Commonwealth argues, <em>Bruton’s per se </em>rule is not implicated, but rather, the case poses a distinct claim arising from the trial court’s response to the defense objection to the prosecutor’s closing, in which she identified appellee by name when describing the actions of “the other guy” referred to in Garcia’s statement. The Commonwealth contends that a claim that falls outside of the <em>Bruton </em>evidentiary paradigm presumptively is subject to the usual sort of trial objection/discretionary court response analysis, an analysis that admits of a role for cautionary instructions to eliminate or minimize prejudice. In this regard, the Commonwealth cites <em>Commonwealth v. McCrae, </em>where this Court recently stressed that <em>Bruton </em>only applies “in the context that gave rise to the decision, <em>ie., </em>the introduction of a powerfully incriminating statement made by a non-testifying co-defendant at a joint trial.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 20 (quoting <em>McCrae, </em><a href="/pa/574/0594-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="832 A.2d 1026" data-case-ids="587985,9088786" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0594-01,/a2d/832/1026-01">832 A.2d at 1035</a>).

The Commonwealth notes that the challenged comment occurred during the prosecutor’s argument concerning Garcia’s guilt and her general point was consistent with other testimony respecting Garcia. Specifically, the Commonwealth notes that Cheatham testified that appellee was still in the car with Garcia along with the murder weapon when he exited the vehicle, and the police officers testified that Garcia and appellee were together seven hours later. From these facts, the Commonwealth argues, the prosecutor properly inferred and argued that the two men remained together until they were arrested. The point the prosecutor was making in the challenged portion of her closing — that Garcia had the opportunity to part ways with appellee and likely would have had they not been conspirators — therefore was proper. The Commonwealth concedes that the prosecutor’s reference to <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>Garcia and appellee going to Garcia’s house is “potentially problematic,” but argues that this misstatement was at worst an isolated reference that was curable by appropriate instructions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Furthermore, the Commonwealth claims that the remark did not bear upon appellee’s guilt because merely going to Garcia’s house did not implicate appellee in the earlier crime. For these reasons, the Commonwealth believes that the curative instruction proposed by the court, and rejected by appellee, was sufficient to remove any prejudice the prosecutor’s reference might have created, and thus the trial court’s response to the objection cannot be viewed as reversible error.</p>

Appellee claims that there was no other evidence directly placing him in Garcia’s home with the gun. Appellee characterizes the prosecutor’s statement here as “actual inculpation,” not contextual implication, which renders <em>Richardson </em>inapplicable.

Appellee further argues that the prosecutor’s comment was not harmless and was not curable by a jury instruction because the comment opened the door to the jury considering another source of incriminating information, which corroborated Cheatham’s testimony in part. Because the evidence was not overwhelming, appellee claims, the instructions (both the charge offered and declined and the general instructions that were issued) were inadequate, as a matter of law, to dissipate the harm arising from the prosecutor’s statement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Consider, for example, if the redacted evidence would be powerfully incriminating if tied to the defendant, and the prosecutor were to say something along the lines of: “You heard the co-defendant’s confession, which also described the actions of someone he identified only as ‘the other guy;’ well, I’m here to tell you that ‘the other guy’ he was speaking of was the defendant and we just changed the wording of the statement.” The <em>Frazier </em>case, of course, did not involve a deliberate attempt to undo a proper redaction, and thus it did not involve the prospect of prosecutorial conduct which would affect the use the jury could make of evidence from a nontestifying co-defendant’s statement which was actually introduced against the co-defendant at trial. We have no doubt that, in an appropriate case, the High Court would approve application of the <em>per se Bruton </em>rule to an instance where the objection is to argument by counsel concerning Bruton-redacted evidence. Indeed, the government obviously has a difficult task in arguing that a jury in a joint trial may easily perform the “mental gymnastics” required by <em>Bruton </em>if the trial prosecutor, learned in the law, intentionally betrays difficulty in keeping the evidence separate.</p>

The prosecutor’s statement, though plainly <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>improper, affected the redaction only indirectly and by inference. Moreover, the error occurred in the context of an argument attempting to rebut co-defendant Garcia’s claim of non-involvement. The revelation of appellee’s name when speaking of the stop at Garcia’s house, though troublesome, concerned a point in time after the actual killing, and it did not directly inculpate appellee in the murder beyond the evidence properly introduced through Cheatham concerning appellee’s role in the murder. Moreover, the reference was isolated and, following the objection, the prosecutor made no further improper reference to the redacted statement. In light of the context and circumstances of the misstatement, and the teaching of <em>Frazier, </em>we hold that <em>Bruton’s per se </em>rule does not apply.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Again, the prosecutor’s statement was confined to a single comment in an argument concerning co-defendant Garcia’s guilt. The curative instruction offered by the court was direct, unequivocal, and strong, including that Garcia’s statement was not to be considered as evidence that Garcia “drove [appellee] anywhere or even that [appellee] was in Garcia’s automobile.” The trial court, of course, was in the best position to assess whether the circumstances were such that the misstatement was curable. Appellee’s counsel then rejected the curative charge as a strategic matter. However, the court previously had repeatedly instructed the jury that it could consider Garcia’s statement only as evidence against Garcia and, in its general charge, it instructed the jury that the arguments of counsel were not evidence. The general instructions issued, as well as the charge proffered but declined, were adequate to remove any prejudice. Accordingly, we find that the trial court committed no error and that the Superior Court, consequently, erred in awarding a new trial on grounds that the prosecutor’s argument triggered and violated the <em>Bruton </em>rule.</p>

The trial court discussed the relevant case law at some length, and then noted that there was no irreconcilable conflict between appellee’s defense and that of Garcia. Trial Ct. Op. at 12. Furthermore, with respect to appellee’s specific concern that he would be unable to cross-examine Garcia, the court discussed <em>Bruton, Gray, Richardson, </em>and <em>Travers </em>and noted that redaction coupled with a cautionary charge was an approved method of addressing claims premised upon the Confrontation Clause. The trial court then noted that Garcia’s statement was properly redacted so as not to refer to appellee by name or other indication and the jury was appropriately instructed so that admission of Garcia’s statement, against Garcia alone, did not violate appellee’s confrontation rights. Finally, the court noted that appellee’s concern that the jury might conclude that he was one of the “other guys” referred to in Garcia’s statement by considering other, properly admitted evidence, did not require severance because the governing case law — specifically the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Richardson v. Marsh </em>and this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Travers </em>— had rejected such a theory of contextual implication.</p>

In addition, the primary challenge for both defendants was the same: to convince the jury not to credit Cheatham’s testimony.

        <em>Miles </em>is distinguishable from this case.

Second, in <em>Miles, </em>there was no objection, and no curative charge proffered. Third, the <em>Miles </em>Court did not consider the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <em>Frazier, </em>and the distinction between <em>Bruton </em>error arising from the introduction of the co-defendant’s statement and error premised upon counsel's <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>argument.

In <em>Frazier, </em>the Court considered whether the rule in <em>Bruton </em>applied to a prosecutor’s opening statements. In that case, an alleged accomplice of the defendant pleaded guilty and was awaiting sentencing at the time of the defendant’s trial. The prosecutor in opening statements in the defendant’s case referred to the expected testimony of the accomplice. At trial, however, the accomplice invoked his privilege against self-incrimination on the witness stand and declined to testify. The defendant claimed that this violated <em>Bruton </em>because the prosecution had the benefit of placing a testimonial-like statement before the jury, without subjecting the speaker to cross-examination. The Court focused on the fact that the case did not involve a statement of a co-defendant in a joint trial, but instead related to a prosecutor’s commentary in an opening statement on what evidence <em>might </em>be introduced later during trial.</p>

The violation I find in this case arises because the prosecutor’s improper reference in closing arguments effectively introduced the non-testifying co-defendant’s statement to the jury as though it had never been redacted. Respectfully, this Court should not admit a violation of the fundamental right of confrontation and cross-examination by means of a back-door revelation, when <em>Bruton </em>so carefully guards the front door. As the Majority aptly notes: “There is no point in redacting and sanitizing otherwise inculpatory statements of a non-testifying co-defendant, to facilitate a joint trial, if that protective measure approved by the High Court to comport with the Confrontation Clause could be deliberately and directly undone by lawyer commentary.” Maj. Op. at 398, 925 A.2d at 159. Accordingly, I maintain that a violation of the rule in <em>Bruton </em>occurred when the prosecutor, during her closing statement, effectively undid the Bruton-compliant redaction of the non-testifying co-defendant’s statement admitted at trial.I *<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

While the Commonwealth relies on the testimony of the eyewitness, Anthony Cheatham, his testimony is suspect because he is a potential accomplice in the crime. Moreover, his testimony, which implicated Appellee by name, is contradicted by co-defendant Garcia’s statement, which, as redacted, did not implicate Appellee by name. The versions of events offered by Garcia and Cheatham differed as to whether Garcia or Cheatham accompanied the shooter (or Appellee in Cheat-ham’s version) during the murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Additionally, at the time <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>of the arrest, the murder weapon was controlled by Garcia, not Appellee. Finally, Garcia’s statement is not cumulative of other evidence because it is the only evidence presented that spans the entire period from the murder to the arrest. While there is no indication of a nefarious intent by the prosecutor to vitiate the Bruton-compliant redaction, her comments nevertheless tied Appellee by name to the “other guy” referenced in Garcia’s statement. While other incriminating evidence existed, Garcia’s statement was important evidence placing Appellee alone with Garcia after the murder with the gun in Appellee’s hand and corroborating Cheatham’s testimony that Appellee was the shooter. Accordingly, I find a reasonable possibility that the error may have contributed to the verdict such that I cannot conclude that the error was harmless. Thus, I would affirm the Superior Court’s decision to remand for a new trial.</p>
