R.R., at 76a. In 1991, Mr. Baublitz notified the Township of its obligation to adopt an airport hazard zoning ordinance, which he believed the AZA required. <em>Id., </em>at 119a, 125a-26a.

Such an ordinance was discussed at a number of meetings of the Township’s Board of Supervisors. The minutes of the January 13, 2003 meeting reflect that airport hazard zoning was discussed, and the Township solicitor stated he and his predecessor discussed the matter, and his predecessor stated unless the airport’s owner wanted to bring a mandamus action, the topic should not be approached. <em>Id., </em>at 29a, 120a.

Further, the statute requires that such municipalities adopt, in full or by reference, the provisions of model zoning ordinances or other similar guidelines set forth by the FAA related to airport hazards. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 105, 923 A.2d at 1102.</p>

Section 411, however, relates directly to the types of hazard that are the concern of the AZA — in keeping with the AZA, it provides for the land uses permitted in airport hazards areas, restricts the height of structures and objects in those areas, and incorporates FAA regulations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> As applied, Section 411 <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>merely shifts the financial responsibility of insuring safe airport operations from the Township and neighboring landowners to the party seeking to establish an airport by special exception.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Significantly, once the conditions of Section 411 have been met by a landowner, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. §§ 10101-11202 (“MPC”), provides the Township with adequate mechanisms through which to enforce continued compliance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> For these reasons, Section 411 appears to me to be an adequate alternative to the enactment by the local governing body of zoning provisions limiting the use of neighboring properties.</p>
