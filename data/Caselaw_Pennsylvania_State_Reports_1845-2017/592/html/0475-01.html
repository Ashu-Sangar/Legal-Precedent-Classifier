In light of the significant deference that the Commission enjoys in making decisions regarding the granting or denying of harness racing license applications, and for the reasons set forth in greater detail below, we affirm in 'part and reverse in part the order of the Commonwealth Court, and in doing so, uphold the Commission’s denial of both <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>harness racing license applications. We render our decision, however, without prejudice to the applicants to reapply for a harness racing license and for reconsideration by the Commission, consistent with our opinion today.</p>
    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[213,508,1156,477]]]'>The relevant facts and procedural history are as follows. On December 27, 2002, Valley View Downs, LP (“Valley View”) filed with the Commission an “Application for a License to Conduct a Harness Horse Race Meeting with PariMutuel Wagering” pursuant to the Race Horse Industry Reform Act, 4 P.S. § 325.101 <em>et seq. </em>(“Racing Act”). Valley View’s harness racing facility was to be located approximately 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh in South Beaver Township, Beaver County Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b531-5" data-blocks='[["BL_531.6",531,[214,1011,1155,530]]]'>On April 3, 2003, the Commission announced a new Statement of Policy (“Statement of Policy”), effective May 3, 2003, which applied to pending and new license applications. 7 Pa.Code §§ 133.1-133.7. The Statement of Policy declared, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission would treat applicants as a comparative group and that the Commission would not be obligated to issue any license despite the fact that a license was available. On May 24, 2003, a notice was published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin establishing a 60-day license application period from May 24, 2003 through July 22, 2003.</p>
    <p id="b531-6" data-blocks='[["BL_531.7",531,[214,1568,1157,366]]]'>Thereafter, on June 9, 2003, Bedford Downs Management Corporation (“Bedford”) filed an “Application for a License to Conduct a Harness Horse Race Meeting with Pari-Mutuel Wagering” with the Commission. Bedford’s proposed racetrack was to be located approximately three miles east of the Ohio/Pennsylvania border in Mahoning Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania.</p>

Rendell, signed into law the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act (“Gaming Act” or “Act 71”). 4 Pa.C.S. §§ 1101-1904. The Gaming Act authorized limited gaming by the installation and operation of slot machines with the intention of, <em>inter alia, </em>protecting the public through the regulation and policing of <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>activities involving gaming; enhancing live horse racing, breeding programs, entertainment and employment; and providing a new source of revenue to the Commonwealth. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102(1), (2), and (3). Importantly, for purposes of this appeal, under the Gaming Act, a person who has been approved by the Commission to conduct harness horse race meetings could apply to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (“Gaming Control Board”) for a license to operate slot machines at a licensed racetrack facility. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1302(a)(3).</p>

In a supplemental brief to the Commission, Valley View raised allegations regarding Bedford’s principals’ alleged links to “organized crime.” The Commission through its investigative staff conducted further background investigations of individuals and transactions relating to both applicants. On June 24, 2005, the Commission, <em>sua sponte, </em>reopened the evidentiary record. While the Commission’s investigative staff sought a hearing to present its findings regarding Bedford and Valley View, in lieu of a hearing, the parties entered into certain stipulations and a protective order in light of the sensitive nature of the personal background information presented to the Commission. On September 21, 2005, the Commission approved the stipulations and the official docket and evidentiary record were formally closed.</p>

    <p id="b533-4" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[207,782,1154,852]]]'>The Commission denied Bedford’s application because: (1) the deceased grandfather of Bedford’s principal owners had conducted business with reputed organized crime figures through the companies that he owned; (2) the deceased grandfather acquired most of the land upon which Bedford planned to build its facility while his companies were dealing with reputed organized crime figures; and (3) although Bed-ford presented to the Commission a “highly confident” letter from Merrill Lynch, which appeared to evidence adequate financing for the project, the letter did not identify the borrower, the letter required more conditions than Valley View’s highly confident letter, and the letter was issued, in substantial part, based on the original involvement of Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc.

According to the Commonwealth Court majority, the Commission may under the Racing Act refuse to grant a license if the experience, character, or fitness of any officer, director or stockholder is such that his or her participation in horse racing or related activities would be inconsistent with the public interest or with the best interests of racing, 4 P.S. § 325.209(e), but the deceased grandfather was not an officer, director, or stockholder of Bedford; thus, it was error to deny Bedford’s application on this ground. Addition<a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>ally, the Commonwealth Court found that the Commission erred in concluding that the appearance of a connection between organized crime and the ground upon which Bedford proposed to construct the facility was inconsistent with the best interests of racing, reasoning that the law is concerned with the adverse influence of people, not the ground. <em><a href="/a2d/901/1063-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="901 A.2d 1063" data-case-ids="8419416" data-case-paths="/a2d/901/1063-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/901/1063-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="901 A.2d 1063" data-case-ids="8419416" data-case-paths="/a2d/901/1063-01">at 1072-73</a>.</p>

First, it determined that the failure of Merrill Lynch’s “highly confident” letter to identify the precise borrower had no effect on Bedford’s ability to obtain financing. Second, the majority concluded that the fact that Merrill Lynch’s highly confident letter contained more conditions than Valley View’s financing letter was inconsequential as there was no finding that Bedford would be unable to meet any of the conditions. Finally, the Commonwealth Court addressed and rejected the Commission’s concern that Merrill Lynch based its letter, in substantial part, on the high level of confidence that Merrill Lynch had with Isle of Capri and CIBC, not on its own review of the project or the individuals involved in the project. More specifically, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that the departure of Isle of Capri and CIBC from the project was not due to financial concerns, but rather, was a result of a disagreement over management philosophy. Moreover, the Commonwealth Court found that there was no reason to believe, or substantial evidence to support the proposition, that if Merrill Lynch had reviewed the project and the individuals involved, that it would not have issued its letter. Accordingly, the majority of the Commonwealth Court vacated the Commission’s order to the extent that it denied the Bedford application and remanded the case to the Commission for reconsideration in light of its decision. <em><a href="/a2d/901/1063-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="901 A.2d 1063" data-case-ids="8419416" data-case-paths="/a2d/901/1063-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/901/1063-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="901 A.2d 1063" data-case-ids="8419416" data-case-paths="/a2d/901/1063-01">at 1073-75</a>.</p>

In his opinion, Judge Colins discerned that the Commission’s order to deny both license applications should be vacated and both applications should be remanded to the Commission.

At all times, according to the Commission, it focused solely on the application for a harness racing license and acted solely under the Racing Act. At no time did it consider whether Bedford should receive a gaming license in the event that it were to ultimately apply for one and it did not in any fashion usurp the power or jurisdiction of the Gaming Control Board to determine whether Bedford should receive a license for slot machine gaming at its proposed facility. Rather, the Commission offers that it was only concerned with the best interests of racing. The Commission <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>found it necessary to consider Bedford’s likely suitability for licensure under the Gaming Act because that statute inextricably linked harness racing and gaming. The Commission supports its position by pointing to both the purpose of the Gaming Act, including to enhance live horse racing, breeding programs, entertainment, and employment in the Commonwealth, 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102, but also to the connection between the two statutes as evidenced by Section 1302 of the Gaming Act which makes the approval of a horse or harness parimutuel license a condition precedent to eligibility for a Category 1 slot license. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1302(a)(1). While the Commission candidly acknowledges that if it were to rely solely upon the suitability standards set forth in the Gaming Act, that would constitute legal error, the Commission goes on to offer that the provisions of the Gaming Act provided guidance to the Commission and nothing more.

Thus, Bedford would require licensure by two separate Commonwealth agencies. Yet, even the requirement of obtaining two licenses to operate such a facility would not in and of itself give the Commission the ability to act under the Gaming Act.

According to the Commonwealth Court, absent some finding that Bedford could not meet the conditions imposed by Merrill Lynch, “there can be no reason for concern about Bedford’s ability to finance the project based upon those conditions.” <em><a href="/a2d/901/1063-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="901 A.2d 1063" data-case-ids="8419416" data-case-paths="/a2d/901/1063-01">Id.</a></em>

Specifically, the Commonwealth Court offered that Isle of Capri and CIBC ended their relationship with Bedford due to a failure to reach an agreement over the management of the racino and not due to financing. When negotiations with Isle of Capri failed, Bedford pursued a previous offer of a highly confident letter from Innovation Capital Holding, a gaming transaction consulting business with a relationship with Merrill Lynch. Citing to testimony of record not mentioned by the Commission, the Commonwealth Court asserted that Merrill Lynch did not simply rely on the <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>previous involvement of Isle of Capri and CIBC, but that Merrill Lynch reviewed the project and the individuals involved in the project prior to issuing its highly confident letter. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court found that the Commission abused its discretion in “questioning, without any valid reason, the ‘highly confident’ letter issued by Merrill Lynch.” <em><a href="/a2d/901/1063-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="901 A.2d 1063" data-case-ids="8419416" data-case-paths="/a2d/901/1063-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/901/1063-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="901 A.2d 1063" data-case-ids="8419416" data-case-paths="/a2d/901/1063-01">at 1075</a>.</p>

    <p id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[201,1160,1154,1170]]]'>Initially, we note that the Commission’s reasoning regarding financing cannot be viewed in a vacuum. Indeed, the Commission discussed the context of how Bedford’s final financing proposal came into being. Specifically, Bedford filed its application on June 9, 2003 and through the course of the proceedings intended to finance its project in conjunction with an equity investment by Isle of Capri. Isle of Capri possessed a highly confident letter from CIBC. On January 11, 2005, however, Bedford advised the Commission that negotiations with Isle of Capri had ceased but that it was securing another highly confident letter for the financing of the project. On January 17, 2005, Merrill Lynch issued its “highly confident” letter regarding the financing of the Bedford project. In its adjudication, the Commission focused upon certain testimony of Mr. Avid Laurence of Merrill Lynch, who signed the “highly confident” letter. Mr. Laurence indicated that because Isle of Capri had been willing to engage in the deal, and not due to Bedford, it gave them a great deal of confidence and comfort. The Commission also noted that before issuing the highly confident letter, Merrill Lynch did not conduct background checks on the principals of Bedford and was not aware of litigation involving the Shick family.</p>

      <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>It is in this context that the Commission properly voiced its concerns regarding the number of conditions in the Merrill Lynch highly confident letter, the lack of the identity of the borrower of the funds, and the Merrill Lynch letter being based, to a substantial part, on confidence with Isle of Capri and CIBC, rather than an extensive review of the Bedford project itself and the individuals involved in that project. Each of these determinations was based to one degree or another on credibility determinations. Incomplete and questionable independent due diligence regarding financing are certainly legitimate reasons to deny an application. This is especially true when financial suitability is a fundamental consideration in awarding a racing license. These determinations were for the Commission to make and not the Commonwealth Court.</p>

Thus, the ultimate question was not solely that considered by the Commonwealth Court, viz., whether Bedford could obtain, and meet financing; rather, the issue centered on the integrity and sufficiency of Bedford’s financial resources and in part on how Bedford’s financing compared to the other license applicant. While the Commonwealth Court majority may have come to a different conclusion regarding the integrity of Bedford’s financing than that reached by the Commission, that is not the appropriate role of appellate review of these matters. In the end, we find that the Commission was well within its discretion to be concerned about the terms and conditions of Bedford’s financing and the events surrounding the obtaining of such financing; the Commonwealth Court erred in substituting its own judgment in rejecting the Commission’s determination.</p>

      <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>Valley View first argues that the Commission’s Statement of Policy, and its decision to apply a comparative review process to harness racing applications thereunder, violated Valley View’s due process rights. Specifically, Valley View offers two distinct grounds by which it challenges the Statement of Policy. First, Valley View maintains that the Commission’s Statement of Policy was not properly promulgated as a regulation or a rule, and thus, is not entitled to the force and effect of law and that the procedures imposed pursuant to the Statement of Policy were in conflict with existing law and regulations. Second, according to Valley View, the Statement of Policy led to unfair and inequitable treatment of similarly situated applicants and placed Valley View on unequal footing with another prior applicant, Chester Downs. In this regard, Valley View asserts that Chester Downs was awarded a license without having to compete against other applicants and that the Chester Downs facility proposed a 5/8 mile track which was acceptable to the Commission, whereas Valley View’s application was denied, in part, due to a 5/8 mile track.</p>
    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[190,1313,1157,471]]]'>In response, the Commission and Bedford first offer that Valley View failed to properly and timely file a challenge to the Commission’s Statement of Policy and the comparative review process, including assertions regarding the Chester Downs application. Specifically, the Commission submits, <em>inter alia, </em>that Valley View did not make its challenge until it filed a petition for reconsideration. According to the Commission, this was the first time Valley View asserted its due process challenges, and thus, they are waived.</p>

The Commission adopted the Statement of Policy on April 3, 2003, which became effective May 3, 2003. Approximately one and one-half years after the adoption of the Statement of Policy, on October 12, 2004, the Commission held the first pre-hearing conference in these matters. Valley View failed to raise any challenge to the Statement of Policy during this pre-hearing conference, at subsequent pre-hearing conferences, in pre-hearing memoranda, during public comment hearings, or during any of the evidentiary hearings regarding Valley View or Bedford. <em>See </em>58 Pa.Code § 185.83(0).</p>

The letters, which are attached to Valley View’s Brief as Appendix C, merely make a “recommendation” that the policy only apply to new applications, Letter Dated April 7, 2003 Appendix C, Valley View Brief; seek “clarification” regarding the applicability of the Statement of Policy (and suggesting that a comparative assessment should not be conducted with respect to Valley View and that the policy should have been proposed as a formal regulation), Letter Dated May 7, 2003 Appendix C, Valley View Brief; and while purportedly agreeing to proceed under the Statement of Policy, “reserve the right to raise additional arguments about the new ‘group consideration’ standard included in the Statement of Policy and Procedures for License Application Review.” Letter Dated May 27, 2003 Appendix C, Valley View Brief.</p>

First, even though the letters were apparently written a year and one-half prior to the commencement of the Valley View hearings on November 4, 2004, they were never introduced into the evidentiary record or into the certified record before the Commission. It must be remembered that the proceedings <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>concerning both Valley View and Bedford were ones in which hearings were held before a Hearing Examiner, both sides were permitted to participate, object, cross-examine, and to make argument. Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law were presented by the parties, yet no objection to the Statement of Policy was lodged in any of these proceedings, even though Valley View had the opportunity to make such a challenge. Even assuming, <em>arguendo </em>that the letters which are attached to Valley View’s brief are properly before us,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> we find that the mere forwarding of letters to agencies outside of the formal administrative proceedings in which parties are active participants is simply insufficient to preserve an issue on appeal.

    <p id="b553-4" data-blocks='[["BL_553.5",553,[195,1204,1154,635]]]'>Similarly, Valley View first formally attempted to introduce some of its arguments objecting to the Statement of Policy in its Motion for Reconsideration filed with the Commission after the closing of the record in its proceedings and after issuance of the Commission’s Adjudication. As the Commonwealth Court observed, citing <em>Frankford Hospital v. DPW, </em>77 Pa.

According to Valley View, Bedford was permitted four opportunities to correct defects in its application while it was refused this ability. Finally, Valley View suggests that the Commission should have provided preliminary decision-making before a final decision was rendered, akin to that in the land use arena, and that it should have had the ability to cure any deficiencies in its plan prior to a final adjudication.</p>

We agree. In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>Valley View requests the ability to modify its plan, not during the ongoing pre-adjudication process but after a final adjudication was made. In essence, Valley View wants the Commission to re-open the record to allow it to address and purportedly correct its deficiencies.

We would put form over substance.... [Certainly I don’t want to commit this and carve it in stone. But ... it would seem that to the extent there are issues in the gaming law that must be a part of these applications or these facilities, this Commission, I think, has jurisdiction to consider those without having to, per se, consider the requirements of the new gaming law, and I think that finances is one of them.

One aspect of Valley View’s challenge to the Statement of Policy and the comparative review process is worthy of further explication. Valley View argues that the Statement of Policy denied it due process and equal protection because another previous licensee, Chester Downs, with a 5/8 mile harness racing track was granted a license by the Commission to operate a facility in Delaware County. Valley View maintains that because the Chester Downs' track was approved and Valley View proposed the same track length for its facility, the Commis<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>sion engaged in unequal treatment of similarly situated applicants. This contention fails. While viewed in one respect, Valley View could not have known during the proceedings that a 5/8 mile track would not be in the best interests of racing, and thus, could not have raised the approval of the Chester Downs' license as unfair until after the Commission’s final adjudication. Yet, at its core, Valley View's challenge is not to the award of a harness racing license to Chester Downs, but rather, is another aspect of the challenge to the comparative review process. As noted above, Valley View failed to object to the Statement of Policy and the comparative review process during the formal proceedings before the Commission, and thus, the issue has been waived. Moreover, Valley View premises its argument on the basis that both it and Chester Downs proposed a 5/8 mile track. Therefore, according to Valley View, because Chester Downs received approval of its license application, the Commission should have approved Valley View's application. The flaw with this assertion is that Chester Downs' application was not considered with other applications. While a 5/8 mile track may have been acceptable at the time, the Commission was well within its broad discretion to reject Valley View’s track design at a later time, especially when in comparison to the one mile track proposed by Bedford. Thus, for this reason alone, Valley View’s argument with respect to Chester Downs must fail. Furthermore, Valley View ignores the other reasons given by the Commission for its denial of the Valley View application, such as the slope of the track, the single entrance, and the backside paddock, as contrary to the best interests of racing.</p>
