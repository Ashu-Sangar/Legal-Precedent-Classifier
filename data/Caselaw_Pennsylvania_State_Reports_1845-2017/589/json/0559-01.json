        "text": "OPINION\nJustice BALDWIN.\nWe review whether the provisions of Megan\u2019s Law (Megan\u2019s Law II or Act) authorizing the imposition of criminal liability for failure to comply with the Act\u2019s reporting requirements are unconstitutional. In Commonwealth v. Williams, 574 Pa. 487, 832 A.2d 962 (2003) (Williams II), we severed the lifetime penalty provisions applicable to sexually violent predators (SVP) from the Act because the Act required the judge, not a jury, to determine by a diminished standard of proof whether an offender was an SVP. This determination subjected him to a punishment which exceeded the statutory maximum for failure to comply with the Act\u2019s reporting requirements. We held that the process violated the offender\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury pursuant to Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The instant matter presents a different issue. As in our recent decision in Commonwealth v. Killinger, 585 Pa. 92, 888 A.2d 592 (2005), where no SVP determination occurs, the constitutional concerns that required us to sever the penalty provisions in Williams II are absent. As a result, we find the remaining provisions of Megan\u2019s Law II, which establish criminal liability for failure to comply with the Act\u2019s requirements, are constitutional. Therefore, we reverse the order of the trial court, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nI.\nMEGAN\u2019S LAW\nMegan\u2019s Law II, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9791-9799.9, was enacted to \u201cprotect the safety and general welfare of the people of this Commonwealth by providing for registration and community notification regarding sexually violent predators who are about to be released from custody and will live in or near their neighborhood.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791(b). The Act sets forth certain reporting requirements with which an offender must comply following his release from incarceration. These requirements are not only applicable to anyone deemed a sexually violent predator (SVP), but also to an offender not designated an SVP who is convicted of one of certain predicate offenses enumerated in the Act. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1 (registration of sexual offenders). See also infra notes 3 and 4.\nMegan\u2019s Law II mandates that any offender who is convicted of any of the Act\u2019s predicate offenses must: (1) register his current residence or intended residence with state police upon release from incarceration, parole from a correctional institution, or commencement of an intermediate punishment or probation; (2) inform the state police within ten days of a change of residence; and (3) register within ten days with a new law enforcement agency after establishing residence in another state. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(a). State police officials must then forward this data, together with fingerprint and photographic information obtained from the sentencing court, See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.3(4), to the chief of police of the locality where the offender will reside, following the change of address or release from prison. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(c). Where the offender is an SVP, the police chief must then notify the offender\u2019s neighbors, day care operators and school officials within the municipality. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9798(b). The data sent to those recipients include the offender\u2019s name, address, offense, and photographic information (if available), as well as notice of the fact that he has been determined by a court to be an SVP (if such determination was made for that offender), \u201cwhich determination has or has not been terminated as of a date certain.\u201d See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9798(a). If determined to be an SVP, the offender\u2019s name and address, including any subsequent change of address, is also sent to the victim of the offense, until the victim requests that such notification be terminated. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9797; Williams II, 574 Pa. 487, 832 A.2d 962 (2003).\nMegan\u2019s Law II classifies offenders in three separate categories. Depending upon the category into which an offender fits, the Act designates the length of time he must comply with the above reporting requirements, as well as the sanction imposed for non-compliance. An offender is classified according to his adjudication as an SVP or the nature of the predicate crime for which he was convicted. The classifications are: (1) an offender adjudicated an SVP; (2) a non-SVP convicted of one of the more severe crimes enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(2) (non-SVP, lifetime reporter) ; and (8) a non-SVP convicted of one of the less severe crimes enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a)(1) (non-SVP, ten-year reporter). Once adjudicated an SVP, the offender must register pursuant to the above provisions for his lifetime. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(3). Non-SVPs convicted of one of the more serious offenses are also required to report for their lifetimes. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(2). A non-SVP convicted of one of the less severe predicate offenses must comply with the reporting provisions for a period of ten years following release. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a)(1). Failure to comply with the applicable reporting requirements results in a separate criminal offense. For those subject to the ten-year reporting requirement, failure to comply constitutes a felony of the third degree, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(1), for which the maximum penalty is seven years of incarceration. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(3). However, for those subject to the lifetime reporting requirements, either an SVP or a non-SVP lifetime reporter, failure to comply constitutes a felony of the first degree, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(2).\nII.\nBACKGROUND\nOn August 13, 2001, Appellee, Gerald F. Wilson, pled guilty to aggravated indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3125, and indecent assault, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126. Wilson was sentenced to eleven-and-a-half months to twenty-three-and a-half months of incarceration, to be followed by a ten year term of probation. Both aggravated indecent assault and indecent assault are predicate crimes under Megan\u2019s Law. Aggravated indecent assault falls within the scope of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(2), subjecting Appellee to the lifetime reporting requirements.\nOnce released from incarceration, Appellee complied with the applicable reporting requirements by registering his Spring Township, Centre County address with the Pennsylvania State Police. Subsequently, Appellee sought to move to Montana. He attempted to have his probation and parole transferred to that state; however, Montana refused to assume Appellee\u2019s supervision. Ignoring Montana\u2019s refusal, Appellee moved there. He failed to inform the Pennsylvania State Police of his move. Moreover, he failed to provide the Pennsylvania State Police with his annual address verification. Centre County\u2019s Probation Office issued a warrant for his arrest for probation violations.\nSubsequently, he was arrested in Montana, returned to Pennsylvania, and then charged with two violations of Megan\u2019s Law II for failing to register his address with the Pennsylvania State Police and failing to provide the Pennsylvania State Police with the annual address verification. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9795.2(d)(2) and 9796(e)(2). As a result, Appellee\u2019s parole was revoked and he was re-sentenced on his original conviction to an aggregate term of twenty-four to forty-eight months incarceration, to be followed by consecutive six-year terms of probation.\nIn March 2004, Appellee filed a Motion to Quash the indictment on the Megan\u2019s Law II violations. He relied on the decision of the same trial court in Commonwealth v. Killinger, 64 Pa.D. & C. 4th 369 (Ct.Com.Pl.Centre Co.2003). The trial court in Killinger, interpreting our decision in Williams II, held that the penalties for reporting violations for persons not adjudicated SVPs were unconstitutional. Id. Accordingly, the trial court granted Wilson\u2019s Motion to Quash. The Commonwealth appealed. We ordered both parties to submit additional briefs addressing the effect our opinion in Commonwealth v. Killinger, 585 Pa. 92, 888 A.2d 592 (2005) had on this matter.\nThe Commonwealth argues that the trial court erred in ruling that criminal liability for reporting violations for nonSVPs is unconstitutional. Accordingly, the Commonwealth urges a narrow reading of Williams II, arguing the decision severed only the penalty provisions that we found in violation of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), as applicable to SVPs, but did not find the entire scheme of separate criminal prosecutions for violating Megan\u2019s Law\u2019s reporting provisions unconstitutional. The Commonwealth contends that the trial court misread our holding in Williams II, and in so doing, erroneously expanded its reach. The Commonwealth also argues that our recent Killinger decision, which clarified Williams II, confirms the constitutionality of the remaining portions of Megan\u2019s Law, including the portions subjecting offenders to additional criminal prosecution for failing to comply with the Act\u2019s reporting provisions.\nAppellee Wilson agrees with the trial court and argues that convicting an offender of a first-degree felony for failing to report, register, or verify his address is unduly oppressive and unreasonable, thereby violating due process. He contends that Williams II severed all mandatory penalties of Megan\u2019s Law for all categories of offenders, not just SVPs, because \u201csuch measures are manifestly in excess of what is needed to ensure compliance.\u201d Williams II, 832 A.2d at 986. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 5. According to Wilson, convicting a violator of a first-degree felony and subjecting him to the penalties proscribed under the Sentencing Guidelines similarly constitutes manifest excessiveness and undue oppression. Wilson acknowledges that his case is similar to Killinger in that neither case involved a finding of SVP status. However, he distinguishes the case, arguing the substantive consequences of this case differ radically from Killinger based on the severity of the potential punishment Wilson faces compared to Killinger. We disagree.\nAfter a careful review of Williams II and Killinger, we agree with the Commonwealth. The portions of Megan\u2019s Law authorizing criminal prosecutions for failing to comply with the Act\u2019s reporting requirements are constitutional.\nIII.\nDISCUSSION\nResolution of this issue requires an examination of our holdings in Commonwealth v. Williams, 574 Pa. 487, 832 A.2d 962 (2003) (Williams II) and Commonwealth v. Killinger, 585 Pa. 92, 888 A.2d 592 (2005). Williams II was decided in the wake of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which held that \u201cany judicial finding which results in punishment beyond a statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In Williams II, we held that the registration, notification and counseling requirements of the Act were constitutional, while conversely holding that the mandatory lifetime punishment applicable to SVPs, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(2), for failing to comply with the registration, notification, and counseling requirements was unconstitutional.\nPursuant to Megan\u2019s Law II, SVP status was to be determined by a judge using a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.4(e)(3). Williams II, 832 A.2d at 968. Once determined to be an SVP, the offender is subjected to the Act\u2019s lifetime registration, notification, and counseling requirements. Failure to comply with the Act\u2019s requirements resulted in a conviction of a first-degree felony, with a mandatory minimum punishment of lifetime probation and a maximum penalty of lifetime imprisonment, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(2) (repealed), a penalty beyond the otherwise applicable statutory maximum of twenty years for a first-degree felony. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(1). Williams II initially required us to determine whether the registration, notification, and counseling requirements themselves constituted criminal punishment. Where an SVP is involved, if the lifetime requirements are found to be criminal punishment, Apprendi necessitates their invalidation, as the punishments would extend beyond any statutory maximum predicated on a finding by a judge employing a diminished standard of proof.\nPreviously, in Commonwealth v. Gaffney, 557 Pa. 327, 334, 733 A.2d 616, 619-20 (1999), a companion case to Williams I, to determine whether the Act\u2019s reporting requirements are penal in nature thereby constituting criminal punishment, we utilized the Artway/Verniero test promulgated by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. See Artway v. Attorney General of New Jersey, 81 F.3d 1235 (3d Cir.1996); E.B. v. Verniero, 119 F.3d 1077 (3d Cir.1997). In Williams II, Justice Saylor articulated the Artway/Verniero test as follows:\nThe Artway/Vemiero standard involves three elements, legislative (subjective) intent, objective intent or purpose[,] and effects. Under the first element, the court looks to whether the adverse effect upon the individual results from a desire by the Legislature \u201cto punish past conduct or is [instead] a by-product of a bona fide legislative effort to remedy a perceived societal problem.\u201d Verniero, 119 F.3d at 1093. The second inquiry focuses primarily upon whether analogous measures have been regarded as punishment in the past. Under this prong, the challenged statute will be deemed punitive if any of several conditions is met: (a) the measure\u2019s adverse effects cannot be explained solely by its remedial purpose; (b) similar measures have historically been considered punitive; or (c) if the legislature intended the measure to serve a mixture of deterrent and salutary purposes, the deterrent purpose is an unnecessary complement to, or overwhelms, the measure\u2019s salutary operation, or the measure operates in an unusual manner or is inconsistent with its historically mixed purposes. See Verniero, 119 F.3d at 1093. The final Artway/Verniero prong examines whether the \u201csting of a measure is so harsh as a matter of degree that it constitutes punishment.\u201d Artway, 81 F.3d 1235.\nWilliams II, 832 A.2d at 970-71 (certain citations omitted).\nHowever, at the time Gaffney was decided, the United States Supreme Court had not yet addressed whether Megan\u2019s Law\u2019s reporting requirements were unconstitutionally punitive. Since that time, the Supreme Court decided Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 123 S.Ct. 1140, 155 L.Ed.2d 164 (2003), where the Court employed its traditional two-level inquiry and held that the reporting requirements of Alaska\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law were non-punitive. The Court\u2019s traditional test requires a court to first \u201cinquire whether the legislature\u2019s intent was to impose punishment, and, if not, whether the statutory scheme is nonetheless so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the legislature\u2019s non-punitive intent.\u201d Williams II, 574 Pa. at 503, 832 A.2d at 971, citing Allen v. Illinois, 478 U.S. 364, 368-69, 106 S.Ct. 2988, 2992, 92 L.Ed.2d 296 (1986); United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 248-49, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 2641, 65 L.Ed.2d 742 (1980). To analyze the latter factor, the Supreme Court employs a balancing test of several factors first announced in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 83 S.Ct. 554, 9 L.Ed.2d 644 (1963). The MendozarMartinez factors include:\n(1) whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint; (2) whether it has historically been regarded as punishment; (3) whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter; (4) whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence; (5) whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime; (6) whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it; and (7) whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.\nWilliams II, 832 A.2d at 973, citing Mendoza-Martinez 372 U.S. at 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 554. Because Smith involved the reporting requirements of Megan\u2019s Law, we found the Supreme Court\u2019s two-pronged approach to be the proper method to analyze Pennsylvania\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law\u2019s requirements to determine whether they are unconstitutionally punitive as well. After a lengthy examination of the Mendoza-Martinez factors, we ultimately concluded that the Act\u2019s registration, notification, and counseling requirements were non-punitive. Id., 574 Pa. at 524-25, 832 A.2d at 984. The reporting requirements did not implicate the Apprendi rule. Id. However, we then examined the penalty provisions applicable to SVPs who failed to comply with the lifetime registration and verification requirements, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(2), and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9796(e)(2). We held those penalty provisions unconstitutional under Apprendi and severed them, as applicable to SVPs, from the Act. Williams II, 574 Pa. at 526-28, 832 A.2d at 985-86.\nCritical to our determination was the statutory requirement to sentence an SVP who failed to comply with a mandatory minimum term of lifetime probation up to a maximum penalty of life in prison. Appellee suggests we invalidated the provisions because they were \u201cmanifestly excessive.\u201d While we did characterize the measures as \u201cmanifestly in excess of what is needed to ensure compliance,\u201d Williams II, 574 Pa. at 527, 832 A.2d at 962, easily finding them punitive, we invalidated them because the process by which an offender was deemed an SVP could not, consistent with Apprendi, support additional criminal punishment beyond the maximum that was otherwise imposable. We elucidated this concept again in Killinger:\nThe excessiveness of the penalty in Williams II, however, merely underscored the impropriety of the penalty under Apprendi. Indeed, the penalty\u2019s excessiveness affected the outcome only insofar as excessiveness was an aspect of the inquiry regarding the punitive nature of the penalty called for under Apprendi pursuant to the factors enumerated in Mendoza-Martinez.\nKillinger, 888 A.2d at 600.\nThe SVP classification was not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, which Apprendi requires. The statute required a finding by a judge applying a lesser standard of clear and convincing evidence. Former 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.4(e)(3). Therefore, we severed the penalty portions from the Act as they applied to SVPs only, leaving the remainder of the Act intact. Since we did not specifically state in Williams II precisely which language was removed to effectuate the severance, we do so now. Former 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(2) read as follows:\nAn individual subject to registration under section 9795.1(b)(1), (2), or (3) who fails to register with the Pennsylvania State Police as required in this section commits a felony of the first degree and shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of probation for the remainder of the individual\u2019s lifetime and may be sentenced to a period of incarceration of up to the individual\u2019s lifetime.\nSimilarly, former \u00a7 9796(e)(2) provided:\nAn individual subject to registration under section 9795.1(b)(1), (2), or (3) who fails to verify his address as required in this section commits a felony of the first degree and shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of probation for the remainder of the individual\u2019s lifetime and may be sentenced to a period of incarceration of up to the individual\u2019s lifetime.\nTo be clear, the language \u201c, or (3)\u201d must be stricken from the Act in order to sever SVPs from the applicability of these punishment provisions. Further, to properly interpret the Act, as it remains applicable to certain non-SVP offenders pursuant to \u00a7 9795.1(b)(1) and (2), we must insert the word \u201cor\u201d between (b)(1) and (2) in former \u00a7 9795.2(d)(2) and \u00a7 9796(e)(2). Because our decision in Williams II dealt strictly with SVPs, we did not address the remaining offender classifications in Megan\u2019s Law II.\nIn Killinger, we answered a question left open by Williams II: whether the milder sanction imposed on non-SVP, ten year reporters who fail to comply with the Act\u2019s registration provisions, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(1) (repealed), is unconstitutional. Killinger, 888 A.2d at 593. In Killinger, the Appellee was convicted of Indecent Assault, but was not adjudicated an SVP. Thus, he fell into the category of offenders where, upon release, he was required to comply with the Act\u2019s registration and reporting requirements for a period of ten years. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a)(1). Failure to comply constituted a third-degree felony. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(1).\nKillinger was released and subsequently failed to comply with the Act\u2019s reporting requirements. He was arrested and charged with two violations under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(a)(2)(i), both third-degree felonies. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(1). He filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss the charges, claiming \u00a7 9795.2(d)(1) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion finding that Williams II \u201cinvalidated the sanctions for non-compliance applicable to non-SVP offenders as well as the mandatory lifetime sanctions for SVP offenders expressly invalidated in that case.\u201d Killinger, 888 A.2d at 596. See also Killinger, 64 Pa. D. & C. 4th at 380. We reversed and found the Act, as applied to non-SVPs, to be constitutional.\nAfter a review of Williams II, we stated:\n... the sanction challenged in this case does not offend the United States Constitution under Apprendi and progeny. The sanction attaches to Appellee pursuant to his conviction for a predicate offense under the Act, an event that in itself does not implicate the constitutional issue addressed by Apprendi. No judicial fact-finding, nor any fact-finding by a diminished standard of proof, triggered a status relevant to the severity of the penalty, as was the case in Williams II.\nKillinger, 888 A.2d at 600-01.\nThe case before us presents a constitutional challenge similar to that in Killinger. However, Appellee is classified as a non-SVP, lifetime reporter. Thus, failure to comply with the lifetime requirements results in a first-degree felony. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(2). Coincidently, the trial court in the case at bar was the same trial court that invalidated the penalty provisions for non-SVP, ten year reporters in Killing-er. Prior to the filing of our Killinger decision reversing the trial court, the trial court in the instant case granted Appellee\u2019s Motion to Quash the indictment, relying on its own decision in Commonwealth v. Killinger, 64 Pa. D. & C. 4th 369 (Ct.Com.Pl.Centre Co.2003).\nThe instant case is immediately distinguishable from Williams II. It falls within the sound reasoning of Killinger. In Williams II, the factors which led to our invalidation of the SVP penalty provisions stemmed from the process by which the SVP determination itself was effectuated. Only where a judge, rather than jury, makes an SVP determination by a diminished standard of proof was an offender subject to the lifetime penalty provisions. This violated Apprendi. Logically, then, where an offender is not adjudicated an SVP, the constitutional concerns present in Williams II are not implicated. For this reason, this part of Williams II does not control the disposition of the case at bar.\nHere, the Appellee, after being convicted of a predicate offense delineated in the Act, was\nsubject to the penalty for the underlying offense, the applicable registration provisions of Megan\u2019s Law II, and the sanctions imposed upon violation of these provisions, all of which are plainly visible on the face of the governing statute, and none of which depend on judicial fact-finding under a diminished standard of proof.\nKillinger, 888 A.2d at 600. The reporting requirements and penalties for non-compliance are merely a consequence of the offender\u2019s underlying conviction for the predicate offense and raise no Apprendi concerns. Thus, Killinger controls the disposition of this case and we find that the Act\u2019s provisions imposing criminal liability for non-compliance are constitutional.\nAppellee concedes that this case is facially similar to Killinger, yet maintains that this case should be controlled by Williams II. See Supplemental Brief for Appellee at 2. He argues that this case substantively differs from Killinger because the maximum penalty Killinger could have faced was up to seven years imprisonment, while Appellee faces a mandatory minimum penalty of lifetime probation and a maximum of lifetime imprisonment. He maintains that this penalty is excessive, and utilizes an example where an offender is merely one hour late in reporting but must then face a lifetime sanction under the strictures of the Act. In essence, Appellee argues that, due to the severity of the punishment a non-SVP, lifetime reporter faces, this case should nonetheless be controlled by Williams II. However, Appellee\u2019s excessiveness claim does not arise from Apprendi or any judicial fact finding. Rather, his claim appears to originate from an alternative claim in his Motion to Quash the indictment.\nIn his Motion to Quash, Appellee argued that sections 9795.2(d) and 9796(e) of the Act were \u201cconstitutionally infirm because they bear no rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.\u201d Further, Appellee averred that the sections \u201cviolate due process, bill of attainder, ex post facto, and cruel and unusual punishment provisions of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.\u201d See Appellee\u2019s Motion to Quash dated March 17, 2004, at 2, paragraphs 10 and 11, R. 6a. The trial court, as aforementioned, quashed the indictment relying on its opinion in Killinger, and adopted that opinion for the instant case. R. 31a. In the trial court\u2019s opinion in Killinger, it expressly declined to address similar claims made by Killinger, instead mistakenly relying on Williams II. See Killinger, 64 Pa. D. & C. 4th at 375. As such, the lower court has not thoroughly reviewed Appellee\u2019s excessiveness claim. Consequently, because Appellee\u2019s excessiveness claim is not squarely before us, we, too, decline to address it now. It must be noted, however, as the non-aggrieved party, Appellee had no duty to cross-appeal to preserve the remaining claims in his Motion to Quash and, therefore, those claims are not waived. See Pa.R.A.P. 501.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the lower court and remand the case to the trial court for consideration of Appellee\u2019s remaining claims delineated in his Motion to Quash.\nChief Justice CAPPY, and Justices CASTILLE, NEWMAN, SAYLOR and BAER join the opinion.\nJustice EAKIN flies a concurring opinion.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9791-9799.9. Act of May 10, 2000, P.L. 74, No. 18. This is the second enactment of Megan\u2019s Law. A substantial portion of \"Megan's Law I,\u201d Act of Oct. 24, 1995, P.L. 1079, Spec. Session No. 1, was ruled unconstitutional by this Court in Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 285, 733 A.2d 593 (1999) (Williams I).\n. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.4 (procedure for SVP determination); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9792 (definition of SVP).\n. The offenses that subject a non-SVP offender to the lifetime reporting requirement are 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3121 (rape); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3123 (involuntary deviate sexual intercourse); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3124.1 (sexual assault); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3125 (aggravated indecent assault); and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4302 (incest) where the victim is under 12 years of age. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(2).\n. The enumerated crimes giving rise to the ten year reporting requirement are 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2901 (kidnapping) where the victim is a minor; 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126 (indecent assault) where the offense is a misdemean- or of the first degree; 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4302 (incest) where the victim is 12 years of age or older but under 18 years of age; 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5902(b) (prostitution and related offenses) where the actor promotes the prostitution of a minor; 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5903(a)(3),(4), (5), or (6) (obscene and other sexual materials and performances) where the victim is a minor; 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6312 (sexual abuse of children); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6318 (unlawful contact with minor); and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6320 (sexual exploitation of children). Further, individuals convicted of an attempt to commit any of the above listed crimes or an attempt to commit any of the crimes listed in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(2), see supra note 3, are also subject to the ten year reporting requirement. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a)(1).\n. Prior to our decision in Williams II, failure to comply as a lifetime reporter resulted in a mandatory minimum sentence of lifetime probation and a maximum of lifetime imprisonment. See infra for a discussion on Williams II. As a result of that decision, the General Assembly repealed the penalty provisions in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(1) and (2). See Act of Nov. 24, 2004, P.L. 1243, No. 152, \u00a7 8. The penalty provisions for violations of the reporting requirements of the Act can now be found at 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4915.\nAlthough the penalty provisions have been repealed and replaced, this matter is not moot. As stated in our decisions in Williams II and Commonwealth v. Killinger, 585 Pa. 92, 888 A.2d 592 (2005), the Appellee, as well as many other litigants sentenced under the original Act have a vested interest in our decision. On November 24, 2004, the General Assembly enacted 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4915, effective January 23, 2005, which defines the criminal offenses and grading for violations of the Act\u2019s registration requirements. The section replaced the criminal liability provisions previously defined in the Act itself. Nonetheless, any offender sentenced to comply with Megan\u2019s Law II prior to the effective date of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4915 is governed by the Act\u2019s criminal liability and offense gradation provisions, not 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4915.\n. This decision was the basis for our decision in Commonwealth v. Killinger, 585 Pa. 92, 888 A.2d 592 (2005), discussed infra.\n. We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(7), which provides:\nThe Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of the courts of common pleas in the following classes of cases:\n(7) Matters where the court of common pleas has held invalid as repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, or to the Constitution of this Commonwealth ... any statute of this Commonwealth....\n. SVPs were subject to the applicable penalty provisions via then existing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(3).\n. Former 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(d)(2) provided:\nAn individual subject to registration under section 9795.1(b)(1), (2), or (3) who fails to register with the Pennsylvania State Police as required in this section commits a felony of the first degree and shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of probation for the remainder of the individual\u2019s lifetime and may be sentenced to a period of incarceration of up to the individual\u2019s lifetime.\n. Similarly, former 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9796(e)(2) provided:\nAn individual subject to registration under section 9795.1(b)(1), (2), or (3) who fails to verify his address as required in this section commits a felony of the first degree and shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of probation for the remainder of the individual\u2019s lifetime and may be sentenced to a period of incarceration of up to the individual's lifetime.\n. \u201cWords and phrases which may be necessary to the proper interpretation of a statute and which do not conflict with its obvious purpose and intent, nor any way affect its scope and operation, may be added in the construction thereof.\u201d See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1923(c).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126(a)(7).\n. The statutory maximum punishment for a third-degree felony is seven years. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(3).",
