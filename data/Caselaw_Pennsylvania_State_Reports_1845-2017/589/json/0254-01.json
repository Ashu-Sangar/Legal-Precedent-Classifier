Wimer (\u201cWimer\u201d) was not required to exhaust his contractual remedies under the PEBTF\u2019s governing plan documents?\nDid the Superior Court err as a matter of law when it concluded that the PEBTF\u2019s right to subrogation is determined as of the date when it reimbursed Wimer\u2019s medical expenses and therefore concluded that the PEBTF should be denied the right of subrogation for any medical payments made on Wimer\u2019s behalf after January 1,1998?",
