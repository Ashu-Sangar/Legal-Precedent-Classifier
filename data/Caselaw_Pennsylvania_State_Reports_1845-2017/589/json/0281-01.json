The Superior Court panel erred in raising the issue of appellant\u2019s standing to appeal sua sponte, and then quashing the appeal upon that ground. See, e.g., In re Nomination Petition of deYoung, 903 A.2d 1164 (2006) (a court is prohibited from raising the issue of standing sua sponte). Furthermore, we note that the Commonwealth agreed with appellant that he has standing to appeal in this case. Jurisdiction relinquished.",
