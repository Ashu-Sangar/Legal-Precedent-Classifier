In 1984, this Court issued an Order of disbarment on consent based upon DiAngelus’ misuse and misappropriation of client funds obtained by securing unauthorized client loans, commingling and converting client funds and failing to account for the disposition of these funds when requested to do so. We reinstated him on December 11, 1992. In 2002, DAngelus received an informal admonition resulting from an incident when he was co-counsel in a DUI matter. While DiAngelus’ co-counsel was out of the country, DAngelus, without co-counsel’s knowledge or permission, signed co-counsel’s name on a petition and verification.</p>

In the first matter, ODC alleged that in the course of his representation of Robert Closs (Closs), DAngelus lied to a magisterial district judge. In the second matter, ODC alleged that while representing Patricia Dubolino (Dubolino), DiAngelus lied to the assistant district attorney about the existence of a plea agreement with the arresting officer. The assistant district attorney relied upon this misrepresentation when advising the judge of the prosecution’s position in the matter.</p>

However, with respect to the Dubolino matter (Charge II), the Committee held that DiAngelus violated the following Rules: (1) RPC 4.1(a), which prohibits a lawyer “[i]n the course of representing a client” from “knowingly mak[ing] a false statement of material fact or law to a third person,” (2) RPC 8.4(c), which prohibits lawyers from “engaging] in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,” and (3) RPC 8.4(d), which prohibits “conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.” The Committee recommended that DiAngelus be disbarred.</p>

She was found guilty of the offense in the magisterial district court. After her conviction, the Department of Transportation (DOT) notified her that it would suspend her operating privileges for three months. Following expiration of the thirty days in which to file an appeal from the decision of the magisterial district court, Dubolino retained DiAngelus to file a civil license suspension appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>and a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>summary criminal appeal in the Court of Common Pleas. On January 31, 2001, DiAngelus appeared before the Honorable Kenneth Clouse in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County for Dubolino’s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>summary appeal. At the hearing, the Commonwealth agreed to withdraw the charge of violation of Section 1786 in exchange for Dubolino pleading guilty to the lesser charge of violation of Section 1301 of the Code, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1301 (driving unregistered vehicle prohibited).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
