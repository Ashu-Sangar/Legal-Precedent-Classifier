When the motorcycle would not start, [Ajppellant abandoned it.

Considering the murky nature of the law surrounding “layered” PCRA claims, this court finds the reasoning presented by the Supreme Court in various case holdings allows this Court to consider the merits of [Appellant's claims as long as such claims allege that prior counsel’s ineffective assistance resulted in the issue not being previously raised. <em>See Commonwealth v.

As the Commonwealth states, “[i]n no manner does this case stand for, or even address, the asserted proposition that a defendant presenting mitigating evidence during a penalty phase cannot be subject to cross-examination about the circumstances of the crime.” (Brief of Appellee at 37).

Appellant additionally argues that the jury was improperly impaneled as a result of voir dire questions from the prosecutor suggesting that prospective jurors should not be "influenced by ‘outside influences’ such as feelings of sympathy or mercy arising from mitigating evidence present in the case (in particular, Appellant's youthful age), and eliciting] promises from veniremembers who were selected as jurors that they would set aside such sympathy and mercy.” (Brief of Appellant at 15). Although Appellant refers to additional facts from the record to support this argument as to improper paneling, he fails to distinguish it from his overall legal claim. In fact, he relies on <em>Rizzuto </em>throughout <a id="p697" href="#p697" data-label="697" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*697</a>his discussion of the argument, and he fails to specify why his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise it previously.

Moreover, the only potentially available claims (those of ineffective assistance of counsel) are addressed in the brief primarily via an umbrella, introductory statement and/or in a tag-on fashion at the conclusion of each individual claim asserted.

If counsel feel the need to state waived, underlying claims outright for some purpose or purposes connected with federal habeas corpus review, this function would be more appropriately relegated to the umbrella and/or tag-on approach than would the development of the only claims that remain for this Court's review under <em>McGill (i.e., </em>the derivative claims). Counsel are certainly also free to state the underlying claim in the alternative if there is a bona fide belief that they are not waived under this Court’s present jurisprudence, but this does not excuse a correct development of a derivative claim per <em>McGill </em>if merits review on the derivative claim is also sought.</p>

The majority’s explication of <em>Lesko, i.e., </em>that it stands for the proposition that a defendant cannot claim a Fifth Amendment privilege at the penalty phase relative to matters related to credibility or the subject matter of his testimony, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion at 707, 910 A.2d at 686, is certainly correct as far as it goes. But the majority does not recognize the salient point for which Appellant references <em>Lesko, </em>namely, that the circumstances of the offense charged does not bear a sufficient relationship to credibility or life-histoiy-type mitigation testimony to support a waiver. <em>See Lesko, </em><a href="/f2d/925/1527-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="925 F.2d 1527" data-case-ids="1789169" data-case-paths="/f2d/925/1527-01">925 F.2d at 1543</a> ("We do not believe that Lesko's limited testimony constitutes a waiver of his right ... to be free from prosecutorial comment about his failure to testify about the merits of the prosecution’s case.”).</p>
