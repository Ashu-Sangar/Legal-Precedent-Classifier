The Superior Court reasoned that once Laidlaw, which furnished the only tie to Philadelphia County, was dismissed from the case, venue in the remaining action against the Rosenbaums was properly in Bucks County, where the accident occurred and where all defendants could be served. <em><a href="/a2d/822/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="822 A.2d 56" data-case-ids="9125394" data-case-paths="/a2d/822/0056-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/822/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="822 A.2d 56" data-case-ids="9125394" data-case-paths="/a2d/822/0056-01">at 58</a>.

Accordingly, the Chester County Defendants assert that filing such an objection would have been futile and frivolous and therefore prohibited by Pa.R.C.P. 1023.1, which requires attorneys to certify that the “legal contentions [in their pleadings] are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law,” and Rule 3.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which bars a lawyer from bringing or defending a proceeding unless there is a non-frivolous basis for doing so.</p>

Specifically, the Chester County Defendants argue that a plaintiff could frustrate a defendant’s right to challenge improper venue and hand-pick a favorable forum by suing an entity that regularly conducts business in the plaintiffs chosen forum but has little or nothing to do -with the case. If the non-forum defendant files preliminary objections challenging venue, the trial court, accepting all of the allegations in the complaint as true, will be compelled to deny the preliminary objections because of the inclusion of the forum defendant.

Pursuant to Rule 1006(c)(1), Plaintiff argues that she was entitled to bring the action in any county in which any defendant regularly conducted business. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1006(c)(1) (“[A]n action to enforce a joint or joint and several liability against two or more defendants ... may be brought against all defendants in any county in which the venue may be laid against any one of the defendants under the general rule of subdivisions (a) or (b).”).

This is the exclusive method to challenge venue as “improper.” A Rule 1006(e) challenge to improper venue by preliminary objection has two key components: one substantive and one procedural. Substantively, the basis for a Rule 1006(e) challenge is the defendant’s belief that venue is “improper” in the plaintiffs chosen forum. The meaning of the word improper, as used in subsection (e), is, as previously noted, shaped by Rules 2179 (providing where a personal action against a corporation may be brought), 1006(a) and (b) (providing where an action may be brought) and, relevant to this proceeding, 1006(c) (“[A]n action ... against two or more defendants ... may be brought against all defendants in any county in which <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>the venue may be laid against any one of the defendants .... ”). These rules exclusively address where venue properly may be laid at the time the suit is initiated.

Rule 1028, which limits preliminary objections to several grounds, specifically includes “improper venue” and requires all preliminary objections to be raised at once and within twenty days of service of the preceding pleading. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1026(a).

Rather, the question of whether venue is proper is a factual determination. If venue is proper, the case stays where it is filed, and, if it is not, the court must transfer it. Therefore, an objection to improper venue must be made before the case is substantially litigated, before the trial court invests resources in disposing of various motions and objections.

Preliminary objections, in turn, must be raised within 20 days after the filing of the complaint. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1026, 1028(a)(1). The dilemma is that venue, assessed under the circumstances at the time for preliminary objections, was proper; venue, assessed under the changed circumstances, was not proper. The change in circumstances occurred only after the time for preliminary objections was past. That is, the language of our Rules would not give a party the opportunity to raise a legitimate objection to venue in this situation. Put another way, our Rules seem to allow a party to manipulate venue by naming and preserving parties in a case until the time of preliminary objections is past.</p>
