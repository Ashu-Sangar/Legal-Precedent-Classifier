Thus, since a praecipe for discontinuance constitutes a final resolution of the case and has the effect of a final judgment, a trial court may consider a petition for fees filed within a period of 30 days after the filing of the praecipe. In summary, requests for counsel fees under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 2503 are part of the principal claim and must be determined as part of that claim.</blockquote>

      <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>It seems particularly reasonable to apply this rule to this case, since Garnishee, the prevailing party at trial and the proponent of the ancillary motion in question, affirmatively sought to reduce the verdict to judgment prior to the court’s disposition of the ancillary motion. In this case, there was no pressing need for Garnishee to praecipe for judgment on the first day after the deemed denial of Garnishor’s post-trial motions. <em>See Hughes v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa-super/366/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="366 Pa.

Garnishee was well aware that its motion for counsel fees was still pending and had the option of waiting until the trial court ruled on that motion before filing the praecipe for judgment.</p>

Conversely, the plain language of Rule 227.4(1)(b) offers a far more logical and legally sustainable solution, in providing that when a party praecipes for judgment after the deemed denial of post-trial motions, the judgment entered is final as to all parties, all issues, and is ready in its entirety for the appellate process. Thus, all appeals and cross-appeals would be entertained by one appellate tribunal at one time, <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>and Pandora’s Box would remain closed.

Herein, I suggest that it should be before final judgment is entered to permit an appeal from the counsel fee request to proceed as one with all other appealable issues in a case. However, I recognize that it would also be defensible to adopt a process by which all applications for counsel fees are filed after the underlying case is fully and finally adjudicated. This would at least avoid inconsistent results and permit the court deciding counsel fees to have the benefit of a complete record.</p>
      <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.2",358,[283,1983,1146,389]]]'>Nevertheless, I believe the process articulated herein remains preferable because of its inherent efficiency. To adopt a system where counsel fees follow absolute finality of the underlying litigation could double the time and substantially increase the hours counsel and the , courts spend on a case, to their and the litigants' detriment. I note that the Majority adopts neither system, and instead appears to impose on Pennsylvania the worst of all worlds; allowing for the potentiality of substantially simultaneous separate appeals in the same case, with the real possibility of inconsistent and unjust results, not to mention the likelihood of substantial delay.</p>
