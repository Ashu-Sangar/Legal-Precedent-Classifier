Acknowledging that Rule 600 does not define “release on nominal bail,” Appellant considers the definition of the term in Pa.R.Crim. P. 524(c)(4). Appellant asserts that neither the term nor concept of house arrest is contained in Pa.R.Crim.P. 524(C)(4), which defines “release on nominal bail” as:</p>

The amendment provides for the denial of bail to prisoners for whom “no condition or combination of conditions other than imprisonment will reasonably assure the safety of any person and the community.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Pa.

    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.6",198,[272,723,1157,529]]]'>The Commonwealth responds that Rule 600(E) specifically refers to “nominal bail” and not “unconditional release,” and that these terms are conceptually very different. Nominal bail is a form of bail, which by its very nature subjects defendants to conditions necessary to insure their appearance at trial and to protect the public. The Commonwealth notes that if this Court, as author of the rule, had desired to grant defendants unconditional release it could have said so, and that our use of the term “nominal bail” demonstrates our intent to allow imposition of conditions upon release.</p>
    <p id="b198-5" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[271,1279,1156,797]]]'>Turning to the constitutional issue, the Commonwealth contends that a court considering a Rule 600(E) petition requesting release on nominal bail is also bound by Article I, Section 14, the constitutional provision which, in the Commonwealth’s view, mandates that a trial court refuse release when “no condition or combination of conditions other than imprisonment will reasonably assure the safety of any person and the community.” Pa. Const. art. 1, § 14. The Commonwealth asserts that the best way to harmonize these provisions is to allow a defendant’s release upon conditions that protect the public. Indeed, the Commonwealth notes, Appellant’s construction of Rule 600(E) to prohibit the placement of conditions on release would lead to the outright denial of bail in some cases in which conditional release might have been granted.</p>

Moreover, the issue is likely to recur anytime an accused is subjected to pretrial bail conditions after being incarcerated for more than 180 days. However, it is likely to evade review because the Commonwealth must bring all criminal cases, like this one, to trial within 365 days or face a defense motion for dismissal with prejudice. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 600(A)(3) and 600(G). It would be a rare case where a defendant could petition for relief under Rule 600(E) after 180 days of incarceration, have it addressed by the trial court, and petition for review to the Superior Court and this Court before the underlying criminal case is brought to trial or the expiration of Rule 600(G)’s 365 days, requiring dismissal with prejudice.

In contrast, the drafters of Rule 600(E) signaled quite the opposite conclusion in the comments following the rule: “When admitted to nominal bail pursuant to this rule, the defendant must execute a bail bond. <em>See </em>Rules 525 and 526.” Pa.R.Crim. P. 600, cmt. The cited rules, Pa.R.Crim.P. 525 and 526, impose conditions on all defendants on bail. Rule 525, entitled “Bail Bond,” describes the purpose as well as the procedure of a bail bond: “a bail bond is a document whereby the defendant agrees that while at liberty after being released on bail, he or she will appear at all subsequent proceedings as required and comply with all the conditions of the bail bond.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 525(A). Moreover, Rule 526, entitled “Conditions of Bail Bond,” provides conditions which shall be imposed “[i]n <em>every case </em>in which a defendant is released on bail.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 526 (emphasis added). The conditions include a requirement that the defendant “appear at all times required until the full and final disposition of the case;” not intimidate witness or victims; and refrain from criminal activity. <em><a href="/pa/585/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="888 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="2472104,8998296" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0287-01,/a2d/888/0710-01">Id.</a> </em>Accordingly, a defendant released on nominal bail under Rule 600(E) is subject at least to these automatic conditions.</p>

The Commonwealth Court concluded that Rule 600 contemplated immediate release with or without the execution of a bail bond, which did not happen in the case given the detainer. The court concluded that release on nominal bail under Rule 600(E) was different from release on nominal bail pursuant to the general rules governing bail (currently numbered Pa.R.Crim.P. 524-528). The court did not consider the comment relied upon in our analysis above, which directly references the general rules of bail, in spite of a dissent based on that comment. The court also did not consider whether a defendant could be denied relief absent conditions because the trial court granted relief, nor did the court consider the impact of Article 1, Section 14, discussed below. Accordingly, we reject Appellant’s reliance on these two cases to support his plain language argument.</p>

Initially, we reject outright Appellant’s suggestion that Rule <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>600(E)’s “release on nominal bail” does not constitute bail subject to Article 1, Section 14, because the plain language of Rule 600(E) utilizes the term “bail.” As amended in 1998, Article I, Section 14, provides for bail for all prisoners except those pending trial for capital offenses or those subject to lifetime imprisonment, or “unless no condition or combination of conditions other than imprisonment will reasonably assure the safety of any person and the community.” Pa. Const. art. 1, § 14.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Courts may frequently be faced with a defendant who has been incarcerated pretrial in excess of 180 days but whom the trial court deems too dangerous to be released without conditions, as occurred in this ease. Article I, Section 14, would require the trial court to deny the defendant release under Appellant’s construction of Rule 600(E), forbidding the placement of conditions on release. This construction would result in a denial of any Rule 600 relief to this subset of defendants prior to trial or the expiration of Rule 600(G)’s 365 days, even where the trial court otherwise would have released the defendants subject to certain conditions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> This result is as absurd as it is contrary to the purpose of Rule 600 to provide relief to defendants held in pretrial incarceration in excess of 180 days. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Release may be conditioned on terms that not only give adequate assurance that the accused will appear for trial, but also assures that victims, witnesses, and the community will be protected. Accordingly, we hold that Rule 600(E) permits a trial court to impose non-monetary conditions, such as house arrest and electronic monitoring, on a defendant who might otherwise be denied release on nominal bail under Article I, Section 14. Thus, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>
