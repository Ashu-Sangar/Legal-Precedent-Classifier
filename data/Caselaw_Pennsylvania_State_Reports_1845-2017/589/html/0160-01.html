To exercise this privilege, section 1547 requires a motorist to consent to a search and seizure when suspected of DUI. The unresolved question this Court must answer is: to what does a motorist consent? Does a motorist consent to a warrantless search and seizure, an unreasonable search and seizure, or both? A fair reading of the lower court decisions in this area imply that once a motorist pulls his vehicle onto the street, he has consented to the <em>unfettered discretion </em>of the police officer to conduct a warrantless search and seizure, regardless of its reasonableness. Similarly to assuming that section 1547 bestows unfettered discretion on a police officer to choose which test to administer, the lower courts, without legal authority, have assumed that section 1547 requires a motorist to submit to unreasonable searches and seizure in this context. The lower court decisions found it sufficient to reason that, since driving is a privilege, no constitutional rights attach. I cannot agree. An analysis of the reasonableness of the search is still required.</p>

Of course, this holding would not be an absolute bar to an officer requiring one test or another. Inevitably exigent circumstances may arise that would preclude an officer from accommodating the motorist’s choice. In such a situation, it would not be unreasonable for an officer to require the motorist to submit to the only available test. Such is the nature of a balancing test.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.6",342,[270,951,1156,795]]]'>In conclusion, the Commonwealth Court’s litany of cases granting police officers in the field unfettered discretion to choose which chemical test to administer is premised on legal error. Those courts have assumed that since driving is a privilege, no constitutional rights attach. The proper inquiry is whether bestowing the unfettered discretion on a police officer meets the reasonableness requirement of our Constitutions. The majority order dismisses this case as improvidently granted. To the contrary, I believe this case presents this Court with the opportunity to correct the legal errors perpetrated by the lower courts in these eases, and answer the question this Court has never answered: whether permitting the investigative officer to mandate which chemical test to administer under section 1547 is unreasonable pursuant to the 4th Amendment and Article I, Section 8.</p>
