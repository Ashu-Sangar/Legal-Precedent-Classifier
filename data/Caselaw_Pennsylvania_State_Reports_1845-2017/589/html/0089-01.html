The newspaper maintains that, prior to the return date for the first of these subpoenas, it agreed to provide the Attorney General’s office with all available documentation deriving from the hard drives related to the subject of the investigation and to make the computer hardware available for inspection at Lancaster Newspapers’ office in the presence of newspaper personnel. Upon rejection of such conditions by the Office of Attorney General, the newspaper initiated proceedings before the judge supervising the grand jury proceedings, seeking to quash Subpoena 314. The newspaper contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the subpoena was overbroad because it required production of information that was not relevant to the grand jury investigation, and further, violated its constitutional and statutory rights, since it required production of work product materials protected by the First Amendment Privacy Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000aa-2000aa-12, and newspaper source information protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as the Pennsylvania Shield Law, 42 Pa.C.S. § 5942. The supervising judge denied the motion to quash; however, he directed that the examination of the newspaper hard drives by the Office of Attorney General would be closely limited to permit only the review of historical information concerning internet access and admonished that no document files or other content unrelated to such history were to be viewed or accessed. Lancaster Newspapers sought to appeal the supervising judge’s order and filed a motion for stay pending appeal.</p>

In June 2006, the newspaper and several employees and reporters filed with the supervising judge a petition seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>to quash the relevant grand jury investigation. The newspaper alleged that the subject matter was not appropriate to a statewide investigating grand jury, because the investigation did not involve organized crime or public corruption, did not implicate conduct within more than one county, and did not require the specialized resources of a statewide body. In furtherance of this effort to quash the investigation, the newspaper also sought access to documents related to the administration of the grand jury, including the sealed notice submitting the underlying investigation, denominated as “Notice of Submission of Investigation Number 12” (“Notice 12”). <em>See generally </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 4550 (delineating the procedure for a matter’s submission to an investigating grand jury).</p>

Thereafter, the supervising judge issued an opinion and order denying the newspaper’s jurisdictional challenge, finding that the matter under investigation fell squarely within the purview of a statewide investigating grand jury. Further, the supervising judge deemed Lancaster Newspapers to be in contempt of court and imposed a sanction of $1,000 per day for failure to comply.</p>

The Attorney General filed a petition for review from the supervising judge’s order requiring disclosure of Notice 12, coupled with a motion to seal the filing. This Court issued orders staying the effectiveness of the supervising judge’s contempt order and requirement of disclosure concerning the content of Notice 12, pending our expedited review.

The newspaper discusses a “chilling effect” that the surrender of entire computer hard drives to the government by the media will have on its ability to utilize confidential sources and to gather news information. According to the newspaper, less intrusive means were available to be utilized by the government and/or grand jury to accomplish their investigative purposes. The newspaper extensively develops its arguments concerning newspaper source protection under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the First Amendment Privacy Protection Act, and the Pennsylvania Shield Law. Further, although it recognized the amenability of individual documents to compelled disclosure in grand jury proceedings, in submissions to the supervising judge, Lancaster Newspapers analogized the transfer of computer hard drives to a surrender of entire file cabinets of the newspaper.</p>

Further, the Attorney General emphasizes that the specific information sought by Subpoena 686 — the internet history and cached content of the computer hard drives (as more particularly described in the supervising judge’s order) — is not protected from disclosure under constitutional or statutory rights or privileges. The Attorney General contends that, even if there is protected information contained on the two hard drives, the safeguards placed on the Commonwealth’s search by the lower court are adequate to guard against the disclosure of any protected information. Additionally, the Attorney General notes that compliance with Subpoena 686 will not intrude upon the newspaper’s ability to perform its newsgathering function. In this regard, his office indicates that, on August 29, 2006, the Commonwealth provided Lancaster Newspapers with duplicates of the four original hard drives currently in its possession, and the Commonwealth also has agreed to provide the newspaper with duplicates of the two hard drives identified in Subpoena 686 if and when they are produced.</p>

In my view, this Court should defer to the supervising judge’s assessment of this issue as well, which was not an abuse of the substantial discretion necessarily vested in his control over the grand jury proceedings. <em>See In re Impounded, </em><a href="/f3d/241/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="241 F.3d 308" data-case-ids="11136928" data-case-paths="/f3d/241/0308-01">241 F.3d 308</a>, 312 (3d.

The fact that the Majority’s ultimate dispositive analysis adverts to a potential chilling effect and overbreadth, however, suggests that the decision is powered by First Amendment concerns. As actual authority for overturning the trial court’s order, the Majority cites only to a single-judge opinion from the Southern District of New <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>York, which of course is not binding on this Court. <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em><a href="/f-supp/846/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="846 F.

Finally, in my mind, the fact that the subpoena could be narrower and more to the liking of the newspapers does not render it unconstitutional.
