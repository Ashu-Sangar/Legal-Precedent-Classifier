The Act sets forth certain reporting requirements with which an offender must comply following his release from incarceration. These requirements are not only applicable to anyone deemed a sexually violent predator (SVP), but also to an offender not designated an SVP<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> who is convicted of one of certain predicate offenses enumerated in the Act. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1 (registration of sexual offenders). <em>See also infra </em>notes 3 and 4.</p>

State police officials must then forward this data, together with fingerprint and photographic information obtained from the sentencing court, <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.3(4), to the chief of police of the locality where the offender will reside, following the change of address or release from prison. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.2(c). Where the offender is an SVP, the police chief must then notify the offender’s neighbors, day care operators and school officials within the municipality. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9798(b). The data sent to those recipients include the offender’s name, address, offense, and photographic information (if available), as well as notice of the fact that he has been determined by a court to be an SVP (if such determination was made for that offender), “which determination has or has not been terminated as of a date certain.” <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9798(a).

Depending upon the category into which an offender fits, the Act designates the length of time he must comply with the above reporting requirements, as well as the sanction imposed for non-compliance. An offender is classified according to his adjudication as an SVP or the nature of the predicate crime for which he was convicted. The classifications are: (1) an offender adjudicated an SVP; (2) a non-SVP convicted of one of the more severe crimes enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1(b)(2) (non-SVP, lifetime reporter) <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>; and <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>(8) a non-SVP convicted of one of the less severe crimes enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1(a)(1) (non-SVP, ten-year reporter).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Once adjudicated an SVP, the offender must register pursuant to the above provisions for his lifetime. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1(b)(3). Non-SVPs convicted of one of the more serious offenses are also required to report for their lifetimes. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1(b)(2). A non-SVP convicted of one of the less severe predicate offenses must comply with the reporting provisions for a period of ten years following release. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1(a)(1). Failure to comply with the applicable reporting requirements results in a separate criminal offense. For those subject to the ten-year reporting requirement, failure to comply constitutes a felony of the third degree, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.2(d)(1), for which the maximum penalty is seven years of incarceration. 18 Pa.C.S. § 1103(3). However, for those subject to the lifetime reporting requirements, either an SVP or a non-SVP lifetime reporter, failure to comply constitutes a felony of the first degree, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.2(d)(2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Only where a judge, rather than jury, makes an SVP determination by a diminished standard of proof was an offender subject to the lifetime penalty provisions. This violated <em>Apprendi. </em>Logically, then, where an offender is not adjudicated an SVP, the constitutional concerns present in <em>Williams II </em>are not implicated. For this reason, this part of <em>Williams II </em>does not control the disposition of the case at bar.</p>

      <em>Williams II. </em>See Supplemental Brief for Appellee at 2. He argues that this case substantively differs from <em>Killinger </em>because the maximum penalty Killinger could have faced was up to seven years imprisonment, while Appellee faces a mandatory minimum penalty of lifetime probation and a maximum of lifetime imprisonment. He maintains that this penalty is excessive, and utilizes an example where an offender is merely one hour late in reporting but must then face a lifetime sanction under the strictures of the Act. In essence, Appellee argues that, due to the severity of the punishment a non-SVP, lifetime reporter faces, this case should nonetheless be controlled by <em>Williams II. </em>However, Appellee’s excessiveness claim does not arise from <em>Apprendi </em>or any judicial fact finding. Rather, his claim appears to originate from an alternative claim in his Motion to Quash the indictment.</p>
    <p id="b751-5" data-blocks='[["BL_751.5",751,[219,1229,1158,1146]]]'>In his Motion to Quash, Appellee argued that sections 9795.2(d) and 9796(e) of the Act were “constitutionally infirm because they bear no rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.” Further, Appellee averred that the sections “violate due process, bill of attainder, <em>ex post facto, </em>and cruel and unusual punishment provisions of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.” <em>See </em>Appellee’s Motion to Quash dated March 17, 2004, at 2, paragraphs 10 and 11, R. 6a. The trial court, as aforementioned, quashed the indictment relying on its opinion in <em>Killinger, </em>and adopted that opinion for the instant case. R. 31a.

It must be noted, however, as the non-aggrieved party, Appellee had no duty to cross-appeal to preserve the remaining claims in his Motion to Quash and, therefore, those claims are not waived. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 501.</p>
