Appellant, John McClintic, burglarized and robbed the home of his 85-year-old neighbor while she was sleeping on June 27, 2002, and again on July 5, 2002. On June 27, 2002, at 2:00 a.m., Appellant broke into the victim’s home, entered her bedroom where she was sleeping, sat on the edge of the bed, and told her that he had a gun and wanted her money. Appellant then took some cash from a wallet and grabbed the victim’s breast, pinched it, and left. Although the victim recognized Appellant as her neighbor, she did not report the incident. Eight days later, Appellant again appeared in the victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night, informed the victim he was armed, and demanded money and jewelry. After taking some cash and jewelry, Appellant struck the victim across the thigh and fled.</p>

Appellant appealed to the Superior Court, arguing that Section 9714(a)(2) authorizes a single sentence enhancement per criminal episode, which, in this case, he defined as each group of related crimes committed at a particular time and place, rather than for each separate crime of violence committed during a single criminal episode. <em>See Commonwealth v. McClintic, </em><a href="/a2d/851/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="851 A.2d 214" data-case-ids="9235122" data-case-paths="/a2d/851/0214-01">851 A.2d 214</a> (Pa.Super.2004).

    <p id="b647-5" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[228,810,1158,766]]]'>Despite this conclusion, the Superior Court also noted that accepting Appellant’s argument would advance the purpose of the Three Strikes Law, which is to ensure that persons who continue to commit violent crimes are incapacitated by a prison sentence of at least twenty-five years. Noting that the enhancement is considerable, the Superior Court reasoned that mandating enhanced sentences for each individual crime of violence in a given criminal episode or encounter could potentially result in draconian sentences for a single criminal transaction. Despite these concerns, the Superior Court felt constrained by the language of Section 9714(a)(2) to conclude that the trial court correctly imposed an enhanced sentence for each enumerated offense of which Appellant was found guilty.</p>

Appellant argues that Section 9714(a)(2) authorizes a single sentence enhancement per criminal episode. The term “offense” in Section 9714(a)(2) is ambiguous, argues Appellant, and, although the definition provided by the Superior Court is plausible, “offense” generally means a group of related crimes committed at a particular time and place. Because of this ambiguity, Appellant urges this Court to look to legislative intent, which <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>Appellant asserts was to incapacitate repeat offenders from committing further crimes. The triggering offense requires an enhanced sentence because it confirms the offenders’ continuing danger to society and the need to counter that threat through incapacitation. Appellant argues that an offender is no more a recidivist when he commits two crimes of violence in one criminal episode than when a similar episode involves only one crime of violence.

The General Assembly chose to use the word “offense,” argues the Commonwealth, rather than “transaction,” and was clearly familiar with the concept of transaction as it used the word elsewhere in Section 9714(a)(2). The Commonwealth urges us to define offense as it is unambiguously used and defined elsewhere: “a violation of the law; a crime; often a minor one,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1108 (7th ed.1999); <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1991 (defining crime as “any indictable offense”); 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(g) (equating the term offense with specific statutory infractions); Sentencing Guidelines Implementation Manual §§ 303.3, 303.15 (5th ed.1997) (assigning an offense gravity score to each crime committed, regardless of whether one or more episodes were involved). The Commonwealth argues that far from confusing the words offense and transaction, Titles 18 and 42 carefully distinguish between them. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 1123(a)(1), 1515(a)(1), <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>6303(a)(5) (providing that “summary offenses ... arising out of the same criminal episode or transaction” as a delinquent act are within the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court); 18 Pa.C.S. § 110(1)(ii) (barring a new prosecution for an “offense ... arising from the same criminal episode” as a prior crime of which the accused was previously acquitted or convicted).

The language of Section 9714(a)(2) subjects to mandatory minimum sentences those persons who “at the time of the commission of the current offense” had previously been “convicted of two or more such crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions.” This language makes clear that Section 9714(a)(2) contemplates offenders that have committed more than three crimes of violence. Section 9714(g) defines “crime of violence” to include burglary and robbery, among others. Thus, the sentence enhancement applies to a person who is convicted of robbery or burglary and has previously been convicted of two <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>or more crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions. There is no dispute that Appellant had previously been convicted of aggravated assault and robbery, both predicate “crimes of violence” as defined in Section 9714(g). Therefore, the language of Section 9714(a)(2) requires a sentence enhancement for Appellant because he was convicted of a crime of violence, robbery or burglary, and “at the time of the commission of the current offense” had two convictions for predicate crimes. The question is whether the sentence enhancement applies twice, once each for the robbery and burglary, even though these crimes were undisputedly part of a single criminal episode.</p>

This phrase is used twice in Section 9714, first in subsection (a)(1) and a second time in subsection (a)(2). To determine its meaning in the context of Section 9714(a)(2), it is necessary to determine its meaning in the context of Section 9714(a)(1). This phrase is comprised of two components: “current,” and “offense.” There is no dispute that “current” refers simply to the criminal activity that was charged at the current trial, upon which the defendant is being sentenced.</p>

This is so because Section 9714(a)(1), which provides for a sentence enhancement for two-strike offenders, begins “[a]ny person who is convicted in any court of this Commonwealth of a crime of violence shall, if at the time of the commission of the current offense the person has previously been convicted of a crime of violence, be sentenced to a minimum of at least ten years of total confinement.... ” Only when the offense underlying the second conviction involves a crime of violence can Section 9714(a)(1) be invoked. Therefore, the Section 9714(a)(1) sentence enhancement applies when a person is currently convicted of a crime of violence, and at the time he committed that particular, or current, crime of violence, he had one prior conviction for a crime of <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>violence.

Plugging this crime of violence into Section 9714(a)(1) requires a sentence enhancement where a person is convicted of robbery, if at the time he or she committed the current robbery, the person had another conviction for a crime of violence.</p>

Instead, the legislature began subsection (a)(2) simply “where the person had at the time of the commission of the current offense.... ” The phrase “current offense” has the same meaning in both subsections (1) and (2), and, again, refers back “crime of violence” as used in subsection (1).

We disagree with both parties, however, that defining “current offense” answers the question before us. “Current offense” in Section 9714 means the crime of violence for which the defendant was charged at the current trial and upon which the defendant is being sentenced. Here, Appellant was sentenced for two crimes of violence arising out of the June 27 incident: robbery and burglary. Either of these crimes standing alone qualifies as a “current offense” for which a sentence enhancement is appropriate. The question we must now address is whether <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>each crime of violence requires its own sentence enhancement.

Use of the word “such,” a demonstrative adjective, refers to an antecedent, or a category of things previously mentioned. The category of things previously mentioned is “current offense,” which we have defined as “crime of violence.” Use of the word “such” before the clause “crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions” serves to limit the current offense or crimes of violence to which the sentence enhancement applies to those “crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions.” Thus, close examination of the specific statutory language, the polestar of all statutory construction, reveals that the legislature intended to apply sentencing enhancements for all crimes arising from a criminal transaction, rather than for each individual crime within such transaction.</p>

Relevantly, appellant was convicted of a June 27 robbery and burglary, and another robbery and burglary occurring July 5. Because of his past convictions, his sentences for all of these crimes were controlled by the <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>“Three Strikes Law.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(a)(2).

    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[272,573,1154,763]]]'>Section 9714(a)(2) requires a 25-year mandatory minimum sentence be imposed if the defendant had two or more prior convictions of violent crimes when he committed the current offense. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714(a)(2). The majority interprets “current offense” to mean “the crime of violence for which the defendant was charged at the current trial and upon which the defendant is being sentenced,” Majority Op., at 480, 909 A.2d at 1250, and acknowledges either robbery or burglary, “standing alone[,] qualifies as a ‘current offense’ for which a sentence enhancement is appropriate.” <em>Id., </em>at 480, 909 A.2d at 1250. However, the majority then concludes these crimes for some reason do not stand alone, holding that because appellant committed these offenses in the same criminal episode, only the sentence for one of these crimes may be enhanced.</p>
    <p id="b660-6" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[266,1381,1155,754]]]'>The majority reaches this conclusion by a somewhat labored interpretation of the simple language of the statute, specifically the phrase “previously been convicted of two or more such crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions.” <em>Id., </em>at 481, 909 A.2d at 1250. The word “such” is somehow said to refer to “current offense,” which it clearly does not. The word does indeed refer to an antecedent, as it modifies the words next to it, “crimes of violence,” an antecedent term defined previously in the statute. It does not abut, modify, or even refer to “current offense” — it manifestly speaks to a defendant’s prior convictions, in this case appellant’s record before commission of the present offenses. It certainly does not infer any legislative intent concerning multiple offenses before the sentencing court.</p>

      <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>Indeed, as the majority notes, the legislature wanted to be sure the prior “strikes” were distinct, with an opportunity to reform between each; hence, the language in the above phrase dealing with prior convictions. However, nowhere is there an indication the legislature wanted to limit enhancement for multiple violent crimes occurring after two distinct opportunities to reform were not taken. There is no “separate criminal transaction” language when the legislature speaks of the present crimes. The quoted “single transaction” language appears only when speaking of the record that triggers enhancement. “Single transaction” is a concept obviously in the legislature’s awareness, making its absence when speaking to enhancement of sentences for the present crimes indicative of a legislative intent to the contrary of the majority’s conclusion. I suggest the language is sufficiently clear that we need not even reach legislative intent, but if we do, that intent is manifestly in line with the sentence imposed here.</p>
    <p id="b661-4" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[241,1245,1153,521]]]'>The events of June 27 may comprise but one transaction if considered for purposes of determining appellant’s prior record — it would only be one “strike” — but that is not the question. The question is whether, once sufficient separate prior convictions are established, all subsequent crimes of violence, be they in one episode or 20, are enhanced. It seems clear that once appellant was shown to have been convicted of two prior qualifying crimes of violence, the statute requires enhancement of sentence for every violent felony committed thereafter, not just some of them.</p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.6",661,[241,1791,1151,470]]]'>If the statute applies (and all agree it does), which crime from June 27 is enhanced under the majority’s premise, the robbery or the burglary? Where is the legislative intent to make the court choose but one, or guidance on which of the two to choose? The language is to the contrary — that the court “shall” impose the enhanced sentence for the offense, not the “transaction.” This is not sentencing appellant as a “third and fourth offender” — it is sentencing him as a multiple offender with two prior violent convictions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
