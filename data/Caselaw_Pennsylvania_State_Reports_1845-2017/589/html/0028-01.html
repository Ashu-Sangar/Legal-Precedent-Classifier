After finding that the Commonwealth met its burden of demonstrating due diligence and that the circumstances occasioning the delay were beyond its control, the two criteria for an extension of time in Rule 600(G), the trial court denied Appellant relief.</p>

Appellant points out that in <em>Matis, </em>the only matter before us was whether the Commonwealth could extend the period for the running of Rule 600(G) by the length of the delay caused by its pretrial appeal. She stresses that Rule 600(E) unequivocally entitles defendants held pending trial in excess of 180 days to immediate release on nominal bail while Rule 600(G) incorporates the potentiality of extensions of time for said appeals or similar delays. Appellant further notes that the Superior Court decision could subject every incarcerated defendant, who is clothed with the presumption of inno<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>cence, to indefinite incarceration prior to trial based on delays attributable only to the Commonwealth.</p>

Sipe-Dixon, </em>1844 MDA 2005 (filed November 3, 2005). Thus, the Commonwealth argues that the question presented here is moot because Appellant is no longer being held in pretrial incarceration, and instead is currently serving her sentence. The Commonwealth also maintains that, if we find error in the decisions below, the error is harmless because Appellant has been credited with all time she served in pretrial incarceration. In the alternative, the Commonwealth contends that Appellant’s original motion for release on nominal bail was properly denied by the trial court, and in lieu of argument, adopts the rationale set forth by the courts below. Thus, the Commonwealth avers that we should dismiss this appeal or affirm on the merits.</p>

Thus, absent unusual circumstances which would prolong the Rule 600(G) 365-day period without imperiling the prosecution, the issue before us will repeat itself and yet evade review. Given a defendant’s right to be free from prolonged pretrial incarceration; the district attorney’s right, as a representative of the citizenry, to prosecute criminal conduct; and the reality that these questions will recur and yet evade review, it is appropriate that we address the merits. <em>See id; see also Commonwealth v.

We begin our analysis by examining this matrix. Rule 600(A)(2) provides that when a defendant is incarcerated, trial shall commence no later than 180 days from the date the criminal complaint is filed. Rule 600(E), which lies at the heart of the controversy herein, is a corollary to Rule 600(A)(2), providing that no defendant shall be held in pretrial incarceration for a period exceeding 180 days. If a defendant is so held, he shall be entitled to immediate release on nominal bail upon petition. Rule 600(E), however, provides for excludable time in accord with Rule 600(C).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> This Rule allows that in computing the running of the 180 days, delays resulting from defendant’s actions or requests shall be excluded.

Rule 600(A)(3) provides that in a case where defendant is at liberty on bail, a trial shall commence no later than 365 days from the date a written complaint is filed. As the corresponding enforcement provision, Rule 600(G) provides that if a defendant is on bail for more than 365 days without trial commencing, the charges against the defendant shall be dis<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>missed with prejudice.

The renumbering became effective on April 1, 2001. It would unnecessarily complicate an already somewhat cumbersome analysis to refer to the applicable sections of Rule 1100 herein and then correlate them to Rule 600. Accordingly, for the sake of convenience and clarity, we will substitute the applicable provisions of Rule 600 for the cited provisions in <em>Matis </em>to old Rule 1100, as to do so will not result in substantive inaccuracy.</p>

A relatively recent amendment to Article I, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution permits courts to deny bail when "no condition or combination of conditions other than imprisonment will reasonably assure the safety of any person in the community." Pa. Const. Art. I, § 14. This constitutional provision supersedes the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and provides any court with the authority to deny nominal bail after 180 days if release would endanger the safety of any person. In this regard, in <em>Sloan, </em><a href="/pa/589/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="589 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="2572144" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0015-01">589 Pa. at 15</a>, 907 A.2d at 460, a companion case being filed simultaneously with this matter, we have held that when a defendant is released on nominal bail in accord with Rule 600(E), reasonable conditions can be imposed to ensure a defen<a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>dant’s appearance at trial and to protect the public. The trial court's ability to deny bail altogether pursuant to Article I, Section 14, and its ability to set conditions for the release on nominal bail in accordance with our decision in <em>Sloan </em>is protective of the public interest, while this case is protective of a defendant’s right to not be held indefinitely in pretrial detention. This strikes an appropriate balance between society’s substantial interest in its safety and a confined defendant’s substantial right to not be indefinitely held in pretrial confinement.</p>
