C.S. § 9711(e)(3), but he did not frame the evidence in such <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>terms in his closing remarks to the jury. Moreover, in its charge to the jurors, the trial court did not mention the catchall mitigator authorizing consideration of “[a]ny other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense,” 42 Pa. C.S. § 9711(e)(8), and counsel voiced no objection, although this was the only category of mitigation within which the affirmative evidence that counsel had presented in the penalty phase potentially could be assessed. The jurors unanimously found the aggravating circumstances alleged by the Commonwealth to have been established beyond a reasonable doubt,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and each juror determined that Appellant had failed sufficiently to establish any mitigating circumstance, thus requiring the imposition of a death sentence. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv) (prescribing that “the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d) and no mitigating circumstance or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances”).</p>

Appellant averred, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial counsel failed to investigate, develop, and present mitigating evidence concerning his life history and mental-health condition, including evidence of abuse and neglect suffered during his childhood and major mental health impairments, for example, cognitive disorder diminishing, <em>inter alia, </em>his ability to reason, make sound judgments, and control impulses. According to the petition, the “good worker” evidence that counsel did actually adduce was paltry and dwarfed by the other available and compelling mitigation. The petition averred that counsel’s deficient stewardship stemmed from his failure to undertake a sufficient and reasonable mitigation investigation, in-<a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>eluding failures to speak with readily available life-history witnesses, obtain medical and social history records, and explore mental-health issues that were obviously of potential relevance as indicated by the circumstances of Appellant’s background and his offenses. Further, Appellant alleged that a mental-health expert, with knowledge of Appellant’s violent, chaotic, and unhappy childhood, and his history of cognitive and psychological impairments, would have explained to the jury the long-lasting and debilitating effects of such conditions, including the impact on Appellant’s affect and behavior, thus suggesting some lesser degree of moral culpability in terms of the decision whether to impose a life or death sentence. The petition also alleged that the abjectness of counsel’s deficient performance was manifested by his confusion connected with the presentation of mitigation; his failure to adequately develop the mitigation claim deriving from Appellant’s asserted intoxication; and the basic failure to obtain an instruction under Section 9711(e)(8) of the death penalty statute to furnish the jury with some framework for considering the limited evidence that counsel did adduce, or at least to lodge an objection to the omission of such charge. Finally, the petition averred that Appellant’s counsel on direct appeal was ineffective for omitting from the appeal any challenge to trial counsel’s stewardship, which allegedly would have required relief from the death sentence.</p>

Most of these declarants indicated that trial counsel never spoke to them and that they would have been willing to testify on Appellant’s behalf at trial; as to Appellant’s mother, she acknowledged having had conversations with counsel, but she indicated that counsel never broached the subject of Appellant’s background or childhood abuse with her, or asked her to testify in the penalty phase.</p>

The post-conviction proffer also included Appellant’s medical records evidencing: an early incident of hospitalization, in which a physician noted that he suffered from malnutrition, dehydration, and jaundice possibly due to sepsis; Appellant’s 1976 vehicle accident in which he suffered a “blow-out type fracture of the left orbit and lateral wall of the maxilla,” reported memory loss, and exhibited drifting and poor responses of his eyes; educational records showing poor achievement and sub-normal performance testing; and juvenile records reflecting Appellant’s status as a “loner,” his report that his step-father barred him from the household during his teenage years, the indication of a juvenile counselor that “[rjecords seem to verify [Appellant’s] view-point inasmuch as they indicate the step-father to be negligent in his duties,” and the counselor’s statement that “[t]here does not seem to be any functioning going on in terms of social experience.” The submission also included police reports containing witness statements regarding Appellant’s unusual behavior after the killing.</p>

Indeed, the PCRA court was able facially to support a conclusion that counsel was effective on this record only by characterizing the case in fairly abstract terms — for example, by focusing on the testimony that counsel questioned Appellant’s mother “a lot,” <em>Gorby, </em>No. 555(a)(b) 1986, <em>slip op. </em>at 4, as opposed to taking into account the content of the conversations, including the specific information that was actually known by and/or furnished to counsel and the omission of any inquiry into potential mitigation avenues such as childhood abuse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Furthermore, the PCRA court’s approach to the issue of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness is untenable, as it rests solely upon a finding that counsel’s truncated investigation was a sufficient one, at the same time as it expressly accepts <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>that well-traveled avenues of mitigation were not pursued during the course of the limited inquiry that was made.</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[227,454,1156,940]]]'>The PCRA court also incorrectly credited counsel’s reliance on witness conclusions as to critical matters (such as an indication from Appellant’s mother that he suffered no mental infirmity), to foreclose additional inquiry, despite counsel’s actual knowledge of circumstances that should have prompted at least some further investigation (for example, Appellant’s irrational behavior after his crimes; his “rough childhood”; his dependency on intoxicating substances; his poor educational achievement and test results despite normal intelligence; and the known incidence of head injury). One of Appellant’s attorney witnesses likened such a course of conduct to a physician who, on considering a description of symptoms by a patient suffering from a disease, offers the patient a clean bill of health without examination or testing, because the patient did not specify a diagnosis. <em>See </em>N.T., October 15, 2004, at 45. While such analogy is not a perfect one, it does cast some illumination on this substantial weakness in the PCRA court’s reasoning.</p>

Furthermore, and particularly as trial counsel’s actual presentation at the penalty phase of trial was remarkably weak,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> we find it reasonably probable that at least one juror might have decided differently had an effective presentation been made, and thus, might have averted a death sentence. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv). Accordingly, we conclude that the arguable merit prong of inquiry into the effective assistance of appellate counsel is established. <em>See generally McGill, </em>574 Pa. at 587-88, 832 A.2d at 1022-23 (explaining the interrelationship between the three-prong ineffectiveness inquiry relative to a waived claim of ineffective <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>assistance of trial counsel and the arguable-merit aspect of a layered claim of deficient stewardship on the part of appellate counsel).</p>

We also agree with Appellant that the ineffectiveness claim was substantially stronger than the claims that were raised on direct appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Finally, we find the prejudice criterion of the ineffectiveness inquiry satisfied, since had appellate counsel raised the issue in appropriate terms, relief in the form of a new sentencing proceeding should have been afforded at the direct-appeal stage, based on the same set of circumstances that require such an award at this juncture.</p>

It is enough to note that appellant bore the burden of proof; that counsel’s demise does not discharge appellant’s burden to prove that counsel could not have had a reasonable basis for his strategic decisions on appeal; and that we do not know on this record what sort of investigation was actually undertaken by appellate counsel, what sort of appellate strategy he adopted, and what sort of cooperation he received from appellant and his family. <em>Contrast May, supra.</em>

The fact that later decisions of this Court and the U.S. Supreme Court have faulted the penalty phase investigations of certain trial lawyers, under certain facts, does not necessarily prove that all reasonable appellate lawyers were required to raise such claims in 1989-<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>90, which is when appellant’s direct appeal was briefed and argued by counsel.

I fail to see any relevance in this sort of testimony whatsoever. Certainly, lawyers learned in the law, and experienced in criminal defense appeals, have a reasonable pretension to specialized knowledge in this area and, if the question were one for a jury, their opinions may be relevant. But such opinions are not relevant to the ultimate <em>Strickland </em>question courts must decide upon collateral attack. The question of constitutional effectiveness is decided only by jurists, and a judge is hardly in need of the “expert” testimonial views of lawyers in order to make that determination. Courts are at least equally suited to assess attorney performance; indeed, given the obvious potential for bias on the part of lawyers caught in an adversarial system, courts are better situated. If the approach were otherwise, all PCRA hearings would be reduced to contrasting “expert” opinions from lawyers presented by the defense (and countered by the opinions of prosecution “experts”) as to just who was ineffective (and who wasn’t) in the conduct of a trial. Also, if the approach were otherwise, this Court and the Superior Court could be inundated with the “expert” views of lawyer amici telling us how we should decide <em>Strickland </em>questions. The role of lawyers on the question of ineffectiveness is as advocates, not as experts; anything an “expert” would say from the stand, the defendant’s lawyer can simply argue from the bar or, more properly, argue in the brief. Thus I, for one, do not view the opinion testimony of lawyers as relevant proof of the effective<a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>ness, or lack of effectiveness, of the defendant’s prior counsel. <em>See Commonwealth v.

On the separate question of the appellate standard of review, I agree with the Chief Justice that, evidentiary and credibility questions aside, no particular deference is due to a PCRA judge’s determination of the <em>Strickland </em>question.
