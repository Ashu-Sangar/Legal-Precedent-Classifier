Prior to the March 8, 2005 filing deadline, Candidate filed a nominating petition to have his name placed on the ballot for the Democratic Primary Election for the position of Philadelphia Traffic Court Judge. He included with his papers a Financial Statement in accordance with Section 1104(b) of the Ethics Act. Thereafter, on March 15, 2005, Objector filed a petition to set aside Candidate’s nomination petition on the basis that the Financial Statement submitted by Candidate contained a material omission, which rendered the Financial Statement, as well as the nominating petition fatally defective. Specifically, Objector alleged that Candidate failed to enter information regarding income Candidate derived from rental properties in Block 10 of the Financial Statement relating to “Direct or Indirect sources of Income” in accordance with Section 1105(b)(5) of the Ethics Act, which requires the person filing a Financial Statement to provide the name and address of any direct or indirect source of income totaling $1300 or more. Specifically, Objector claimed that Candidate indicated “None” in Block 10 when, in fact, he owned rental property that provided him with a source of income.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thereafter, Candidate sought to amend his Financial Statement and, in fact, filed an amended statement on March 21, 2005. Therein, Candidate <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>disclosed monies he derived from rental properties as a source of income in Block 10.</p>

The Commonwealth Court noted that although our Court in <em>Benninghoff </em>permitted a candidate to amend his Financial Statement despite its technical defect-namely, his failure to list his then current position as state representative as a source of income-we did so based upon the fact that the omitted information could be “facially obtained from information provided on the form as a whole.” <a href="/pa/578/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="852 A.2d 1182" data-case-ids="1329325,9239204" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0402-01,/a2d/852/1182-01">852 A.2d at 1187</a>. Specifically, in <em>Benninghoff, </em>an incumbent state representative seeking reelection failed to list his employment as a state representative in Block 10 (Direct and Indirect Sources of Income) of the financial interest form. Elsewhere on the form, however, in Blocks 4, 5, and 6, he variously listed his occupation or profession as a state representative (Block 4), indicated his status as an official or employee of the relevant state district (Block 5), and listed state representative as his profession (Block 6). <em><a href="/pa/578/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="852 A.2d 1182" data-case-ids="1329325,9239204" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0402-01,/a2d/852/1182-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/578/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="852 A.2d 1182" data-case-ids="1329325,9239204" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0402-01,/a2d/852/1182-01">at 1184</a>.

Following objection, Anastasio admitted that he had such income for the relevant calendar year and that, therefore, his response to Block 10 indicating “none” was in error. Nevertheless, he maintained that his omission was unintentional and harmless, as he had provided the information on his financial form to the best of his knowledge and belief. <em>Id. </em>at 881.</p>

The <em>Benninghoff </em>majority emphasized that Section 1104(b)(3) of the Ethics Act specifies that "[fjailure to file the [Financial Statement] in <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to any other penalties provided, be a fatal defect to a petition to appear on a ballot.” Further, the "provisions of this chapter” in Section 1105(b) require a candidate to report any income of over $1300. Under Section 1101.1, which states that the Act is to be "liberally construed to promote complete financial disclosure,” we determined that an omission in a certain block of the disclosure form does not invalidate the entire Financial Statement if the pertinent information is disclosed elsewhere on the face of the document.</p>

In the determination of whether a defect in a candidate’s financial disclosure qualifies as fatal, the inquiry does not turn on the <em>mens rea </em>of the candidate in completing the form, <em>i.e., </em>whether or not the candidate thought he was fully disclosing his assets, nor does the inquiry hinge on the availability of information in public records outside of the information disclosed. The public policy animating the Act is to allow the electorate to determine both the source of a candidate’s income and identify the candidate's debtors from the financial statement alone.</p>
