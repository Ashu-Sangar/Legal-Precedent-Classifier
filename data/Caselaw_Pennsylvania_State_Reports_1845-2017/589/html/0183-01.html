Dr. Burmeister then removed the lesion from Decedent’s left temple, and, in due course, exited the room. Nurse Welsh also left the room, leaving the door open. Both Dr. Burmeister and Nurse Welsh returned on occasion to check on Decedent; however, at some point, while unattended, Decedent fell from the examination table to the floor, undisputedly suffering injury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Decedent <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>testified that he did not know exactly how or why he fell, but that after being left lying on his right side, he felt his body roll to the right and fall to the floor. After hearing the loud noise that resulted from the fall, Nurse Welsh, Dr. Burmeister and other employees discovered Decedent on the floor and helped place him back on the examination table.</p>
    <p id="b368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_368.6",368,[275,670,1152,465]]]'>Defendants’ testified, contrary to Decedent, that from the start of the operation Decedent was placed on his back in the center of the examination table. Following the operation, they claimed Decedent was left in this position and that they then left the room and continued to check on Decedent until they heard a thud and rushed into the room to find him on the floor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> All agree that Defendants and other employees of the Doctor Burmeister placed Decedent back onto the examination table and rendered prompt care.</p>

Quinby alleged that Dr. Burmeister negligently provided medical care to Decedent by failing to position Decedent properly on the examination table, failing to use side rails or another restraining system on the examination table, failing to assess Decedent’s fall risk, failing to monitor Decedent subsequent to the operative procedure, failing to supervise Nurse Welsh by instructing her to not leave the Decedent, and generally failing to adopt and enforce rules for the safety of patients left on examination tables. Quinby alleged separately that Nurse Welsh was negligent in providing nursing care by failing to position Decedent properly on the examination table, failing to restrain Decedent, failing to assess Decedent’s fall risk after the operative procedure, and leaving Decedent unattended. Quinby also brought counts against Defendants for negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of consor<a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>tium, and failure to obtain informed consent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> After Quinby filed the complaint, Decedent died, allegedly from complications arising from the fall, and the parties filed a stipulation to amend the complaint to include a count for wrongful death and reflect the parties’ understanding that the complaint transmuted to a survival action upon Decedent’s death. Prior to his death, Decedent testified in a pre-trial discovery deposition and in a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Quinby called as her expert Bradley Fenton, M.D. Dr. Fenton opined that Defendants had not complied with the standard of care, which required them to ensure that Decedent was left safely and securely on the examination table at all times. Further, Dr. Fenton stated that he was unaware of how, absent extrinsic forces not present in this situation, a quadriplegic could fall from an examination table without there being a breach of the requisite standard of care.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> In any event, Dr. Fenton testified that someone should have stayed in the room with Decedent or he should have been secured to the examination table with side rails or straps. Dr. Fenton concluded that Defendants failed to provide Decedent with a safe environment for the entire time he was in the office. Although Dr. Fenton formed this opinion and wrote his report prior to reviewing Defen<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>dants’ deposition testimony that they left Decedent on his back, he stated that upon reviewing these depositions, he concluded that they offered nothing to change his opinion or conclusion that someone should have remained in the room with Decedent, or that he should have been placed on a table with rails or straps.</p>
    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[252,665,1157,797]]]'>Defendants presented the expert testimony of Joseph Bender, M.D., who asserted that leaving a quadriplegic lying in the center of the examination table would be safe, and there was simply no reason for Dr. Burmeister to expect, given the circumstances and Decedent’s past medical history of twenty-five years with no falls in the office, that Decedent would be able to move himself on the table.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Dr. Bender did testify that notwithstanding a quadriplegic’s general inability to move, some quadriplegic’s do occasionally have muscle spasms. However, Dr. Bender also testified that he was unaware of any spasm strong enough to throw Decedent’s motionless body off the table and onto the floor. Dr. Burmeister in this regard testified that he cared for Decedent since the accident rendering him a quadriplegic nineteen years before, and was unaware that Decedent had ever had muscle spasms.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Additionally, Quinby sought to introduce the audio portion of a videotape Decedent had made twenty-two months prior to his fall describing his life and interactions with family and friends as a quadriplegic, which Decedent had intended for use as an educational tool for <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>students. Quinby offered that the audio track would allow the jury to hear the strength and character of Decedent’s voice and thereby his condition prior to the accident. Quinby also sought to introduce the videotape of Decedent’s <em>de bene esse </em>deposition, taken the day before he died, which would have permitted contrast of his condition before and after the accident. Upon Defendants’ objections, the trial court refused to permit admission of the audio portion of the video taken of Decedent prior to the accident depicting his life as a quadriplegic because the trial court believed that a demonstration of Decedent’s strength prior to the fall was irrelevant to “the ultimate issue.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Moreover, the trial court refused to permit the showing of the <em>de bene esse </em>video tape, but, instead, allowed a transcript of the deposition to be read into the record.</p>

        <em>13</em>

      <em> </em>The trial court declined to do so because it found that Quinby failed to establish either that Decedent’s fall from the examination table was of the kind that usually does not occur in the absence of negligence, or that other causes, such as Decedent’s conduct, were eliminated by the evidence. The jury, without being charged on <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>returned a verdict in favor of Defendants, finding that Dr. Burmeister and Nurse Welsh were not negligent. On February 18, 2003, Quinby <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>filed a post-trial motion for judgment n.o.v. or a new trial pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 227.1, which the trial court denied. Judgment was entered for Defendants and Quinby appealed.</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[270,505,1152,574]]]'>On appeal, Quinby first asserted that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>because the circumstances were such that Quinby was entitled to an inference of negligence. The Superior Court agreed, concluding that the indicated negligence was within the scope of Doctor Burmeister and Nurse Welsh’s duty when caring for a quadriplegic. <em>See Quinby v. Burmeister, M.D. et al., </em><a href="/a2d/850/0667-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="850 A.2d 667" data-case-ids="9229322" data-case-paths="/a2d/850/0667-01">850 A.2d 667</a>, 669 (Pa.Super.2004). In this regard, the court concluded that a quadriplegic could not normally fall from an examination table absent negligence; and that, in this case, other causes for the fall were eliminated.</p>
    <p id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.6",372,[266,1114,1156,528]]]'>Second, premised upon the conclusion that an inference of negligence, pursuant to <em>res ipsa loquitor, </em>was warranted, Quinby argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant judgment n.o.v. on the issue of liability against Defendants, because the evidence was such that no two reasonable minds could disagree that Defendants were negligent. <em>See Cummings v. Nazareth Borough, </em><a href="/pa/427/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="427 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1910386" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0014-01">427 Pa. 14</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20874" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="233 A.2d 874">233 A.2d 874</a> (1967). Again, the Superior Court agreed. Accordingly, it reversed the trial court’s decision on liability granting Quinby judgment n.o.v., and remanded the case for a new trial on damages.</p>
    <p id="b372-6" data-blocks='[["BL_372.7",372,[264,1669,1153,573]]]'>Finally, the Superior Court agreed with Quinby’s challenges to the trial court’s ruling on the admissibility of the videotapes, finding that the jury was entitled to listen to the audio portion of the videotape Decedent made twenty-two months before the fall to permit the jury to see the pace and extent of Decedent’s decline after the fall. Further, the Superior Court held that the trial court erred in denying admissibility of Decedent’s <em>de bene esse </em>deposition taken the day before he died, which, in the Superior Court’s view, would have permitted the jury to see, as well as hear, Decedent testify on his own behalf.</p>

As already stated, Decedent was a quadriplegic incapable of moving his lower limbs, trunk, and right upper limb, and with only very slight use of his upper left limb. It is undisputed that to allow for the removal of a lesion on his left temple, Decedent was positioned on the examination table. After successful completion of the surgery, according to Decedent, he was left on his right side, and, according to Defendants, he was left on his back and centered on the table. It is undisputed that Decedent was never protected by side rails or restrained with straps, and that, somehow, Decedent fell from the table to the floor.</p>

Quinby, of course, argues that the Superior Court’s grant of judgment n.o.v. was entirely proper on the facts of this case, because all the parties agree that Decedent fell from the table, and no one could explain how Decedent could have fallen if positioned on his back as Defendants testified.

Rather, Nurse Welsh asserts that Quinby’s own expert, Dr. Fenton, testified that Decedent’s fall could have occurred if he had an involuntary spasm.

Conversely, if Decedent was on his back as Defendants testified, Dr. Fenton stated that this would not change his conclusion that Defendants breached the duty of care and were, thus, negligent for the same reasons. Contrary to Nurse Welsh’s assertion, Dr. Fenton did not testify that if Decedent was on his back, it would have been possible for a muscle spasm to move him to the floor.

It is important to note that the above discussion regarding the applicability of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>to the facts presented at trial is also implicated in our discussion of the propriety of judgment n.o.v. As noted, § 328D(2) provides that “It is the function of the court to determine <em>whether the inference may reasonably be dram by the jury, or whether it must necessarily be drawn.” </em>(Emphasis added). Further, § 328D(3) provides that “[i]t is the function of the jury to determine whether the inference is to be drawn in any case <em>where different conclusions may reasonably be reached.” </em>(Emphasis added). Therefore, it is apparent that the Restatement contemplates that there will be circumstances such that the inference of negligence must be drawn, and in those circumstances, where there are no material facts in dispute and different conclusions may not reasonably be reached, the court may direct the jury to find for the plaintiff. We believe that this is such a case, and, pursuant to § 328D(2) and (3), the evidence demonstrates that the inference of negligence must be drawn, and different conclusions may not reasonably be reached. Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 328D cmt.

Appellee asserted appellants breached their duty of due care by failing to place Quinby in a stable position on a table with rails or restraints, and by failing to remain in the exam room with him. Majority Slip Op., at 4-5. In support of these allegations, appellee presented her husband’s deposition testimony that he was left lying on his right side on the exam table, along with evidence that the exam table lacked rails or restraints and that appellants failed to remain in the exam room with him. Appellee also presented the expert testimony of Dr. Bradley Fenton, who testified appellants’ failure to “ensure that [Quinby] was left safely and securely on the examination table at all times” constituted a breach of the standard of care. <em>Id., </em>at 5-6. Appellee presented evidence to establish the duty, breach, causation, and damages elements of a negligence action; therefore, the evidence did not require that the jury infer any of these elements. As in any case of ordinary negligence, the evidence here required only that the jury weigh the evidence, make credibility assessments, and determine whether appellants were negligent.

Appellee failed to present any evidence eliminating the possibility that a third party entered Quinby’s room during the time in question and caused the fall.

Or even if he was on the edge of the bed, it would throw it off the edge of the bed if we weren’t there controlling it.” <em>Id., </em>at 177a. Quinby’s father also testified, “it wouldn’t really matter on these narrow [examination] tables which way he was laying, he could easily have triggered a fall off the table.” <em>Id., </em>at 179a. The only evidence that addressed this possibility was appellee’s expert’s statement that he was personally unaware of any muscle spasm strong enough to throw a person, lying on their back, from an examination table. Thus, appellee failed to present evidence sufficiently eliminating the possibility that Quinby was properly situated on the table, but experienced a spasm that shifted his balance on the table and caused his fall.
