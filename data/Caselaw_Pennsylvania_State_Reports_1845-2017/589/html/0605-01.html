Local residents, landowners and community leaders testified regarding the inadequate water supply and poor and unsafe quality of their water. Residents testified to problems they had encountered in accessing water, the costs they had expended in installing and maintaining equipment used to obtain, store and render potable their water supplies, and other costs attributable to having to turn elsewhere for water or water-related services (such as clothes laundering). Residents also testified to the danger posed in the event of a fire, as water for fighting fires must be <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>brought by tanker truck; indeed, one home was destroyed by fire because firefighters ran out of water, and another resident lost a bam and 110 sheep to a fire.</p>

The PAWC argued that the cost of the project would exceed its required investment, and thus it was entitled to request customer contribution as a condition of undertaking the project, while the OCA argued that the PAWC’s required investment would be substantially more than the cost of the project, and thus, no customer contribution would be required. To understand the competing calculations requires some understanding of the operation of the regulations. The regulations provide a method for determining the investment required of the utility for each “bona fide service applicant.” That per-applicant investment is then multiplied by the number of bona fide service applicants; the total dollar figure represents the utility’s required investment. The utility’s investment amount is then measured against the estimated cost of the project. If the utility investment exceeds the cost, no customer contribution is required. If the required utility investment is less than the project cost, however, contribution may be requested of bona fide service applicants, whose individual obligation is determined by simply dividing the cost difference by the number of applicants.</p>

Calculating its investment obligation, the PAWC assumed 744 new customers as bona fide service applicants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Applying the algebraic formula set forth in Section 65.21(3) of the PUC’s <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>regulations, the PAWC claimed, it would be required to invest $6,200 for each bona fide service applicant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> (In contrast, the utility noted, its investment in its existing facilities servicing existing customers was only $2,309.) Multiplying its per-applicant obligation by the 744 applicants it projected, the PAWC calculated its required investment in the project to be $4,612,800 (744 x $6,200). Taking the $1,677,699 difference between the cost of the project and its required investment, the PAWC then calculated the customer contribution of each bona fide service applicant to be $2,255 <em>(ie., </em>$1,677,699 -r 744). The actual contribution could be either more or less depending upon how many residents actually took service upon completion of the project, and indeed, under the regulations, the PAWC would be obliged to provide refunds to the original service applicant-contributors if additional customers attached to the new water mains in the ensuing ten years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Direct Testimony of Terry L. Fought, at 5. The OCA’s calculations also differed from the PAWC’s because the OCA assumed a Penn Vest interest rate of 1.387% in the debt portion of the formula, rather than the 4.08% rate the utility employed.

Relevant to the issue before this Court, the ALJ found that the Township was in need of a dependable water source due to the diminishing quantity and quality of the water available, but that the need for water alone did not oblige the PAWC to extend its service without customer contribution. Instead, the ALJ found that the application of the PUC line extension regulations, and the PAWC’s tariff, were reasonable, and that application of those regulations would require customer contribution. In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ accepted the PAWC’s weighted cost of debt and its estimated cost of the project. <em>PUC Initial Decision, </em>at 56-70.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The ALJ also rejected the OCA’s argument that an exception to the regulations and their application was appropriate.</p>

The PUC rejected the OCA’s argument that the demonstration of public need alone requires the extension of water lines at the utility’s expense, noting that it had already considered and rejected that argument in previous cases, including a challenge brought by the OCA to the PAWC’s adoption of its Tariff Rule 27.

On the delegated power point, the OCA essentially argues that requiring customer contribution in an instance where an extension is necessary for public need is beyond the power delegated to the PUC because the first sentence in Section 1501 mandates that, “[e]very public utility shall furnish and maintain adequate, efficient, safe, and reasonable service and facilities, and shall make all such ... extensions ... as shall be necessary or proper for the ... safety of its patrons, employees, and the public.” When an extension is necessary for public safety, the OCA argues, the utility must provide it at its sole cost, unless that obligation would prevent the utility from earning a return on its overall operations or would create an undue burden on existing customers. But while Section 1501 speaks to necessary extensions, it does not purport to speak to the economics of required extensions, much less does it suggest that the PUC was obliged to conclude that the entire cost of a water line extension must be borne by the utility. Indeed, Section 1501 later states in explicit terms that: “Subject to the provisions of this part and the regulations and orders of the commission, every public utility may have reasonable rules and regulations governing the conditions under which it shall be required to render service.” <em><a href="/a2d/727/1080-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="727 A.2d 1080" data-case-ids="11633536,607148" data-case-paths="/a2d/727/1080-01,/pa/556/0199-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis supplied). Thus, in addition to the fact that the delegated power does not affirmatively restrict the PUC from authorizing customer contribution, the statute affirmatively recognizes that reasonable conditions may attach to the rendering of mandated service. Given the plain language of this construct, as well as the broad power delegated to the PUC to adopt “just and reasonable standards” under Section 1504, we hold that the PUC was authorized to adopt line extension regulations which accounted for economic factors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

We also are unpersuaded by the OCA’s argument that the revenue the PAWC could expect in future rate increases should require it to forward the entire cost of mandated line extension projects. In addition to the fact that this is a policy argument which does not prove the unreasonableness of the agency’s regulatory scheme, the argument confuses two separate costs to utilities: costs associated with line extension and costs associated with regular service. The PAWC is subject to separate regulations for the establishment and increases of its rates. <em>See </em>52 Pa.Code § 53.1 <em>et seq. </em>These requirements are separate and apart from the line extension regulations. Rates are intended to compensate the utility for its ongoing service, <em>i.e., </em>providing regular water service, and are not required to be viewed as containing a component which compensates the provider for unrelated projects or expenditures, such as line extensions for the benefit of new customers.</p>

The Township has no alternative supplier to which it may legally turn for public water service. Further, it is undisputed that <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>the water supply in the Township is inadequate and that the water quality is poor. While PAWC has not refused to service the Township at all, it has refused to service the Township unless the residents, wishing to connect to service line extensions to receive the benefits of public water service, pay a nonrefundable, non-reimbursable contribution in aid of construction of $2,255.00 per household. I believe this determination flies in the face of the statutory requirement that public utilities, as governmentally authorized monopolies, bear the cost of capitalizing the investment necessary to extend service to <em>bona fide </em>service applicants. When interpreting Section 1501, the appellate courts of this Commonwealth have generally concluded that the costs associated with maintaining and expanding the physical facilities necessary to provide utility service are the initial responsibility of the public utility.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> In circumstances in which there is no public need for improvements or extensions in service, <em>e.g., </em>when the proposed project involves special services or benefits only a particular customer or developer, the Commission and courts have approved the assessment of customer contributions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

According to the regulations, if the annual revenue does not equal or exceed the line’s annual costs, then the utility may require a contribution from customers that is proportional to the annual costs not covered by the annual revenue. 52 Pa.Code § 65.12(2). The regulations were adopted pursuant to Section 1501 of the Public Utility Code, which expressly authorizes a utility, with the approval of the Commission, to adopt “reasonable rules and regulations governing the conditions under which it shall be required to render service.” 66 Pa.C.S. § 1501. The Commission determined that it is reasonable to require customer contributions to an extension if the contributions are required to prevent the utility from a negative return on investment, <em>i.e., </em>the utility must realize at least a “break even” return on mandated extensions. The Commission believes that new customers should be required to contribute to the cost of a utility’s extension when it is necessary to protect that utility’s existing customers from excessive rates or to preserve the financial viability of the utility.</p>

Section 1501 clearly requires a utility to provide safe and adequate service to an area lacking public water without customer contribution where a public need exists and the financial viability of the utility is not threatened. The statute does not include a caveat that “repairs, changes, alterations, substitutions, extensions, and improvements” are made only where the financial health or profitability of the utility can be maintained. The Commission rejected this public need argument in its adjudication, noting it has consistently held that public need does not invalidate the regulation’s requirement for customer contribution where the cost of supplying service is more than the immediate return from that service.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a>

In addition, the township requested the installation of fire hydrants. Despite evidence showing that the extension would entail the expenditure of less than one-fourth of one percent of the company’s current and accrued assets, the Commission concluded that it was “not economically feasible” for the utility to extend its mains and did not require the extension. <em><a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20168" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="94 A.2d 168">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20168" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="94 A.2d 168">at 170</a>.</p>

Of even greater significance, the <em>Ridley </em>court rejected the position of the Commission that individual line extensions must be profitable for the utility, or customer contributions are required. The court observed that the “purpose of an inquiry upon a complaint for refusing an extension of facilities is ... to determine the effect of an extension upon the total return from the overall operation of the entire system.” <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20168" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="94 A.2d 168">Id. at 170</a> (emphasis added). As did the Superior Court in <em>Ridley, </em>I find that the Commission erred in failing to analyze whether, by extending the service line to the Township residents, the total revenues and expenses would produce an impermissible rate of return or financial harm to the utility. There is a palpable distinction between securing a fair return and maintaining the current level of profitability, a distinction that was not explored in the hearings before the Commission. Because I believe that the regulations promulgated by the Commission, and their strict application, are at odds with Section 1501, I would vacate the Order of the Commonwealth Court and remand for additional findings. The statutory rule provides that “[e]very public utility shall furnish and maintain adequate, efficient, safe, and reasonable service and facilities, and shall make all such repairs, changes, alterations, substitutions, extensions, and improvements in or to such service and facilities as shall be necessary or proper for the accommodation, convenience, and safety of its patrons, employees, and the public.” 66 Pa.C.S. § 1501 (emphasis added). While the statute provides the Commission with the <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>authority to promulgate regulations to ensure that the statutory mandate is met, and while the statute permits utilities to formulate rules as to how it will conform to the statutory mandate, I believe that the General Assembly has decreed that the “accommodation, convenience, and safety of its patrons, employees, and the public” is the paramount concern.</p>
    <p id="b817-4" data-blocks='[["BL_817.5",817,[222,680,1156,1232]]]'>On the established record, there can be little doubt that those portions of Mt. Pleasant Township requesting service are in need of a public water system. Moreover, whether one uses the figures of Consumer Advocate that 568 residents would use the service or the figure of PAWC that 744 residential customers would be served, this is clearly not a <em>de minimus </em>number and militates even more for a determination that public need is the overriding factor here. The degree of public need in this case is not one of mere accommodation or convenience but one affecting public health and safety, and I believe that the Commission erred in concluding that, absent customer contributions, the Utility need not extend water service to the affected area. The Commission should have evaluated the need for customer contributions on the basis of a fair overall return to the utility, not on the basis of whether the individual line extension would be profitable. Accordingly, because: (1) a utility is obligated by statute to supply service within its certificated area; (2) there is a demonstrated substantial need for water service in the Township; (3) there is no finding that extending service into the Township would have a detrimental effect on the total return on investment of PAWC, I believe that the Order of the Commonwealth Court should be vacated and the matter remanded for additional findings.</p>
