There were several failed attempts at negotiating a plea before the Honorable Renee Cardwell Hughes of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Subsequently, White’s counsel moved to decertify the case to juvenile court. The decertification proceedings occurred before the Honorable Legróme D. Davis.

The court first addressed the availability of an immediate appeal from an order denying a recusal motion under Pa.R.A.P. 311(d), which allows the Commonwealth to appeal, as of right, an interlocutory order that “terminates or substantially handicaps” the prosecution. <em>White, </em>at 558. The court reasoned it need not “accept blindly” the Commonwealth’s certification of substantial handicap. <em>Id. </em>Rather, “when issues other than those evidentiary in nature are raised, we may pause to consider the propriety of the Commonwealth’s certification.” <em>Id., </em>at 559. The court considered the fact that the ruling did not interfere with the Commonwealth’s ability to present its case, and ultimately declined to expand Rule 311(d) to include an appeal from an order denying recusal. <em>White, </em>at 559. The court also considered whether the jury trial issue was appealable under Rule 311(d), and concluded that precluding the Commonwealth from appellate review of this issue would allow a trial court to overrule a constitutional provision based on its own interpretation, which “no doubt” constituted a substantial handicap under Rule 311(d). <em>White, </em>at 560-61.</p>

The court then noted that “implementation of the Rule is irrelevant in the event that the Commonwealth seeks to exercise its constitutional right to a jury trial.” <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth’s right to a jury trial is “the same as” the defendant’s, as <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>provided for by Article 1, § 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. “Its effect, simply, is to permit the Commonwealth to insist on a jury trial despite a criminal defendant’s decision to waive that same right.” <em>White, </em>at 561. The Superior Court concluded a guilty plea to murder generally is unique, and what follows is akin to a trial, since the proceedings still involve the presentation of evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the findings of fact in support of the verdict. <em>Id., </em>at 562. Accordingly, the court concluded a degree of guilt hearing was “a variation of a waiver trial and as such, it cannot trump the Commonwealth’s constitutional right to demand a jury trial.” <em>Id.</em>

We first considered the “legal underpinnings” of Rule 311(d), noting the government may bring an interlocutory appeal in criminal cases only under express statutory authority. <em>Cosnek, </em>at 873.

      <em>Cosnek, </em>at 874.

In <em>Cosnek, </em>we further explained that subsequent case law clarified <em>Bosurgi, </em>such that the Commonwealth merely needed to allege an order suppressing, precluding, or excluding evidence terminated or substantially handicapped its case to be entitled to a pre-trial appeal under Rule 311(d). <em>Cosnek, </em>at 874 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em>Cosnek </em>sought to apply Rule 311(d) to the Commonwealth’s appeal of an <em>in limine </em>ruling which denied its motion to exclude defense evidence; it did not involve an order remotely similar to that at issue here. The limited question in <em>Cosnek </em>was the proper application of Rule 311(d) in light of the specific challenge forwarded; we were not asked to revisit and rewrite Rule 311(d), nor to deal with circumstances not there presented. Rules and cases serve differing functions and have differing effects. Rules certainly build upon and reflect experience, but they primarily seek to frame future expectations and attempt to provide general guidance.

Here, however, there is no sentencing issue, since there is nothing to suggest the judge might impose a sentence different from that provided by statute or engage in additional fact-finding during sentencing. Accordingly, White concludes that any reliance on those cases is inapt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

      <em>White, at 562. </em>This characterization is generally <em>correct; a </em>defendant’s plea of guilty to murder generally bifurcates the fact-finding process which ordinarily occurs at trial — it dispenses with the need to determine whether the defendant committed murder, but leaves open for determination the question of the degree. A plea of guilty to murder generally “is simply an acknowledgement by a defendant that he participated in certain acts with a criminal intent.” <em>Commonwealth v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/528/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="528 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1829826,1829847" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0546-01,/pa/528/0546-02">528 Pa. 546</a>, <a href="/pa/528/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="528 Pa. 546" data-case-ids="1829826,1829847" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0546-01,/pa/528/0546-02">599 A.2d 624</a>, 626 (1991) (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

The purpose of the degree of guilt hearing is “to determine whether the homicide was murder of the first, second or third degree, or voluntary manslaughter.” <em>Commonwealth v.

It is thus evident that the United States Supreme Court views the term “trial” in the Sixth Amendment as encompassing a broad set of criminal proceedings in which fact finding occurs, particularly where the facts found may result in criminal punishment exceeding that which would otherwise be imposable. Given this broad view of the term “trial” under the Sixth Amendment, and that the 1998 amendment to Article I, Section 6 <a id="p672" href="#p672" data-label="672" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*672</a>expressly equates the Commonwealth’s rights in this setting with those of the defendant, it is appropriate not to apply an unduly narrow definition of the word “trial” to defeat the Commonwealth’s jury rights as to degree-of-guilt hearings.

Thus, Appellee’s attempt to carry them over in their present form into the post-amendment context is inconsistent with the intent of the revised Constitution and is not supportable. Pending necessary amendments to the rules, I can only envision that a defendant should be afforded their full benefit upon the Commonwealth’s consent and waiver of its own jury trial right. Additionally, I note that a defendant has other means of accomplishing some of the effects of Rules 590(C) and 803(A); for example, she may stipulate to facts at trial, such as her involvement in the killing, thus perhaps taking some of the sting out of the Commonwealth’s case and enhancing her credibility before the fact finder on the question of her degree of guilt.

My research leads me to the inescapable conclusion that Article I, Section 6 prescribed the right to a mode or method of trial, i.e., a "jury trial.” <em>Accord Byers and Davis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/42/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="173" data-cite="42 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="481553" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0089-01">42 Pa. 89</a> (1862) (discussing that "mode of trial,” i.e., the right to trial by jury "had long been considered the right of every Englishman”); <em>Singer v. United States, </em><a href="/us/380/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="174" data-cite="380 U.S. 24" data-case-ids="1525354" data-case-paths="/us/380/0024-01">380 U.S. 24</a>, <a href="/us/380/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="175" data-cite="380 U.S. 24" data-case-ids="1525354" data-case-paths="/us/380/0024-01">85 S.Ct. 783</a>, <a href="/us/380/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="176" data-cite="380 U.S. 24" data-case-ids="1525354" data-case-paths="/us/380/0024-01">13 L.Ed.2d 630</a> (1965) (explaining that trial by jury was the one, regular common law mode of trial). Accordingly, I would conclude that Article I, Section 6 gives the parties the right to demand a jury if there is a trial; and in this case, the amendment to Article I, Section 6 gives the Commonwealth the reciprocal right to demand a jury when there is a trial.</p>

Contrary to the Majority, I am not convinced that the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution plays a role in interpreting Article 1, Section 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Consistent with this court’s prior case law, Article 1, Section 6 was simply an attempt to preserve the parties’ right to a jury as it existed at common law, and, thus, the amendment would merely give the Commonwealth the same right to a jury as the accused as it existed at common law. Indeed, I believe there is a question whether Article 1, Section 6 is an "analogous” provision to the Sixth Amendment, since the rights given by the Sixth Amendment mirror those contained in Article 1, Section 9 and not Article 1, Section 6. Accordingly, I doubt whether the Sixth Amendment case law is relevant in any fashion to a discussion of Article 1, Section 6.</p>
