Thereafter, on September 20, 2002, Ostrosky, who was 18 years old at the time, encountered Mr. Foster at a Glassport Area High School football game. Mr. and Mrs. Foster were both present at the game and Mr. Foster was serving as a parent-chaperone to the high school band, as his son was a band member. The encounter began when Mr. Foster observed Ostrosky talking to band members during the time the high school football game was taking place. Mr. Foster approached Ostrosky and explained to him that band members are not permitted to talk during game time and that he, Ostrosky, should move on. After making a smart remark to Mr. Foster, Ostrosky complied with Mr. Foster’s request and left the area where the band was assembled.</p>

Mr. Foster saw Ostrosky, but said nothing to him at that time; Mr. Foster then left to use the restroom. When Mr. Foster returned from using the restroom, Ostrosky approached him again and began talking about the previous vandalism incident. Specifically, Ostrosky stated that he blamed Mr. Foster for his getting into trouble and said it was Mr. Foster’s fault that he was required to pay $2,000 in restitution. Ostrosky then became belligerent and called Mr. Foster a “fat f — .” Notes of Testimony, 6/16/08, (N.T.), at 18. He told Mr. Foster that he “should take [Mr. Foster’s] fat ass out in the field and beat [him] up.” <em>Id.</em>

Mr. Foster no longer found Ostrosky funny and became concerned. He began looking around for help. Other people began walking up to Ostrosky and Mr. Foster, who were obviously involved in a verbal confrontation, and Mr. Foster asked that someone call the police. Mr. Foster was concerned particularly because of Ostrosky’s threat directed at Mrs. Foster as he was unsure if Ostrosky would attempt to carry out such threat.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Ostrosky then became louder and continued yelling at Mr. Foster “in [his] face.” N.T. at 21.

These sentences applied to the counts charging a violation of the retaliation statute and terroristic threats. No further sentence was imposed on the remaining counts. Thereafter, Ostrosky filed post-trial motions, which the trial court denied. Ostrosky filed a timely notice of appeal to the Superior Court alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was insufficient to sustain Ostrosky’s conviction pursuant to the retaliation statute.</p>

Upon examining the provision’s language, the court noted that, by its very terms, in order to obtain a conviction, assuming an intent to retaliate, the Commonwealth can sustain its burden by proving any one of the following three scenarios: (1) that the defendant harmed another by any unlawful act; or (2) that the defendant engaged in a course of conduct which threatened another; or (3) that the defendant repeatedly committed acts which threaten another. The Superior Court then observed that in this case, the Commonwealth alleged only that Ostrosky violated the statute pursuant to the first of the foregoing scenarios, namely, that, with the intent to retaliate against the Fosters, he harmed the Fosters by an unlawful act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1034 (1966). Black’s Law Dictionary provides the following expansive definition of the word: “Injury, loss, damage; material or tangible detriment.” Black’s Law Dictionary 734 (8th ed.2004).

The court observed that while Mr. Foster became “concerned” following Ostrosky’s final comment in relation to Mrs. Foster and that Mrs. Foster felt “intimidated” by the comment when told of it by a third party, their testimony, otherwise, did not demonstrate harm beyond the feelings associated with the single isolated threat itself. The court, referencing various sources for the notion that feelings of intimidation are the equivalent of feeling threatened, noted the following:</p>

Similarly, Mr. Foster, although first finding the encounter funny, later felt threatened such that he started looking around for help and told someone to call the police. In other words, there was no evidence indicating that the victims experienced anything other than the feeling of being threatened during this one, isolated incident. The fear and intimi<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>dation felt by the victims are, at their core, feelings that arise from being threatened. <em>See <a href="/a2d/866/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="866 A.2d 423" data-case-ids="9037211" data-case-paths="/a2d/866/0423-01">id.</a> </em>(listing synonyms for threat and threatening including, <em>inter alia, </em>alarm, foreboding, intimidation); Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 2882 (1966) (describing words associated with “threat” such as, <em>inter alia, </em>coercion, annoyance, harassment, persecution, and defining, threat as, <em>inter alia, </em>“expression of intention to inflict loss or harm on another by illegal means and especially] by means involving coercion or duress ... ”).</blockquote>

Ultimately, the court concluded that Ostrosky’s threat standing alone did not satisfy the required harm given the statute as a whole, its grammatical context, and its history. Specifically, the court noted that the current version of the retaliation statute resulted from an amendment of the prior version, which became effective on December 20, 2000. The prior version of the statute simply provided the following:</p>
    <blockquote id="b621-6" data-blocks='[["BL_621.7",621,[278,1524,1108,147]]]'>(a) Offense defined. A person commits an offense if he harms another by any unlawful act in retaliation for anything lawfully done in the capacity of witness or victim.</blockquote>

Thus, the Superior Court concluded that because Ostrosky’s conduct represented a single instance of verbal threat, and the statute contemplates that only multiple instances of threats constitute a violation, Ostrosky’s conduct was insufficient for purposes of violating the current version of the retaliation statute.</p>

Ostrosky argues the Commonwealth seeks to conflate the two separate elements of “harm” and “by any unlawful act” through its argument that an unlawful act is always harmful and therefore proof that a defendant committed an unlawful act carries with it proof that the defendant harmed the victim. Ostrosky notes that if the legislature intended that result, it could have simply indicated that <em>“a </em>defendant is guilty if he commits an unlawful act directed at a witness or victim.” Instead, the legislature very clearly provided in the first portion of the retaliation statute that for a person to commit an offense, there must be both “harm” and “any unlawful act.” Ostrosky continues that in a separate phrase after the conjunction “or” the statute provides that a perpetrator can also violate this provision by engaging in a course of conduct or repeatedly committing acts which threaten another. Thus, Ostrosky concludes that to violate the statute, the Commonwealth must prove either that Fosters suffered specific identifiable harm as a result of an unlawful act or were the subject of repeated threats.</p>

The question at issue here is whether the harm that must be shown can be satisfied exclusively by proof of the unlawful act itself, in this case a single threat.

Here, appellee was convicted of making terroristic threats <em>against the Fosters, </em>arising out of a one-time (albeit prolonged) incident, which constituted an <em>unlawful </em>act even though but one confrontation was involved. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2706(a)(1). Because retaliation may be accomplished through a variety of methods, and lawful conduct might not become threatening or illegal without it occurring multiple times, it is clear why the <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>General Assembly saw a need to address retaliation committed through both a single unlawful act and lawful acts that become illegal when committed repeatedly. In my view, the first clause of the statute plainly captures the unlawful terroristic threats made by appellee in the case <em>sub judice, </em>threats which were directed at individuals with whom he had had a prior dispute.</p>
    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[276,723,1156,365]]]'>Given my understanding of the language of the statute, and the real world concerns with which it grapples, I necessarily, but respectfully, disagree with the Majority’s conclusion that the “harm” element in the first clause of the statute would be rendered surplusage if the fact that the predicate act was unlawful supplied the harm. The Majority accurately summarizes the Commonwealth’s argument on this point as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="ANK" data-blocks='[["BL_630.6",630,[318,1110,1115,464]]]'>Regarding the element of “harm” required by the retaliation statute, the Commonwealth maintains that a crime is harmful in and of itself, which is why the legislature has prohibited hundreds of actions and called them crimes. It notes that not every harmful act is a crime, but that every crime is a harmful act. Thus, the Commonwealth maintains that once the unlawful acts of terroristic threats, disorderly conduct, and harassment were proven, harm, <em>per se, </em>resulted.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.7",630,[317,1605,1115,364]]]'>Additionally, the Commonwealth asserts that the 2000 amendment to the retaliation statute merely clarified that a course of conduct and/or repeated threatening behavior, in addition to a single unlawful act are expressly prohibited under the statute. The Commonwealth maintains that by the addition of this language, the legislature in no way sought to decriminalize a single threatening act.</blockquote>

    <p id="b630-7" data-blocks='[["BL_630.9",630,[274,2222,1158,149]],["BL_631.1",631,[227,331,1156,799]]]'>It bears reiteration that not all crimes involve harm to a person that the retaliation statute is meant to protect. From this fact, it logically follows that, in instances where the <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>retaliation victim is not the victim of the predicate unlawful act, the statute would require a distinct showing of harm to the retaliation victim. If the defendant breaks the speeding limit while pursuing his victim on the highway, for example, it does not necessarily follow that the defendant’s speeding violation caused harm to the person he was chasing. An argument might even be made that the harm element is not automatically established if the predicate unlawful acts involved harassing or brutalizing friends or family of the person who is the alleged victim of retaliation. But where the predicate act is criminal in and of itself (as was the case here), and where the victim of the predicate act is the same as the retaliation victim (as here), I believe that, under the plain language of the first clause of Section 4953(a) statute, harm has been proven.</p>
