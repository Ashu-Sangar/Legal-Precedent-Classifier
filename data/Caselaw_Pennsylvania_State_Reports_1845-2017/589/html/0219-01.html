The issue before this Court is whether 42 Pa.C.S. § 5104(b) and Article I, Section 6, of the Pennsylvania Constitution require that the same ten jurors vote identically on each question listed on a special interrogatory verdict sheet to sustain a proper “verdict” in the case. For the reasons that follow, we hold that any ten jurors who agree on a given interrogatory furnish a sufficient majority as to that question, and a verdict that requires a series of responses to interrogatories should be sustained even where a different grouping of ten jurors comprise the required majority for each individual question posed in a set of special interrogatories. Accordingly, we reverse the Superior Court’s contrary ruling.</p>

Beginning on February 8, 2003, a three-day trial commenced before a twelve-member jury, during which the jury heard testimony that, among other damage claims, Appellant lost $45,000 in wages and suffered $6,300 in medical expenses as a result of his shoulder injury. After trial, the court submitted to the jury a verdict slip containing seven interrogatories.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The twelve-person jury rendered its initial verdict in favor of Appellant for $51,300. Appellees’ counsel requested that the jury polled.

The trial court again polled the jury. The polled jury was unanimous that Appellees were negligent (question one); that Appellees’ negligence was a substantial factor in causing Appellant’s harm (question two); and that Appellant was contributorily negligent (question three). On the issue of whether Appellant’s contributory negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about his harm (question four), ten jurors agreed that it was not, while jurors four and eight stated that Appellant’s contributory negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about his harm. On the question regarding the amount of damages (question six), while ten jurors believed that Appellant sustained $51,300 in damages, jurors four and nine stated that Appellant should only receive an award of $6,300.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, while ten jurors agreed on each individual interrogatory, the identities of the dissenters as to questions four and six were not consistent, and therefore, the same ten jurors did not agree as to all of the questions material to the verdict and award.</p>

The trial court denied Appellees’ motion and concluded that the jury had reached a valid verdict because at least ten out of twelve jurors agreed on every question on the verdict slip. The trial court opined that “[i]t is not unreasonable to infer that, rather than being confused, jurors no. 8 and 9 simply reached different conclusions about how to most fairly compensate [Appellant] in light of the evidence of damages, just as <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>they differed regarding the evidence of [Appellant’s] contributory negligence.” Tr.

A divided panel of the Superior Court agreed with Appellees, vacated the judgment, and remanded for a new trial. The panel majority examined the language of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides, in relevant part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b402-6" data-blocks='[["BL_402.6",402,[297,911,1111,204]]]'>Trial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right thereof remain inviolate.

In accordance with this provision, the General Assembly enacted 42 Pa.C.S. § 5104(b), which provides that “[i]n any civil case a verdict rendered by at least five-sixths of the jury shall be the verdict of the jury and shall have the same effect as a unanimous verdict of the jury.” The Superior Court framed the issue as whether the term “verdict” as used in the Pennsylvania Constitution and Section 5104(b) “consists of all of the answers to the interrogatories or whether each individual interrogatory is a separable ‘verdict.’ ” <em>Fritz v. Wright, </em><a href="/a2d/872/0851-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="872 A.2d 851" data-case-ids="8977427" data-case-paths="/a2d/872/0851-01">872 A.2d 851</a>, 852 (Pa.Super.2005). Addressing this question, the majority determined that verdict meant the former, reasoning that in the interest of justice it could not parse the verdict sheet and count the votes on individual questions as if each were a separate verdict. Rather, it held that the verdict upon which five-sixths of the jurors must agree is comprised of the total verdict inclusive of each interrogatory response. In this case, the Superior Court found that the total verdict was agreed to by only nine jurors, and thus was not a proper verdict, as nine was less than five-sixths of the total jury. The Superior Court majority noted that its holding would not prevent jurors with dissenting views from fully participating in the deliberation process. Instead, the majority opined that the dissenting jurors could continue <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>to express their disagreements throughout the deliberation process, and seek to persuade others to their views.</p>
    <p id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[251,440,1155,1163]]]'>Judge Olszewski filed a dissenting opinion, in which he opined that the “same-juror rule” established by the majority unconstitutionally burdens a litigant’s right to a jury of twelve persons. He argued that there was a proper verdict in this case because at least ten jurors agreed Appellees were negligent; at least ten jurors agreed that Appellant’s contributory negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about his harm; and at least ten jurors agreed that Appellant was entitled to $51,300 in damages. In support of his position, Judge Olszewski relied on <em>Blum v. Merrell Dow Pharm.

He explained that the same-juror rule in effect obviated the role of dissenting jurors by effectively nullifying any of their votes that occurred subsequent to their first minority vote. Under such circumstances, he argued the parties would receive jury deliberations by fewer than twelve jurors in violation of the Pennsylvania Constitution as interpreted in <em>Blum.</em>

It is a logical assumption that if twelve jurors had deliberated in this matter, the five-sixths verdict might never have been reached.

Under this scheme, there was obviously no room for an “any majority” rule. For example, indisputably all jurors had to agree as to liability and damages before a verdict could be rendered awarding money damages. In 1971, however, the Constitution was amended to authorize the General Assembly to provide that “a verdict may be rendered by not less than five-sixths of the jury in any civil case.” Pa. Const. art. 1 § 6. This uncomplicated change facially conveys only the idea that the threshold number of jurors in complete agreement concerning the verdict may be lowered. I do not believe that the straightforward terms of the amendment put the electorate on notice of a sea change in the idea that there must be complete agreement among the jurors favoring the verdict.</p>

None of the majority’s justifications, however, persuades me that the amendatory language should be read in so broad a fashion.</p>

This “jury of ten” idea is illusory, however, as it facially fails to account for two jurors in Pennsylvania’s twelve-juror system. Moreover, the quoted passage substitutes for the concept of the rendering of a “verdict,” as clearly expressed in both Article 1, Section 6, and Section 5104(b), the looser expression “civil cases are to be decided.” Utilizing the language of the Constitution and the statute and putting aside the “jury of ten” rhetoric, the majority’s rationale does not sustain itself. In fact, requiring the rendering of a verdict supported in full by ten of twelve jurors is perfectly consistent with the electorate’s action in amending the Constitution, as well as the Legislature’s clearly expressed intention, to lower the threshold to permit verdicts to be rendered that are supported in full by five-sixths of a twelve-member jury.</p>

The majority, however, offers no real support for the proposition that jurors must accede to the reasoning of a majority of others with respect to any aspect of their own rationale underlying a verdict. Rather, jurors have traditionally been permitted to dissent to a verdict for any legitimate reason, whether it is a belief that there is no liability or that there is no causally connected injury, or, conversely, an understanding that liability and damage exist in a case in which a majority of jurors favors a defense verdict. Further, juries as collective bodies routinely do not consider dependent issues where their decision on a predicate issue is dispositive; I find nothing in logic, in precedent, or, in particular, in the amendment to Article I, Section 6, that supports precluding a juror from doing the same within his or her own individualized assessment, assuming full and fair deliberation.</p>

From the perspective of an individual juror, however, it appears to me that one who believes that there is no liability is as (or more) likely to feel disenfranchised if he or she is forced to contribute a vote allocating damages than if permitted to rest on a determination of no liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Additionally, the notion that such a juror has no ability to continue to participate meaningfully in the discussions during a damages assessment is conjectural, as it is based upon a fixed and conclusory set of assumptions about the dynamic process of juror deliberation.

It should also be noted that bifurcation is to be "carefully and cautiously applied” and utilized only upon a trial court’s overall evaluation that the interests of justice are best advanced through the use the procedure. <em>Stevenson, </em><a href="/pa/513/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="513 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="1802571" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0411-01">513 Pa. at 422-23</a>, <a href="/pa/513/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="513 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="1802571" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0411-01">521 A.2d at 419</a> (quoting <em>Brown v.

I disagree, however, that the maintenance of a "same juror” approach threatens the use of special interrogatories. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 238-39 n. 11, 907 A.2d at 1095 n. 11. In the first instance, I differ with the majority’s suggestion that the mere fact that liability may be established in a tort case based on alternate theories is inherently confusing in terms of juror voting behavior. <em>See id. </em>Further, from my perspective, various difficulties attend the use of either the "any majority” or the "same juror” rule in complex civil litigation. <em>Cf.

Rather, informing jurors ... that they must be consistent in attributing responsibility for the payment of damages to parties whom they find to be culpable would appear to have the dual virtues of simplicity and common sense, while effectuating the underlying principle of responsibility in proportion to fault.”).</p>
