RPC 8.4(b) makes it professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer. Petitioner based this charge upon the contention that Respondent committed perjury or unsworn falsification to authorities pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 4902 and 4904. Each of those sections includes as an element of the crime that the person made a false statement which he did not believe to be true. Petitioner did not prove this element of the crime and thus did not prove a violation of 8.4(b). RPC 4.1(a) states that in the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person. Respondent published his accusations on the Internet, in a letter to the editor of the local newspaper, and in a letter to Judge Gardner. These accusations were based on his personal impressions and opinions that wrongdoing occurred in his client’s case. These accusations were not false statements of material facts concerning the representation of his client.
