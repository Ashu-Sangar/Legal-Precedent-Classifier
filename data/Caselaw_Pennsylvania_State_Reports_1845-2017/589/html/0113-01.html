In challenging the constitutionality of the assessment under the Uniformity Clause, <em>see </em>Pa. Const. art.

They also advanced a claim under Section 1983 of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1871, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>, <em>see generally Kowenhoven v.

Appellants asserted that the Assessment Ordinance, enacted in December 2001, requires that the Chief Assessment Officer certify, <em>inter alia, </em>that the yearly mass assessments produce price-related differentials (“PRDs”) no greater than 1.03 on a county-wide basis, and that, although this certification was made, the assessments did not, in fact, comply with this requirement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellants additionally asserted that, while individual appeals from the yearly reassessments may be able to reduce an over-assessed property’s valuation, because tax charges are the product of the assessment and millage, and millage is based upon the total assessed value of all properties in the county, “the under assessment of a substantial proportion of homes will cause lower valued homeowners to be overcharged for taxes even if their individual assessments [are] corrected.” Complaint at ¶ 53; RR. 25a.

Fayette County Bd. of Assessment Appeals, </em><a href="/a2d/782/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="782 A.2d 642" data-case-ids="9472379" data-case-paths="/a2d/782/0642-01">782 A.2d 642</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2001); <em>Murtagh v.

For similar reasons, the trial court found that Appellants could not circumvent this process to present their uniformity challenge in the court’s equitable jurisdiction. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court initially noted that Appellants had failed to allege that the assessment system was deliberately operated to produce inequities or that any subclass of properties was consciously singled out for disparate treatment; to the contrary, the Complaint acknowledged that the system was designed to treat all properties in a similar <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>fashion, but asserted that it had not done so.

While the prayer for relief seeks an order requiring the County to “reassess their properties as required for purposes of tax rate co[rr]ection,” there is no specific correction that plaintiffs propose.

Further, in our view it is sufficiently broad to subsume all necessary consideration of the administrative function. <em>See supra </em>589 Pa. at 124-25, 907 A.2d at 526 ("[Bjypassing the agency process within the framework of a direct attack on the enabling statute is inherently less likely to do violence to the agency’s role as fact-finder and applier of specialized expertise than in the context of an ‘as-applied’ challenge.”); <em>Borough of Green Tree, </em><a href="/pa/459/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="459 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="481054" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0268-01">459 Pa. at 279</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="459 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="481054" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0268-01">328 A.2d at 824</a> ("Where the administrative process has nothing to contribute to the decision of the issue and there are no special reasons for postponing its immediate decision, exhaustion should not be required.”); <em>Kowenhoven, </em><a href="/pa/587/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="587 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="3466842" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0545-01">587 Pa. at 557</a>, <a href="/pa/587/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="901 A.2d 1003" data-case-ids="3466842,8419141" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0545-01,/a2d/901/1003-01">901 A.2d at 1010</a> ("[T]he less need there is for compliance with an agency's <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>procedures as a prerequisite to informed constitutional decision making, then corresponding greater is the embarrassment caused to litigants by requiring conformity with the statutorily-prescribed remedy” (quoting <em>Borough of Green Tree, </em><a href="/pa/459/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="459 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="481054" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0268-01">459 Pa. at 281</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="459 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="481054" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0268-01">328 A.2d at 825</a>)); <em>id. </em>at 559, <a href="/pa/587/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="901 A.2d 1003" data-case-ids="3466842,8419141" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0545-01,/a2d/901/1003-01">901 A.2d at 1012</a> ("[G]iven that the general procedures of which Appellants complain can be facially tested against constitutional norms unaided by agency expertise, there is little practical difference between the present challenge and one in which the constitutional validity of a taxing statute is in issue.”).</p>

Thus, in light of our finding that Appellants have not satisfied the first prong — that is, that they have failed to raise a substantial constitutional issue in the context of their request for mandamus (a proposition with which the concurrence does not appear to disagree) — we see no need to address any proposed additional requirement at this juncture.</p>

    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[266,1140,1165,1229]]]'>While the test as enunciated by the Majority is correct insofar as it goes, I find it to be incomplete. I believe it misses an important factor in our exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. Our exhaustion doctrine has us examine not only whether there is a substantial constitutional question and an adequate administrative remedy; it also directs us to question whether administrative input would be helpful. We have stated that “[t]he primary purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to ensure claims will be addressed by the body having expertise in the area. This is particularly important where the ultimate decision rests upon factual determinations lying within the expertise of the agency, or where agency interpretations of relevant statutes or regulations are desirable.” <em>Lehman v. Pennsylvania State Police, </em><a href="/pa/576/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="576 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="16718" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0365-01">576 Pa. 365</a>, <a href="/pa/576/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="839 A.2d 265" data-case-ids="16718,9057069" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0365-01,/a2d/839/0265-01">839 A.2d 265</a>, 275 (2003). I believe cases such as the matter <em>sub judice </em>clearly warrant administrative agency involvement. Determining whether a property assessment was properly done is beyond cavil a fact-intensive inquiry, one in which the agency’s expertise would be most welcome. The fact that this matter raises a macro, county-wide challenge does not render agency involvement unnecessary; if anything, specialized administrative knowledge could prove even more helpful in such a complex matter.</p>

      <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>Thus, respectfully, I find the majority’s two-prong test for equity jurisdiction inadequate in that it fails to acknowledge specifically the need for and fails to accord sufficient deference to administrative expertise as required by the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. Wholesale resolution of the appeals <em>sub judice </em>without first having each case reviewed by the agency with the most expertise on the subject matter is not only jurisprudentially improper but also ill-advised.</p>
