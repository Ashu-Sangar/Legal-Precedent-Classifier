      <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>In the Litz matter, Respondent received $50,518.17 of insurance proceeds generated by the destruction of his client’s marital home. Respondent had fiduciary duties pursuant to the Rules of Professional Conduct to properly handle this money. Respondent’s client, Ms. Litz, was going through divorce proceedings and the insurance proceeds were a subject of the proceedings. By order of January 6, 2004, the Divorce Master’s recommendation as to the disposition of these particular funds was approved by the Lycoming County Court of Common Pleas. The order awarded to each party 50% of the insurance proceeds. Mr. Litz was entitled to $20,297.11 of the funds.</p>
    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[238,981,1156,846]]]'>By this time these funds were long gone, having been disbursed by Respondent over a period of approximately one year. Respondent properly spent $9,398.05, leaving him in possession of funds in the approximate amount of $41,000. Respondent made disbursements of $43,104.23, or more than was contained in Litz funds. These disbursements were primarily to Ms. Litz or for her benefit, as Ms. Litz came to Respondent on various occasions complaining of a lack of funds to meet expenses. Respondent made up the shortfall with the funds of an unrelated client (Seacrist), plus interest that had been generated by the combined money of Litz and Seacrist. Respondent has not made any restitution, as he maintains that it is Ms. Litz who benefited most from the disbursement, and is thus responsible for making Mr. Litz whole. Nevertheless, Respondent stated he would consider personally negotiating a settlement with Mr. Litz.</p>

Respondent agreed to file a complaint in the matter and called for a flat fee of $500, which Ms. Loner paid. A year long period of non-communication and inactivity followed the commencement of representation. Ms. Loner became increasingly frustrated in her attempts to communicate with Respondent, and finally went to the Prothonotary’s office, where she discovered Respondent had never filed a complaint on her behalf. Ms. Loner made a demand for the payment of her fees, as well <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>as for the amount she had lost by virtue of his failure to file the complaint. Respondent eventually refunded Ms. Loner’s $500 in November 2003, after the involvement of Office of Disciplinary Counsel.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[269,550,1157,893]]]'>Some mitigation exists in this case. With respect to his actions in the Litz matter, the record is clear that Respondent was not primarily motivated by greed. Virtually all of the improper disbursements were made to his client, because of her serious financial troubles. The client’s demand for the disbursements had some legal basis, albeit a weak one, in that she had signed a post-nuptial agreement with her husband, providing that the marital home was hers exclusively, and that by implication, the insurance proceeds generated by the home’s destruction were also hers. It was during this time frame that Respondent acceded to his client’s insistent demands that he disburse funds to her. Ultimately, friction between Respondent and Ms. Litz led her to retain new counsel. It was not until February 2003, when the Master’s Report was issued, that it became clear Ms. Litz’s reliance on her post-nuptial agreement was incorrect. Mr. Litz filed a claim with the Lawyers Fund for Client Security in June 2005.</p>
    <p id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.6",470,[270,1467,1154,193]]]'>Additional mitigation exists in that Respondent has practiced law since 1984 and has no prior record of discipline. He cooperated with Petitioner in its investigation of these matters.</p>

In matters involving mishandling of escrow funds in connection with which third parties had a claim, a wide range of discipline has been imposed, based in substantial part on the presence/absence of mitigating or aggravating factors. For instance, in the matter of <em>In re Anonymous No. 7 D.B. 86 &amp; 22 D.B. 87, </em>49 D. &amp; C.3d 165 (1988), the respondent, who had a lengthy prior disciplinary history, improperly disbursed $1,500 to a client despite the interests of a third party. This misconduct was compounded by multiple misrepresentations made in a separate matter. This respondent was suspended for two years. In the matter of <em>In re Anonymous, </em><a href="/pa-d-c4th/5/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Pa. D. &amp; C.4th 259" data-case-ids="8820088" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c4th/5/0259-01">5 Pa.

This respondent received a private reprimand from the Disciplinary Board. These cases, as well as other similar cases, may be distinguished on the facts in that Respondent’s mishandling of the Litz funds was for the benefit of a financially burdened client, as opposed to benefiting himself.</p>
    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.5",471,[229,724,1156,781]]]'>The Board is persuaded, upon careful review of the record, that as Respondent’s motivation for the mishandling of the escrowed funds was not based on greed, it is highly unlikely that such conduct will reoccur. Respondent acknowledged his wrongdoing and stated that he has learned from the circumstances, which suggests that he understands not to engage in such conduct in the future. Balancing the facts of the matter with the mitigating circumstances, the Board recommends that Respondent be suspended for three months, followed by a one year period of probation with conditions. As noted above, a claim was filed with the Lawyers Fund for Client Security by Melvin Litz. In the event an award is made to Mr. Litz, Respondent is required to repay the Fund in full. This restitution must be made prior to reinstatement to the bar. Pa.R.D.E. 531.</p>
