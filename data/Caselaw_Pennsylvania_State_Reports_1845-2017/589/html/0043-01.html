    <p id="b224-15" data-blocks='[["BL_224.15",224,[270,1743,1150,628]]]'>Appellant and Sashana Young, a juvenile with whom he was intimate, moved from New York City to Allentown, Pennsylvania, between one and two weeks prior to the killing on July 18, 2001. Appellant’s half-sister, Ann Julie Torrez, lived in the area sometimes staying with relatives, but apparently Appellant was not permitted to stay with those relatives. On the night before the murder, the victim, Lloyd Gehret, gave the trio money for food and permitted them to sleep in an apartment that he owned and was renovating. There was evidence that the victim was attracted to Young and Torrez, and that Appellant was told of advances that the victim had made toward them.</p>
    <p id="b225-4" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[231,335,1153,573]]]'>
      <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>The next morning, when Mr. Gehret arrived at the apartment, Appellant sliced his neck with a utility knife and killed him by bludgeoning him with a hammer. Young and Torres were present in the apartment at various points during the ten or fifteen minutes throughout which Appellant perpetrated the killing, with Young handing Appellant the hammer and stabbing at the victim with a screwdriver at Appellant’s direction. As Mr. Gehret lay dying, Appellant took his wallet and keys. Upon leaving the scene, Appellant said: “This is my 17th body, I’ll never get caught.” He discarded his bloody sweater and sweatpants in a garbage can on a nearby street.</p>
    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.5",225,[232,932,1154,521]]]'>The next day, Torrez voluntarily approached police and provided a statement implicating Appellant and Young in the killing. She disclosed the location of the bloody clothing that Appellant had discarded, which the police retrieved. Further, she indicated that Appellant and Young were staying in a specific room at a boarding house on North Front Street in Allentown, and that Appellant remained in possession of the victim’s wallet, which was located there as well. Based on this information, a detective applied for a search warrant, which was issued by a district justice.</p>
    <p id="b225-6" data-blocks='[["BL_225.6",225,[232,1476,1152,249]]]'>A police emergency response team executed the warrant, with two non-uniformed officers entering the building first.

Further, Appellant asserted that the police failed to knock and announce their presence prior to entering to execute the warrant, in violation of applicable procedural and constitutional requirements. Appellant also sought to avoid trial based on a claimed lack of competency. Initially, a court-appointed mental-health professional diagnosed Appellant as suffering from, among other disorders, <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>paranoid schizophrenia, and he reported that Appellant was incompetent to stand trial. <em>See </em>N.T., February 19, 2003, at 212-13. Appellant was thereafter involuntarily committed for further assessment and any necessary treatment. Upon his discharge, the Commonwealth produced testimony at a pretrial competency hearing that Appellant, while perhaps suffering from some mental disorders, was nevertheless competent and was malingering, and the trial court credited this evidence.</p>
    <p id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[259,826,1159,842]]]'>At trial, Young and Torrez testified as Commonwealth witnesses, and Appellant’s counsel objected and moved for a mistrial when the Commonwealth adduced testimony from them concerning Appellant’s indication that the victim’s was his “seventeenth body.” Appellant’s counsel asserted a general objection and, at sidebar, explained that the statement was “a bombshell” that was “totally unanticipated” by counsel. N.T., March 6, 2003, at 184-85. The district attorney responded that he was certain that he had disclosed the statement prior to trial. The trial court ruled that the testimony was relevant and admissible, but only to demonstrate that Appellant’s state of mind reflected a specific intent to kill, and to show that the witnesses had reason to fear Appellant, which aided in explaining their delay in reporting the crimes. The court also gave cautionary instructions concerning the limited purposes for which the evidence could be considered.</p>
    <p id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.6",226,[258,1694,1154,685]]]'>Appellant was convicted, <em>inter alia, </em>of first-degree murder and robbery.

The defense presented evidence in mitigation that Appellant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2); suffered from an impaired capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform it to the requirements of the law, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(3); was of a relatively young age at the time of his crimes, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4); and was subject to life circumstances such as poverty, abuse, and homelessness dur-</p>

Initially, the court noted that Lehigh County’s system of utilizing an annual master list of licensed drivers in the county who are eighteen years or older was deemed by this Court to be consistent with constitutional requirements in <em>Commonwealth v. Lopez, </em><a href="/pa/559/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="559 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="837113" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0131-01">559 Pa. 131</a>, 149-50, <a href="/citations/?q=789%20A.2d%20485" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="789 A.2d 485">789 A.2d 485</a>, 494-95 (1999). The trial court then considered the specific requirements that a challenger demonstrate that an identifiable group is not fairly and reasonably represented in the jury pool, and that this is the result of systematic exclusion of the group from the selection process. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=789%20A.2d%20485" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="789 A.2d 485">id.</a> </em>(citing <em>Duren v.

Referencing Appellant’s evidence consisting of census data suggesting that the Hispanic population in Lehigh County in the year 2000 represented approximately ten percent of the general county population, the trial court determined that Appellant had established neither element. In this regard, it noted that the census information was not current; there was nothing in the data particularizing the criteria used to identify members of the Hispanic population; nothing was offered to align the ten percent figure with the eligibility criteria for jury service; no evidence was adduced concerning the extent to which Hispanics were actually represented in the jury pool pertaining to Appellant’s case; and the only testimonial evidence on <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>the subject reflected an entirely race-neutral system of jury selection. <em>See Sanchez, </em>No. 3652 of 2001, <em>slip op. </em>at 28-29 (“There was not a scintilla of evidence that there was willful or even innocent exclusion of Hispanics from the jury pools in Lehigh County.”). The court also indicated that it had appropriately refused to comply with a defense request for it to direct the compilation of information concerning racial composition of jury pools, since such request was never properly made to the court. <em>See id. </em>at 30-31.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Further, given the evidence that the jury selection process in Lehigh County was appropriate and race neutral, the court saw no basis that would support granting the request in any event. <em>See id. </em>at 31.</p>
    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[225,1032,1152,841]]]'>Next, the trial court addressed Appellant’s suppression claims, first focusing on his assertion that the search warrant executed at the room where Appellant and Young were arrested was constitutionally deficient, in that the affidavit of probable cause on which it was based lacked sufficient reliability and/or corroboration. Appellant acknowledged that the affidavit was grounded on Torrez’s eyewitness account, but contended that, because Torrez was not referred to by name in the affidavit, but rather, was designated only as “the witness,” the affidavit lacked any indication that she had actual knowledge of the facts set forth there. Appellant also recognized that the affidavit disclosed the actual corroboration by police of various information that was supplied by Torrez, but maintained that some corroboration of Torrez’s identification of the address at which he and Young were located was necessary before a warrant could reasonably issue.</p>

Upon leaving the scene of the crime with Sashana Young and AnnJulie Torres, Appellant uttered this statement, saying “[t]his is my seventeenth body, I’ll never get caught.”</p>
    <p id="b244-8" data-blocks='[["BL_244.9",244,[264,1043,1152,421]]]'>The Commonwealth notes that it disclosed the seventeenth body statement to defense counsel “while on a bathroom break at some point before the first trial listing of this case in August 2002.” Brief for Appellee at 28 (citing N.T. 11/10/03 at 37). My concern is compounded further by the fact that the trial court found that “[djefense counsel did not recall having that conversation with the prosecuting attorney in the lavatory.” Trial Court Opinion at 58.</p>
    <p id="b244-9" data-blocks='[["BL_244.10",244,[260,1489,1156,366]]]'>The trial court described the Commonwealth’s mode of disclosure as “less than exemplary,” and the Majority portrays it as “unusual.” I find these descriptions to be charitable. In my opinion, the Commonwealth’s compliance with the mandatory disclosure rule was serendipitous at best, having occurred during a bathroom break when defense counsel’s visit happened to coincide with that of the prosecutor.</p>
    <p id="b244-10" data-blocks='[["BL_244.11",244,[258,1880,1153,366]]]'>I am troubled by the fact that in addition to the “seventeenth body” statement, there were other instances of undisclosed prejudicial statements of Appellant: “the Commonwealth’s apparent withholding of other, similar inculpatory statements by Appellant would tend to support a finding of non-disclosure with regard to the ‘seventeenth body’ statement as well.” Majority Opinion at 22.</p>

Brief of Appellee at 29.</p>
    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[227,628,1150,86]]]'>Pa.R.Crim.P. 573(B) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>for mandatory disclosure:</p>
    <blockquote id="b245-6" data-blocks='[["BL_245.6",245,[267,755,1110,528]]]'>1) <em>Mandatory. </em>In all court cases, on request by the defendant, and subject to any protective order which the Commonwealth might obtain under this rule, the Commonwealth shall disclose to the defendant’s attorney all of the following requested items or information, provided they are material to the instant case.

    <p id="b245-8" data-blocks='[["BL_245.8",245,[220,1634,1154,743]]]'>As the Majority acknowledges, the fact that there were other undisclosed damaging statements makes Appellant’s contention that the “seventeenth body” statement was not disclosed to counsel more credible than it might be otherwise. In this same vein, the fact that defense counsel does not remember being told about the “seventeenth body” statement buttresses the claim of Appellant of a disclosure violation. Further, the explanation of the prosecutor as to why he did not turn the statements over to defense counsel is also troubling: “the majority of discovery had been provided before [I] was assigned the case [and] it was my impression that [defense counsel] had — you had the substance of what occurred. You did not have my notes.” Brief for Appellee at 29, 30 (citing N.T. 11/10/03 at 61).</p>

      <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>Although I have a high degree of skepticism regarding the Commonwealth’s compliance with Pa.R.Crim.P. 573(B), I agree with the disposition of the Majority for the following reasons: (1) the trial court properly weighed the probative value of the evidence against its potential for unfair prejudice; (2) the trial court made factual findings that supported the position of the Commonwealth that it disclosed the “seventeenth body” statement in the lavatory, and, because the trial court is the fact-finder, we accord deference to its findings with respect to credibility, <em>Commonwealth v.

Crawley, </em><a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">514 Pa. 539</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">526 A.2d 334</a>, 342 (1987); and (5) even assuming that the trial court erred in permitting testimony regarding the “seventeenth body,” the error was harmless because of the overwhelming evidence of Appellant’s guilt, <em>Commonwealth v. Morris, </em><a href="/pa/513/0169-02" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="513 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1802550,1802581" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0169-02,/pa/513/0169-01">513 Pa. 169</a>, <a href="/pa/513/0169-02" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="519 A.2d 374" data-case-ids="1802550" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0169-02">519 A.2d 374</a> (1986).</p>
