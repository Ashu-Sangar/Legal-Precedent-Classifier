It is a two-story structure with a full basement, the entrance to which is at street level from Bigelow Boulevard.

The majority explained that the Zoning Code sets forth a two-step approval process for an off-site parking agreement: first, a written agreement among the owners of record must be obtained, and second, proof of the recordation <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>of that agreement must be presented to the zoning administrator prior to the issuance of a building permit. The majority noted that the ordinance does not specify exactly when the written agreement is required in the special application process, and concluded, in this regard, that the Zoning Board had reasonably interpreted its own ordinance as not requiring the recordable form of the agreement to be included with the application for the special exception; rather, it may be submitted and filed at the building-permit stage of the project. In reaching this conclusion, the majority recognized that courts generally defer to a zoning board’s interpretation of the ordinance it is charged to enforce. <em>See <a href="/a2d/831/0764-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="831 A.2d 764" data-case-ids="9090071" data-case-paths="/a2d/831/0764-01">id.</a> </em>at 770 (citing <em>In re Brickstone Realty Corp., </em><a href="/citations/?q=789%20A.2d%20833" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="789 A.2d 833">789 A.2d 833</a>, 339 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001)).

He opined that, because MedCano had no off-site parking agreement at the time of its application to the Zoning Board, the board should not have granted the special exception.

In light of the limited grant of allocatur in this matter as set forth above, the issue for resolution distills to whether the Zoning Board erred in finding that the Zoning Code’s standards were satisfied by MedCano’s submissions — including its Parking Management Plan, the written approval of same by the Pittsburgh City Planning Department, and the letter from Plaza Parking Services — which did not include an actual parking contract in recordable form, but which plainly reflected that Plaza and MedCano intended to enter into a parking agreement once the special exception was approved. The reason we understand this to be the central question involved, is that the specific wording of the limited grant concerned the more general issue of whether a munici<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>pal zoning authority is permitted to approve a special exception conditioned upon the applicant’s later compliance with the special exception’s express requirements as set forth in the zoning code. Clearly the answer to that question as a general proposition is yes, as the prerequisites to a special exception may, in some instances, pertain to the physical characteristics of the subject property, and it would make little sense to force a property owner to undertake expensive alterations if the special exception may not be granted in the end.

      <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>We agree with the Commonwealth Court majority that the Zoning Code is not explicit as to when the off-site parking agreement in recordable form must exist and be recorded. In particular, Section 914.07.G.2(a)(4) indicates that an off-site parking agreement between the owners of record is “required,” but it does not say when. It also states that an attested copy of that agreement must be “submitted” for recordation at the County Recorder’s office, but again it does not say when this must occur. In contrast, this provision does specify that “[p]roof of recordation of the [off-site parking] agreement shall be presented to the Zoning Administrator prior to issuance of a building permit.” This is the only aspect of Section 914.07.G.2(a)(4) that gives an explicit sequence of events. Thus, the use of the term “prior to the issuance of a building permit,” as opposed to “prior to the issuance of a special exception,” could reasonably be viewed by the Zoning Board as permitting the conditional grant of a special exception to precede the existence of the agreement in recordable form, so long as the plan as submitted fairly indicates an intention to enter into such a contract. Given this uncertainty in the code’s text, we find it appropriate to defer to the board’s evident understanding that the ordinance did not prohibit its actions in this matter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The <em>Edgmont </em>court, for example, did not suggest that the proposed land and building alterations had to be performed before a special exception could issue; rather, so long as the plan included these provisions in a satisfactory manner, approval could be given conditioned upon full compliance with the plan at a later date. Because, however, the zoning board had approved the special exception solely upon the landowner’s promise to <em>revise the plan </em>to come into compliance with the zoning code, the court reversed. <em>See id. </em>at 420. Likewise, the applicant in <em>Baird </em>simply expressed his general purpose to comply with applicable regulations, but there was nothing in the proposal as submitted to the board that reflected any intent to do so; and in <em>Lafayette College, </em>the school’s plan simply did not satisfy the zoning code’s parking requirements.</p>

Here, as noted, the Zoning Board interpreted the relevant provisions of the ordinance to permit granting a special exception where MedCano’s submissions contained adequate assurances that the off-site parking needs associated with the proposed use would be met in accordance with the requirements of the ordinance, even though no legally-binding contract existed at the time of the hearings. The board determined further that proof of such an agreement would have to be presented to the zoning administrator before a building permit could issue. This, in our view, not only represented a reasonable interpretation of the zoning <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>code’s actual text, but also comported with the realities of the business setting in which the underlying negotiations took place.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Therefore, we see no basis in the Zoning Code or in any other legal doctrine to conclude that the Zoning Board was required to insist upon the presence of an actual, recordable contract at the plan-submission stage, particularly as substantial proof that MedCano could provide the requisite number of off-site parking spaces was reflected in the parking management plan, <em>see </em>RR. 142a, the city transportation planner’s approval of the plan, <em>see </em>RR. 144a, and the letter issued by Plaza Parking Services, Inc., <em>see supra </em>note 4.</p>

The relevant provision of the second class city planning statute is broadly worded in that it permits the Zoning Board to approve special exceptions to the terms of the applicable ordinance "in harmony with its general purpose and intent and in accordance with general or specific rules contained therein.” 53 P.S. § 25057.

We also defer to the Zoning Board's apparent understanding that the term “owner,” as used in Section 914.07.G.2(a)(4), may include an entity that owns a leasehold interest giving it control over the required number of parking spaces. This makes practical sense given the Zoning Code's concern that adequate parking be guaranteed.</p>

In the regular course of business of any development of a property, a development plan is prepared and submitted to the appropriate municipal governing bodies, for approval. Once the plan is approved, it is recorded and development begins. Here, the Parking Management Plan is the counterpart of the development plan, and once it is approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, it will be recorded, as will the binding agreement with the property owner of the off-site parking facility, and development will commence. And the plain language of the Zoning Code reflects this “regular course of business" approach.</blockquote>
