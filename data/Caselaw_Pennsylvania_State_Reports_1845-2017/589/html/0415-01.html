In their Class Action Complaint (“Complaint”), Appellants alleged that IBC violated the Nonprofit Corporation Law of 1988 (“Non-Profit Law”), 15 Pa.C.S. § 5101 <em>et seq., </em>and breached contractual and fiduciary duties in having amassed an excess in surplus funds for purposes inconsistent with its non-profit status. We granted review to consider whether the Commonwealth Court correctly determined that the Complaint could not proceed in the court of common pleas due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the filed-rate doctrine. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Commonwealth Court erred. Accordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and this case is remanded to the Commonwealth Court for further proceedings.</p>

Alternatively, the Commonwealth Court also agreed with IBC on application of the filed-rate doctrine. Describing the doctrine as a rule that preserves the exclusive role of a regulatory agency in approving rates, and focusing on the interaction between the rates an insurer charges and the reserves it accumulates, the court determined that the doctrine barred Appellants’ claims because a decision from the trial court that IBC was holding excessive reserves would necessarily require a recalculation of rates that the Department had approved. <a href="/a2d/814/0800-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="814 A.2d 800" data-case-ids="9344949" data-case-paths="/a2d/814/0800-01">814 A.2d at 804-05</a>.

Under 40 P.S. § 41, the Department is charged with executing the insurance laws of the Commonwealth. Thus, under the Accident and Health Filing Reform Act, the Department is authorized to approve IBC’s rates and to disapprove of and provide redress for rates that are inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or excessive; under the Health Plan Corporations Act, the Department is authorized to, <em>inter alia, </em>examine IBC’s financial condition and approve its reserves; and under Article V-B of the Insurance Department Act of 1921, the Department is authorized to monitor and evaluate the adequacy of IBC’s surplus as it relates to IBC financial solvency through application of a risk-based capital formula. 40 P.S. §§ 6124, 6125; 40 P.S. §§ 3803, 3808; 40 P.S. § 221.1-B <em>et seq. </em>At the same time, in the Non-Profit Law, the Legislature has granted the court of common pleas the power to hear and determine the validity of “corporate action” and to make such orders as may be just and proper, including the power to enforce document production and inspection in the Non-Profit Law; and in the Judicial Code, the “unlimited original jurisdiction of all actions and proceedings, including all actions and proceedings heretofore cognizable by law or usage in the courts of common pleas.” 15 P.S. §§ 5508, 5791-5793; 42 Pa.C.S. § 931.</p>

First, the court mischaracterized the allegations <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>in their Complaint as aimed at securing judicial regulation of IBC’s rates and reserves, and second, failed to recognize that the Complaint makes claims under the Non-Profit Law and the common law, both of which are committed to the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas, for IBC’s actions in having accumulated an excess in surplus for impermissible purposes. IBC counters that the Commonwealth Court correctly understood that: the injury about which Appellants actually complain is the payment of excessive premiums; that since the amounts an insurer holds in reserve is a function of the rates it charges, Appellants’ challenge to an alleged excess in its surplus is necessarily a challenge to IBC’s rates; that any review of assertions that IBC retained excessive funds does not come under the Non-Profit Law, but under statutes exclusively administered by the Department; and that Appellants’ attempt to secure review of an approved rate in a court of law is precluded under the filed-rate doctrine.</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[244,1253,1159,897]]]'>We agree with Appellants. At his juncture in the proceedings, on preliminary objections, we do not conclude that it is clear and free from doubt that Appellants’ Complaint amounts to nothing more than a request that the court of common pleas second-guess an approved rate, as IBC argues, or that the court assume the Department’s regulation of IBC’s reserves or risk-based capital. <em>See Hospital Healthsystem Ass’n of Pennsylvania, </em>888 A.2d at 607. Rather, we view the Complaint as raising whether IBC violated the Non-Profit Law and committed breaches of contractual and fiduciary duties in amassing a fund designated as surplus that was in amount, over and above that necessary for IBC to operate properly, meet its legal obligations, or secure its financial solvency, and in dedicating that fund to certain purposes. These are claims that the Legislature has empowered the court of common pleas, not the Department, to adjudicate. <em>See </em>15 P.S. §§ 5508, 5791-5793; 42 Pa.C.S. § 931.</p>

Policyholders of Covenant filed a complaint against the Company, its directors and Provident, alleging a derivative claim for breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets and abuse of control, and a class action claim based on the alleged fundamental unfairness of the merger. Provident filed preliminary objections, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that since the complaint challenged the Department’s approval of the merger and the Department’s finding that the merger was fair, the complaint should be dismissed because the issues it raised were not for the court of common pleas to adjudicate, and had been already decided by the Department. The policyholders countered that since the claims sounded in tort, they were not within the Department’s jurisdiction, but properly before the trial court. The trial court sustained Provident’s preliminary objections; the Superior Court reversed. On appeal, this Court upheld the Superi- or Court. Upon reviewing the allegations and claims set forth in the complaint, we held that while the Complaint contained allegations about the fairness of the merger as well as the consideration that Provident paid for Covenant’s surplus, when read as a whole, the claims asserted against Appellants were for torts in consummating the merger, and thus, belonged in the trial court. <em><a href="/a2d/712/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="712 A.2d 273" data-case-ids="11809430,507774" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0273-01,/pa/551/0570-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/712/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="712 A.2d 273" data-case-ids="11809430,507774" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0273-01,/pa/551/0570-01">at 277-78</a>.</p>
