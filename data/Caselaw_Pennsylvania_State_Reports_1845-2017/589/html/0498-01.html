Claimant develops this argument by reference to the Second Restatement of Judgments, which discusses a “need for flexibility in the operative principles” of collateral estoppel. Restatement (Second) of Judgments, Introductory Note to Ch. 3, Top. 2, Tit. E (Issue Preclusion).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> According to Claimant, the public interest will be affected, directly and adversely, by a decision permitting municipal civil service commissions to decide workers’ compensation issues. In this regard, Claimant highlights that the Workers’ Compensation Act is unique social legislation enacted under specific constitutional authority, <em>see </em>Pa. Const. art. III § 18,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> for the protection of most employees in the Commonwealth; develops that workers’ compensation judges are trained in the specialized legal and <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>medical matters pertinent to their duties; and observes that the General Assembly has taken pains to standardize practices and procedures in furtherance of a uniform, statewide system. Claimant asserts that this scheme will be undermined if collateral estoppel is applied in the present situation, since local governments will likely chose to litigate employees’ claims to benefits for work-related injuries within their own, idiosyncratic civil service systems. The result, Claimant contends, would foster abuse by permitting local government employers to avoid the specialized expertise and scrutiny of neutral, professional workers’ compensation judges and Board members, subject claims to consideration by untrained political appointees having interests aligned with those of government-employers, and undermine uniformity and workers’ entitlements. Indeed, Claimant analogizes the present situation to one that the Commonwealth Court characterized as an effort by an employer to “effectively ‘sandbag* the compensation system.” <em>Francisco v. WCAB (Patterson-Kelley Co.), </em><a href="/a2d/707/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="707 A.2d 584" data-case-ids="11857493" data-case-paths="/a2d/707/0584-01">707 A.2d 584</a>, 588 n. 5 (Pa.Cmwlth.1998). Thus, Claimant argues that “a fresh determination of the factual issues by a [workers’ compensation judge] is warranted.” <em>Verbilla, </em>668 A.2d at 605. Finally, in support of his policy arguments, Claimant references a series of cases holding that decisions of unemployment compensation referees are not binding in various contexts, even where the issues are identical.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

The City follows the approach of the Commonwealth Court and the Board in discerning an identity of issue between the Commission’s conclusion that Claimant was capable of performing full duty and the workers’ compensation judge’s determination concerning earning capacity. The City proceeds to furnish a description of the various procedures and burdens in the civil service and workers’ compensation contexts, including references to the City’s burden in a Regulation 32 appeal, <em>see Sweed v.

The perspective of the City is that the considerations in a Regulation 32 appeal are more favorable to claimants than those prevailing in a workers’ compensation reinstatement context, because the employer is the party with the burden to prove that the employee is no longer disabled or that the employee’s current disability is not related to his previous work injury. As such, and because the City actually proved before the Commission that Claimant was able to perform his full duties, it is the City’s position that the reinstatement petition which, by its nature, depended on the same allegations, must fail.</p>

Further, it criticizes the workers’ compensation judge’s perspective concerning issue preclusion as superficial. Specifically, it develops that — whereas she distinguished the procedures available in the civil service and workers’ compensation settings on the basis that a workers’ compensation judge may subpoena witnesses, hear evidence, make a record of hearings and issue findings, conclusions and orders — the Commission actually possesses similar powers in these regards. Finally, the City disputes Claimant’s argument that local governments will attempt to subvert the workers’ compensation system by channeling benefits matters in such a way as to obtain dispositive rulings in a preferred forum. In this respect, the City asserts that the allegation of bias on the part of municipal civil service commissions is unfounded and observes that it is the employee who elects to invoke the Commission’s jurisdiction under Regulation 32.11 in any event.</p>

First, we agree with the City that Claimant’s allegations of bias are bald, unfounded, and conflict with the presumption of regularity that courts generally afford to administrative proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Cross County Entertainment, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>101 Pa.Cmwlth. 98, 103, <a href="/pa-commw/101/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="515 A.2d 997" data-case-ids="1354264" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/101/0098-01">515 A.2d 997</a>, 999 (1986). The City’s critique of some of the workers’ compensation judge’s reasoning in declining to apply preclusion principles is also apt, as workers’ compensa<a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>tion judges and the Commission do enjoy similar powers on the points that were discussed. We also agree with the City that there is a sufficient identity between the dispositive issues in the Commission and workers’ compensation proceedings to satisfy the first element of collateral estoppel. On this point, certainly Claimant is correct that the term “disability” is defined differently in the workers’ compensation setting to subsume both physical capacity to work and job availability. <em>See, e.g., Dillon v. WCAB (Greenwich Collieries), </em><a href="/pa/536/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="536 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1843144" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0490-01">536 Pa. 490</a>, 501-02, <a href="/pa/536/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="640 A.2d 386" data-case-ids="1843144,7861845" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0490-01,/a2d/640/0386-01">640 A.2d 386</a>, 392 (1994). However, in the Regulation 32.11 setting in which this case arises, disability need only encompass the physical capacity factor, because the employer has required the claimant to report to a specific job that was held open. <em>See </em>Phila. Civ. Serv. Reg. 32.11 (providing for an appeal to the Commission from a directive to the claimant to return to work).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> Finally, we perceive a greater degree of commonality, than does Claimant, in the policies and objectives of the Workers’ Compensation Act and Regulation 32’s affordance of full-salary benefits to injured police officers, as we believe that they do share an underlying humanitarian objective.</p>

In the first instance, we agree with Claimant’s position that the decisions applying common principles as between workers’ compensation and Regulation 32 proceedings, <em>see supra </em>note 8, are not controlling in terms of whether Regulation 32 proceedings should be accorded preclusive effect in the work<a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>ers’ compensation setting. Moreover, we find the present situation sufficiently analogous to the line of cases declining to apply collateral estoppel relative to decisions of unemployment compensation referees in subsequent civil and workers’ compensation proceedings. <em>See supra </em>note 15. Significantly, this Court’s decision in this line relied on the substantial procedural and economic disparities between unemployment compensation proceedings and later civil and administrative proceedings. <em>See Rue, </em>552 Pa. at 20-21, 713 A.2d at 86-87.</p>
    <p id="b689-4" data-blocks='[["BL_689.5",689,[243,826,1154,1374]]]'>In the present context, Regulation 32 implements a scheme by which the City affords wage-loss and other benefits in lieu of workers’ compensation benefits for a closed period, consistent with the City’s obligations under the Heart and Lung Act. Payment of salary is limited to one year, subject to potential extension by the City for a period of up to three years. <em>See </em>Phila. Civ. Serv. Reg. 32.05. Both because liability under the Workers’ Compensation Act may span a substantially longer period and because the benefits available under Regulation 32 supplant workers’ compensation benefits for a defined period, the employee’s net recovery, and the City’s (or any insurer’s) net risk, under Regulation 32 is substantially narrower in scope than the potential liability under the workers’ compensation scheme. In particular, with regard to an employee claiming total disability, the net amounts in controversy in Regulation 32 proceedings are substantially lower than in a workers’ compensation matter that may result in lifetime benefits. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 511. On the procedural side, the Workers’ Compensation Act details extensive procedures for resolving various disputes concerning benefits, <em>see </em>77 P.S. §§ 701-791, that are lacking under Regulation 32. Thus, although the Commission has tools at its disposal similar to those available to a workers’ compensation judge, such as the power to issue subpoenas, the procedures under Regulation 32 are substantially more <em>ad hoe </em>than those pertaining in the workers’ compensation arena.</p>

As this Court has previously explained, the Workers’ Compensation Act’s “uniquely detailed substantive and procedural provisions” supplant traditional common law rights and remedies, limiting recoveries in a manner that, in any other context, would be beyond the Legislature’s authority. <em>East, </em>574 Pa. at 25, 828 A.2d at 1021. Philadelphia’s civil service regulations, on the other hand, arise in a significantly different landscape and have a substantially different focus, as they encompass many other forms of employment actions and decisions, with which Regulation 32 benefits are intermingled.

We do not attach a great deal of significance, however, to the fact that the employee initiates the appeal under Regulation 32.11. Certainly, it would be possible to force the claimant who desires a dispositive ruling concerning earning capacity by a workers' compensation judge into an election between pursuing a workers' compensation decision and preserving the possibility of full-salary payments under Regulation 32. We believe that one important purpose of Regulation 32, however, is to afford supplemental benefits to police officers in recognition of their essential social contributions and the risks that attend them. We do not believe, therefore, that police officers should be specially foreclosed from a workers’ compensation decision merely because they pursued an appeal relative to such supplemental benefits.</p>
