For the reasons stated herein, we conclude that this' type of prior conviction does constitute grounds to impose a third-degree felony gradation. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

In June 2001, Lori Nester (Nester) terminated a romantic relationship with Thomas Edward Bortz (Bortz). Unhappy with this arrangement, Bortz began to threaten Nester. On August 14, 2001, she obtained a PFA order against him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>Bortz was undeterred and continued to place phone calls and deliver love letters to Nester. He also made unannounced visits in person in spite of the PFA order prohibiting contact with Nester. After contempt hearings, Bortz was convicted of violations of the PFA order on November 11, 2001, May 2, 2002 and June 20, 2002. See Notes of Transcript (N.T.), 11/12-13/03, at 50-51. Despite these convictions, he persisted. In the early morning hours of August 31, 2002 Bortz rang Nester’s doorbell. Nester called the police, who arrived to discover a white foamy substance on the hood of Nester’s car. The same substance was discovered on her neighbor’s car the next morning. Bortz was arrested and confessed to the police that he rang the doorbell and sprayed the vehicles. (Commonwealth Exhibit Number 2; N.T., 11/12-13/03 at 105).</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.7",609,[245,1091,1150,362]]]'>Bortz was charged with one count of stalking under 18 Pa.C.S. § 2709.1, graded as a third-degree felony, as well as two counts of criminal mischief under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3304, and one count of loitering and prowling at nighttime under 18 Pa.C.S. § 5506. A jury convicted Bortz on all counts. The trial court sentenced Bortz to prison for 15 to 84 months on the stalking conviction.</p>

The majority found that one of the enumerated crimes of violence under the statute is a violation of a PFA order involving the same victim pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 6108. Judge McEwen dissented, contending that Bortz was never previously “convicted of a crime of violence” relating to the victim, but rather was adjudicated in civil contempt of a PFA order. He specifically noted that these violations were related to the fact that Bortz delivered twenty-three love letters to the victim’s home despite the existence of the PFA <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>order. Further, he remarked that the love letters attached to the trial transcript do not contain threats of any kind, but are mere professions of love and affection. Therefore, because none of Bortz’s indirect criminal contempt convictions involved any act of violence, and the statute requires a “crime of violence” for felony grading, Judge McEwen argued that there is no evidentiary basis to uphold a felony grading.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[263,747,1156,484]]]'>Bortz now contends that the lower courts improperly conflated the mere existence of a PFA order against him with a criminal conviction for a “crime of violence.” Bortz also adopts the dissenting argument made by Judge McEwen that Bortz had not been convicted of a “crime of violence,” but was merely found in contempt of a civil order.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Lastly, Bortz contends that Commonwealth failed to prove that the victim of his prior convictions was the same victim involved in his stalking conviction.</p>

The plain language of the statute provides an illustrative list of violations which are crimes of violence. One of those enumerated examples states that a “crime of violence” occurs when there is a violation of an extant PFA order issued under 23 Pa.C.S. § 6108. This language is explicit and free from ambiguity. So under 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b) we need look no further than the words of the statute to determine the Legislature’s intent.

He is correct. Bortz does not merit felony grading merely because a PFA order against him existed. Rather, he merits felony grading because he <em>violated </em>that order. In his pre-trial motion <em>in limine, </em>Bortz admitted to three prior convictions for indirect criminal contempt based on violations of the PFA order obtained by Nester.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Motion, 11/10/03, at ¶¶ 9-11. Further, Nester testified at trial regarding these violations and the fact that Bortz made numerous oral, written and physical communications with both her and her granddaughter during the period the PFA was in effect. N.T., 11/12-13/03, at 50-51. Finally, the Superior Court specifically noted that, <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>contrary to Bortz’s claim, a certified copy of the PFA order was admitted into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 126. Therefore, Bortz’s contention that the Commonwealth failed to prove that Nester was both the victim of his civil contempt violation of a PFA order and the victim of his stalking conviction is meritless.</p>

He was, therefore, in violation of an order issued under 23 Pa.C.S. § 6108. Further, Nester was the victim of both his PFA violation and his stalking violation. The stalking statute clearly reads that a first time offender who was previously convicted of a crime of violence involving the same victim, family, or household member including a violation of an order issued under 23 Pa.C.S. § 6108 will receive third-degree felony gradation. To read the statute in any other manner would fail to give effect to all of its terms.</p>
