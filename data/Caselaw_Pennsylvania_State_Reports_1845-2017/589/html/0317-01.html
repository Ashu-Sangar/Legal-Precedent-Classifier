Kvaerner’s Bf. in Opposition to National Union’s Motion for Summary Judgment, at 6, 24. In support of this claim, Kvaerner submitted a report from two experts in which they collectively opined that the damages to the Battery were caused from displacement and movement of the Battery’s roof, which occurred because Kvaerner grouted the bricks earlier than had been scheduled. <em>See </em>Expert Report of Mr. Chuck Beechan and Dr. Clayton Liu, Exh. 8 to Appendix to Kvaerner’s Responses in Opposition to the Motions for Summary Judgment of Commercial Union and National Union and in Support of its Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. The experts further opined, however, that “the heavy ‘monsoon-type’ rain which occurred on October 31 could have damaged the joints in the roof.” <em>Id. </em>at 3. Kvaerner then explained that because it did not intend or expect the early grouting of the Battery’s bricks or the October 31 rains to cause the movement in the Battery’s roof and thereby damage the Battery, the Battery’s damages were caused by an “accident” for purposes of the Policies.

According to Kvaerner, it was entitled to coverage under the above provisions because the damages to the Battery occurred after it was completed by Kvaerner and were the result of Thyssen’s decision to permit Kvaerner to grout the bricks on the Battery’s roof earlier than scheduled.

The Superior Court found that these exclusions may have precluded coverage for the Bethlehem lawsuit if an endorsement had not been added to the 1997 Policy, changing the effect of the exclusions. The court explained that while the “business risk/work product exclusions” generally barred coverage for damages caused by work performed by the insured or the insured’s subcontractor, endorsement 16, which was added to the 1997 Policy in March 1997, altered the exclusions by permitting coverage for property damage caused by the insured’s subcontractor. Given this endorsement, the Superior Court found that it could not conclude as a matter of law that the “business risk/work product” exclusions precluded coverage in the instant case until findings of fact were made regarding the amount of work performed by Kvaerner’s subcontractors and whether any of that work caused the Battery’s damages.
