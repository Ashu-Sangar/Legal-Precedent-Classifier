Petitioner has continued to abstain since that time and has not had an alcoholic drink since July 14, 2003. It was in July 2003 that Petitioner began attending AA meetings and recognizing the dominant role that alcohol played in his life. Petitioner is a serious participant in AA meetings, attending two or three of them each week. Additionally, Petitioner attends weekly group therapy facilitated by Dr. Limoges for lawyers in recovery from alcoholism. Dr. Limoges indicated that passing the one year mark in sobriety is significant, and persons who have passed approximately the first year or year and a half have a very, very low rate of relapse.

Dr. Limoges gave Petitioner an excellent prognosis based on his uninterrupted sobriety, his acceptance of his diagnosis, his motivation to succeed, the support of his family and friends, and his continued involvement with AA.</p>

Petitioner is ashamed of his past misconduct and believes that he is not the same person he once was. Once he stopped drinking and got involved in AA, Petitioner had the ability to step back and see the interplay of the alcoholism and his conduct.

      <em>In Matter of David J. Hirsch </em>90 DB 1995, 74 RST 2002 ((Pa. June 29, 2004)), Mr. Hirsch was disbarred on consent in 1995 after he was convicted of racketeering and criminal forfeiture. He was incarcerated for 11 months, followed by two months in a halfway house and supervised release for three years. Mr. Hirsch presented evidence at his reinstatement hearing that he had a long history of alcoholism punctuated by an equally lengthy, 12 year history of sobriety attempts. Between 1991 and 2001 Mr. Hirsch made five attempts to achieve sobriety without relapse and was unable to do so. The only time he was able to stay sober for any length was during his incarceration and supervised release. <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>After that ended he could not stay sober. He relapsed in 2000; his involvement in a car accident with his daughter in the car prompted him to return to AA. At the time of the reinstatement he had been sober for two years. Dr. Limoges was the expert in Mr. Hirsch’s case. He described Mr. Hirsch as emerging from denial in 2001 and finally having the ability to stay sober. Despite Dr. Limoges’ testimony, the Board denied Mr. Hirsch’s reinstatement based specifically on the context of Mr. Hirsch’s history of alcoholism intertwined with relapses. The Board emphasized that Mr. Hirsch had stayed sober for more than two years in the past due to the definite limitations on his ability to consume alcohol while imprisoned or on supervised release, but had eventually relapsed even after such a period of time, so his ability to remain sober was uncertain and therefore a very critical issue. Petitioner Lord’s situation is certainly different. He has no history of failed attempts at sobriety and he has not been in denial about his alcoholism since his acceptance of his disease in 2003.</p>

Between 1996 and 2001, Mr. Frankel made numerous attempts to become sober by either self-treatment or participation in AA. These attempts were not successful. It was only after Mr. Frankel’s relationship with his wife began to collapse that he entered an inpatient program in 2001. He stayed in the program for a total of 93 days. Three months later he filed his request for reinstatement, having been sober for six months. At the time of his hearing, he was sober for approximately 13 months.

Another critical piece of information is that Mr. Frankel’s motivation for his misconduct was to support his drug addiction. It was the very reason why he converted client funds.
