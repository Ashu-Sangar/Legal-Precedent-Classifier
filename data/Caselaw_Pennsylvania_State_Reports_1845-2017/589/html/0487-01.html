An argument ensued between appellant and his supervisor, which culminated in security guard Dwayne O’Brien escorting appellant to his car. When the men arrived at the car, O’Brien noticed a number of Nine West shoe boxes in the car. O’Brien asked if appellant had receipts for the shoes; appellant pushed O’Brien and got into the car.

The essence of my departure from the majority opinion is the determination of what constitutes such a substantial step, such that the intent to cause “fear of imminent serious bodily injury or death” (simple assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2701(a)(3)) can be distinguished from the intent to “cause serious bodily injury to another,” (aggravated assault 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1)) beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

I am concerned that the fact that the victim in this case was a good Samaritan weighed in the determination of whether the assault committed was more egregious than it would have been had the victim been other than a good Samaritan.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> At the trial, the victim testified that he witnessed Matthews have a “complete head-on collision with the right side of the guardrail.” R. 37. The scene was smoke filled and the car was severely damaged. R. 37-38. The Appellant, Matthews, was unconscious. R. 38. Matthews regained consciousness and pushed a revolver into the victim’s throat while asking whether the victim was a police officer. R. 39-40. Appellant searched through the car several times and around areas where the car had been. R. 41-43. Periodically, the <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>Appellant would point the gun at the defendant. R. 41-43. When a third car pulled up, Matthews starting yelling “you’re f — ing dead. I’m going to f — ing Mil you.” and then ran away. R. 43. Matthews never fired the gun, nor did he attempt to fire the gun. Although his conduct was far from that accepted in polite society, according to the victim, Appellant’s verbal threats to Mil him were far spaced from pushing the gun to the victim’s throat and actually came just as the defendant ran away.</p>
    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[244,820,1156,849]]]'>The legislature has adopted two separate statutes to punish two different assault-based illegal activities. The first, simple assault, is defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2701(a)(3), which provides that “[a] person is guilty of assault if he attempts by physical menace to put another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.” The official comments to that section indicate that “[s]ubsection (a)(3) covers the situation when the actor intends to frighten even though he does not intend, or lacks ability, to commit a battery.” The second, aggravated assault, graded as a first degree felony (the type of aggravated assault for which the Appellant was convicted with regard to Wachter, the victim) is defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1), which provides that “[a] person is guilty of aggravated assault if he attempts to cause serious bodily injury to another, or causes such injury intentionally, knowingly or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.”</p>
    <p id="b673-6" data-blocks='[["BL_673.6",673,[243,1692,1153,687]],["BL_674.1",674,[260,327,1155,463]]]'>As the majority pointed out, “[a]n attempt under § 2702(a)(1) requires a showing of some act, albeit not one causing serious bodily injury, accompanied by an intent to inflict serious bodily injury.” <em>Op. </em>at 491, 909 A.2d at 1257 <em>(citing Alexander). </em>The majority also correctly cited 18 Pa.C.S. § 302(b)(1)(i) for the proposition that “[a] person acts intentionally with respect to a material element of an offense when ... it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result....” However, after this, the majority goes on to find that the fact that Appellant pressed the gun into the victim’s throat, while asking if the victim was a police officer, and several minutes later threatened to kill the victim before running away is sufficient to infer an intent <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>to cause serious bodily injury. To the contrary, these facts are not sufficient to find that Matthews’ conscious object was to inflict serious bodily injury, rather than to cause fear in his victim. The majority notes that Wachter feared for his life. This is exactly the fear that is addressed by the simple assault statute. However, I would note that Wachter’s fear is not at issue, as it is the <em>mens rea </em>of Matthews that is required to turn simple assault into aggravated assault, not the mental state of the victim.</p>
