The court below held that, since the government was operating the system, it would be liable for the injury, if any one was, and entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff alleges that other clauses in the joint resolution and proclamation, show this was not intended; but, since the argument here, the Supreme Court of the United States, upon consideration of those documents, in their entirety, has decided in Western Union Telegraph Company v. Poston, 65 L. Ed. (U. S. Adv.) 709, that defendant is not liable for anything done or omitted after the government took control; and, by reason thereof, the joint resolution, as thus construed, has become \u201cthe supreme law of the land\u201d: Art. YI, Constitution of the United States.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed.",
