Costello, deceased.\nDefendant filed an affidavit of defense; but plaintiffs asked for judgment in their favor because of the failure to serve a copy of the affidavit on them, or their counsel, as required by a rule of the court below; judgment was entered as prayed for, and this appeal followed.\nThe rule in question provides: \u201cA copy of the affidavit of defense shall be served on the plaintiff or his attorney within forty-eight hours after it is filed; otherwise the plaintiff may take a rule for judgment, supported by an affidavit that a copy of the affidavit of defense has not been served as required by this rule.\u201d\nWhile the judgment was entered for a default which ordinarily would be relieved against, yet, since the pleadings fail to suggest any defense on the merits, we cannot say that the court below abused its discretion in the premises.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
