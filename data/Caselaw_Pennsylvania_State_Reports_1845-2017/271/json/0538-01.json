In our judgment there is no substantial difference in the facts admitted on the first trial and the proofs offered on the second; and there is nothing in the facts and circumstances which developed on the second trial that would warrant the court in saying as a matter of law that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.",
