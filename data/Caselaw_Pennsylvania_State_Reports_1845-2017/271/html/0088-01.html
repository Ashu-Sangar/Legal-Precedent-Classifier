Chestnut Street is crossed at right-angles by Pine Street, and, partly owing to the tracks of the railroad being laid in the center of Chestnut Street, the grade of Pine Street as it approaches Chestnut Street sharply ascends, which required plaintiff, who was driving on Pine Street, to operate his truck in low gear in order to make the crossing. The truck had almost cleared the track, when it was struck at the rear end by defendant’s locomotive, plaintiff was thrown from his seat, and sustained serious injuries, to recover damages for which, this action was brought; the verdict was in his favor and defendant has appealed, contending that judgment should be entered for it notwithstanding the verdict.</p>

    <p id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[273,1485,1152,633]]]'>The negligence charged against defendant, which the court submitted for the jury’s consideration, was the failure to have the headlight of the locomotive lit and neglect to give notice of the approach of the train by bell or whistle. Conceding, as defendant does, these two matters to be for the jury, and the jury having found for plaintiff, all the attending circumstances of the collision must necessarily be viewed, on defendant’s motion for judgment n. o. v., in the most advantageous light for plaintiff (Keinath v. Bullock, Receiver, <a href="/pa/267/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="267 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="1057739" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0589-01">267 Pa. 589</a>). Thus viewing the case, we have the following facts and circumstances to deal with:</p>

Under these circumstances, the question of plaintiff’s contributory negligence was for the jury: Bush v. Phila. &amp; Reading Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/232/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="232 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="977879" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0327-01">232 Pa. 327</a>; Bond v. Penna. R. R.
