Believing that combination would be more profitable, favorable legislation was obtained, one road would lease others, and those owned and leased would be run as a single system. Ultimately many of them were leased by the Philadelphia Traction Company, which, with its leased lines and those still operating under their original charters, were later leased by the Union Traction Company; and it, in turn, with all its leased lines, was leased by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, which is now the sole operating company in the city. This latter lease is the only one to which the last-named company is a party; but thereby, as by all the other leases, it was provided'that the lessee company should carry out the terms and conditions of <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>the preceding leases, for which its lessors were responsible. Those contracts provided for specified rentals, to be paid by the lessee to the lessor, sufficient to cover the fixed charges of the latter and a stated dividend to its stockholders; and, since the leases included the franchises of the original companies, the latter were denuded of everything except their mere corporate existence. All this occurred long before the Public Service Company Law of July 26, 1913, P. L. 1374, went into effect; and those contracts, of course, are of binding force, according to their terms, unless the State constitutionally can interfere and actually has interfered therewith on behalf of the public.</p>

Campbell, filed another intervening complaint (which it afterwards amended) against all of the underlying companies, — but not the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, — enlarging and slightly changing, though not substantially altering, the original intervening complaint and prayer thereof, save that, as stated, it brought in more defendants, and also definitely averred the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company had no charter rights to operate cars on any street of the city, but is running them “solely as agent or lessee of the respondent underlying companies; and that said underlying companies cannot escape their duty to the public or exact from the public unreasonable compensation, and place themselves beyond the reach of the public laws by merely making contracts between themselves and the holding companies.”</p>

The Superior Court overruled the motions to quash, sustained the demurrers and reversed the orders of the commission, so far as related to each of the appellants here. Upon application by the City of Philadelphia, the United Business Men’s Association and George J. Campbell, and the Public Service Commission, we allowed each of them to appeal to this court, so far as related to twenty-one of the decrees entered by the Superior Court, with the result that we have to consider sixty-three appeals, including the present one, the arguments here being limited by us to the three questions hereinafter stated, the first one of which is: “Were the orders of the Public Service Commission, here in question, of a character appealable to the Superior Court?”</p>

In answering this, but little aid is received by considering what has been decided regarding the meaning of these words in other statutes, for here we have a complete and exclusive system in and of itself. Everybody admits the legislature could not have intended, by this section, to give an appeal from every order of the commission, no matter how unimportant (as, for instance, from an order adjourning a hearing until the next day); and hence the courts must either give to the words “any finding or determination” a purely arbitrary meaning, entirely aside from a consideration of the act itself (which would be judicial legislation and not judicial construction, and hence never to be tolerated unless no other course is open), or we must seek in the act the meaning intended, and this, of course, is the correct method (Long v.

Happily, an investigation along this line makes the intent clear, and decides the point in accordance with the general policy of our law, which forbids appeals from interlocutory orders, unless they are expressly provided for by statute. That the order appealed from (which only required an answer and arranged for fixing a time for a hearing later) is interlocutory, and would not ordinarily be the subject of an appeal, every one must concede : Arnold v.

The “written finding, determination or order” which these two sections specify shall be filed of record, clearly must be the one from which an appeal may be taken under section 17, “within, thirty days after the filing of any finding or determination by the commission.” Without going into further detail, it may be said that tie balance of this section, which provides that the appeal shall be accompanied by an affidavit that “injustice has been done” by the ruling, determination or order from which the appeal is taken (not “may be done” if some time in the future an order is made as to the rates to be charged), as well as the other sections of the act, all point to the conclusion that the “finding or determination,” which may be appealed from, is the “finding or determination,” referred to in the preceding sections, and make certain that the act was drafted in conformity with, and not.as an exception.to, the policy of the law above referred to, and hence, in rate cases, excludes appeals from purely interlocutory orders of the commission, not affecting the rates being charged, just as they are held barred, in other proceedings, unless statutorily allowed. This does not mean that no appeal <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>can be taken from an order fixing rates, or from an order in part satisfying a complaint as to rates, simply because it is not a final order ending the proceedings. An appeal will lie from such an order, though it is only to be temporarily in force, for it thus directs a partial satisfaction of the complaint to the “extent and within such time as the commission shall specify”; and is, therefore, covered by article VI, section 19, which refers to an “appeal by a public service company from an order of the commission' establishing, changing, or altering, or in any manner affecting, the prices, rates, joint rates, tolls, or charges for any service.” The order here appealed from does not, however, affect the rates being charged; and hence, assuming the commission had jurisdiction of the person and subject of inquiry, it would designate a matter of procedure only, not the subject of an appeal, whereas if the commission lacked jurisdiction in other respects, it would have to be treated otherwise, as will be shown later.</p>

If, literally, “any finding or determination by the commission” can be followed by an appeal, as, unless limited in the way herein stated, it may be (since no other limitation has been or can be found in the statute), the whole system may be made farcical by those who desire to destroy it, and no relief could be had against such action. Instead of the commission directing its own course of procedure, it could only do so subject to an appeal to the Superior Court, following “any finding or determination” by the commission. Every “finding, determination or order,” however unimportant, would have to remain unacted upon for fifteen days, because, under article VI, section 14, a rehearing thereof may be applied for within that time. After this was disposed of, the matter would have to remain in abeyance thirty days longer in order to ascertain, under section 17 of the same article, whether an appeal would be taken, <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>and, under sections 18 and 21 thereof, an additional thirty days, after notice of the. appeal, for certification of the record and an answer by the commission. The appeal would then have to be decided by the Superior Court, after the usual delays for preparation of paper-books, fixing a time for hearing, argument and decision. It would then go back to the commission, with the same course possible after the next -unimportant “finding or determination,” and so after , every succeeding one, to each of which also there might be a petition for rehearing, appeal to the Superior Court, etc., etc., all of them together resulting in delaying the proceedings for an indefinite period of time. It is impossible of belief that the legislature intended to give the Superior Court either the power or duty thus to direct the commission in purely procedural matters (over which, by article Y, section 26, the commission itself is given full authority), or to make it possible to have delays which would effectually destroy one of the most important reasons for the passage of the act. Yet these conclusions are inevitable, unless the one reached in this opinion is adopted.</p>

Moreover, it is quite probable <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>that, if appeals from interlocutory orders were permitted whenever the public service company chose to take them, the expense, in the long run, would be as great as or greater than by limiting them as herein specified; and certainly to allow them in trivial or procedural matters would burden the courts with numerous appeals, would drag the proceedings to an inordinate length, and, as already suggested, would give to companies, willing to risk any expense in order to tire out a complainant, an opportunity to defeat the purpose of the statute.</p>

This difference in language, while a matter for consideration, cannot operate to enlarge the meaning of the other sections, especially as there may be “judgments, orders or decrees” of the Superior Court which are interlocutory in their nature, simply remitting the record to the commission for further proceedings in consonance with the order of the court, and hence ought not to be appealed to this court until the controversy is ended, so far as the commission and Superior Court are concerned, — in itself another proof of the legislative intention not to cumber these cases with unnecessary appeals.</p>

Since their inception, courts of chancery have exercised the right to grant injunctive relief against acts done or about to be done, to the injury of the party complaining. Originally the long arm of the chancellor reached out and stayed the hands of the common law judges in ordinary legal proceedings, as well as it did <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>those of administrative officers; but the exercise of this power, in the former instances, found little countenance here. One has to go far back, however, to find a time when a court of equity would not enjoin the proceedings of an administrative tribunal, if a proper cause for relief was presented. Presumptively the legislature knew this when it passed section 31, and intended thereby that this well-known and effective remedy should be applicable to proceedings by the new administrative jurisdiction it created, notwithstanding it had already provided that some of the orders of the commission should be the subject of an appeal under section 17; and to the end that long delays in applying this equitable remedy might not result, it made section 31 applicable to an order of any commissioner, as well as of the commission itself, and authorized relief by “modifying, suspending, or staying” the order, as well as by “annulling” it, adding, ex majori cautela, that every such “rule, regulation, finding, determination or order under the provisions of this act,......shall be and remain conclusive upon all parties affected thereby unless set aside, annulled, or modified in an appeal or proceeding taken as provided in this act.” In accordance, therefore, with the principle that the methods provided by established practice will be followed, unless the new statute, being interpreted, declares otherwise, and, if it does, will be modified only to the extent indicated therein, we find no difficulty in concluding that, so far as rates, service and facilities are concerned, no appeal will lie under section 17, except from an order of the commission dismissing the complaint or requiring the respondent to satisfy it in whole or in part; while, under section 31, if, for jurisdictional reasons, affecting the parties or the subject-matter complained of, the commission or a commissioner is exceeding the powers given by the statute, an injunction may be granted, thereby once and for all disposing of the question thus raised. It follows that, in the present in<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>stance, the appeal should have been quashed, and that the Superior Court erred in not so deciding.</p>

In answering it we are not concerned with what the legislature might have done, but with what it actually has <em>done; </em>for we are all of opinion the act does not authorize the commission to alter the leases of the underlying companies.</p>

The Public Service Company Law, however, like all others not in the course of the common law and providing extrajudicial remedies (even though the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred may ultimately be brought within the scrutiny of a court), covers only such matters as are expressly or by necessary implication included within its terms; and while, under the act, the commission is given plenary powers touching the things committed to it, still, so far as concerns contracts made by the utilities, they are comparatively few in number. In the matter of rates, service and facilities, — and these are the only subjects referred to in the complaints <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>under consideration, — the powers of the commission are limited to the review of actions by operating companies, for only this character of utility company can affect rates, services or facilities by acts “done or about to be done, omitted or about to be omitted......in violation of any of the requirements or provisions of this act,” and they alone furnish service “sufficient for the accommodation and safety of its patrons, employees and the public”: article II, section 1(a). Hence where, as here, under legislative authority, such a corporation has transferred its franchises and assets and has ceased to function, the commission has no jurisdiction over it, since the company has no rates to make or collect, no service to render the public, and no facilities to furnish or extend. This conclusion alone defeats the intervening complaints before the commission, for they are directed against non-functioning corporations only. ' If it be true, as argued by appellants, that there is a residue of powers remaining in the underlying companies, notwithstanding the leases, doubtless the statute, if applicable, will be duly applied when, if ever, they attempt to exercise those powers ; in these complaints nothing is alleged on this subject. So, also, if, despite the fact that the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company is not made a party thereto, the present complaints are to be treated simply as auxiliary to the first proceeding, and as notice to the original railway companies to come in and defend their lease agreements, intervenors are ho better off. Probably this was the purpose of the complaints, since, except in the case of joint rates, those of each utility company must be separately considered, and complaints against two or more cannot be joined together any more than two companies can jointly file a schedule of rates, those of one having no relation to those of the other; and this is true even if one is a customer of the other. No contract made by a utility is subject to a direct attack and revision, unless it is itself a rate contract; and no contract may be indirectly reviewed in such cases, unless it has some re<a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>lation to one or more of the elements to be considered in revising the rate. So far as affects the fair value of the property of the company, these elements are set forth in article V, section 20, of the act (P. L. 1415); and probably nowhere else has the whole matter been more carefully considered or better expressed than in the opinion by our Brother Kephart (when on the bench of the Superior Court), in Ben Avon Borough v. Ohio Valley Water Company, <a href="/pa-super/68/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="68 Pa. Super. 561" data-case-ids="630912" data-case-paths="/pa-super/68/0561-01">68 Pa. Superior Ct. 561</a>. We need not quote therefrom; it suffices that fixed charges for franchises and assets, long since acquired and now entitled to be retained only by continuing the payments provided in the lease thereof, are not among those elements; they do not help to determine the value of existing assets, or the cost of present operation; and, hence, in the instance before us, the rates to the public cannot be increased or diminished by reason of the fact that the rentals called for by the leases were unreasonable when made or are unreasonable now. If this were not so, then the greater the fixed charges the greater would be the fare to be paid by the public, which would be directly in the teeth of the only reason on which such statutes can be sustained.</p>

The company is entitled to receive a reasonable return for the service it furnishes, and no more; the public is entitled to receive an adequate return for the reasonable rates it pays, and no more. Beyond making sure of these two things, the statute does not vest a greater power in the commission, so' far as the matter under consideration is concerned. It has ample authority to see that its orders, as to service and facilities, are fully complied with by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company ; if the effect of so doing is that the latter’s stock<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>holders receive no return on their investment, because of the necessity for compliance with the terms of the leases, this concerns them alone and not complainants or the public. Moreover, if the statute gives to the commission the power to reduce these rentals, it may also increase them, a conclusion which would be a great surprise to everybody, and against which, if decreed, these intervenors would be among the first to complain. As the matter now is, the law gives neither right, and hence the commission should have at once halted this attempt to induce it to exceed its powers.</p>
