Subsequently Morgan sold the machine to Potts, and it finally came into possession of defendant; when acquired by the latter, more than two-thirds of the purchase price remained unpaid. Under the terms of sale and of the mortgage, this failure of payment entitled the typesetting company to reclaim the machine, and, to do so, its receiver, appointed by the United States District Court, began the present proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.5",582,[259,1024,1154,750]]]'>On the trial, the court submitted to the jury, as the issue for their determination, the question whether defendant company, when it purchased the machine, had notice of the unpaid claim of the typesetting company covered by the mortgage. The jury found defendant had notice, and from the verdict and resulting judgment in favor of plaintiff, defendant prosecutes this appeal, assigning many errors, which, in the statement of the questions involved, it resolves into these main inquiries: Can a receiver maintain replevin in his own name to enforce a chattel mortgage given to his principal before his appointment? Was the court correct in refusing evidence to show the discharge of the receiver after suit brought and before trial?</p>

Whether in the exercise of the authority thus given he sued in his own name, as receiver of the corporation given him in charge, in its name to his use, or in some other appropriate form, really matters not. Both he and the corporation were on the record, and a judgment recovered in any such form would protect defendant against a reassertion of the claim sued on. We have repeatedly held that, if a suit is brought either by mistake of law or fact in the name »f the party beneficially interested, instead of by the <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>contracting party to the use of the former, the record may be amended, or treated as amended, in the appellate court, so as to conform to the requirements of the law as to the names of the parties: Trustees of Methodist Episcopal Church v.

Indeed, by analogy to the Practice Act of 1915 (P.
