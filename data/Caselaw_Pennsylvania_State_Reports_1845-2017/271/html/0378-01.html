Does the word “heretofore” refer to jury trials as conducted in England or in Pennsylvania? We find the method of selecting juries and the qualifications of jurors, at the time of the promulgation of this Constitution, September 28, 1776, was regulated in Pennsylvania and in England by legislation and not by the common law, in the latter country by the Act of 3 George II, c. 25; 3 Blackstone 361.</p>

It was also provided “No jury shall exceed the number of seven, nor be under six, unless, in special causes upon life and death, the justice shall think fit to appoint twelve.” By an amendment (Duke of Yorke’s Book of Laws, p. 69) it was provided, “In all cases to be tried by juries at the General Court of Assizes the number of jurors shall be twelve, but at the several Courts of Sessions the same number is sufficient as already in the law is set forth.” “The Frame of Government of the Province of Pennsylvania,” confirmed by the first provincial council May 5, 1682, provided: “Eighth. That all trials shall be by twelve men, and as near as may be peers, or equals, and of the neighborhood, and men without just exception” (Duke of Yorke’s Book of Laws, 1682-1700, page 100). “The Great Law or the Body of Laws” of the Province of Pennsylvania passed at an assembly held in Chester, December <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>7,1682, provided: “Chapter XXXVIII.

This law was abrogated by William and Mary in the year 1693. It was reenacted, however, the same year, June 1, 1693, by chapter 25 of “A Petition of Bight” (Duke of Yorke’s Book of Laws, page 199). From this review of the early statutes, it will be seen that the framers of the Constitution of 1776 knew that legislation determined the qualifications of jurors, not the common law, and, as will be hereafter demonstrated, specifically provided that this method should continue. After the promulgation of our first fundamental law, an act was passed, on March 19,1785 (2 Statutes at Large 486), entitled “An Act for the better regulation of jurors,” which provides (section 2) the sheriff shall summon “sober and judicious <em>persons </em>of good reputation and none other.”</p>

By the Act of March 29, 1805, P. L. 183, chapter LXV, “An Act directing the mode of selecting and returning jurors,” it was enacted, that “in each county of this Commonwealth the sheriff and county commissioners, or any two of said commissioners, with the sheriff, shall meet at the seat of justice at least thirty days previously to the first court of common pleas to be holden in each and every year, and shall then and there select, from the <em>list of taxable citizens, </em>the names of a sufficient number of sober and judicious persons, to serve as jurors at the several courts hereinafter mentioned.” The Act of April 4, 1807, P. L. 124, contained the provisions, “It shall be the duty of the assessors of the several townships and districts within this Commonwealth, and of the assessors of the several wards in the City of Philadelphia, and of each borough, to return the <em>names of all the white male taxable citizens, </em>liable to <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>serve as jurors, of competent ability, understanding, and knowledge of the English language, to the county commissioners of their respective counties; and it shall be the duty of the county commissioners aforesaid, to deposit the names of the persons, so returned to them, in the proper wheels in proportion to the numbers requisite for each.” The Act of February 13,1816, P. L. 52, further regulated the subject; it says, “In each county of this Commonwealth, the sheriff and county commissioners, or any two of the said commissioners with the sheriff, shall meet at the seat of justice at least thirty days previously to the first court of common pleas to be holden in each and every year, and shall, then and there, select from the <em>list of taxable citizens, </em>the names of a sufficient number of sober, intelligent and judicious persons, to serve as jurors at the several courts to be held in each county, respectively, for that year.” An examination of the Act of April 14,1834, P. L. 341, “An Act relative to the organization of the courts of justice,” shows that it regulated the whole subject of selecting jurors; section 85 provides that “The sheriff, and at least two of the commissioners of every county, shall, at least thirty days previously to the first term in every year of the court of common pleas of the respective county, meet, and thereupon proceed with due diligence to select, at the seat of justice thereof, <em>from the taxable citizens of the county, </em>a sufficient number of sober, intelligent and judicious persons, to serve as jurors in the several courts of such county in which juries shall be required to be holden therein during that year.”</p>

The statutory enactment which covers Philadelphia is section 2 of the Act of April 20, 1858, P. L. 354 (2 Purdon 2077, placitum 94); it sets forth: “That prior to the first day of December in each and every year, the receiver of public taxes of the said city shall lodge with the said sheriff, for the use of the said board [of judges], a duly certified list of <em>all taxable inhabitants of the said city, </em>setting out their names, places of residence and occupation ; and, prior to the tenth day of December in each and every year, it shall be the duty of the said board, or a quorum thereof, to assemble together and select from the said list of taxables a sufficient number of sober, healthy and discrete citizens, to constitute the several panels of jurors, grand and petit, that may be required for service in the several courts for the next ensuing year, in due proportion from the several wards of the said city and the principal avocations.”</p>

The court said (L. R.

At common law, jurors were required to be freeholders and the qualification continued by statute from the time of Henry Y down to that of George II: 20 Amer. Law Register 437. The statute of the 2d Henry V, c. 3, requires jurors that pass upon a man’s life to have forty shillings per annum freehold. At the time of the adop<a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>tion of Pennsylvania’s first Constitution in 1776, there was a property qualification in England for all jurors: 3 Blackstone 362.</p>
    <p id="b421-3" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[160,489,1154,1514]]]'>Just what was the common law right of trial by jury is somewhat difficult to determine and define. Certain it is that in England it was not, in 1776 when our first Constitution was adopted, the same as it had been in earlier times: Proffat on Jury Trials; Forsyth, Trial by Jury; History of the Jury System by Lesser. Magna Charta (1215 A. D.) provided, that no man should be deprived of life, liberty or property unless “by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.” While this has been popularly accepted as a guaranty of trial by jury, yet, such trials, in their present form, did not come into existence until some time later; and the phrase, — “lawful judgment of his peers and the law of the land,” — when used, meant nothing more than a guaranty of the right to trial according to one of the then existing modes, — by recognition, compurgation, combat, ordeal, witnesses and other forms then in vogue (Bigelow, Hist, of Proced. 155, n.; Taylor, Due Proc. of Law, sec. 4). In the words of Mr. Justice Williams in Smith v. Times Pub. Co., <a href="/pa/178/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="178 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="885541" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0481-01">178 Pa. 481</a>, 506, “It simply protected Englishmen from the power of secret, irresponsible tribunals and conceded the jurisdiction of the legally established courts over all causes.” The modes of procedure gradually changed, through the centuries which elapsed from the granting of King John’s charter to the founding of the early English colonies in America; at the latter time trial by jury, substantially as we know it, had replaced the other forms.</p>

California, <a href="/us/110/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="110 U.S. 516" data-case-ids="3503887" data-case-paths="/us/110/0516-01">110 U. S. 516</a>, where, after referring to the various ancient modes of trial, it is said (page 530): “When we add to this that the primitive grand jury heard no witnesses in support of the truth of the charge to be preferred, but presented upon their own knowledge, <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>or indicted upon common fame and general suspicion, we shall he ready to acknowledge that it is better not to go too far back into antiquity for the best securities for our ‘ancient liberties.’ It is more consonant to the true philosophy of our historical legal institutions to say that the spirit of personal liberty and individual right, which they embodied, was preserved and developed by a progressive growth and wise adaptation to new circumstances and situations of the forms and processes found fit to give, from time to time, new expression and greater effect to modern ideas of self-government.” The same idea finds expression in Twining v. New Jersey, <a href="/us/211/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="211 U.S. 78" data-case-ids="11926611" data-case-paths="/us/211/0078-01">211 U. S. 78</a>, 101, where it was said by Mr. Justice Moody: “It does not follow, however, that a procedure settled in the English law at the time of the emigration, and brought to this country and practiced by our ancestors, is an essential element of due process of law; if that was so, the procedure of the first half of the 17th century would be fastened upon the American jurisprudence like a straight jacket, only to be unloosed by constitutional amendment.”</p>

As it first appeared it was “trials” not “trial” by jury shall be as heretofore and the section went on to say, “and it is recommended to the legislature of this State to provide by law against every corruption or partiality in the choice, return or appointment of juries.” This first constitutional enactment on the subject indicates that what was to remain as theretofore was the “trials” of certain kinds of cases and the method of trial; they were to be by jury as theretofore, not by a judge alone, or by some other tribunal, and the trial itself was to be carried on as such trials had customarily been conducted; and, so far as the qualifications of the jurors were concerned, as the <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>latter clause of the section shows, they were to be, as they had been, matters for legislative regulation.</p>

It is evident, however, that what was being guaranteed by these three subsequent instruments was the same thing spoken of in the Constitution of 1776, the right to a jury trial of certain kinds of cases and the method of trial, and not a rigid fixing of the mode of selecting jurors or their qualifications by past standards. If the qualifications of jurors can be fixed only by the Constitution, it is inconceivable that the right of the legislature, to determine what they shall be, has not been challenged from the foundation of our preS ent state government until now.</p>

This was known to the framers of the first and all succeeding Constitutions, in the first being specifically recognized, and, in guaranteeing the right of trial by jury, it and all the others did not in any way limit the legislature from determining from time to time how juries should be composed.</p>

If the Act of 1867 is prospective in operation, and takes in new classes of electors as they come to the voting privilege from time to time, then necessarily women being electors are eligible to jury service. That the Act of 1867 does cover those who at any time shall come within the designation of electors there can be no question. “Statutes framed in general terms apply to new cases that arise, and to new subjects that are created from time to time, and which come within their general scope and policy. It is a rule of statutory construction that legislative enactments in general and comprehensive terms, prospective in operation, apply alike to all persons, subjects and business within their general purview and scope coming into existence subsequent to their passage”: 25 Ruling Case Law 778. <em>\</em>
