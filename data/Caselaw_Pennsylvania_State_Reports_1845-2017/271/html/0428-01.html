A. Passavant, some time prior to 1849.

In the face of these charter provisions, it is idle to contend that defendant corporation is not a denominational or sectarian institution; but it appears that, in 1919, while the appropriation bill in controversy was in course of passage, defendant by duly formulated resolutions, created “a local board......with [alleged] legal power to conduct the Passavant Hospital,” and it now contends that this board is a purely nonsectarian body, which may collect and expend the appropriation from the State.</p>

The charter also provides that in certain contingencies, “The Bishop for the time being of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Pennsylvania in which Philadélphia is situated,” shall designate the manner of electing directors of the hospital. Since the date of the appropriation now under attack and the filing of the bill in this case, the name of defendant has been changed to the “Memorial Hospital of Roxborough, Philadelphia,” and other efforts appear to have been made to separate the institution from the control of St. Timothy’s church; but, of course, the facts must be treated as they were at the time the act under attack was approved.
