The latter, however, is set out in the affidavit of defense. At the trial, the note was received in evidence over defendant’s objection that it was competent only in connection with the agreement of which it formed a part. Plaintiff rested without offering the agreement and defendant submitted no evidence, but asked for binding instructions on the ground that plaintiff had failed to aver or prove the <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>contract of which the note was a part. The trial judge directed a verdict for plaintiff, and this appeal is from judgment entered thereon.</p>
    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[161,487,1157,1463]]]'>Defendant’s contention cannot be sustained. The note.provides for two things, (a) payment of the amount as stipulated, and (b) collateral security therefor. The latter, as the note recites, is “under and subject to the terms and conditions of a certain agreement, bearing even date herewith of which this obligation is a part.” As the collateral is pledged expressly subject to the agreement and the note as an obligation to pay is not, we must assume the agreement refers to the former, and were this a proceeding to realize on the collateral, the agreement might be a necessary element of plaintiff’s case, but it is not here. This is an action on a note which the holder can maintain without realizing, or attempting to realize, upon his collateral: Jones on Collateral Securities (3d ed.), sections 685, 686; Colebrook on Collateral Securities (2d ed.), section 153; and see City Bank of York v. Rieker, <a href="/pa/262/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="262 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="1044502" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0028-01">262 Pa. 28</a>; O’Neill v.

As this suit is expressly based upon the note, it was not necessary for plaintiff to allege or prove the agreement as to the collateral. If that contained any provision amounting to a discharge or payment of the note, the burden was upon defendant to show it. That is, in an action on a note with collateral it is not necessary for plaintiff to plead or prove the latter, or any contract relating thereto; for the burden is upon a defendant to show that the collateral is so held as to prevent a recovery upon the note.</p>

A bond and mortgage may stand for the same debt, yet suit can be maintained upon either without pleading or proving the other. Under the statute (Practice Act May 14, 1915, P. L. 483) it is necessary for the pleader to attach to his pleading copies of all notes, contracts, etc., upon which <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>he relies for his claim or defense; but it is not necessary to attach copies of other papers merely referred to but not essential to his cause of action (Peoples Street Ry.

    <p id="b182-5" data-blocks='[["BL_182.5",182,[256,642,1152,315]]]'>Moreover, while defendant objected to the note as evidence, he did not move to strike it out nor assign as error the ruling of the trial court for its admission. We must, therefore, consider the note properly in evidence (Buehler v. United States Fashion Plate Co., <a href="/pa/269/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="269 Pa. 428" data-case-ids="1063486" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0428-01">269 Pa. 428</a>), and, so doing, it makes a prima facie case.</p>
