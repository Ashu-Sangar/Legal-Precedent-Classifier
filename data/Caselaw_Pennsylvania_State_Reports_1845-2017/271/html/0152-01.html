With a view of engaging in that business one Samuel Greenwald and the defendant, Albert Orringer, on March 22d, submitted an offer of $25,000 for the property, on which they made a deposit of $5,000, with the cashier of the First National Bank of Donora, each advancing one-half thereof. The offer was rejected and the property exposed to public sale on the 15th of the following April, when it was sold to Greenwald and Orringer, in the name of the former, for $31,300. The sale was confirmed on the 28th of the same month and two days later a joint deed for the property was executed and delivered to Samuel Greenwald and Albert Orringer, who caused the same to be recorded and each paid one-half of the purchase money, in cash and by a bond and mortgage, the $5,000 deposit being applied thereon. During the spring, there was talk about forming a partnership or corporation in which others were to become interested, and, on the day the sale was confirmed (April 28, 1919), an application was filed for a charter of a corporation to be called the Modern Baking Company, in which Greenwald and Orringer were to be the principal stockholders. The charter was granted June 3d, and since the 15th of that month the corporation has been in possession of and operating the plant. The first formal corporate meeting was held on July 8, 1919, at which Greenwald was elected president and Orringer treasurer and Samuel Klein, another stockholder, secretary. As originally planned the corporate stock was to be equally divided between Greenwald and his friends and Orringer and his friends, but as issued the former hold a majority. The business was apparently prosperous, but in the fall of that year serious differences arose between the factions, resulting in litigation and in the removal of Orringer as treasurer. Thereupon a judgment for $24,000 was entered against <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>Orringer, on a note in favor of Ms brother Joseph, on which execution was issued and Albert Orringer’s one-half undivided interest in the bakery property was seized and sold by thé sheriff and Joseph became the purchaser. Meantime the corporation filed this bill averring that Greenwald and Albert Orringer held title to the real estate in trust for it, also that Greenwald had offered to convey his undivided interest to the corporation and praying for a decree ordering Albert to do the same, and adjudging that Joseph’s judgment was not a lien upon the bakery property. Defendants filed responsive answers, Albert claiming one-half of the real estate in question as his own and denying that he held the same in trust for the corporation. A replication was filed and the case went to trial, at which the evidence was conflicting; that for the corporation, represented by the Greenwald party, tended to show that, before the property was purchased at the trustee’s sale, it was understood and agreed by all parties concerned that the property was being bought for and on behalf of the new corporation; and, because its charter had not been granted, the title should be and was taken temporarily in the names of Greenwald and Orringer; and further that the consideration money •they advanced was to be and was repaid to them by stock of the corporation. All of this evidence was contradicted by that for the defense.</p>

S. B., in the sum of $21,003, is for a bona fide indebtedness owing from the latter to the former.” There are some other findings more <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>favorable to plaintiff, but none that nullifies those above quoted. The corporation seems to have treated the property as its own and the evidence tends to show it repaid Greenwald and Orringer, in the stock they received, for the purchase money so expended by them. The court below held, however, that as the only relief sought was based upon the ground of a resulting or constructive trust, a decree for plaintiff could not be made on the finding of a parol purchase by it from Greenwald and Orringer, followed by payment of consideration, possession, etc., even if the facts warranted such decree. The court therefore entered a decree dismissing the bill without prejudice, and therefrom plaintiff brought this appeal.</p>
