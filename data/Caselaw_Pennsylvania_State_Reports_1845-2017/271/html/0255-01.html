It is admitted a deed, absolute on its face, without reservation or restriction, was executed, acknowledged and recorded in Centre County eighteen years ago. Plaintiffs’ decedent was grantee therein, while defendants claimed through the will of grantor. Delivery is a matter of intention to pass title. It may be accomplished by words alone, by acts or by words and acts. To be sufficient in law it must be found grantor has parted with the title: Smith v.

In discussing a proposed gift to that institution, as the men were advanced in years, he suggested the advisability of taking steps looking toward the ultimate disposition of the farm on their death. He was informed it was their wish to give the property to a niece, Mrs. Lewis. A deed was suggested as the proper plan to carry out their wish, subject to their right to use and occupy the land in any way they saw fit until their death. This plan was agreed upon and the matter was left in Wilt’s hands for attention, and, because of the gift to the institution, all charges were to be at his expense. The deed was prepared, executed, acknowledged and witnessed, wherein Mrs. Lewis was named as grantee. It was turned over to Mr. Wilt, who informed Mrs. Lewis of the proposed <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>plan. She readily consented to the execution of an agreement Mr. Wilt considered necessary as a “safeguard,” “sort of a protection so she could not interfere with them during her lifetime, notwithstanding the fact that the deed was made.” And the agreement was “to cover any possibilities that might arise afterwards because the deed was on record.” When the deed was delivered to Mr. Wilt, it was without restriction or limitation, save only the obligation to secure to the Crains the full enjoyment of the property during life. It must be a necessary inference, from this evidence, the*deed could.be delivered, when this duty was met, and here it differs from Sears v. Scranton Trust Co., <a href="/pa/228/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="228 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="969823" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0126-01">supra.</a> After the deed was executed and placed of record, ■ the grantors informed the assessor, — who made assessments for the purpose of taxation, — they had nothing to assess, as Mrs. Lewis owned the land.</p>

When the latter was secured there was an admission that the grantee had a then present interest in the land. No effort was made to conceal the fact of recording, which could have been discovered at any time, and, so far as we are advised by the record, the grantors never questioned it nor the deed, the latter never having been returned to their possession. It is true Mr. Wilt, in the course of his testimony, makes use of such language as “after their demise, or their death,” “the deed was not to go into effect until after the death of the Crains,” and “the deed was SO' made as not to convey it over to them during their lifetime.” This latter statement of course is in direct conflict with the deed, and all of them, considered with his entire testimony and the acts done, are not sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery. His story, throughout, evidences an intention on' the part of the grantors to execute and deliver the deed, provided possession and use of the property was secured to them during life. His statements, at best, <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>show a confusion of ideas, if they are not in entire harmony with what transpired when he secured to the Crains the property during the remainder of their lives. To reform a deed absolute on its face, — attended with all the formalities of law, duly recorded, handed to a third party without restriction or reservation, save as to the one purpose mentioned, — and hold it a testamentary instrument, requires evidence more certain than the loose statements here submitted. The reservation of rents, use and occupation would not be sufficient (Knowlson v. Fleming, <a href="/pa/165/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="165 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="862079" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0010-01">165 Pa. 10</a>; Eckman v. Eckman, supra), and the intention must be established by proof of acts of the grantor. The strongest evidence of delivery was the fact of recording, and the burden of overcoming the presumption resulting therefrom was c&gt;n defendants, who, to destroy it, must do so by clear, positive proof that no delivery was intended, and that Mr. Wilt was not authorized to record the instrument. The evidence before us certainly did not meet that burden.</p>
