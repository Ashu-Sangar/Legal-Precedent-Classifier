In 1894, Martin L. Shaver, the owner of 144 acres of land in Somerset County, conveyed the coal in 55 acres thereof to C. U. Hileman et al., with full and complete right to enter upon and occupy so much of the surface as necessary for the successful mining and removal of the coal, and providing certain compensation to Shaver for land occupied or injured by such mining. In 1912, Shaver sold the surface of the entire 144 acres and 4 acres of the coal to William Friedline, the present plaintiff. The deed erefor stipulates “and it is further understood and reed, that the operation of coal sold to C. U. Hileman al., by deed.......shall be subject in all things to the <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>conditions sét forth in said deed.” Thereafter, in 1917, Shaver conveyed the balancé of the coal, amounting to 85 acres, to the defendants herein with the proviso, “It is further understood that no fights for mining shall extend beyond the rights reserved in the deed from M. L. Shaver to William Friedline for the surface of the above described tract of land.” Just prior to this purchase, defendants bought from plaintiff five acres of the surface, apparently as part of the same transaction and to be nsed in connection with their coal-mining operations, but upon investigation concluded their mining plant should be located on plaintiff’s surface some four hundred feet from the five acres, and they sought to buy from plaintiff an additional acre of surface for that purpose, but failed to agree as to the price. Thereafter defendants, against plaintiff’s ‘repeated protests, took possession of the acre, cut timber, sunk a shaft thereon, etc., in preparation for coal mining, when they were restrained by an injunction granted in this suit.</p>
    <p id="b567-3" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[173,1388,1155,368]]]'>The case was heard upon bill, answer, replication and testimony; from which the chancellor made comprehensive findings of the facts, including, inter alia, the following: “From the testimony taken, we find as a fact that, while it will be more expensive and less convenient for the defendants to mine their coal from this five-acre tract, it is practical and commercially feasible so to do.</p>

    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[253,566,1152,1178]]]'>A careful examination of the entire record discloses no reversible error. The mining rights granted to Hileman referred only to the fifty-five acres of coal conveyed to him; and, while the deed from Shaver to Friedline embraces the surface above that coal and also above the eighty-five acres of coal subsequently sold to defendants, the reference to the mining rights therein is expressly confined to “the operation of coal sold to C. U. Hileman et al., by deed” and “subject in all things to the condition set forth in said deed.” When Shaver sold the surface he did so of course subject to the mining rights he had previously granted therein to Hileman. The latter was not interested in the eighty-five acres of coal and the reference to his deed in the conveyance to plaintiff cannot be construed as extending thereto: Titus v. Poland Coal Co., <a href="/pa/263/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="263 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1047491" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0024-01">263 Pa. 24</a>; Webber v.

Such conveyance makes no mention of any surface mining privileges as appurtenant to the eighty-five acres of coal reserved by Shaver, who thenceforth owned the same with such right of access thereto as the law would imply, and that was all he could, or attempted to, sell defendants.</p>

Here, when defendants bought the coal, they owned five acres of plaintiff’s surface, which the chancellor finds was a means of access to the coal; he also finds, in effect, that while it is not the most convenient avenue of approach to the coal the latter can thereby be mined at a profit and that it is commercially feasible to do so. Such findings were based upon competent and sufficient evidence, were approved by the court below, and cannot be disturbed on appeal: Shimer v.
