    <p id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[280,980,1155,577]]]'>Under section 9 of the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. (1832-3) 249, which lays down the statutory rule that words of inheritance in a devise are not essential to pass a fee, it is plain that the first part of the above devise, standing alone, gives Alice L. Edwards an absolute estate in all of her husband’s property; but, unless we gather from the whole provision that such was testator’s dominant purpose, she does not take a fee simple title to real estate: Pattin v.

This, by itself, would show that he did not intend to give the widow an absolute fee simple estate, for, since others are to take the “residue,” the original devisee could not make a valid devise of what might be left after using so much of the property as she needed (Allen v. Hirlinger, <a href="/pa/219/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="219 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1002703" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0056-01">219 Pa. 56</a>, 60); but, considering the first part of the provision before us, which, standing alone, gives the wife her husband’s whole estate, the latter part, disposing of the residue left at her death, certainly shows an intention to grant her power to consume all or any part of the property devised,- — -“real, personal and mixed” (Hege v.
