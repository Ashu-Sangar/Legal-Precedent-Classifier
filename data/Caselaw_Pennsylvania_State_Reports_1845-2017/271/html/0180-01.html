Upon the return trip, when the accident happened, the only occupants were the sister and the brother, who was driving. The car was stopped at the usual and customary point of observation, from which a view of the railroad could be had for more than 500 feet in the one direction, and a considerable distance in the other. No train was seen to the east, but, from the west, a freight was slowly moving. Apparently, there was ample time to cross in front of it. The car was then started, and passed in safety to the second track. It had nearly cleared this, when a. train, coming from the east, struck the rear, causing the death of the driver and his sister. This suit was brought, to recover damages for the loss of both, — a proper joinder of action: Penna. R. R. Co. v.

The learned court below was, however, of the opinion that the instruction complained of became unimportant in view of its finding that the brother was guilty of contributory negligence, which, under the facts disclosed, was declared as a matter of law. This being so, it is argued his fault is to be imputed to the plaintiffs, who had committed the daughter to his care, and who, at the time of the accident, was in his charge. It is not necessary to consider the applicability of this latter position to the present case, since we are of opinion the facts do not show such conduct on the part of Lawrence as to justify a declaration of contributory negligence as a matter of law.</p>

This view would appear to rest in part on the supposed obstruction of sight by the car standing upon the siding; but, its presence or location was a matter of dispute, which could not be determined as a matter of law. Though it is incumbent upon the driver to stop at a proper place, and, even when he has done so, to continue to be vigilant as he proceeds, yet, where he has made due observation at the usual point, from which a view of the tracks may be had, it is usually for the jury to say whether he was under the duty to again halt before entering upon the crossing: Shaffer v.
