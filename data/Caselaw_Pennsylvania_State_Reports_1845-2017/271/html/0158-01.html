When this principle is applied to the case now before us, it is plain that, as <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>to James E. Shock, Jr., the minor child born after the making of his father’s will, the will of the latter was annulled, and, with respect to such after-born child, the father died intestate.</p>

In holding that the will was annulled as to this child, we said: “The will is set aside wholly or partially because the law presumes that it does not express the final intention of the testator [testatrix], and this reason of the law takes no notice of whether the power to make the will comes from public law or from private contract.” If we strike from the matter just quoted the phrase “private contract,” and substitute therefor the words “a privately conferred power of appointment” (which, on principle, may be done), we have a ruling that the birth of a child, after the date of a will, which otherwise would operate as the exercise of a power of appointment, annuls such operation: see also McClure’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=173%20N.Y.S.%20206" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="173 N.Y.S. 206">173 N.

It is there said (pp. 119-20) : “We must declare this a case of intestacy, so far as relates to the appellant, a son of the testatrix born after the making of her will; then, looking back at the articles of nuptial settlement, we find they provide that, in case of intestacy, the trustees shall hold the property for her legal heirs......; it follows therefore, and from the fact that she had but one other child, that she is intestate of one-half of her estate, and that that one-half goes ......for the use of the appellant [the minor child].” Had the after-born child in Young’s Appeal been given the-whole estate over which the power existed, no doubt the pro tanto intestacy as to the child would have been held, in effect, to extend to the entire estate, as in the present case.</p>

Shoch, Jr., is concerned, since the latter is the only child surviving hife father, it follows that this grandchild takes the entire fund, under the terms of his grandfather’s will.</p>

L. 430. This statute, in terms, confines its operation to the individual estate of the testator, and we said that the taking against the will is not viewed in law as necessarily rendering the decedent intestate; whereas, as previously shown, Shes-tack’s Estate, supra, decides that the marriage of a testator (or the birth to him of a child), after the making of his will, creates, as to the surviving spouse (or after-born child) an actual intestacy. This is the distinction which must be kept in mind, when considering Huddy’s Estate in connection with the present case.</p>

Shoch did not intend to exercise the power as far as concerns the after-born child, James E. Shoch, Jr. Therefore, the power has never been exercised, for the Act of 1879 has not changed the last-mentioned statutory doctrine in the least; consequently, the appellee takes under the will of his grandfather.</p>
