It developed a considerable trade in the articles which it produced, and its wares had become known in many institutions through its catalogues, and the actual users of its designs. In its employ, until 1918, were the individual defendants named in this proceeding, who, subsequently, formed the corporation complained of, which established a business of like character, appealing to the same class of customers. The Elliott Company complained of the manner in which the new corporation conducted its dealings, and filed the bill, which is the basis of the present proceeding, to restrain alleged unfair competition. After hearing, a permanent injunction was granted.</p>
    <p id="b221-3" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[171,1038,1153,1072]]]'>The learned chancellor has found, upon sufficient evidence, that certain employees of plaintiff took advantage of their position to secure copies of the designs and dies in use by it, and likewise obtained, surreptitiously, lists of the Elliott Company’s customers for goods of the character manufactured. With this information, they formed the Skillkrafters Corporation, and began business in competition with their former employer. A catalogue was prepared and issued, giving illustrations of the work it was prepared to offer. The wording used therein would lead the public to infer that like pins and rings had previously been made and placed upon the market by it, which was' not the fact. Eleven of the thirty-seven pictures were, in effect, identical with the designs used and sold by the Elliott Company, with the distinctive marking and lettering, and nineteen others substantially the same. A large number of these circulars were forwarded to the schools and colleges with which the plaintiff had been doing business, as well as to its other known customers.</p>

As a general proposition this is true (Putnam Nail Co. v.

The goodwill of a manufaicturer is not to be destroyed through needless simulation by others if the exercise of reasonable precaution to protect ■it will impose no substantial restriction on the right of another to make and sell. “When a person not only copies the general design, but also copies or imitates the peculiar features, marks or devices, tending to produce confusion in the minds of intending purchasers and to mislead them into purchasing his goods in place of those of the original maker, unfair competition results which may be restrained,” 26 E. C. L. 880. The authorities thus holding in this state have been so satisfactorily collated in Pennsylvania Cent. Brewing Co. v. Anthracite Beer Co., <a href="/pa/258/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="258 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="1035131" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0045-01">258 Pa. 45</a>, that repetition here is unnecessary.
