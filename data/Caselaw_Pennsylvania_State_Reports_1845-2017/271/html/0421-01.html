The chancellor, after hearing, granted the relief prayed for, and defendants have appealed.</p>

In addition to the land, which was described by metes and bounds, the deed contains this further grant: “Together with all water rights in said Octoraro Creek belonging or appertaining to the <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>premises above described, and also all and singular the mineral, mining, water and other rights and privileges in said Octoraro Creek and in and upon the lands situate in both Chester and Lancaster Counties, Pennsylvania, and in Maryland, lying in, along said Octoraro Creek, of whatsoever nature and by whomsoever granted, reserved, acquired and owned by the said Isaac Tyson, Jr., during his lifetime, the Tyson Mining Company, and the said executors and trustees or the survivor of them.”</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[274,793,1150,1280]]]'>If by the foregoing, plaintiff acquired all the mining rights and privileges in and upon the lands situate in both Chester and Lancaster Counties, and in addition, such rights in Maryland, “lying in, along said Octoraro Creek,” as the grantor was competent to convey, then plaintiff is entitled to the relief it seeks; while on the other hand, if the expression, “lying in, along said Octoraro Creek,” qualifies not only the word “Maryland” but also the words “the lands situate in both Chester and Lancaster Counties,” plaintiff fails to make out its case. In other words, if the mining rights conveyed both in Chester and Lancaster Counties, and in Maryland, were those lying in and along Octoraro Creek, plaintiff can assert no rights against defendants, who do not claim anything in and along Octoraro Creek, but do claim mining rights, under their grants in lands in Lancaster County not along Octoraro Creek; whereas if, by the paragraph quoted, all the mineral rights of the grantor, in Chester and Lancaster Counties, were conveyed to plaintiff, then defendants took nothing by the conveyance which they produce, and their deeds, purporting to convey that which had already been assured to plaintiff, are a cloud on its title, which it has the right to have removed.</p>

Garrison, on February 25, 1918, conveyed the mining rights thus acquired to the Chrome Mining Company, the real appellant. On June 28,1918, Columbus O’Donnell Lee, Jacob Lindley and Richard H. Pleasants, receivers of the Tyson Mining Company, executed a quitclaim deed to the Chrome Mining Company, for any interest that the Tyson Mining Company may have in the mining rights conveyed to the former.

In the first place, the trustees of the Isaac Tyson, Jr., estate, had.been discharged by the court after the conveyance to plaintiff upon their allegation that they had disposed of all the property belonging to the estate; so a new trustee had to be raised to make the conveyance to Garrison. It was set forth in the petition for the new trustee, that the estate made no claim to any mining rights, but that Garrison offered to pay to the estate one hundred dollars for a grant of its interest in them in Lancaster County, “notwithstanding the fact that he has been advised that all such interests have been disposed,of and that said estate makes no claim thereto.” The petitioner asked only for an order to sell “such uncertain mining rights and claims” as the estate might possess; and, in his deed, for the consideration named, the substituted trustee conveyed only the mining rights and privileges “which still remain a part of the property of the said Isaac Tyson, Jr.” The pur<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>chaser necessarily knew that what he was acquiring was enveloped in doubt, and must have realized he was buying a lawsuit.</p>

If however there were doubt on the question after reading the deed, a study of the writings, which were preliminary to and led up to the deed, will resolve all doubts in plaintiff’s favor.</p>

When we look at the deed, these three things are conveyed: the tract of land, the mining rights upon lands situate in Chester and Lancaster Counties and the mineral rights in other lands abutting on Octoraro Creek, which were those in Maryland. In the petition of the trustee to the Circuit Court of Baltimore for authority to make the sale, he set forth, that he had received an offer from plaintiff’s representative for the land “provided that, at the same time, all the mineral rights and water rights owned by your petitioner in lands located in either Chester or Lancaster Counties in said State are conveyed to said H. F. Huy free of cost,” and in the decree of sale, the court ordered the trustee to convey the land, “together with all the mineral rights and water rights belonging to said petitioner in either Chester or Lancaster Counties.” There can be no question, in the light shed <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>on the deed by these papers, that the instrument conveys what plaintiff contends it does.</p>

The rule is that relief will be granted in equity when the complainant shows a perfect title, legal or equitable, and the title of the defendant is shown to be invalid”: 5 Ruling Case Law 657. “The jurisdiction of a court of equity to remove clouds from title is an independent source or head of jurisdiction, and whenever a deed or other instrument exists which may be vexatiously or injuriously used against a party, after the evidence to impeach or invalidate it is lost, or which may throw a cloud or suspicion over his title or interest......a court of equity will afford relief by directing the instrument to be delivered up and cancelled”: Heppenstall v.
