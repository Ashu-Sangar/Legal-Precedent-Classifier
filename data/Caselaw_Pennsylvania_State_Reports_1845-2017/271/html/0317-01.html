He engaged the plaintiff as sales manager, and.a dispute as to'the terms of the employment led to this litigation. Beaver claimed a promise of compensation by the payment to him of a monthly salary, and a one-third interest in the business, to be transferred upon the reimbursement of Slane for certain advances and other charges, which sums have now been returned. The defendant denied the existence of such an understanding, whereupon this bill was filed asking for specific performance of the alleged contract, as well as for the appointment of a receiver and an accounting. After the overruling of a demurrer, — which did not raise the question of the adequacy of the legal remedy of the complainant, — an answer was filed. Subsequently, a hearing was had, and findings of fact and law made. It was concluded therein that no agreement, which could be specifically enforced, had been established by the evidence, that the bill should, therefore, be dismissed, and the parties left to their redress at law. The plaintiff <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>
      <em>then </em>sought to withdraw his complaint, which was refused; while the defendant insisted that it be proceeded with to final judgment, as no objection to the jurisdiction had been made, a course which was ultimately-adopted by the court below. Later, a decree was entered, dismissing the bill on the merits.</p>

A litigant has no absolute right to discontinue an action, without the sanction of the court, either on common law principles or by force of any statute (Lamb v. Greenhouse, <a href="/pa-super/59/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="59 Pa. Super. 329" data-case-ids="449002" data-case-paths="/pa-super/59/0329-01">59 Pa.

Unless the defendant proceeds by demurrer or answer, as directed, he cannot take advantage of the fact that the action should have been brought at law; there is even more reason to hold the plaintiff: has waived any complaint on this ground when he voluntarily chose the tribunal in which to be heard. If the question is not preliminarily raised, the court is expressly directed to proceed to a final determination of the cause. Clearly, the defendant could not wait until the findings were <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>made before challenging the jurisdiction of the court, nor should the other party be permitted to withdraw for this reason, when the rulings are adverse to his contention.
