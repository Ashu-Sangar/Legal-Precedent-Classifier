Carson, <a href="/pa/244/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="244 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="1003525" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0006-01">244 Pa. 6</a>, the claim was for labor, covering a considerable period, in building stairs for a house, no indication being given as to whether it was performed “in preparation of materials used in the house, at the shop of plaintiff, or in incorporating them into the building by carpenters, cabinetmakers, assistants or laborers”; or where a lump sum is charged for some general, class of materials, made up of many different items, as “lumber furnished,” not stating the kinds supplied, without which the owner would have no fair opportunity for investigation (Benton v.

This objection is untenable, in view of the express declaration that the contract of May 19,1917, was fully performed on August 18, 1917. The same exceptions are urged against the lien filed, — which does contain the contract and describe in detail the various classes of excavation work, — as to the notice of intention, but they cannot be sustained. Nor was there error in the refusal of the court below to strike off preliminarily the entire lien, since some items appearing therein were valid: McCristal v. Cochran, <a href="/pa/147/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="147 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="829880" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0225-01">147 Pa. 225</a>; Dyer v.

    <p id="b362-4" data-blocks='[["BL_362.5",362,[263,1029,1150,530]]]'>The fourteenth error assigned is directed to the swearing of the jury as to both owner and contractor, the latter not being properly in court by service or appearance. He was necessarily, under the act of assembly, named in the proceeding as a party defendant. Though the action complained of may be deemed irregular (Sullivan v. Johns, <a href="/whart/5/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="5 Whart. 366" data-case-ids="8878167" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0366-01">5 Whart. 366</a>), we cannot see how the present appellant was injured; if any one can complain of such action, it is the contractor, and he is not objecting here: Hills v.

The document could not be received as proof of the contents (Hills v. Elliott, supra), for the paper is merely a statement of the claim made: Bernheisel v. Smothers, <a href="/pa-super/5/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="5 Pa. Super. 113" data-case-ids="280037" data-case-paths="/pa-super/5/0113-01">5 Pa. Superior Ct. 113</a>. An examination of the record, however, indicates that the offer was merely as a part of the history of the case, and was followed by reading the portions thereof which the affidavit of defense conceded to be true. As to the other statements, evidence was offered to show their correctness. Further, it is to be observed that, though a general objection to the admission of the evidence in question was made, this was coupled with a specification of the reasons for not receiving it, based on the claim of the insufficiency of the lien, and of the intention to file the <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>same, heretofore considered. To the special complaint made at the trial, the defendant should now be confined (Danley v. Danley, <a href="/pa/179/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="179 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="886969" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0170-01">179 Pa. 170</a>), in view of the fact that it clearly appears the lien’s use as evidence was limited to the parts admitted by defendant’s pleadings.</p>
    <p id="b363-3" data-blocks='[["BL_363.5",363,[150,612,1153,860]]]'>One other matter requires consideration. After the filing of the mechanic’s lien in the Luzerne courts against the owner and contractor, the latter brought suit in Philadelphia County against the' subcontractor, claiming an over-payment to him. Ott defended on the ground that the contrary was true, and to establish his defense necessarily showed the amount of work done by him, and that a balance was due on account thereof. He set up no counterclaim, and asked no certificate in his favor. The verdict was generally for defendant. It is insisted Ott’s duty was to assert his claim at that time, and, not having done so, he is now debarred -from proceeding with the enforcement of his mechanic’s lien, since the owner of the land is entitled to the benefit of any defense which the contractor might have; and, as to him, it is argued, the plaintiff’s claim is res adjudicata.</p>
    <p id="b363-4" data-blocks='[["BL_363.6",363,[148,1485,1153,808]]]'>It is undoubtedly true that what has once been judicially determined shall hot again be the subject of litigation, and that this principle extends to every question in the proceeding which was legally cognizable (McGunnegle v. R.

He proved that nothing was owing by him at the trial, but did not set up his counterclaim. He was not bound to do so: Gilmore v. Reed, <a href="/pa/76/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="76 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1038853" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0462-01">76 Pa. 462</a>. “The mere pendency of a suit upon a claim, will not prevent the same claim from being used as a set-off in another action; or vice versa, the introduction of a claim as a set-off in one action, will not create a bar to a suit in another court, in a direct action upon the same claim”: National Metal Edge Box Co. v.
