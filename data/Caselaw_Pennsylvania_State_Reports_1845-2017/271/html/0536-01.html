    <p id="b571-3" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[182,440,1152,649]]]'>The dealings between the parties, which plaintiff claims gave rise to the contract in suit, consist of three letters; the first, from defendant, asks plaintiff to quote a price on certain goods, with terms of purchase and shipment; the next, a reply, states price and terms; and the last, an acknowledgment, indicates a desire on defendant’s part to take the goods, but states somewhat different terms. To this last letter plaintiff made no answer; but, later, shipped the goods to Somerset, Pennsylvania, consigned to its own order. The shipment was refused by defendant, and the action now before us, for breach of contract, followed.</p>

The defendant’s last letter differed from plaintiff’s offer in three distinct particulars: (a) A consignee was named to whom the goods were to be shipped; (b) a different place of delivery from that made by plaintiff; (c) a limit of time when the goods should be shipped. How then can it be successfully contended that this made a complete contract, without an acceptance of these terms by the plaintiff. The transaction was not completed; the letter of defendant required another communication from the plaintiff assenting to the terms of defendant. The plaintiff never agreed to ship to defendant consignee, at Holsopple [the place named in the last letter], the goods ordered. Suppose the defendant had brought an action for damages to compel plaintiff to perform its contract, the answer would be: We nevef agreed to ship goods to U. S. Houck, consignee, at Holsopple, Pa., which would be true, and would defeat the action. The contract was left un<a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>finished; it was the duty of plaintiff to accept the counter proposal of defendant.”</p>
