    <p id="b46-4" data-blocks='[["BL_46.5",46,[263,443,1151,580]]]'>The Pennsylvania Act of May 18,1887, P. L. 108, called the Brooks Law, is entitled “Ah Act to restrain and regulate the sale of vinous and spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, or any admixtures thereof.” Any liquor containing distilled alcohol is spirituous; all having alcohol as a result of fermentation are vinous and those with alcohol produced by artificial processes, such as the brewing of beer, come within the malt or brewed class; these, together, are generally supposed to include practically all kinds of beverages containing even a trace of alcohol.</p>
    <p id="b46-5" data-blocks='[["BL_46.6",46,[262,1044,1151,1239]]]'>The Brooks Law has nineteen sections, and neither the term “intoxicating liquors” nor its equivalent is found in any of them till we reach the fourth, which makes it the duty of constables to return all places, “licensed and unlicensed,” that are “engaged in selling intoxicating liquors”; then the sixteenth section renders it unnecessary for druggists to obtain a license under the statute, but provides “they shall not sell intoxicating liquors except upon the written prescription of a regularly registered physician,” and “any person who shall wilfully prescribe any intoxicating liquors as a beverage to persons of known intemperate habits shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” These provisions and a prohibition, in the seventeenth section, against selling to persons visibly affected by “intoxicating drink,” are absolutely the only references in the statute to “intoxicating liquors,” and it will be observed that none of them have to do with defining the kinds of liquors comprehended by the licenses which this legislation requires. In fact we early decided that the liquors referred to in the licensing parts of the Act of 1887 need not have an “intoxicating quality”: see Com. v. Reyburg, <a href="/pa/122/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="122 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="1948382" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0299-01">122 Pa. 299</a>, 304.</p>

    <p id="b47-3" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[200,429,1152,1734]]]'>The statute in question was put upon the books at a time when strict prohibition was being agitated in the State, the same legislature which passed it formulating a constitutional amendment to that end, for submission to the people (1887, P. L. 414); and it may well be the thought was in the minds of the law-makers that not only did this piece of legislation (the Brooks Law) serye the then present purposes, but it would fit the situation, till a better instrument could be devised, in the event of prohibition coming to pass. At least this suggestion is warranted, not only by the significant absence from the act of the term “intoxicating liquors,” in connection with the license system there ordained (such term or an equivalent being rather generally used in the earlier Pennsylvania liquor laws), but also by the whole structure of the statute; for it is so drawn that, by the elimination, — through subsequent legislation or otherwise, — of the possibility of intoxicating liquors being sold thereunder, its terms would admirably suit the control of the business of dealing in those kinds of liquors which most readily may become of the intoxicating class, or those liquors under the guise of which intoxicating beverages can be most easily trafficked in. This course, — that is, a well regulated license system, to govern the general supply and distribution of all liquors of the character just described, — in the view of many thoughtful people, is considered one of the very best aids to efficient control, and, through such control, actual enforcement of practical prohibition. In this connection, witness the series of amendments made to the Brooks Law by our last legislature, which still retain the license plan.</p>
    <p id="b47-4" data-blocks='[["BL_47.6",47,[204,2175,1147,145]],["BL_48.1",48,[286,311,1148,696]]]'>When looked at from the standpoint we have indicated, there is nothing in the Pennsylvania Act so inconsistent with the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>the United States (which reads thus: “Section 1, After one year from the ratification of this article, the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof, for beverage purposes, is hereby prohibited. Section 2. The Congress and several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation”), or to the Act of Congress passed October 28,1919, called the Yolstead Act (which prohibits liquors for beverage purposes that contain one-half of one per cent of alcohol or more), as to require us to hold our statute annulled by the federal law.</p>

Aside from these limitations, all our acts of assembly stand, which are not inconsistent with the amendment and cognate federal statutes, and, as already stated, the Act of 1887 cannot be thus classed; any of its provisions in conflict with the federal law are annulled; but, as the prevailing scheme of the statute and the parts thereof under which the indictments at bar were drawn, are not so in conflict, the act was properly held to be in force for present purposes.</p>

In Brazier v.

On the same theory, —but, as this is a sovereign State, with stronger grounds pf support, — we conclude that the Brooks Law still survives, as Pennsylvania’s own police power method of officially listing and adequately controlling the customary sources of general supply and distribution, to the peoples within her borders, of those kinds of liquors among which intoxicating beverages are usually found, and she may thus assist in prohibiting their illegal use as such; although, of course, not intended for that specific purpose, the statute is adapted to serve as an instrument with which to perform, at least in part, this State’s right and obligation to enforce, “by appropriate legislation,” the 18th Amendment.</p>

On the contrary, while the Brooks Law recognizes the ex<a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>istence of intoxicating liquors, and, by not forbidding, tacitly permits their sale and use, its whole tenor is one of restraint against the recognized evils which flow therefrom, and, as previously said, so far as the licensing features of the act are concerned, the scheme of the statute is to regulate the direct distribution to the people not of intoxicating liquors but of those kinds of liquors among which the former is usually found, and thus to control such distribution for the enforcement of laws regulating the actual use of intoxicating liquors, no matter what those laws may prove to be from time to time. If man were so constituted that legally ordained prohibition would, in and of itself, universally restrain his appetite for strong drink, after the 18th Amendment, no such regulation would seem necessary, but, unfortunately, he is not, and of this fact we take judicial notice; since the normal appetite for vinous, spirituous, malt and brewed liquors of an intoxicating nature still continues, and, so far as we can see, will continue for some time to come, and since those beverages, whether intoxicating or not, very largely constitute the drink of the people, it is obvious that a statute such as the Pennsylvania Act of 1887, requiring all dealers in the kinds of liquors just named to be licensed, and strictly regulating the trade therein, by thus making it possible to keep a close watch over the character of men who are given a license, and over their conduct after the privilege is granted, is capable of serving a useful purpose in preventing the illicit distribution to the people of intoxicating drinks by those in control of the usual source of beverage supply. To this extent at least, it is adapted to present conditions, and therefore not in conflict with the new laws which brought about those conditions.</p>
