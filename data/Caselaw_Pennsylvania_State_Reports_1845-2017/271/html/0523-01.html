By the Act of April 7,1870, P. L. 57, it is provided that “The Court of Common Pleas of the County of Dauphin, is hereby clothed with jurisdiction, throughout the State, for the purpose of hearing and determining all suits, claims and demands whatever, at law or in equity, in which the Commonwealth may be the party plaintiff, for accounts, unpaid balances, unpaid liens, taxes, penalties and all other causes of action, real, personal and mixed.” The remedy which this act was intended to provide, compels an approval of the conclu<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>sion reached by the court below; for its evident purpose is that the Commonwealth, when suing in her own right, shall be allowed to prosecute her claims at the seat of government, and not be required to go to other parts of the State, where the defendants happen to reside. The fact that, under other legislation, she has also the privilege of proceeding wherever the defendants may be found and served with process, is beside the question; for-this does not repeal the Act of 1870, either expressly or by implication, and hence she still has the absolute right to litigate her claims in Dauphin County, if she chooses so to do.</p>

L. 346; we so declared in Com. ex rel. the Attorney General v.

    <p id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[255,414,1164,1401]]]'>The basis of the opinion below is that since the statute provides no other penalty for its infraction, none other can be imposed; and this is true so far as penalties are concerned, but the rule of construction relied on goes no further. It might just as well be said that because an act simply provided that embezzlement of public funds should be punished by fine and imprisonment, there could be no recovery by a civil action against the embezzler. It is rare indeed that a statute expresses the fact that existing remedies for its enforcement are reserved, nor is it requisite it should do so; yet this is the necessary conclusion from the opinion below, which says, in effect, that because no such reservation is expressed, the legislature must have intended that, by simply paying a fine, public officials, charged with the duty of preventing the spread of contagious diseases, can obtain a right to neglect their duty and subject the people to the risk of contagion, against which the statute was intended to secure them. This is, of course, unsupposable; when the Commonwealth declares her public policy on such important state matters, instead of it being necessary to reserve the right to proceed, the courts will always presume, — in the absence of an express provision .otherwise, — that she retains the right to pursue every existing means necessary to compel her officials to enforce that policy.</p>

In the former, which was an application by a private relator to compel the defendant to abate a continuing public nuisance, it was held that since, in such cases, “the proper sentence......is that the defendant stand committed till he abates it, at his proper cost,” mandamus would not lie because there is an adequate and specific remedy at law to reach the end sought; in the latter, there was no duty imposed on the defendants, in regard to the subject-matter of the complaint, and hence there was none which they could be required to perform. Nor is the Act of March 21, 1806, 4 Smith’s Laws, 332, in point, for here “a remedy is [not] provided......and no penalty [is to be] inflicted, or anything done agreeably to the provisions of the common law......[except such as] shall be necessary for carrying such act or acts into' effect.”</p>

An indictment, at the most, is merely punitive, and not remedial in its nature, and can only punish the neglect of duty, without compelling its performance. It cannot, therefore, take the place or usurp the functions of a mandamus, which af<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>fords specific relief by commanding the performance of <em>the </em>identical thing sought.” To the same effect are Wood on Mandamus and Prohibition (3d ed.) 80, 18 Ruling Case Law 135, 26 Cyc. 173, and our own cases of Com. v. Johnson, 2 Binney 275, and Overseers of Porter v. Overseers of Jersey Shore, <a href="/pa/82/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="82 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="1047864" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0275-01">82 Pa. 275</a>.</p>

If this be so, and they continue to do it, the writ of peremptory mandamus need not be issued.</p>
    <p id="b564-5" data-blocks='[["BL_564.6",564,[287,972,1148,359]]]'>The judgment of the court below is reversed at the cost of appellees, and the record is remitted with' directions to forthwith enter judgment for the Commonwealth, and thereafter to issue a writ of peremptory mandamus against the appellees, M. T. Wilkins, Burt Thomas and J. Ross Barney, whenever it shall be found necessary so to do.</p>
