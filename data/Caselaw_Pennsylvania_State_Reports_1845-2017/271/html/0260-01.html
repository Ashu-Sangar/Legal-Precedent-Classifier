By letter of March 28, 1919, Edmund Shaw offered to sell to defendants “the place you now occupy,” with the buildings and grounds, personal and household goods (excepting a few articles of a personal nature, such as pictures of his wife and himself) for $10,000, at $35 per month, covering a period of twenty-five years. After some delay the letter was acknowledged, October 15, 1919, and the offer was accepted; at the same time defendants received from Shaw an acknowledgment of the acceptance in the following language: “October 15, 1919, property sold to William E. Oornman for the sum of Ten Thousand (10,000) Dollars, to be paid in monthly payments of Thirty-five (35) Dollars per month until the full sum of Ten Thousand (10,-000) Dollars be fully paid, without interest. First payment made October 15, 1919. Edmund Shaw.” A second payment was made November 15th, and the receipt reads as follows: “Deceived November 15, 1919, From Wm. E. Cornman the sum of Thirty-five (35) Dollars, <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>due this day on contract for sale of property Number 1130 Fourteenth Avenue, Altoona, Pa. Edmund Shaw.” These writings constitute the entire transaction of sale.</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[267,479,1154,1881]]]'>It will be noted the letter refers to land “you now occupy.” The property covered by the writ had been occupied by defendants under a lease from decedent for some time, and it was the only land so leased. The offer was never withdrawn and the sale was finally consummated by an acceptance on the 15th of October, when payment was made on account of the purchase price; and if anything was lacking in the first and second papers to clarify the matter so as to satisfy the statute, the receipt of November 15th supplied the deficiency. The papers are so related through recitals and references and so connected by their internal sense, coherence and adaptation of parts as to make a complete agreement within the statute. The land may be easily identified by the fact of possession and number; a consideration was mentioned with time of payment and, in short, all the necessary elements of a complete contract may be found. It does not appear the metes and bounds designated in the writ were in any respect different from the description mentioned in the agreement. “Land 25 feet on Fourteenth Avenue, and extending back in even width 86 feet, and has thereon erected a two and a half story frame dwelling,” fits in precisely with “the place you now occupy,” “1130 Fourteenth Avenue.” Any general description as to the location is made specific by reference to an existing possession that cannot apply to any other land, with no other property known as 1130 Fourteenth Avenue, in the City of Altoona. The language is not so abstract but that, with a minimum of external evidence, the land could be found without the possibility of contradiction or uncertainty, and to the exclusion of all other properties. The writings, of and within themselves, furnish means of identification. There is no variation in the terms, conditions, consideration and subject-matter.</p>
