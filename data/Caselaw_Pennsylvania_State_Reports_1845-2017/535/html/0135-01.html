In a modification proceeding, the employer bears the burden of proof, and <em>Kachinski </em>did no more than delineate the elements of that burden and the nature of the evidence necessary to meet it. In proceedings on a claim petition, the employee bears the burden of proof, and thus <em>Kachinski </em>is inapposite. It makes no sense, argues the appellant, to state that the employer “has the burden of proving that other work is available to the claimant which he is capable of obtaining” or “must produce evidence of a referral (or referrals) to a then open job which fits in the occupational category for which claimant has received medical clearance,” at a stage of the proceedings where the employee has the ultimate burden of proof and the employer is arguing that the employee is not entitled to any benefits.</p>

      <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>The appellee responds by asserting that she met the burden of establishing entitlement to benefits by proving her inability to do the job she held at the time of the injury. As a result, she argues, the Board and Commonwealth Court properly ruled that the burden shifted to the employer to show both change in her disability and availability of work she was capable of doing, and that there was no evidence in the record to substantiate such findings.</p>
    <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[192,831,1157,912]]]'>The confusion in this case stems, in large part, from the duration of the proceedings. The injury occurred on January 3, 1987, and the claim petition was filed two weeks later. It was seven months before the claimant testified, and the deposition testimony of her physician/expert was not introduced until six months after that. The next scheduled hearing five months later was continued, and five more months passed before the deposition testimony of the employer’s physician/expert was introduced. At this point, nearly two years had elapsed from the date of the injury. To this point, the only question was whether the claimant had sustained a compensable injury; the medical testimony, based on examinations conducted on or before June 10, 1987, was directed to this question. Had the referee made a decision awarding benefits based on his assessment of this evidence, the employer would have been required to meet the <em>Kachinski </em>burden in any later proceeding to modify benefits.</p>

At the hearing on March 22, 1989, the claimant acknowledged that she had worked full time from October 17, 1988 to March 11, 1989. She testified that she had done so despite continuing pain in her back, and that she had quit because her knees and back were bothering her more than when she had started. Her supervisor testified that the claimant had never appeared to be in pain, had never advised anyone that she was having difficulties in performing <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>her duties on account of pain, and had simply not shown up for work on March 11, for which she was terminated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a>

Thus the referee concluded, on the basis of the testimony of the claimant’s medical expert, that she had sustained a compensable injury and was entitled to total disability benefits. That testimony, however, was based on a physical examination that occurred on June 9, 1987. The referee also found that the claimant had engaged in full-time work from October 17, 1988 through March 11, 1989, more than a year after the aforementioned physical examination. He specifically deemed not persuasive or credible her testimony that she had done so with continuing back pain and that she ultimately left due to physical distress. Thus he concluded that as of October 17, 1988, the claimant was entitled to only partial disability benefits since she was physically able to perform certain work that, obviously, was available to her. He also concluded that because she voluntarily abandoned that work, she was not entitled to resumption of total disability benefits after March 11, 1989.</p>

      <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>The error in the reasoning of the Board and Commonwealth Court is that, viewing the referee’s findings of fact with hindsight, it artificially bifurcates the proceedings and as a result improperly shifts the burden of proof. The employer correctly asserts that in a claim proceeding, the employee bears the burden of establishing a right to compensation and of proving all necessary elements to support an award. <em>Fox v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, </em><a href="/pa-commw/30/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="30 Pa.

Although with hindsight we may say that the claimant produced evidence establishing that she had suffered a compensable injury, this is not the same as saying that she carried her burden of proof with respect to the proceeding. Her evidence established that she had suffered a compensable injury resulting in total loss of earning capacity that continued through June of 1987; it did not exclude the possibility of her returning to employment in the future. When the record was reopened more than a year and a half after the claimant’s last physical examination, the burden of proving entitlement to compensation still rested with the claimant. The employer’s evidence that the claimant had been engaged in full time employment and had left this employment without apparent cause was competent evidence on the issue of the extent of the claimant’s loss of earning power. In the context of this case, we find that the Board erred in determining that the employer’s lack of medical evidence on the question of the claimant’s ability to work after March 11, 1989, amounted to an absence of substantial evidence to support the referee’s finding.</p>

For the purposes of workmen’s compensation “disability” is a term synonymous with “loss of earning power.” <em>Scobbie v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Greenville Steel Car Company), </em><a href="/pa-commw/118/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="118 Pa.

The logical extension of this principal is that if there is proof that a claimant’s earning power has improved, there is proof that the claimant’s disability has abated. Proof existed that Claimant’s earning power improved for the period October 17, 1988 to March 11, 1989 because the record indicates that Claimant was employed by K-Mart during this period. However, the Board was correct in its conclusion that the referee’s findings do not support a determination of partial disability on or after March 12, 1989 when Claimant was no longer employed by K-Mart.</p>

Commw. 503" data-case-ids="1891021" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/38/0503-01">38 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 503</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=393%20A.2d%201300" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="393 A.2d 1300">393 A.2d 1300</a> (1978), another case involving a referee’s error in calculation, does not excuse Employer from the failure to present evidence concerning Claimant’s wages to the referee in the present case. Where the evidence sought to be introduced at the requested rehearing was readily available at the time of the original hearing, denial of a rehearing is not an abuse of discretion on the part of the Board. <em>Dominijinni v.

The employer makes reference to evidence outside the record that it has since discovered, which, it asserts, demonstrates that the claimant left this employment not because of pain but because she had begun a different job at higher pay. Obviously, we cannot consider evidence outside the record in resolving this appeal. The effect of this evidence on the claimant’s right to compensation must be determined in appropriate proceedings pursuant to the Act.</p>

      <p id="b339-6" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[223,1888,1150,513]]]'>. The only case cited by Employer which deals with voluntary abandonment in the <em>post-Kachinski </em>era is <em>Dugan v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Fuller Company of Catasaugua), </em><a href="/pa-commw/131/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="131 Pa. Commw. 218" data-case-ids="1399098" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/131/0218-01">131 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 218</a>, <a href="/pa-commw/131/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="131 Pa.

We note that since <em>Dugan </em>is an award of benefits case rather than a modification case, the Court’s consideration of <em>Kachinski </em>in its decision points out the fact that <em>Kachinski </em>controls whenever an employer seeks to prove that a claimant is capable of returning to employment. <em>Dugan </em>holds that an employer is not required to prove the availability of work for a claimant who has testified to his “voluntary abandonment” by retirement, and unwillingness to consider other employment. <em><a href="/pa-commw/131/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="131 Pa.

The present case is distinguishable from the situation in <em>Dugan, </em>as Claimant testified to her willingness to try light work.</p>
