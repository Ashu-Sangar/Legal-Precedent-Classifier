This case presents <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>two issues for our review. The first is whether an order by a trial judge that parties to a paternity suit submit to a blood test is appealable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The second issue is whether blood tests were properly ordered. Our determination of that depends on whether Appellee, Kathryn Jones (“Jones”), overcame the presumption that her child is the child of her former husband with whom Jones lived at the time of conception and birth.</p>
    <p id="b288-4" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[265,756,1166,885]]]'>The factual circumstances of this case are as follows: On January 20, 1988, Jones filed a paternity suit against Trojak, alleging that he was the biological father of Katie Jones (“Katie”), who was born October 80, 1987. At the time of the child’s birth, Jones was still married to and living with William Jones. The trial court ordered all of the parties involved to undergo blood tests to determine paternity. Trojak objected, contending that Jones failed to rebut the presumption of her ex-husband’s paternity and, therefore, blood tests were unnecessary. The trial court overruled the objection, and the blood tests were administered. The results from the blood tests indicated that William Jones could not be the father and that Trojak shared genetic markers with Katie which gave rise to a 99.9% probability that he is the biological father. On October 26, 1988, the trial court found Trojak to be the biological father of Katie. An appeal was filed, but was discontinued after the trial court granted a new trial.</p>

Trojak filed an interlocutory appeal to the Superior Court, and Jones filed a motion to quash. The motion to quash was denied. Subsequently, on January 11, 1990, while the appeal was pending before the Superior Court, the trial court filed an Opinion and Order finding that Trojak was the child’s natural father. The Superior Court reversed the trial court’s June 19, 1989 Order and remanded the matter to the trial court. We granted Trojak’s request for review.</p>

This Court has not determined whether a court order requiring blood testing is appealable, and we find that these circumstances present us with the opportunity to speak on this issue.</p>

Our concern is that once a party to a paternity action submits to a blood test, the psychological and moral damage will have been done, the family unit will have been intruded upon, and, most importantly, the child will have been scarred from the mental stress and the social stigma associated with having the identity of his or her parents investigated.
