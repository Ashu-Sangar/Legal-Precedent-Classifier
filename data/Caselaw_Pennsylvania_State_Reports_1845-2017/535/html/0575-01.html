The overwhelming <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>evidence presented by the Commonwealth included the testimony of his daughter, Mary Brown, to the effect that on Thanksgiving Day 1989 her parents had a host of arguments. Finally, Mary Brown and her mother, victim Mary Edwards, left the house with Appellant’s words, “I will take care of you when you get home,” ringing in their ears. Mary Edwards dropped her daughter off at the latter’s home. The next day, Mary Edwards was found dead on her kitchen floor with three bullets in her body. Appellant was found in an alcohol induced sleep reclining in his easy chair. In addition to his dead wife, there were found a .38 snub nose revolver on the table next to him, a near empty bottle of vodka on the dining room table, and a German shepard dog in the yard. Ballistics determined that five shots were fired from the gun. Mary Edwards was hit by three of the cartridges, while the remaining two were on the kitchen floor. No fingerprints were on the gun. Appellant’s socks and shoes were bloodied with blood of the decedent’s blood type. No evidence of a break-in was observed.</p>
    <p id="b767-5" data-blocks='[["BL_767.4",767,[182,1395,1155,522]]]'>Appellant was charged with murder in the first degree. No defense was presented. The Commonwealth presented its findings to the jury and closed. Defense counsel requested the court <em>not </em>to instruct the jury on the principle that “no adverse inference” could be drawn from Appellant’s failure to take the stand. The court denied the request and so instructed the jury. Additionally, the instruction included instructions on first, second and third degree murder as well as voluntary manslaughter. The jury found Appellant guilty of third degree murder.</p>

      <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>In <em>Commonwealth v.

The instant appeal presents the other side of the coin, <em>i.e., </em>what happens where the defendant does not want such a charge to be given. This possibility was clearly acknowledged by the majority in <em>Reginald Lewis </em>when it was noted that “if defendant and his or her counsel determine that the fundamental right to remain silent is best served by not drawing attention to defendant’s silence, the derivative right (i.e., the ‘no defense inference’ instruction) may be validly waived.” <em><a href="/pa/528/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="528 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1829819" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0440-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/528/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="528 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1829819" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0440-01">at 455, fn. 14</a>, <a href="/pa/528/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="528 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1829819" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0440-01">598 A.2d at 983, fn. 13</a>. Thus, since this Court in <em>dicta </em>acknowledged that the defendant clearly had the right to refuse this charge, the trial judge’s decision nonetheless to instruct the jury was apparently erroneous. The Commonwealth argues that even if the trial court committed error, such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The Superior Court agreed with the Commonwealth’s argument and Appellant comes to us.</p>
