The Philadelphian was originally an apartment building. However, in 1979 it was converted to a condominium complex by virtue of filing a Declaration of Condominium in accordance with the Unit Property Act, Act of July 3, 1963, P.L. 196, 68 P.S. §§ 700.101-700.805 (repealed July 2, 1980). All of the Philadelphian’s unit owners are members of an unincorporated association known as the Philadelphian Owners’ Association, which is governed by a seven-member council. In 1986, the council adopted a membership policy which required council members to be resident owners. The council also adopted a parking policy for the allocation of on-site parking due to the severe shortage of on-site parking.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[248,1155,1164,464]]]'>Concomitant with the new policy was the creation of two waiting lists: the first list was for resident owners, while the second list was for non-resident owners and their tenants. The lists created a priority scheme whereby resident owners would first be awarded parking spots and the second list would only come into operation after the parking requirements of all the resident owners had been satisfied. Because the parking shortage was so severe, there was no movement on the second list.</p>

Lyman, were non-resident owners and as such were included on the second list. They commenced this action after they experienced difficulty securing a tenant for their unit. The difficulty was allegedly related to the unavailability of parking. Their complaint was brought in equity and contained three separate prayers for relief: first, they sought to have the parking policy declared unlawful; second, they sought damages in the nature of lost rent which they attributed to the discriminatory parking policy;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>third, they asked that the requirement that council members be resident owners be declared unlawful.</p>

On the council’s motion for summary judgment, the court upheld the garage policy, and dismissed the complaint with respect to the relief requested at counts one and two of the complaint.

The trial court did, however, ultimately enjoin the council from implementing the requirement that council members be resident owners.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

That court after reviewing the allegations of the respective parties, the agreements of sale, the Declaration of Condominium, and the condominium’s code of regulations, held that, while the council could enact a policy giving resident owners priority over non-resident owners, the current allocation was not permissible because the non-residents were not being compensated for the use by other owners of the garage and lot which is owned in common by all. <em>Lyman v.

    <p id="b592-6" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[243,712,1170,966]]]'>When called upon to review actions of a condominium association which do not impact constitutional privileges, courts have generally employed one of two standards. The first standard is “the administrative agency analogy.” Under this standard, courts have scrutinized condominium association actions in much the same way judicial review of administrative actions is conducted. Thus, to determine whether an action is reasonable, the court looks first to whether an association has acted within the scope of its authority as defined by the enabling statute, its own declaration and bylaws; and whether it has abused its discretion by promulgating arbitrary or capricious rules bearing no relation to the purpose of the condominium. Under this standard, if the rule is authorized and reasonable the association or council may adopt it; if not, then it cannot. <em>See Hidden Harbour Estates, Inc. v.
