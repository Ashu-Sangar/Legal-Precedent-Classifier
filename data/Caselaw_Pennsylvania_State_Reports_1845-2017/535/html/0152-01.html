Farouk M. Georgy, Leonard Collins; and Lyon, Cooper, Hippie, Georgy, and Collins, P.C. (“Doctors”). The Doctors specialize in the area of obstetrics and gynecology, and had been treating Mrs. Hudak for infertility. In January of 1983, an ultrasound revealed that Mrs. Hudak was carrying triplets.</p>

After experiencing difficulty in contacting her physicians, Mrs. Hudak was eventually advised to go to the Williamsport Hospital. Dr. Collins was present at the hospital, and administered Rotodrine in order to stop the contractions. After Mrs. Hudak’s contractions ceased, she was transferred to Geisinger Medical Center. The following day the triplets were delivered by caesarian section. All of the triplets were bom alive. However, two of the three died in the delivery room twenty minutes after birth, and the third child died approximately ten hours later. The parties stipulated that at the time of delivery, the triplets were <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>incapable of sustained life outside the womb, and therefore, were not viable.</p>

The trial court, upon the Doctors’ motion, dismissed the wrongful death and survival claims concluding that an action cannot be maintained on behalf of a non-viable fetus.

Thus, the issue is whether a child that is born alive is a natural person for purposes of our wrongful death and survival acts even if the infant is considered non-viable at the time of its birth.

Second, we recognized that our wrongful death and survival statutes are remedial in nature and should be liberally construed. Third, we held that difficulties in proving either causation or damages should not operate as a complete bar to recovery. Fourth, we demonstrated that allowing wrongful death actions on behalf of a stillborn fetus would not permit a windfall of double recovery to the parents. Finally, we explained a stillborn’s inability to take by distribution is irrelevant when determining how wealth is accumulated.</p>

The Superior Court, by couching the issue in terms of whether infants born alive “should now be accorded the same rights [as] children who have attained viability,” has turned our decision in <em>Amadio </em>on its head. The issue was not whether the viability standard should supplant live birth as the only relevant measure of when a fetus becomes a person, but whether a viable stillborn fetus should be treated the same as a child born alive. Therefore, <em>Amadio </em>did not affect the rule permitting a wrongful death action for a child that is born alive.</p>

Rather, it is the dissent which advocates the application of <em>Amadio </em>to the present case, where the death of a fully developed fetus is not involved. Further, we do <em>not </em>agree with Justice Cappy’s attempt to dismiss the existence of the triplets, however brief, by characterizing them as having merely shown “signs of live birth.” (Dissent at 6). We disagree with the implication of this description that some level of endurance must be achieved before a living being can qualify as an individual under the Act. No jurisdiction has qualified life in this manner, and denied a cause of action for children that are born alive. Pennsylvania should not be the first.</p>
