Newton, believing that there were narcotics to be found, then instituted a more thorough search. From a box on the windowsill he seized a coffee grinder containing a white powdery residue.

In the traditional fourth amendment case, the warrant requirement based upon probable cause and issued by a neutral and detached magistrate guarantees the protection of a citizen’s constitutional rights. Similarly, in the context of a probationer or parolee’s limited fourth amendment rights, some systemic procedural safeguards must be in place to guarantee those limited fourth amendment rights. In the absence of any statutory or regulatory framework, or an agreement explicitly setting out the rights of the defendant and the authority of the state to supervise the defendant, we are constrained to conclude that the actions of these parole officers violated the fourth amendment. Therefore, the evidence was properly suppressed.</p>

I do not believe that the majority is saying that a police officer’s warrantless search under these same facts would be impermissible, only that these parole officers could not act like police without specific authority to do so.
