On August 12, 1980, John Miller, the named insured on a no-fault automobile insurance policy issued by the Appellant, Keystone Insurance Company (Keystone), sustained fatal injuries in a motor vehicle accident. Appellant promptly paid funeral, collision and survivor’s loss benefits to Appellee Mary Miller, the mother of John Miller. On August 11, 1986, Appellee filed a claim on behalf of her son’s estate, seeking post-mortem work loss benefits, plus interest and counsel fees, for herself and the class which she represents. Following a change in venue and an involved procedural history, the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County conducted a hearing and granted Appellant’s motion for summary judgment on the basis that the Appellee’s claim was barred by the statute of limitations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On appeal, Superior Court interpreted our decision in <em>Dercoli v.

Appellee did not request nor did she seek post-mortem work loss benefits until August, 1986, when she filed a complaint averring that Keystone misled her into believing that her son’s estate had no valid claim for work loss benefits. Appellee did not attend the trial court’s hearing and the sole evidence introduced into the record on her behalf consisted of two exhibits offered by her counsel. One exhibit, to which Appellant objected, was a copy of a letter written by an independent adjuster, retained by Appellant, to Appellant’s claims manager. This letter dated October 21, 1980, indicated that the adjuster knew of the estate’s potential entitlement to work loss benefits by reason of recent court decisions but that the adjuster made no mention of “possible” wage loss benefits to Miller and would “await developments in that regard”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The other exhibit was a Keystone chart showing the various payments made to plaintiff, including a final payment of survivor’s loss benefits on April 30, 1982.</p>

Superior Court found that the responsibility to obtain for the estate all that it is potentially entitled to is implicitly imposed by the No-Fault Act. It also determined that when an insurer counsels an unrepresented claimant, the insurer tacitly knows that its level of information is greater than that of the insured. Finally, Superior Court held that even though the law is not settled on the question of whether an insured is able to recover at the time the insured’s claims are being processed, the duty of good faith and fair dealing announced in <em>Dercoli </em>

      <em>Dercoli </em>involved a situation where the widow of an insured sued two automobile insurers for damages for breach of an alleged duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiff alleged that she had been severely injured in an automobile accident in which her late husband had been at fault. Significantly, she further alleged that upon the advice and assurances of the insurers that she would receive everything to which she was entitled, she was induced to refrain from hiring counsel to represent her in her dealings with the insurers. While the insurers were still adjusting the plaintiffs claims, the defense of interspousal immunity was abolished. This meant that the plaintiff had a viable tort claim for negligence against her late husband’s estate which was unquestionably covered by the policies’ liability coverage. Notwithstanding the insurers’s representations and assurances, the insurers did not advise the plaintiff of the potential tort claim or of the fact that the claim was clearly covered by the policies. The insurers in <em>Dercoli </em>successfully demurred to the complaint and the plaintiff appealed. Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s dismissal. This Court reversed.</p>

Two months later, the claimant requested information from her late husband’s employer as to any widow’s benefits due her. Unidentified employees informed her that there were no other benefits apart from life insurance and the death gratuity that she received. The Plaintiff did not seek advice from any other source and claimed that she did not learn of her potential entitlement to work-related benefits until 1978, when she read a newspaper account of a case regarding this Court’s decision in two other “heart attack” cases. On April 3, 1979, the Plaintiff filed a claim alleging that the statute of limitations was tolled because her late husband’s employer failed to notify her of her right to file a claim for death benefits. This Court refused to impose an affirmative duty upon an employer to apprise an employee or claimant of all available benefits.

As determined by the Superior Court, it cannot be denied that the insurance industry in this Commonwealth was aware of this appellate activity, and an internal memorandum prepared by Keystone to Mrs. Miller’s claim representative regarding the information disclosed to her provides some evidence that Keystone was aware of the unfavorable appellate activity in this area. <em>Miller v. Keystone Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/402/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="402 Pa.

Moreover, it is clear that neither <em>Heffner </em>and <em>Pontius, </em>nor this Court's express determination that a deceased victim’s estate is entitled to recover for work-loss in <em>Freeze v. Donegal Mutual Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/504/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="504 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1787785" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0218-01">504 Pa. 218</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="504 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1787785" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0218-01">470 A.2d 958</a> (1983), represented a "change” in the law of Pennsylvania. To the contrary, these cases merely decided what the No-fault Act had always required, and furthermore, served to dispel an incorrect interpretation of the Act being advanced by insurers.</p>

Contrary to the position of the Majority, I believe that, if Mrs. Miller can establish a basis for the duty that I and the Superior Court have described, Keystone’s breach thereof would serve to toll the running of the statute of limitations in this matter under the principle of estoppel. My review yields no basis for the Majority’s conclusion that Mrs. Miller cannot establish that she was fraudulently or deceptively lulled into a false sense of security, given the alleged actions, omissions and relationships of the parties, and the limited record developed prior to entry of summary judgment. To further support the dismissal of this claim on the basis that there was no discussion between Mrs. Miller and Keystone related to post-mortem survivor’s benefits or the filing of a claim simply begs the question.</p>

As thoroughly described by the Superior <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>Court herein, while this Court did not finally put to rest the issue of an estate’s claim for work-loss benefits until <em>Freeze v. Donegal Mutual Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/504/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="504 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1787785" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0218-01">504 Pa. 218</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="504 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1787785" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0218-01">470 A.2d 958</a> (1983), <em>Freeze </em>did not change the law of Pennsylvania. It merely enforced what the No-fault Act had always required, and essentially only provided what this Court had implied in the <em>Heffner-Pontius </em>cases. Moreover, the question is not whether Keystone's insureds were able to recover between the <em>Heffner-Pontius </em>cases and the <em>Freeze </em>decision, but rather, whether Keystone had an obligation to inform them of the potential for recovery and that it was no longer acting in the interest of its unrepresented insureds. Finally, it is clear that as of the date of this Court's decision in <em>Freeze, </em>only three months had elapsed since Mrs. Miller received her last benefits, and quite conceivably <em>a full year </em>remained before the estate’s claims would have been time barred. <a href="/pa-super/402/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="402 Pa.
