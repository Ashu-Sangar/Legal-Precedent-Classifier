At trial, Crater testified that on November 21, 1981, at approximately 6:00 p.m. he met up with appellant, Dauntel Evans and Joey Boyer to carry out a robbery the four of them had planned a few days earlier. The four men first drove to a store to purchase gasoline, during which time they discussed robbing a certain country grocery store known as “Stein-ruck’s.” During this time, both Crater and appellant were in possession of handguns. The conspirators agreed that Crater would drive the car and that appellant and Evans would enter <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>the store. At some point during this conversation, Joey Boyer decided that he no longer wanted any part of the planned robbery, exited the vehicle and walked home.</p>
    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[245,528,1162,579]]]'>Appellant, Evans and Crater then proceeded to Steinruck’s Store, but abandoned their plan to rob the store after noting the number of people present in the store. After the three of them decided to choose an alternate site, Crater suggested that they rob Ritchie’s Tavern. When they arrived at Ritchie’s tavern, Crater entered the bar, surveyed the premises, and then returned to the car. Appellant and Evans concealed their faces and entered the tavern, armed with the handguns. Crater testified that he heard three shots after the other two had entered the bar. Appellant and Evans then ran from the tavern and the three men drove off.</p>
    <p id="b272-6" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[241,1178,1162,474]]]'>The first issue raised by appellant concerns the trial court’s refusal to permit cross-examination of Joey Boyer regarding bias. It is well settled that it is within the discretion of the trial court to determine the scope and limits of cross-examination and that this Court cannot reverse those findings absent a clear abuse of discretion or an error of law. <em>Commonwealth v. Birch, </em><a href="/pa/532/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="532 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="1835949" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0563-01">532 Pa. 563</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="532 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="1835949" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0563-01">616 A.2d 977</a> (1992).

    <p id="b272-7" data-blocks='[["BL_272.6",272,[234,1694,1163,692]]]'>At trial, Joey Boyer was called to testify on behalf of the Commonwealth. Prior to cross-examining Boyer, defense counsel informed the court that it intended to question the witness regarding any favorable treatment received by Boyer in exchange for his testimony. It appears that at the time Boyer agreed to testify on behalf of the Commonwealth, he was incarcerated in the Dauphin County Prison on a charge of theft and was also awaiting extradition to Virginia on unrelated burglary and theft charges. At some point after he agreed to testify in the instant matter, but before the time of trial, the Virginia charges were dropped and the Dauphin County charge was reduced to criminal mischief. A fine of $200 was imposed and Boyer was released from prison.</p>

      <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>Rather than permit the cross-examination, the trial court held an <em>in camera </em>hearing in an effort to ascertain whether the allegations of bias had any merit. The trial court ruled that the intended cross-examination of Boyer fell outside the ambit of permissible cross-examination since, according to the testimony of Boyer and the district attorney, there had been no promises of leniency with respect to those charges and since the charges were no longer <em>pending. </em>On appeal, the Superior Court concluded that the trial court erred in so ruling, but found that the error was harmless. In so concluding, the Superior Court relied upon this Court’s decisions in <em>Commonwealth v. Evans, </em><a href="/pa/511/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="511 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1798719" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0214-01">511 Pa. 214</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="511 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1798719" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0214-01">512 A.2d 626</a> (1986), and <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[204,1106,1156,958]]]'>In <em>Evans, </em>the defense sought to cross-examine a Commonwealth witness as to any promise of leniency regarding charges which were pending against him in the same jurisdiction in which the case at bar was being tried. We held there that such cross-examination was permissible. Similarly, in <em>Coades, </em>we held that a witness under indictment for charges stemming from the same crime which formed the basis for the case in which that witness had been called to testify could be cross-examined as to any favorable treatment that witness may have already received from the prosecution with regard to the witness’ own case. Here, the charges which Boyer had pending at the time he agreed to testify neither stemmed from the same incident which is the subject of the case <em>sub judice </em>nor were the charges pending at the time of appellant’s trial. The Superior Court, while noting these distinctions, nevertheless concluded that this Court’s holdings in <em>Evans </em>and <em>Coades, </em>when read together, would permit the cross-examination requested here. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[205,2096,1154,150]],["BL_274.1",274,[266,333,1168,901]]]'>In <em>Evans </em>and <em>Coades </em>we reiterated the well established rule that a witness may be cross-examined as to any matter tending to show the interest or bias of that witness.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>Our primary concern in both of those cases was with assuring that any possible bias of a witness regarding hopes for leniency or actual favorable treatment be revealed to the jury so that it could properly evaluate the witness’ credibility. Clearly, a similar concern is present here. We agree with the Superior Court that from the facts presented here, it can easily be inferred that at the time Boyer agreed to testify for the Commonwealth, he had expectations of leniency with regard to his pending charges, and that when he did so testify, he was obliged to tailor his testimony in favor of the prosecution. The fact that the charges were no longer pending is of no moment. As Judge (now Justice) Montemuro so aptly stated in his opinion below: “If this were the test, then the Commonwealth need only ensure that its witness receive the favorable treatment before the start of the trial to avoid cross-examination challenging the witness’ bias.” As we said in <em>Evans:</em>

    <blockquote id="b274-5" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[299,1264,1132,476]]]'>The jury may choose to believe the witness even after it learns of actual promises made or possible promises of leniency which may be made in the future, but the defendant, under the right guaranteed in the Pennsylvania Constitution to confront witnesses against him, must have the opportunity at least to raise a doubt in the mind of the jury as to whether the prosecution witness is biased. <em>It is not for the court to determine whether the cross-examination for bias would affect the jury’s determination of the case.</em>

We cannot conclude that the jury here could have inferred from this line of questioning that appellant had invoked his right to remain silent and that an adverse inference should be drawn therefrom. Moreover, the prosecutor’s point was a fair inference from the evidence. For example, appellant did testify that he encountered Evans, Boyer and Crater on the evening in question, but claimed that such encounter occurred earlier than 6:00 p.m. that evening. He also testified that at approximately 6:00 p.m., David Crater borrowed the car which was later identified as the getaway car, but that appellant did not encounter Crater any time thereafter.</p>

The questions proffered by the Commonwealth were not suggestive of any exercise by appellant of his right to remain silent at a time when he, if not guilty, would have likely informed authorities of his defense. For instance, this line of questioning did not imply that appellant had exercised his right to remain silent when faced with questions from authorities. Nor did the Commonwealth here imply silence on the part of appellant after being informed of his constitutional rights. Additionally, this line of questioning was clearly not designed to lead the jury into believing that appellant had a duty to come forward with this evidence at an earlier date but that he chose not to do so.

During both of these robberies, a handgun was taken from the residence. The murder weapon that was retrieved from the creek after the Ritchie robbery and murder was subsequently identified as a handgun that was taken during the Brubaker burglary. At trial, a ballistics expert testified that the .32 caliber projectile found at Ritchie’s Tavern and the .32 caliber cartridge found in the back seat of the getaway car matched ammunition left behind in the Herring burglary and that these projectiles could have been used in the type of handgun stolen during the Herring burglary. We cannot dispute the trial court’s finding that this evidence was “extremely” probative especially given the fact that none of the eyewitnesses to the Ritchie robbery and murder were able to positively identify the perpetrators. Moreover, any prejudicial effect that this evidence may have had was minimized by the trial court’s cautionary instructions wherein it informed the jury that evidence of these prior crimes was presented so as to provide them with all the facts necessary to determine the guilt or innocence of appellant as to the instant charges.
