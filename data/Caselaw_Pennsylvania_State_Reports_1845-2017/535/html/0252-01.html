      <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>On appeal to the Superior Court, Ms. Jenkins challenged the constitutionality of the substantive and retroactive application of § 8305(a). The Superior Court addressed only the challenge to the retroactive application of this subsection because its determination that retroactive application of § 8305(a) is unconstitutional rendered consideration of the substance of the provision unnecessary. Our review is also limited to the constitutionality of the retroactivity provision. The Superior Court held that the retroactive application of § 8305(a) to causes of action accruing before its effective date was unconstitutional. Because Ms. Jenkins’ cause of action accrued on March 8, 1984, more than four years before the promulgation and effective date of § 8305(a), the Superior Court held that it could not constitutionally govern this action.</p>
