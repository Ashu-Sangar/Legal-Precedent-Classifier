Although the Legislature attempted to deter and punish individuals who possess, sell, or deliver drugs, the appropriate criminal punishment would serve as a deterrent to any future drug activity rather than a license revocation. As such, suspension of a driver’s license becomes an additional punishment and an irrational method of disciplining individuals possessing marijuana in their homes.

As such, the prospect of losing one’s driver’s license may deter a potential drug user from committing that first drug offense. At least, that potential user may consider the loss of his/her license and its effect on employment and transportation prior to committing a drug offense.
