Ultimately this dispute originates in the fact that in 1978, Congress enacted the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”), codified relevant to this case at <a href="/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20796" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="16 U.S.C. § 796">16 U.S.C. § 796</a>(17)-(22) and 16 U.S.C. § 824a-3. PURPA <em>requires </em>that, amongst other things, regulated electric utilities offer to purchase electric energy from alternative power sources in the form of cogeneration and small power production facilities, thereby reducing this country’s dependence on foreign oil and natural gas. PURPA also envisions the promotion of energy conservation and encourages the development of alternate energy sources. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) subsequently issued regulations under the statute. See, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="18 C.F.R. § 292">18 C.F.R. § 292</a>, <em>et seq. </em>Under the statute and the regulations, qualified cogeneration and small power production facilities are referred to as qualifying facilities (“QFs”) and must be certified by FERC as such. Congress, however, chose <em>state </em>regulatory authorities to be the prime enforcers of PURPA. The statute <em>requires </em>state regulatory agencies to implement FERC’s rules in this area. This rather convoluted scheme of federal pre-emption was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi </em><a href="/us/456/0742-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="456 U.S. 742" data-case-ids="6191413" data-case-paths="/us/456/0742-01">456 U.S. 742</a>, <a href="/us/456/0742-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="456 U.S. 742" data-case-ids="6191413" data-case-paths="/us/456/0742-01">102 S.Ct. 2126</a>, <a href="/us/456/0742-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="456 U.S. 742" data-case-ids="6191413" data-case-paths="/us/456/0742-01">72 L.Ed.2d 532</a> (1982).

(“MEI”) directly concerning MEI’s proposal to refurbish an old West Penn power plant and create an electric generating facility fueled by bituminous coal refuse designed to provide up to 43 megawatts of power for a period of 30 years. This project is commonly known as the Milesburg Project and is located in Milesburg, Centre County, Pennsylvania.

The rates were based on West Penn’s own determination of its “avoided costs” and were calculated to be <em>at or below </em>its “avoided costs” as of May 7, 1986. FERC regulations define “avoided costs” as “the incremental costs to an electric utility of electric energy or capacity or both which, but for the purchase from the qualifying facility or facilities, such utility would generate itself or purchase from another source.” <a href="/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.101" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="18 C.F.R. § 292.101">18 C.F.R. § 292.101</a>(b)(6). Unlike avoided energy costs, which are relatively stable and are not at issue in this appeal, avoided <em>capacity </em>costs, as will be seen below, can vary significantly over time. They are time dependent. The avoided <em>capacity </em>rate agreed to would have resulted in capacity payments of approximately $10 million per year by West Penn to MEI over the 30 year period for the purchase of electric power.</p>

      <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>A further word about “avoided costs” is in order. Prior to PURPA, cogeneration and small power production facilities could not force utilities to purchase their electricity output and could only negotiate with utilities for the purchase of their power under the ordinary commercial circumstances of a willing buyer and a willing seller. In PURPA, Congress directed the FERC to set rates for utility purchases of power from QFs for ultimate resale to the utility’s retail customers that are: (1) just and reasonable to the electric consumers of the utility and in the public interest; (2) not discriminatory against QFs; and (3) not to exceed the “incremental costs of alternative electric energy.” 16 U.S.C. § 824a-3(b). PURPA defines the term “incremental costs of alternative electric energy” as the cost to the utility of electric energy which the utility would have generated or purchased from another source, absent the purchase from the QF. 16 U.S.C. § 824a-3(d). The concept of paying QFs the same or lesser amount as the utility would have charged for a like amount of power is commonly referred to as avoided cost pricing. <a href="/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="18 C.F.R. § 292.304">18 C.F.R. § 292.304</a>. The Congressional intent of the avoided cost pricing scheme is to make the utilities’ ratepayers economically indifferent between utility power plant additions and utility purchases of QF power.</p>
    <blockquote id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[295,1584,1120,474]]]'>Under Section 210 of PURPA an electric utility’s ratepayers are intended to be at least indifferent, in terms of the rates they pay, as to the source of power. In other words, the ratepayer is not to pay any more for power because the utility has purchased power from a QF rather than generating the power itself or purchasing power from another wholesale source. This is the purpose underlying the incremental cost ceiling on the rates utilities have to offer to purchase QF power.</blockquote>

The EEPA contained a series of milestone dates designed to assure West Penn that satisfactory progress was being made on the project so that it could rely upon MEI’s commitment to deliver power. One of the key milestone dates was the deadline for the closing of the initial construction financing of the Milesburg project (known as the “Financing Closing Date”). The EEPA provided that it would automatically terminate if the Financing Closing Date did not occur before September 1, 1988, for any reason whatsoever, including <em>force majeure. </em>A financing closing on the Project has not occurred to date. The parties also agreed in the EEPA that, as a condition precedent of West Penn’s obligations to purchase power, the PUC must enter an order, final beyond appeal, establishing that the EEPA was in full compliance with the law and public policy, that the purchase of power would not result in excess capacity, and that all amounts paid by West Penn under the EEPA were consistent with law and could be immediately and fully passed through to its customers. This condition precedent was thought to be necessary because, as a public utility, West Penn cannot pass through to its customers any costs incurred under an EEPA without the authorization of the PUC.</p>

Various parties intervened and the PUC in substance granted West Penn’s petition without, however, holding open hearings on the matter. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court held that adequate notice to customers of the utility, and a fair opportunity to be heard — as required by due process, had not been given prior to PUC consideration of West Penn’s Approval Petition.

The Commonwealth Court based their conclusion on a reading of a FERC regulation, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.304" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="18 C.F.R. § 292.304">18 C.F.R. § 292.304</a>(d), discussed below. To further complicate matters, Armco/Ludlum now argues that the relevant calculation date is either September 29, 1989, the date when the PUC ordered West Penn to enter into a new transaction based on the original EEPA (which had expired according to its own terms); or, in the alternative, on the date MEI became certified as a QF, January 28, 1988. It is not readily apparent why this date selection question has been so bitterly litigated. However, a careful reading of the record and briefs in this case reveals the answer. Originally, Arm-<a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>co/Ludlum argued for the February 25,1987, date because two tax changes occurred prior to that date that they wanted incorporated into the calculation of the capacity credits for Milesburg, namely, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, effective in tax year 1987 and beyond, and a reduction in Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax effective January 1, 1987. See, the PUC decision in this case, <em>Re: West Penn Power Company, </em><a href="/citations/?q=106%20P.U.R.4th%20459" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="106 P.U.R.4th 459">106 PUR 4th 459</a>, at 465, <a href="/citations/?q=1989%20WL%20418684" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="1989 WL 418684">1989 WL 418684</a> (1989). Although precise calculations are not available, picking the later 1987 date with the tax changes then in effect, Armco/Ludlum argues, would reduce the rates charged to utility customers as a result of the Milesburg project. Armco/Ludlum further argues that picking an even later date in 1988 or 1989 might effectively eliminate rate increases completely. See, Arm-co/Ludlum Appellants’ brief at pp. 43-44. The self-serving shifting of dates by Armco/Ludlum for the calculation of avoided capacity costs emphasizes the correctness of the rationale employed by the PUC.</p>

This fear seems well founded. Moreover, the PUC adopted the Administrative Law Judge’s position that no matter what point in time is used to fix rates, ratepayers will bear the risk that rates will go down and QFs will bear the risk that they will go up. Some point in time must be fixed and the PUC chose to continue to follow and to apply their “serious negotiations” rule, adopted in a case by case method and having been most recently enunciated and applied in <em>Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission v.
