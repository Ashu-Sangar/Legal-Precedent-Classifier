Here, a two-year-old girl, weighing thirty-four pounds and standing thirty-six inches tall, suffered the following serious injuries: scalping, blunt force to her torso, obliteration of her genital area, burning of her body and a skull fracture. She was scalped by being cut with a sharp knife-like instrument from the ear up across the front hair line of her forehead and down to the other ear. Her scalp was then peeled back to the nape of her head exposing the entire skull. Blunt force trauma to her chest and stomach was so forceful that it caused the tearing of her liver and lungs. This force was also one of two possible causes of two feet of the infant’s intestines to protrude from her genital area. (The other possible cause was pulling the intestines out of the genital area). The genital area of the two-year-old child was completely obliterated and ripped to such an extent that there was only one large and bloody cavity where there originally were the anal and vaginal orifices. There were also areas of burning of the infant’s <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>body, many other lacerations and abrasions and a skull fracture.</p>
    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[258,493,1164,855]]]'>All of these separate and gruesome injuries occurred while the child was living. Expert medical testimony by Dr. Jasnosz stated the cause of death was a combination of the scalping, blunt force injuries to the torso causing internal injuries, and the trauma to the genital area. The separate inflictions of these injuries demonstrate a methodical step-by-step process of killing, i.e., a willful, premeditated, deliberate, and intentional killing by a fully developed adult man of a helpless two-year-old infant girl. Any reasonable human being would realize these injuries will cause death to such an infant. The fact that appellant took this infant to an isolated area of a state forest in Cambria County and hid the body further demonstrated his intent to kill. The evidence is more than sufficient to demonstrate that appellant had, at the time of the killing, a specific intent to kill the infant and to support the conclusion that appellant committed an intentional killing.</p>
    <p id="b412-6" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[253,1404,1162,637]]]'>Appellant first claims that his statements and confession were too ambiguous to imply an intentional killing. Appellant admitted to the state police that he killed a little girl in an isolated area in state game lands. He stated to the troopers that “you will find a dead, raped little girl” and that “she was a brave little girl.” He detailed some of his actions, e.g., “while in the pick-up truck, I hit her with my fist four or five times until she stopped moving.” He drew a map with an X showing the exact location where the incident occurred, and where the body was located and explained how the body was covered with leaves and twigs and dirt. Appellant has failed to demonstrate any ambiguity in his confessions.</p>

Appellant claims that because the witness used words such as “consistent with” and “appear to be,” her testimony was qualified. A medical opinion is sufficient to support a finding when given with a <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>reasonable degree of medical certainty. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b413-5" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[206,492,1158,695]]]'>Appellant has failed to demonstrate that Dr. Jasnosz’s testimony was qualified in any respect. Dr. Jasnosz testified during the trial phase and by videotape for the sentencing phase. She was cautioned by defense counsel and the court to render her opinions within the requisite reasonable degree of medical certainty. During the course of her testimony, she prefaced her opinions with the standard of a reasonable degree of medical certainty. The trial court did not err when it found that Dr. Jasnosz’s medical opinions proved that both the anus and vaginal tracts had been penetrated by a penis to prove rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and that the necessary medical testimony had been given within a reasonable degree of medical certainty.</p>
    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[203,1226,1156,854]]]'>Appellant next claims that the Commonwealth did not prove the requisite specific intent for murder of the first degree because of the evidence concerning his intoxication. Appellant claims as a defense that he was so intoxicated at the time of the killing that he did not possess the specific intent to kill as required for first-degree murder. 18 Pa.C.S. § 308 provides that voluntary intoxication can reduce a murder-one conviction to a murder-three conviction. <em>Commonwealth v. Stoyko, </em><a href="/pa/504/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="504 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1787796" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0455-01">504 Pa. 455</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="504 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1787796" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0455-01">475 A.2d 714</a> (1984). The critical inquiry is whether the defendant was overwhelmed by an intoxicant to the point of losing his rationality, faculties, or sensibilities so as to negate or lower the specific intent to kill. <em>Commonwealth v. Breakiron, </em><a href="/pa/524/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="524 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1822795" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0282-01">524 Pa. 282</a>, <a href="/pa/524/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="524 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1822795" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0282-01">571 A.2d 1035</a> (1990).

The Pepper Tree Inn bartender testified that appellant was in control of his faculties when he exited the bar. Appellant himself conceded that he was under control at that time and was drinking in a conservative fashion at the bar. He also navigated a pickup truck approximately <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>thirty to forty miles over narrow, twisting, mountainous roads at night and drove approximately two miles over game land roads that were less passable than logging roads as they consisted of very narrow terrain with rutted and gutter areas inclusive of low streams, watery areas, and severe hills. Appellant presented a series of witnesses on the issue of intoxication but, since most of those who testified to an alleged severe impairment of appellant were individuals who had definable motives and bias by way of established relationships to appellant, the court properly could disbelieve them. The court did not err in concluding that, despite appellant’s ingestion of intoxicants on the evening in question, appellant was capable of forming, and did indeed form, the specific intent to kill by way of a willful, deliberate, and premeditated design.</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[239,1240,1162,368]]]'>Finally, appellant claims that the evidence demonstrated appellant’s intent to commit rape with the victim’s death being an unexpected result of the rape. The evidence detailed above demonstrates otherwise and the trial court did not err in concluding that the seriousness of the injuries inflicted which caused the death clearly demonstrated an intent to kill and substantially more than an intent to rape.</p>

    <p id="b414-7" data-blocks='[["BL_414.6",414,[235,1896,1162,527]]]'>Appellant’s second argument is that the trial court erred in denying appellant’s motion to suppress evidence consisting primarily of tangible items from appellant’s truck and residence, the confession and other inculpatory statements by appellant, and a map drawn by appellant depicting the scene of the crime and location of the victim’s body. When reviewing the denial of a suppression motion, this court should consider only evidence of the prosecutor’s witnesses and so much of the evidence for the defense as, fairly read in context of the record as a whole, remains uncontradicted.</p>

The victim was reported missing to the state troopers by her family who gave them information and a description of a person who was observed in the family’s residence in Clearfield County in the early morning of the disappearance. The description resembled that of appellant. Based on the information, the troopers contacted appellant to see if he would voluntarily appear at the barracks to answer questions relating to the disappearance of the child. At that time, the authorities were looking into the disappearance of a two-year-old female child and did not know whether she had <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>wandered away from her home or whether criminal activity was involved.</p>

At the end of the questioning, appellant drew a map leading to the location of the victim’s remains. Thereafter, appellant explained that the troopers would find there a “dead, raped little girl.” He was left alone and unsupervised in the room for a period of five minutes.

Appellant's unsubstantiated claims are that counsel allegedly failed to: investigate or cross-examine Trooper Lavelle regarding the difference between the times recorded on the search warrant for appellant’s house and the receipt-inventory sheet completed subsequent to the search; cross-examine thoroughly for impeachment purposes the three witnesses who identified appellant as the person seen in the victim's bedroom at the time in question; call, as a witness, Cindi Snyder, who would have testified that appellant was at her home for two 15-minute intervals on the night in question; call other witnesses who would have testified to the sensitive demeanor of the victim; pursue appellant’s claim that a helicopter search was conducted and something was found in the strip mine before appellant was called in for questioning; introduce evidence of Budweiser beer bottles found in the same area as the victim; call, as a witness, the victim’s babysitter who would have testified that the victim's family had abused the child and were involved in a satanic cult, even though no testimony to this effect was deemed probative by the trial court; pursue the absence of a shoe allegedly found at the crime scene even though the record shows that it was used in another case against appellant; impeach a Commonwealth witness concerning her alleged (but not proven) statement that appellant was not the perpetrator and concerning the time of her arrival at her home; object, under the best evidence rule, to the introduction of a photocopy of a map drawn by a trooper from the map drawn by appellant, even though appellant’s map was introduced into evidence; pursue the DNA testing of evidence and records at the Child and Youth Agency of Clearfield County, even though all scientific test results and reports and opinions were provided to the appellant; and, review the Children and Youth records of Clearfield County to see if there was any evidence helpful to his defense even though the trial judge reviewed the appro<a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>priate records from Clearfield County in chambers, found nothing exculpatory or that would aid the appellant in his case and, therefore, refused to turn them over to appellant. His other claims of ineffectiveness have been dealt with herein on the merits. Since the underlying claims have been deemed meritless, the ineffectiveness claims must also fail.</p>
