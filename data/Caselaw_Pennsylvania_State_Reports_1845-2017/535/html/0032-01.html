    <p id="b223-12" data-blocks='[["BL_223.12",223,[187,1569,1154,312]]]'>Ralph Pagano, Appellant, has filed a direct appeal with us from the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County dismissing his appeal to that Court from the decision of the Berks County Board of Elections dated December 23, 1991, which, in turn, dismissed his petition for a recount of the votes cast in the November 5, 1991, election.</p>

Appellant, a resident of the City of Reading, Berks County, was a candidate for a seat on the Reading School Board in the November 5, 1991, election. After counting all the votes as recorded by the electronic voting machines, along with write-in votes and absentee votes, the Berks County Board of Elections determined that Appellant and Irene Carson each received a total of 7, 645 votes for the seat on the School Board. This determination was made on November 20, 1991. <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>On November 25, 1991, Appellant filed a petition for recount with the County Board of Elections on his own behalf.</p>
    <p id="b224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_224.4",224,[257,501,1163,622]]]'>On November 26, 1991, the Board of Elections, being comprised of the Honorable Forrest G. Schaeffer, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, the Honorable Scott D. Keller, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, and Frederick O. Brubaker, Esquire, met to consider Appellant’s Petition. Ms. Carson, at that time, presented a motion that Appellant’s Petition be dismissed because it was not filed in accordance with the provisions of the Election Code, and specifically alleged that the Petition was defective in that it was not verified by the signatures of three electors. The Board asked that the issue be briefed and took the matter under advisement.</p>
    <p id="b224-5" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[255,1155,1160,417]]]'>On November 27, 1991, Appellant filed a petition in the Prothonotary’s Office of Berks County seeking to file a petition <em>nunc pro tunc </em>with the Court of Common Pleas. This second petition was signed by Appellant and verified by three electors. Both petitions are identical in that they each seek to challenge the regularity of certain absentee ballots used by the Berks County Board of Elections in arriving at its November 20, 1991, computation.</p>

    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.3",225,[201,611,1157,1075]]]'>We begin our analysis of this matter by noting that appeals which emanate from orders of the Court of Common Pleas which, in turn, are reviewing orders of the county Board of Elections under Section 1407 of the Election Code, Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1333, as amended, 25 P.S. § 3157, are accepted by this Court in the nature of certiorari review in its broadest sense, <em>In re General Election of November 6, 1971, </em><a href="/pa/449/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="449 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1945683" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0386-01">449 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20782" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="296 A.2d 782">296 A.2d 782</a> (1972), in spite of the fact that the statute forbids appeals in the normal sense of the word beyond the court of common pleas. “No appeal shall be allowed or granted from any order or decree of the court of common pleas made in pursuance of this section.” 25 P.S. § 3157(b). Thus, even though the statute does not permit us to inquire into the merits of Appellant’s challenge to the absentee ballots, we are not foreclosed from accepting the matter on certiorari and reviewing the record including the testimony to determine whether the findings are supported by competent evidence and to correct any conclusions of law erroneously made. <em>In re Recanvassing of Certain Voting Machines, </em><a href="/pa/504/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="504 Pa. 593" data-case-ids="1787752" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0593-01">504 Pa. 593</a>, <a href="/pa/504/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="504 Pa. 593" data-case-ids="1787752" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0593-01">475 A.2d 1325</a> (1984).</p>

Specifically, Appellant argues that the trial court failed to recognize that the procedures for challenging absentee ballots are so confusing in the Election Code that his failure to follow proper procedures was excusable and, in the interest of justice, his petition should have been heard by the county Board of Elections.</p>

There is no reason to disturb this rule of law or to presume a differing procedure simply because Section 1407 refers to the recount of voting machines.
