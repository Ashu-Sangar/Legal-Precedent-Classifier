The taxpayer in this case qualifies as just such an entity because it holds stock in Suburban Water Company. Therefore, it would be improper to rely exclusively on what appears in the first part of the provision to determine how the Legislature wants net income calculated in a case such as this one.

Moreover, Section 601 views companies in this way regardless of how much stock one owns in another. This is a sound interpretation of the statute, and we give it great weight.</p>

Of the two principal methods of accounting for dividends, only the cost method operates this way; the equity method of accounting for dividends departs from this general procedure. 2 Seider &amp; Carmichael, <em>Accountant’s Handbook, </em>§ 30.27-28 (6th ed.). Dividends accounted for under the equity method are treated as a return on capital, not as income, causing the company’s net income per books to be lower than it otherwise would be. <em><a href="/pa/508/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="498 A.2d 374" data-case-ids="1794085,639121" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0359-01,/pa-super/345/0229-01">Id.</a> </em>Dividends are treated this way because the company’s investment in its investee is considered to be significant enough to put the company in a position to influence the operating and financial decisions of its investee.

As already indicated, when corporations are not part of a consolidated commercial enterprise, dividends are recorded by their recipient as income, making them part of a company’s tax computation under Section 601. The regulation at 61 Pa.Code § 155.26(b) ensures that any dividend payment is taxed regardless of whether the recipient reports it as income: It requires corporations to adjust what they report as income per books when dividends are not accounted for as income by virtue of the fact that they were recorded under the equity method of accounting. This does not violate the legislative intent behind Section 601, nor is it unwise. Therefore, the taxpayer’s argument and the Commonwealth Court’s conclu<a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>sion, that the regulation is inconsistent with the underlying statute, is without any merit.</p>

Specifically, the taxpayer contends that the $8 million in dividends it received has already been reflected in and taxed as part of the investee corporation’s net income per books. Therefore, the argument continues, by adding $8 million to the recipient corporation’s net income per books, the same money is taxed before and after it is transferred. While this argument may have some surface appeal, it fails to survive scrutiny.</p>
    <p id="b495-5" data-blocks='[["BL_495.5",495,[220,1045,1153,740]]]'>What the taxpayer decries as double-taxation is nothing more than the manner in which dividends are taxed generally: The corporation pays taxes before dividends are distributed, and the shareholder recognizes the dividend payment as income subject to taxation. The only difference in this case is that the shareholder happens to be a corporation that owns all of the stock in the dividend-paying corporation. The regulation ensures that neither a taxpayer’s corporate status nor the number of shares it owns will affect how dividends it receives are taxed. Therefore, the taxpayer’s insinuation that the regulation unfairly results in double-taxation simply has no merit. Indeed, the regulation ensures that all corporate taxpayers are treated uniformly with respect to dividend payments.</p>
