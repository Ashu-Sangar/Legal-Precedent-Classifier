It also noted that minors are subject to several legal disabilities, such as the inability to be a party to a legal proceeding. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 2026 <em>et seq. </em>The court found that a minor would not be able to fulfill the duties of a district justice because testimony at the hearing had established that the position was a full-time job, and the statutes and rules governing district justices require that a district justice give priority to his office. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 3802; Rule 3, Rules Governing Standards of Conduct of District Justices.
