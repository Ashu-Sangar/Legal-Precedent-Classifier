The lower court erred, therefore, in concluding that the owner’s guilt or innocence in an in rem proceeding against property is constitutionally irrelevant.

We disagree. The amount of the redemption was inextricably related to the redemption itself. If, for example, the court determined that the amount of redemption was the entire appraised value of the house, or what the Commonwealth was likely to have received at auction, presumably the Commonwealth would not have appealed because it would receive no less from King’s redemption than it would at auction. But it could not know the trial court’s final determination as to the amount of redemption until the January 22 hearing, after which it properly took its appeal raising the entire issue of redemption.</p>
