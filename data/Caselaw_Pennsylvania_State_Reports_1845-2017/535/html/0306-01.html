In denying General Refractories Company’s appeal of this issue, the Board concluded that General Refractories Company had stipulated to the modification petition and the fatal claim petition being consolidated. Even if the referee erred in consolidating these two petitions, Section 413 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 771, permitted the referee to award fatal claim benefits <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>under the notice of compensation payable by taking judicial notice of claimant’s death and accepting testimony that it was work-related.</p>

Commonwealth Court reversed the Board. In doing so, the court initially noted that under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, a claimant has the right to elect whether to proceed under that Act or the Occupational Disease Act, but may not proceed under both. The court then reasoned that Appellant elected to proceed under the Occupational Disease Act. Since Appellant chose to pursue her remedy under the Occupational Disease Act rather than the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the referee could not rely on § 413 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act to award fatal claim benefits. Furthermore, General Refractories Company’s failure to file the appropriate answer form was insignificant. The cause of action was identified by the Appellant, not General Refractories Company. Neither the referee nor the Board could change the form of action sua sponte. Therefore, Commonwealth Court vacated the death benefits claim and remanded the matter to the Board for disposition under the Occupational Disease Act.</p>
