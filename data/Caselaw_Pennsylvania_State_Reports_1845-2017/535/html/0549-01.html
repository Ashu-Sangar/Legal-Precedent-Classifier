Appellant, appearing somewhat disconcerted, told Officer Wilson that he had been involved in an argument with a woman named Sharon Smith, and wanted to tell his side of the story before he was arrested.</p>

As the car door opened, Appellant lunged at Wilson and attempted to grab his gun while threatening to kill him.

Appellant testified that Officer Joseph Wilson came outside, opened the car door and began to assault him. Officer Wilson then pulled Appellant from the car and continued the assault. When Sergeant Lewis Wilson heard the struggle, he ran outside to assist his brother. The two officers then beat Appellant into submission.</p>

The possibility that improper contacts may influence a juror in ways he or she may not even be able to recognize and that a defendant may be left with questions as to the impartiality of the jury, leads to the conclusion that when the contact is more than incidental, the burden is on the prosecution to prove that the unauthorized contact did not influence the juror.</blockquote>

The majority also says that under our law there must be a showing that the contact between a member of the jury and an officer of the court , resulted in “a reasonable likelihood of prejudice to the defendant.” (Majority Opinion, at p. 555).

The majority then reverses the findings of the trial judge and grants a new trial because of some imagined speculative subconscious influence that might have crept into the juror’s being during the short conversation and because the trial judge did not call on the juror to satisfy himself that no such bias was present.</p>

The majority excuses defense counsel for his failure to call the juror because it could have put him in the difficult position of deciding whether to avoid questioning the juror or run the risk of antagonizing a juror who might remain to decide his client’s fate. That’s what we call trial strategy and it justifies trial counsel’s decision not to call a particular witness and to live with the consequences of his choice, but I did not know until today that it shifts the burden to the trial court to call the witness and ferret out the information for him.</p>

I am sure that the passage of two and one half years will not have taken away the memory of that event and its effect on the juror’s psyche. Furthermore, if there is a subconscious taint, I doubt that the witness would be consciously aware of it. I guess a psychiatrist will have to be called in at taxpayer’s expense to delve into the subconscious of the witness. I dissent.</p>
