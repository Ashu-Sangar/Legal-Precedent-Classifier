The Commonwealth Court, which considered this matter under its original jurisdiction, dismissed all counts except the contractual claim against the Borough and relinquished jurisdiction, 129 Pa.Cmwlth. 47, <a href="/pa-commw/129/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="564 A.2d 1015" data-case-ids="1395449" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/129/0047-01">564 A.2d 1015</a>.

As its formal name implies, Act 47 is designed to offer relief to any city that is considered to be financially distressed. The Secretary of the Department of Community Affairs (“Secretary”) designates a city as being in financial distress upon finding that certain specified conditions are met. 53 P.S. § 11701.201. Within thirty days after making this designation, the Secretary must appoint a coordinator to prepare a plan addressing the city’s financial problems. 53 P.S. § 11701.221.</p>

If the Secretary determines that the plan will not accomplish this goal, or if the city refuses to adopt the coordinator’s plan, then the city suffers the suspension of certain funds it would otherwise receive from the Commonwealth. 53 P.S. §§ 11701.248, 11701.251, 11701.264.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In Count III, the Association contends that section 252 violates the nondelegation clause of Section 31 of Article III of the Pennsylvania Constitution because it allegedly “prohibits a municipality from entering into collective bargaining agreements and/or arbitration awards pursuant to existing State law.” For this reason, the Association seeks a declaration that section 252 of Act 47 is unconstitutional.</p>

The first demurred as to all counts on the basis that the Commonwealth Appellees are sovereignly immune from suit. The second objection was that the Commonwealth Court lacked jurisdiction over the contractual claim raised in Count I. Each of the remaining five objections was based on the alleged failure of the Association to state a cause of action for which the relief it requested in each of its five counts could be granted. The Borough demurred on the same basis to the constitutional claims raised in Counts II through V. In addition, the Borough raised a preliminary objection to Count I on the basis that the Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the contractual claim asserted therein. The Commonwealth Court sustained all preliminary objections that were raised. We now proceed to review that decision.</p>

Moreover, it is reasonable to forbid those municipalities from entering collective bargaining agreements that are.inconsistent with the provisions of a duly enacted financial recovery plan.</p>
    <p id="b626-8" data-blocks='[["BL_626.6",626,[260,1414,1164,522]]]'>The Association contends that section 252 imposes limitations on labor awards and collective bargaining agreements entered into by a financially distressed municipality without placing similar restrictions on other contracts made by the same municipality. In order to support such a contention, the Association argues that the General Assembly has selectively regulated collective bargaining agreements to the exclusion of other contractual endeavors, which renders section 252 an unconstitutional special law. This argument is simply without merit.</p>
    <p id="b626-9" data-blocks='[["BL_626.7",626,[257,1972,1163,422]]]'>First, the Act does not establish the narrow classification between labor and non-labor contracts alleged by the Association. Any plan designed to alleviate the financial distress of a municipality may also potentially impact upon prospective non-labor contracts. Under section 241 of Act 47, a fiscal recovery plan must include, if relevant, provisions for: balancing a municipality’s budget; eliminating existing deficits and deficit funds; avoiding future deficits; satisfying past due accounts</p>

      <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>payable; and avoiding future fiscal emergencies. 53 P.S. § 11701.241(2)(i), (ii), (iv), and (v). Any of these factors may potentially affect a financially distressed municipality’s non-labor contracts throughout the effective period of the recovery plan. Moreover, Act 47 subjects all liabilities of the distressed municipality to re-negotiation. <em>See </em>53 P.S. §§ 11701.243 and 11701.261. Collective bargaining agreements have not, therefore, been singled out for special regulation.</p>
    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.4",627,[199,800,1160,1022]]]'>Second, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the General Assembly did create a separate legislative classification between labor and non-labor contracts, Act 47 still withstands constitutional scrutiny because a rational basis exists for the classification. In order to place potential limits on labor contracting in Act 47, the General Assembly had to specifically address collective bargaining agreements and arbitration settlements because of the pre-existing statutory scheme in the area of labor law. Included in this arrangement are the processes established in Act 111, the Policemen and Firemen Collective Bargaining Act, 43 P.S. § 217.1 <em>et seq., </em>and Act 195, the Public Employe Relations Act, 43 P.S. § 1101.101 <em>et seq., </em>that regulate the labor contracts into which a public employer may enter. These labor contracts are regulated to the exclusion of non-labor contracts. Similar legislation does not exist involving the non-labor contracts that a distressed municipality may enter into. Therefore, it is apparent that a classification between labor and non-labor contracts is based upon rational distinctions existing in the law.</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[199,1853,1158,359]]]'>Because the statutory classification created by section 252 of Act 47 is rationally related to a proper state purpose, that provision does not violate Article III, Section 32(7) of the Pennsylvania Constitution.

As stated in the Majority Opinion, Section 252 of Act 47 provides that “[a] collective bargaining agreement or arbitration settlement executed after the adoption of a plan shall not in any manner violate, expand or diminish its provisions.” 53 P.S. § 11701.252. Thus, Section 252 of Act 47 effectively permits municipalities to adopt recovery plans which unilaterally determine the limits of future collective bargaining agreements and awards (including the reduction in salaries or benefits) without any meaningful input by the employee organization and with no guidelines or regulations other than the approval of the Coordinator/Secretary.

    <p id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[198,757,1157,746]]]'>The majority’s analysis focuses on the wrong classification at issue. The legislative distinction between a municipality’s contracts with its organized labor force and its other contractual commitments should be the focus. Under Act 47, collective bargaining agreements/awards have been specifically regulated to the exclusion of any other contractual endeavors. Section 252 has no specific counterpart addressing the distressed municipality’s contractual relationships with any of its vendors, subcontractors, suppliers or even that segment of its labor force not collectively represented by organized labor. The Majority allude to a potential effect upon non-labor contracts. Aside from this narrow exception, the municipality is otherwise free to contract on any other subject notwithstanding the guidelines of the plan.</p>

The subject matter which the majority finds as being a viable class distinction (collective bargaining agreements or arbitration awards) does not withstand analysis or scrutiny as being a reasonable class distinction. Therefore, I would declare Section 252 of Act 47 an unconstitutional special law regulating labor in derogation of Article III, Section 32(7) of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>
