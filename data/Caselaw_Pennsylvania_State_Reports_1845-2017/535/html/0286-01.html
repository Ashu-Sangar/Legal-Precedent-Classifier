This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 723(a). Because final resolution of this matter was necessary prior to the primary election of May 18, 1993, we decided it by Order dated May 12, 1993, affirming the Order of the Commonwealth Court and indicating that an Opinion would follow. This Opinion is now filed in support of that Order.</p>

Smith, also a candidate for that nomination.</p>

The court, after hearing, determined that the principal objection to the Lackawanna County papers, that the circulator filed a false affidavit, was meritless. Since the challenges to individual signators in Lackawanna County, even if successful, would not reduce the number of signatures below 100, the court made no specific ruling on those objections.</p>
