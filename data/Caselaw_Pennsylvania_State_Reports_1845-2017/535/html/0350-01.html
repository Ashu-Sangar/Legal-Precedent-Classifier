Sam was found guilty of three counts of first degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime. He then requested a waiver of his right to have the jury decide the penalty, and instructed his attorney not to argue any mitigating circumstances. After an extensive colloquy in which Sam acknowledged that he was in effect asking the court to sentence him to death, the trial judge entered three consecutive death sentences. He specifically found at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance for each murder. Thereafter, the court heard and denied post-verdict motions and suspended sentence on the charge of possession of an instrument of crime. At that proceeding, Sam indicated for the first time that he did not want to die. The court then appointed new counsel, who filed this timely appeal.</p>

Uncontradicted evidence presented at trial established that at approximately 1:00 p.m. on July 20, 1989, appellant’s sister-in-law, Hong Ing, called the family restaurant to report that Sam was beating his son. Sam had <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>habitually beaten the child since he was one month old and occasionally beat his two-year old niece as well.

Sou Ing, her son and brother-in-law of Sam, accompanied her. When they entered the house, they did not see Sam, as he had already gone upstairs. Sou told Hong that he would take both children back to the restaurant. Sou then went upstairs to rest for a brief time. Thay Ing remained downstairs with the children.</p>

The gun, which he had purchased the day before along with 100 rounds of ammunition, held a thirteen bullet clip. At approximately 1:50 p.m. Sam shot Thay twice and attacked his brother-in-law Sou, firing at him inside the house and chasing him out onto the street. As Sou ran down Snyder Avenue, one of the bullets hit him in the back and severed his spinal column. He fell to the ground. Sam then ran up, loaded a fresh clip, and fired continuously at the fallen body. Five bullets entered the back of the victim’s head as horrified bystanders watched.</p>

The North Lebanon police then went to the friend’s residence, and saw Sam in his car in the driveway. While awaiting confirmation that a warrant had been issued, the police received a frantic call from the residence. The caller reported that a man had a gun and was threatening to Mil himself. At that point, the police moved in and made the arrest. They also retrieved the murder weapon<em>.</em>

The court then asked a court psychologist, Dr. Alan Levitt, to <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>interview Sana to determine if he was competent to proceed. Later that day, with the assistance of a Cambodian interpreter, Dr. Levitt examined Sam and concluded that “[h]e seems withdrawn, he seems somewhat out of contact with reality at present. He is not able to focus adequately. And in my opinion he is in a disturbed state, too disturbed to defend himself adequately in a trial situation at this point.” Dr. Levitt opined .that Sam could not understand what was happening at trial.</p>

He opined that Sam “managed to grasp the meaning of all the different, important aspects, such as charges, function, purpose of a trial ...
