    <p id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[269,494,1161,408]]]'>The issue presented for our review is whether it was error for the trial court to exclude as irrelevant, evidence of prior similar incidents in which appellant had been misidentified as the robber. Because the evidence was clearly relevant and because we find that the defense was precluded from presenting evidence of the similarities between the previously charged crimes and the instant one, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b484-7" data-blocks='[["BL_484.6",484,[267,933,1161,362]]]'>On December 20, 1988, at approximately 7:15 p.m., a man entered Kramer’s Pharmacy in White Oak, Pennsylvania, and, at gunpoint, ordered the pharmacist and a clerk to “give me all your Dilaudid.” The perpetrator then ran from the pharmacy with a cigar, box containing drugs. Appellant was later arrested and charged with the robbery after the pharmacist and the clerk identified him as the perpetrator.</p>
    <p id="b484-8" data-blocks='[["BL_484.7",484,[264,1320,1162,519]]]'>On March 9, 1990, appellant proceeded to a bench trial before the Honorable George H. Ross. During cross-examination of one of the arresting officers, defense counsel attempted to elicit testimony relating to a string of similar prior robberies wherein appellant had been misidentified as the perpetrator. The trial court refused to hear evidence of these prior misidentifications, ruling that the evidence was irrelevant to the instant charge. Ultimately, appellant was convicted of the instant robbery charge and was sentenced to five to ten years incarceration.</p>
    <p id="b484-9" data-blocks='[["BL_484.8",484,[262,1870,1163,420]]]'>On direct appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred in concluding that evidence of the prior misidentifications was irrelevant to the instant charge. The Superior Court agreed with appellant, but nevertheless affirmed the conviction on the basis that defense counsel had failed to sufficiently establish the similarities between the prior robberies and the instant robbery or that the robberies occurred close in time, <a href="/citations/?q=420%20Pa.%20Super.%20639" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="420 Pa.

It is equally well established that evidence that a defendant has committed a crime other than the one for which he or she stands accused is admissible where the crimes possess substantial similarities such that proof of one tends to establish logically the identity of the accused as the perpetrator of the other. <em>See Commonwealth v. Morris, </em><a href="/pa/493/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="493 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="8731729" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0164-01">493 Pa. 164</a>, <a href="/pa/493/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="493 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="8731729" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0164-01">425 A.2d 715</a> (1981). Clearly, the converse is also true: evidence that a defendant has previously been misidentified as the perpetrator of one or more crimes bearing substantial similarities to the crime for which the defendant now stands accused is also relevant for the same reasons and should likewise be deemed admissible.</p>

    <blockquote id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.6",485,[244,1834,1113,573]],["BL_486.1",486,[291,356,1125,1135]]]'>While no previous case appears to hold, as we do here, that the defense may introduce evidence that someone else committed a crime which bears a highly detailed similarity to the crime with which the defendant is charged, we agree with appellant that this conclusion follows inexorably from the myriad cases holding that “evidence <em>is </em>admissible when it tends to prove a common scheme, plan or design embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to prove the others or to establish the identity of the person charged with the commission of the crime on trial, — in other words where there is <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>such a logical connection between the crimes that proof of one will naturally tend to show that the accused is the person who committed the other. A veritable multitude of authorities in our appellate courts enunciate, albeit in varying language, this familiar principle.” <em>Commonwealth v. Wable, </em><a href="/pa/382/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="382 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1259978" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0080-01">382 Pa. 80</a>, 84 &amp; n. 2, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20A.2d%20334" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="114 A.2d 334">114 A.2d 334</a>, 337 &amp; n. 2 (1955) (emphasis in the original; citing 21 cases in footnote). The Commonwealth is permitted in such cases to introduce evidence that the defendant committed crimes other than the one charged, because their highly detailed similarity makes their probative value in showing that the defendant committed the crime charged so great as to outweigh even the substantial danger of prejudice to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth v. Morris, </em><a href="/pa/493/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="493 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="8731729" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0164-01">493 Pa. 164</a>, 174, <a href="/pa/493/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="493 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="8731729" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0164-01">425 A.2d 715</a>, 720 (1981). When the defense offers evidence that someone other than the defendant committed a crime with a detailed similarity to the one charged, the probative value is equally strong in showing that the defendant did not commit the crime charged, and the argument for admissibility is even stronger, because there is no prejudice to weigh against this equally strong probative value.</blockquote>
