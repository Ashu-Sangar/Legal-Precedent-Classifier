(“Consolidated”), appeals from the Order of the Superior Court affirming the Order of the Court of Common Pleas which enjoined Consolidated from operating a pharmacy in the West Goshen Shopping Center (“the Shopping Center”). In this case, we granted allocatur to address the question of whether this Commonwealth should adopt Section 524 of the Restatement of Property as an exception to the Statute of Frauds and, if so, whether the facts of this case fit within the exception.

(“Thatcher’s”), which for the last nineteen years has been operating a pharmacy in the Shopping Center immediately adjacent to Consolidated’s Shop-Rite supermarket. Thatcher’s commencement of this action was in response to Consolidated’s plan to operate a pharmacy in the supermarket.</p>
    <p id="b661-9" data-blocks='[["BL_661.9",661,[186,1985,1157,367]]]'>The facts as found by the trial court are as follows: On October 29, 1965, Consolidated entered into a long-term lease with then owner, Enal Productions (“Landlord”), to open a Shop-Rite supermarket as an “anchor” store for the Shopping Center. Under the terms of the lease, Consolidated was prohibited from using more than twenty percent of its selling space for the sale of “non-food” items.</p>

    <p id="b662-6" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[261,1059,1165,795]]]'>In 1976, Thatcher’s installed a refrigeration case from which it sold milk. In response, Consolidated posted a sign in front of the supermarket announcing that: “Coming soon — a Shop-Rite pharmacy.” Upon seeing the sign, Ronald Zukin, the president and sole shareholder of Thatcher’s contacted Joseph Greenblatt, the comptroller and vice-president of Consolidated. Mr. Zukin asked Mr. Greenblatt why the sign announcing the coming of a Shop-Rite pharmacy was in the window. Mr. Greenblatt responded, “We don’t want you in the dairy business,” referring to Thatcher’s recent selling of milk. After some discussion, Mr. Greenblatt said, “You get out of the dairy business and we won’t open a pharmacy.” Within a week, Thatcher’s removed the refrigeration case, and, in response, the supermarket removed the pharmacy announcement.</p>

Mr. Zukin was informed that Consolidated desired Thatcher’s space to use as a Shop-Rite pharmacy. As a result, Mr. Zukin located an alternative site for the pharmacy three blocks from the Shopping Center. Mr. Zukin, with his attorney, negotiated a lease at the new location, drew a deposit check, and was prepared to finalize the deal. Before finalizing that deal, Mr. Zukin had a conversation with Landlord and was advised that Consolidated had changed its mind <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>about taking Thatcher’s space and that a renewal would be offered to Thatcher’s.</p>
    <p id="b663-4" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[180,492,1157,525]]]'>When Mr. Zukin received the proposed renewal, he met with Mr. Greenblatt to seek assurances that Consolidated would not open a competing pharmacy. Mr. Zukin testified that Mr. Greenblatt’s direct response was, “We don’t hurt the little guys. We have no desire to want to hurt you and we have no intention of opening a pharmacy.” Mr. Greenblatt admitted in testimony that this meeting took place but denied making such a statement. Based on the assurances he received from Mr. Greenblatt, Mr. Zukin executed a ten-year renewal in late 1983.</p>
    <p id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.5",663,[181,1049,1156,580]]]'>Within the next year, Mr. Greenblatt became aware that Thatcher’s had a “Beverage Center” in front of its store. In response, a sign was again posted in the supermarket window announcing “Shop-Rite Pharmacy coming soon.” Again, Mr. Zukin contacted Mr. Greenblatt, who advised him that Consolidated did not want Thatcher’s to go into the soda business and, if Mr. Zukin would take his beverage center sign down, “we won’t be in the pharmacy business.” Within a few days, Mr. Zukin removed the beverage center sign and, immediately thereafter, the Shop-Rite pharmacy announcement was removed.</p>
    <p id="b663-6" data-blocks='[["BL_663.6",663,[180,1662,1157,424]]]'>In 1985, Consolidated secured the rental space immediately adjacent to the supermarket, on the side opposite of Thatcher’s. Thereafter, Consolidated removed the partition wall between the supermarket and the new space and secured the federal and state licenses necessary to operate a pharmacy. Aware of Consolidated’s imminent plans to open a pharmacy, Thatcher’s filed the instant action seeking to enjoin Consolidated from implementing its plans.</p>

The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on May 7 and <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>8, 1987. At the hearing, the breach of lease argument was rejected by the trial court and the oral contract theory was abandoned by Thatcher’s. The trial court ruled in favor of Thatcher’s on the grounds of equitable estoppel and entered a <em>decree nisi </em>enjoining Consolidated from operating a retail, prescription pharmacy on the premises of the West Goshen Shopping Center.</p>
    <p id="b664-4" data-blocks='[["BL_664.4",664,[269,763,1165,577]]]'>Consolidated filed exceptions to the trial court’s order claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Statute of Frauds<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> rendered any agreement between the parties unenforceable. In its “opinion sur exceptions,” the trial court upheld its decision on the basis of equitable estoppel but also determined that the Restatement of Property § 524<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> provided an applicable exception to the Statute of Frauds defense. The trial court denied Consolidated’s exceptions and entered a final order. On appeal, the Superior Court, like the trial court, determined that the Restatement of Property § 524 provided an applicable exception to the Statute of Frauds defense.</p>

Consolidated argues that the oral promise created an “easement.” However, this case does not involve an interest in land in the form of a negative easement.

At most, Consolidated made a covenant that it would not sell certain products. This is not analogous to the agreements that are conventionally referred to as negative easements. Negative easements are especially viewed as vehicles to assure the owner of the dominant estate that the owner of the servient estate will not interfere with the flow of air or light to, or the subjacent or lateral support of the dominant estate.

First, it was error for the trial court to conclude that, as a matter of law, Thatcher’s acted reasonably in relying on Consolidated’s representation that it did not intend to operate a pharmacy. Under the terms of its lease, Consolidated had a clear right to do so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Additionally, Thatcher’s lease specifically provided that any part of the shopping center already being used as a supermarket, which included Consolidated, was exempt from the clause prohibiting another store from selling drugs and medical supplies.</p>

Proceeding in such a manner would have memorialized the occasion and reduced the possibility that the terms of the agreement would be misunderstood. As a business entity operating in the commercial setting, Thatcher’s showed poor judgment when it decided to renew its ten-year lease and forgo its opportunity to relocate on the basis of an indefinitely worded promise uttered in an informal conversation with' a potential competitor.</p>

At that meeting, Zukin informed Greenblatt that: (1) he had been offered a new lease; (2) he had a lease at another location for ten years; and (3) he wanted assurances that Consolidated was not going to open a pharmacy. The trial court accepted Zukin’s testimony that Greenblatt replied, “we have no intention of opening a pharmacy.” (N.T. 5/7/87, Zukin, p. 27). Even accepting, as we must, that this is an accurate recounting of the discussion that occurred, it fails to reflect the degree of formality one would expect when business rivals operating in a commercial setting have rights at stake as important as the freedom to enter a new line of business and the choice of where to locate for a ten-year period of time. Despite the gravity of these matters, the record fails to reveal that the parties even so much as shook hands to formalize their agreement. This weighs against enforcing any promise.

Thatcher's states that its Complaint sets forth a claim for "promissory estoppel," but it was not so titled. Appellee's Brief at 26. Thatcher's submits that the Chancellor used the term “equitable estoppel" instead of "promissory estoppel” to refer to the theory upon which it sought relief.

Mr. Zukin asked Mr. Greenblatt why the sign announcing the coming of a Shop-Rite pharmacy was in the window, Mr. Greenblatt responded, “We don’t want you in the dairy business,” referring to Thatcher’s recent selling of milk. After some discussion, Mr. Greenblatt said, “You get out of the dairy business and we won’t open a pharmacy.” Within a week, Thatcher removed the refrigeration case, and, in response, the supermarket immediately removed the pharmacy announcement.</p>

As a result, Mr. Zukin located an alternative site for the pharmacy three blocks from the Shopping Center. Mr. Zukin, with his attorney, negotiated a lease at the new location, drew a deposit check, and was prepared to finalize the deal.

Mr. Zukin also testified that at the time of the meeting he was aware of Consolidated’s lease restriction concerning “non-food” items (i.e., not more than 20% of the selling space) and was aware that the supermarket as then constituted was at or near its “non-food” limits. <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>Based on the assurances he received from Mr. Greenblatt, Mr. Zukin executed a ten year renewal in late 1983.</p>

At the hearing, the breach of lease argument was rejected by the trial court and the oral contract theory was abandoned by Thatcher.
