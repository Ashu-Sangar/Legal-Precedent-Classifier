McNary, </em><a href="/us/454/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="454 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="6183919" data-case-paths="/us/454/0100-01">454 U.S. 100</a>, <a href="/us/454/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="454 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="6183919" data-case-paths="/us/454/0100-01">102 S.Ct. 177</a>, <a href="/us/454/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="454 U.S. 100" data-case-ids="6183919" data-case-paths="/us/454/0100-01">70 L.Ed.2d 271</a> (1981), specifically held that this federal action requires exhaustion of state administrative and judicial remedies due to the sensitive nature of state tax issues. It makes no sense to undercut the Court’s interpretation of federal law. Further, I believe that interests of comity<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> dictate that state courts defer to the federal framework carefully established by the United States Supreme Court, just as the federal court in <em>Fair Assessment </em>deferred to the state courts in fashioning a rule that would not disrupt a carefully fashioned state tax scheme. The majority’s approach creates the anomalous result of encouraging federal claimants to flock to state courts to pursue section 1983 actions, when the precise purpose of the federal rule is to ensure that state courts may deal with the matter under state law first.</p>
    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[235,1341,1163,574]]]'>Moreover, the majority’s approach virtually eliminates any opportunity for the state courts to examine the state tax scheme under the laws or Constitution of the Commonwealth. The precise concern for the sensitive nature of state tax schemes, which motivated the United States Supreme Court in <em>Fair Assessment, </em>should <em>a fortiori </em>motivate state courts to examine those schemes under state law first.
