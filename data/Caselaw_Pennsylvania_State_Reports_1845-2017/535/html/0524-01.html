Thus, the reward element as found in our cases is not present in these machines. The Commonwealth asserts that devices such as knock down switches and meters could easily be installed on the machines seized. We have held that it is the actual condition of the machine at the time it is confiscated that controls whether it is a gambling device. <em>Twelve Video Poker Machines </em>at 367, <a href="/pa/517/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="537 A.2d 812" data-case-ids="1809853,1809880" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0363-01,/pa/517/0362-01">537 A.2d at 814</a>.

    <p id="b719-5" data-blocks='[["BL_719.4",719,[195,790,1159,1326]]]'>Gambling has been defined as “the staking of money or any other thing of value on an uncertain event. It involves chance and a hope of gaining something beyond the amount played.” <em>P.L.E. Gambling and Lotteries, </em>§ 1 (1986) (citing <em>Black’s Law </em>Dictionary). “Gambling has been called a disease of barbarians, superficially civilized. In a legal frame of reference it is characterized in somewhat the same way, a play for value against an uncertain event in the hope of gaining something of value. Thus a gambling device is that which is utilized to facilitate the play for excess value.” <em>Beamel Amusement Corp. v. Police Dep’t of Suffolk County, </em><a href="/misc2d/54/0946-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="54 Misc. 2d 946" data-case-ids="1183977" data-case-paths="/misc2d/54/0946-01">54 Misc.2d 946</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=283%20N.Y.S.2d%20760" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="283 N.Y.S.2d 760">283 N.Y.S.2d 760</a>, 761 (1967). It is this hope of gaining something beyond the amount played which motivates people to gamble and creates the dangers associated with gambling. The machines as operated in the instant case do not present the traditional dangers associated with gambling. The players can never “break the house” because the games are carefully controlled so that the player never wins an amount of tokens equal to or greater than the amount he has played. Thus, the motivation for playing these machines is not “reward” but entertainment, as the player can never “win” anything other than a prize worth less than the amount he has played. The redeeming of tokens for prizes is ancillary to the machine’s entertainment purpose, and not a reward as contemplated by the law of this Commonwealth.</p>

Likewise, if the player cannot get any other return from the play except a return that is less than what he/she has played, the incentive to play must be recreational. While the players of the machines did receive a return, the tokens and prizes do not rise to the level of “reward” under our law. We agree with the appellants’ assertion that the redemptive token feature is not a reward for the purposes of gambling law in this Commonwealth because the player cannot win an amount of equal or greater value than the amount he placed in the machine.</p>

We agree with the Commonwealth that a redemptive token device might be used in a manner similar to a knock down switch. However, the mere fact that the redemptive token feature might be used in this manner does not satisfy the Commonwealth’s burden in this case. As discussed <em>supra, </em>a machine will be found a gambling device <em>per se </em>if it can be used for no other purpose but for gambling. <em>Two Electronic Poker Game Machines. </em>The reasoning behind our cases holding devices with knock down switches and meters are gambling devices <em>per se, </em>is that there is no legal use for these mechanisms on these machines. In contrast, the appellants in the present case have set forth a perfectly legal use of the redemptive token feature as a means of awarding prizes worth substantially less than the amount played. Thus, the presence of the redemptive token feature on a machine is not sufficient to make that machine a gambling device <em>per se. </em>Of course, this does not prevent the Commonwealth from prosecuting machine owners where there is evidence that the redemptive token feature is actually being used in an impermissible manner.</p>
