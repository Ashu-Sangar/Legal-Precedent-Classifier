    <p id="b634-12" data-blocks='[["BL_634.11",634,[254,1407,1162,530]]]'>This case arose out of the following set of facts. In January 1987, the Montgomery County Office of Children and Youth received a report of suspected child abuse alleging that R. sexually abused his daughter. A caseworker investigated the report by interviewing the child and her mother, but R. refused to be interviewed. The caseworker also obtained a psychiatric, psychological and medical evaluation of the child. Based upon the caseworker’s investigation, the Montgomery County Office of Children and Youth filed its report classifying the matter as “indicated” for child abuse.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Devlin presided over the final day of hearings. Hearing Examiner Devlin also issued the Adjudication and Recommendation that the request for expungement be denied. That report was adopted in full by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.</p>

The second is whether permitting his daughter to testify <em>in camera </em>denied R. any constitutional rights to confront a witness.

The answer to this question must take into account the two ways in- which the procedure could be implemented. One option is to use a closed circuit television to permit the child to testify outside the presence of the accused. However, this would not offer safeguards any greater than those provided by the procedure employed here. The only material difference with closed circuit television is that a video camera operator would take the place of the stenographer. There is no reason to think that this would have an effect on what the child said or how credibly she said it. As a result, the factual determination would be no more reliable than it already is.</p>

On balance, the procedures that were utilized created a very limited risk that R. would suffer an erroneous deprivation.

The absence of a federal due process violation will not always predetermine the disposition of a state due process claim. It does so in this case because reputation, the only interest at stake here, receives due process protections solely by virtue of its status as an interest recognized and protected by Pennsylvania law. <em>Paul v. Davis, </em><a href="/us/424/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="424 U.S. 693" data-case-ids="12027375" data-case-paths="/us/424/0693-01">424 U.S. at 710-11</a>, <a href="/us/424/0693-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="424 U.S. 693" data-case-ids="12027375" data-case-paths="/us/424/0693-01">96 S.Ct. at 1165</a>, 47 L.Ed.2d at 419. Thus, the weight that reputational interest carries in the <em>Matthews </em>analysis of the federal claim is strictly a reflection of the protections it enjoys under Pennsylvania law. As a result, the <em>Matthews </em>analysis would yield the same result irrespective of whether R.’s state or federal due process claim is being examined. That will not necessarily be the case if the interest being deprived is one that receives greater protections under our State Constitution than it does under the Federal Constitution. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sell, </em><a href="/pa/504/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="504 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="1787690" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0046-01">504 Pa. 46</a>, 63-64, <a href="/pa/504/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="504 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="1787690" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0046-01">470 A.2d 457</a>, 467 (1983) (reaffirming <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>the view that the Pennsylvania Constitution is an independent source of rights, and that it can provide greater protections than those guaranteed by the Federal Constitution).</p>
