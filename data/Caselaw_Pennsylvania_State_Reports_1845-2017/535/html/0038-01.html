Throughout both the guilt phase and the sentencing phase of the trial, appellant maintained his innocence. To have introduced evidence of appellant’s insanity or diminished capacity would have directly conflicted with appellant’s position of innocence. To plead the defense of insanity suggests that the defendant committed the act, but was not legally culpable. <em>Commonwealth v.

Although appellant was not correct in his statement that he would be eligible for parole if given a sentence of life imprisonment, the record reveals this to have been a calculated strategy on the part of appellant to evoke sympathy from the jury, and another example of appellant’s attempting to avoid responsibility for decisions he made regarding the objectives of his trial. Appellant chose to offer that testimony in the hope of engendering compassion from the jury. Now he would have us hold that his legal representatives were ineffective for adhering to their client’s choice. In addition, counsel discussed this misstatement with appellant upon the completion of his testimony; they decided in concert, that no harm had resulted, and that nothing should be done about it.</p>
    <p id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[261,1165,1164,204]]]'>Appellant’s misstatement did not undermine the validity of the penalty imposed. Moreover, counsel’s decision not to take action was rational. Therefore, appellant has not met the burden of proof necessary to grant relief under the PCRA.</p>
    <p id="b238-6" data-blocks='[["BL_238.6",238,[257,1402,1164,530]]]'>Appellant also asserts that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to object to and adequately preserve for review two issues regarding the trial court’s jury instructions. First, appellant contends that counsel were ineffective because they did not object to the trial court’s instruction to the jury that the Commonwealth’s expert witnesses were not permitted to examine petitioner until after the verdicts of guilty. Appellant’s petition maintains that this was an impermissible comment upon his silence in violation of Article 1, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Fifth Amendment.</p>
    <p id="b238-7" data-blocks='[["BL_238.7",238,[257,1958,1159,203]]]'>This argument is without merit. The instruction merely explains why the examinations were not performed by the doctors at an earlier time. It in no way suggests that appellant was asserting his right to remain silent.</p>
    <p id="b238-8" data-blocks='[["BL_238.8",238,[255,2186,1161,96]],["BL_239.1",239,[235,343,1152,98]]]'>Since the underlying argument is without merit, it would have been futile for appellant’s lawyers to object to the <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>instruction. Therefore, no ineffective assistance of counsel claim will stand based upon this argument.</p>
    <p id="b239-5" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[232,478,1155,259]]]'>Second, appellant asserts that counsel were ineffective because they failed to raise on appeal the question of whether the Court of Common Pleas erred by failing to instruct the jury in a manner consistent with 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(c)(1)(v). This section provides in relevant part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b239-6" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[275,755,1112,206]]]'>[T]he court may, in its discretion, discharge the jury if it is of the opinion that further deliberation will not result in a unanimous agreement as to the sentence, in which case the court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment.</blockquote>
    <p id="AFJ" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[232,985,1153,369]]]'>Again, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim based upon this issue is without merit. This particular section is intended to give guidance to the court in cases where a jury is unable to reach a verdict after having spent a period of time deliberating. Since a request to have this instruction read would have been denied, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to advance this argument.</p>
    <p id="b239-7" data-blocks='[["BL_239.7",239,[229,1381,1157,1012]]]'>Appellant contends that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to object to the verdict slip submitted to the jury. Appellant asserts that the verdict slip was constitutionally deficient because it did not require the jury to make findings as to mitigating circumstances. While we now require the verdict form to include a space for the jury to list mitigating circumstances, it was not required when appellant was sentenced. Pa.R.Crim.P. 358A. Moreover, we have held that the Sentencing Code does not require the jury to specify the mitigating circumstances it found. <em>Commonwealth v. Crispell, </em><a href="/pa/530/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="530 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1833067" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0234-01">530 Pa. 234</a>, <a href="/pa/530/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="530 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1833067" data-case-paths="/pa/530/0234-01">608 A.2d 18</a> (1992), citing <em>Commonwealth v. Carpenter, </em><a href="/pa/511/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="511 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1798690" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0429-01">511 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="511 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1798690" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0429-01">515 A.2d 531</a> (1986). Therefore, the verdict slip was adequate at the time of appellant’s sentencing, and any objection to the slip would have been denied. In addition, the adequacy of the verdict slip was addressed in appellant’s application for extraordinary relief, which was denied by this court. Again, his argument cannot sustain a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel since his underlying claim is without merit.</p>

      <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>Finally, appellant asserts that if we find that appellant’s death penalty hearing was defective, then a sentence of life imprisonment should be entered. We need not address this argument since we affirm the Court of Common Pleas decision denying appellant relief.</p>
