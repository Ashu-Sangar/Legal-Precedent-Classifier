I submit it is not race so much as it is the cultural complexities in our increasingly heterogeneous society which highlight a problem not newly presented. I fear no matter how many rules, guidelines, and the like a court might fashion, when a prospective juror characterized as a minority is challenged, it will be susceptible to the charge that race is a factor, and it well might be the case. The only certain way to completely sanitize the law in this regard is to abolish peremptory challenges altogether and permit only challenges for cause. I am not persuaded, however, to go that far. Peremptory challenges have been an accepted part of the jury selection process for a good number of years and do indeed serve a valid purpose; thus, I am content to deal with a difficult problem on a case by case basis as best can be, given the inherent nature of this type of challenge.</p>

I concluded by suggesting that “[instead of pushing our courts into the morass of trying to judge between explanations for the irrational, perhaps the system would be better served by abandoning the use of peremptory challenges altogether, trying cases before the first group of twelve jurors randomly chosen from the venire, and allowing only challenges for cause.” <em><a href="/pa/529/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="529 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1831180" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0066-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/529/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="529 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1831180" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0066-01">at 79</a>, <a href="/pa/529/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="529 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1831180" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0066-01">601 A.2d at 1222-23</a>.

This means that once a defendant has established a <em>prima facie </em>case of racially discriminatory peremptory challenges, the prosecutor must offer a reason that is either totally neutral, or, if it would have a racially disparate effect, he must show why this particular juror entertains the alleged bias. <em>See Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at -, <a href="/us/500/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="500 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="6223686" data-case-paths="/us/500/0352-01">111 S.Ct. at 1863</a>, <a href="/us/500/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="500 U.S. 352" data-case-ids="6223686" data-case-paths="/us/500/0352-01">114 L.Ed.2d at 413</a> ("We would face a quite different case if the prosecutor had justified his peremptory challenges with the explanation that he did not want Spanish-speaking jurors.

I see no problem with this prosecutor’s challenging the second African American juror because he was a retired school teacher. First, the prosecutor also challenged another teacher who was Caucasian. Moreover, a profession such as teaching is not overrepresented by minorities, and an exclusion based on that profession would not have a racially disparate effect. (If, however, the prosecutor was to exclude African American teachers but not Caucasian teachers, the above analysis would not apply.)</p>

The court actually held that the defendant had not made out a prima facie case of discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, thus according to the <em>Batson </em>scheme the prosecutor was not required to offer any explanation. Opinion at 1034. See also Reproduced Record at 19. As a precaution, however, the court accepted the prosecutor's offer to place his reasons for each peremptory challenge on the record. Opinion at 1034-1035. See also Reproduced Record at 13. For purposes of this appeal, the Commonwealth concedes that the defendant made out a prima facie case, and directs its argument to the legitimacy of the reasons offered by the prosecutor.</p>

Ironically, there would seem to be a potential for undermining the effectiveness of <em>Batson </em>by sanctioning wide ranging appellate review. If, for example, by case law the appellate courts were to decide on the "legitimacy” of certain reasons to strike a minority juror, attorneys could simply compile a list and recite one of the "approved” reasons while still subjectively intending a discriminatory purpose.</p>

It focused on the fact that the prosecutor could have determined the existence of actual bias of this type by asking routine questions on voir dire and then stricken such jurors for cause, thus preserving peremptory challenges for other use. Justice Marshall concluded that the prosecutor’s failure to do so suggested that this was not the real bias he sought to eliminate, that race was.</p>
