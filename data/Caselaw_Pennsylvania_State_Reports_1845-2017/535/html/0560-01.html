In that case, a motel cleaning woman alerted management that she had found suspicious items in a vacated room. The items consisted of a map of the front desk area and several one inch clear plastic bags. A state trooper happened to be in the manager’s office when the cleaning woman reported her discovery. The manager determined that no one was in the room and at about 12:20 p.m. he asked the trooper to enter. The noon checkout time had passed and the occupants of the room had not re-registered. The trooper observed the map and the plastic bags in plain view. He recognized the bags as the kind used for packaging small quantities of drugs. In the closet the trooper found a jacket with a protective bag over it, and after searching the jacket, he found a small bag which later was determined to contain cocaine. The trooper then telephoned the district attorney to secure a search warrant. At 12:45 p.m. the occupants of the room returned to the motel and re-registered for another night. Subsequently, the room was searched pursuant to the warrant, and Brundidge was arrested and charged, inter alia, with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Brundidge moved to suppress the controlled substance.</p>

Upon reflection, it is apparent that in the context of the Fourth Amendment, when a court deters police misconduct, it necessarily also safeguards privacy and the probable cause requirement. Why would a court deter police misconduct at all if not to deter police from improperly invading the right of persons to be secure, i.e., private, in their persons, houses, papers and effects? Deterring police misconduct is not an end in itself. The ultimate distinction, then, between the federal and the Pennsylvania analysis is not that the federal courts seek only to deter police misconduct and the Pennsylvania courts seek to protect certain rights, but that the federal courts place less importance than do we on the right of privacy. Therefore, they balance the interests differently and reach a different conclusion as to the relative importance of privacy as against securing criminal convictions.</p>

Only such limitations on the doctrine can effectively protect from the possibility that police might engage in misconduct without fear of consequence. While acknowledging the applicability of the “independent source doctrine” under these limited circumstances, I feel compelled to state clearly and unequivocally that the “independent source doctrine,” as an exception to the exclusionary rule, should not be allowed to swallow the rule itself. I fear, however, that this Court’s decision in <em>Brundidge </em>has already gone a long way toward sanctioning such a result.</p>

I am compelled to conclude that the application of the “independent source doctrine” in a situation where the “independent source” is not truly independent of both the tainted evidence itself and the officers involved in the initial illegal search will completely eviscerate the exclusionary rule, failing either to deter police misconduct or to protect individual privacy rights as required by Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>
