The minors were sitting in close proximity to numerous cans of beer, and, upon seeing the police, they attempted to shield the cans from view. Believing that underage drinking was taking place, police entered the home and conducted a search. They found many opened and unopened cans of beer, as well as a small bag of marijuana, marijuana seeds, and a pipe containing marijuana residue.</p>

Beer cans are not, however, a type of evidence that can be readily destroyed, as, for example, by flushing them down a drain or burning them. The risk of the cans being destroyed before a warrant could be obtained was, therefore, negligible. Further, if the minors attempted to leave the scene while in possession of the beer or in an intoxicated state, before a warrant was obtained, police could have taken action pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. § 6308 (mere possession of beer by a minor is an offense) or 18 Pa.C.S. § 5505 (public intoxication). Even if some of the minors had succeeded in fleeing from the scene, it must be remembered that “[o]ne of the prices we have to pay for the security which the Fourth Amendment bestows upon us is the risk that an occasional guilty party will escape.” <em>Commonwealth v.

In the case of the marijuana, marijuana seeds and the alcohol present in the beer cans, the evidence was “readily destructible.” In the case of the beer cans themselves and the drug paraphernalia, they were not “readily destructible” but were easily disposable. We have recognized not only the danger that evidence can be destroyed while officers are attempting to get a warrant, but also that evidence can be “secreted away” from the scene. <em>See Holzer, </em><a href="/pa/480/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="480 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1745027" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0093-01">480 Pa. at 102</a>, <a href="/pa/480/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="480 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1745027" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0093-01">389 A.2d at 106</a>.

The record reflects that as Officer Gehrmann spoke to Mr. Roland at the front door, various minors attempted to exit the house through the rear roof. Short of laying siege to the Roland house, it is inconceivable that the police could prevent the minors from exiting the house surreptitiously in the dark. It is also doubtful whether the police could stop them in any event. As the suppression court noted, it would be more unreasonable and outrageous to detain a house full of people until a warrant arrived. <em>See </em>R.R. at 23. The Majority suggests that if the minors attempted to escape, the police could arrest them pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6308 (possession of beer by a minor) or 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5505 (public intoxication). It is doubtful that the minors in question would attempt to flee the scene with incriminating evidence of their illegality so an arrest under § 6308 seems unlikely. As to the second contention, nothing in the record suggests that the minors were sufficiently intoxicated to support an arrest under § 5505.</p>

I see no reason why <em>Welsh </em>should require courts to pre-empt this balancing except in cases involving non-criminal, non-jailable offenses.

    <p id="b799-5" data-blocks='[["BL_799.4",799,[171,814,1159,682]]]'>In the instant case, the police had probable cause to believe the following had occurred at the Roland house: (1) a violent assault on Edward Maxwell; (2) drug possession and use; (3) furnishing alcohol to minors; and (4) underage drinking. None of the above-mentioned offenses are felonies; the first three are misdemeanors and the last is a summary offense. However, I believe it premature to deem these misdemeanors “minor” and end the analysis. These misdemeanors are serious in nature as they involve violent crime and/or the welfare of children. I think it best to proceed to the next step and weigh the privacy interest of the defendant, keeping in mind the nature of the offense to determine whether the warrant-less search was reasonable.</p>

The police walked up to the defendant’s home and knocked on his front door with the intention of asking him some questions. The police have the right to knock on the front door of a residence co-extensive with the right of anyone else, be it a neighbor, salesman or pollster. <em>See United States v.

When Mr. Roland opened his door he was exposing the illegal conduct to the world. The police saw no more than anyone knocking at his door would have seen.

In fact, the violation at issue in <em>Welsh </em>was the petitioner’s second violation of the statute in five years subjecting him to potential imprisonment of up to a year. Thus, the petitioner was actually charged with a criminal misdemeanor. The Court minimized the criminal nature of the petitioner's conduct by finding that the police had probable cause at the time of the search to only believe that the petitioner was a first time offender subject to the non-jailable traffic offense. <em>See Welsh, </em><a href="/us/466/0740-01" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="466 U.S. 740" data-case-ids="6205546" data-case-paths="/us/466/0740-01">466 U.S. at </a>746 n. 6, <a href="/us/466/0740-01" class="citation" data-index="148" data-cite="466 U.S. 740" data-case-ids="6205546" data-case-paths="/us/466/0740-01">104 S.Ct. at </a>2096 n. 6.</p>
