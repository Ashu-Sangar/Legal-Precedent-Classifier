The plan includes a provision known as SWB, which provides that employees with two or more years of continuous service will receive thirty-two hours pay for any week in which they are scheduled to work less than thirty-two hours. SWB payments are made from the plan trust fund, which is funded solely by employer contributions and are subject to income tax by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>

Because he worked less than thirty-two hours and was otherwise eligible for SWB, he was provided payment from the plan trust fund for an additional twenty-three hours in the amount of $892.42. During the same week in question, William Covey, III, worked eight hours for which he earned gross wages of $86.00.

Thorpe’s Employer’s Notice of Application filed with OES indicated in item C(3) that the reason for the separation was that the department shut down. However, in item D(2) of the same form, he indicated that the separation was temporary and the expected recall date was May 10, 1989. Similarly, Covey’s Employer’s Notice of Application indicated in item D(2) that the separation was temporary due to a breakdown. OES denied these claims.

Specifically, the referees found that Charles E. Thorpe, Jr. and William Covey, III could not be considered unemployed because their actual earnings of $107.28 and $86.00, respectively, when combined with their SWB payments of $392.42 and $346.16, respectively, were greater than the unemployment compensation benefit rate of $266.00 for which they would have otherwise been entitled to, plus a partial benefit credit of $107.00.</p>

The only relevant inquiry, according to Judge Palladino, was whether the employees were employed under the Act. Judge Palladino reasoned that the requirement that work be performed before SWB are dispensed distinguishes the SWB in this case from the SUB involved in <em>Hargenrader. </em>This interpretation, according to Judge Palladino, is consistent with the policy of the Act which is set forth in Section 752.

    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.5",324,[264,1353,1161,363]]]'>Equally tortured to me is the majority’s suggestion that a “marked difference” exists between the Supplemental Unemployment Benefits (SUB) (payments made for no work during a 32 hour work week) and these SWB benefits. Both are designed to provide compensation to employees who are without work through no fault of their own and are not payments for services performed.</p>
    <p id="b324-6" data-blocks='[["BL_324.6",324,[263,1738,1162,417]]]'>The majority holds that these employees are ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits because of the fiction that they were remunerated. In reality, these employees did not work and should be allowed to apply for unemployment compensation under the Unemployment Compensation statute and then to have their SWB payments adjusted pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement that Appellant and the employees entered into freely.</p>
    <p id="b324-7" data-blocks='[["BL_324.7",324,[262,2177,1158,152]]]'>Accordingly, I dissent and would affirm the Opinion and Order of the Commonwealth Court which clearly and distinctly analyzes the issue.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b324-8" data-blocks='[["BL_324.8",324,[306,2381,783,42]]]'>CAPPY, J., joins this dissenting opinion.</p>
