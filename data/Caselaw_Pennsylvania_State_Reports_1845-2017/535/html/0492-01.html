The transaction took place though a three inch hole in the door of the abandoned storefront where appellant was engaged in the sale of drugs. Heavy metal grates covered the windows of the building, and the door through which the exchange was transacted was barricaded. The police had been alerted by an anonymous informant that such an operation, termed a gate house<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>, was being carried on at that location, and had gone there armed with the marked money to investigate.</p>

He handed the money through the hole in the door, and in return received from a source who was never in view, a heat-sealed plastic bag containing a white powder. The officer retreated to his vehicle, and waited for fifteen minutes for reinforcements. Police gained access to the building, after announcing themselves and receiving no response except thumping and rustling noises from within, by breaking the door in half, the barricades being impervious to ordinary force.</p>

Although there were two people present in one or two rooms on the upper floors of the building and three people other than appellant found in the storefront area, the store area was clearly not in use, and according to police description was uninhabitable. In a back room, police discovered appellant, identifiable only by the presence of the dye and of the marked ten dollar note in his pocket, in a makeshift bed, with a woman showing traces of blue dye on her body. On the floor stood a bucket containing human waste. Other than his bedmate, appellant was the only occupant of the building marked with the dye.

Therefore, before examining appellant’s argument, we must first analyze its unspoken predicate, that a showing of exigent circumstances was necessary because appeliant possessed a reasonable and legitimate, and thus constitutionally protected, privacy interest in the premises. Without such expectation of privacy, police entry into the store front would have constituted no intrusion, and the exigent circumstances which are posited to justify police action need not be advanced. Although both the trial court and the Superior Court plurality found that there were exigent circumstances, this conclusion followed upon a prior, determination that appellant held no reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy such as would activate his rights under Article 1, Section 8.

Without such a showing we cannot assume that the storefront provided appellant with the same expectation of privacy as would a residence, particularly since the residence address appellant gave to police upon arrest was not that of the storefront. We must, therefore, examine the expectation of <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>privacy he might have had where he was found. More critically, we must examine what, if any, expectations of privacy would be constitutionally “justifiable” in appellant’s situation. <em>Hudson v.
