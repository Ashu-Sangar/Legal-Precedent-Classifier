County Committee rules shall not be inconsistent with the State Democratic Rules and those rules state, in Rule VII, that the State Executive Committee shall have authority to make and certify a nomination for the Office of Representative in the General Assembly. Thus, section 2779 authorizes the political parties to nominate in accordance with the party rules relating to filling vacancies for the Office of Representative in the General Assembly, and the State Democratic Rules govern filling that vacancy. Moreover, the Bucks County Democratic Party Rules shall not be inconsistent with the State Democratic Rules.</p>

This argument is clearly without merit. The State Democratic Party Rule applicable to the nomination and certification process to fill vacancies for the Office of Representative in the General Assembly is the rule that governs this matter.
