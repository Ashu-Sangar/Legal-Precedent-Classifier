Appellant, armed with this hammer and a kitchen knife, first went to the bedroom of his sleeping mother-in-law, Donna, and hammered her three times in the head and then slit her throat and face with the knife, killing her. Leaving her blood-soaked body, he turned his attention to Donna’s two-year-old baby, Lance. Lance was <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>bludgeoned to death with the hammer, which Appellant used on the left side of the child’s head at least five times until he bled through the mattress and onto the bedroom floor.</p>

Neither child survived. Rockelle, the youngest child, however, was spared and placed by Appellant unharmed in the living room, where he and little Rockelle waited eleven hours, or until noon, for Valerie’s return.</p>

Once Valerie was inside the house, however, Appellant went to Tina’s car and told her that Valerie would give her the slacks later that day and Tina left. Appellant then hammered Valerie to death, tied a green plastic bag over her head to gather the blood and added her lifeless body to the carnage, placing it beside the body of Jasmine, whose corpse had been covered with a white sheet and pillows.</p>

At the degree of guilt hearing, the autopsy reports were admitted into evidence to establish that the victims’ deaths were homicides.
