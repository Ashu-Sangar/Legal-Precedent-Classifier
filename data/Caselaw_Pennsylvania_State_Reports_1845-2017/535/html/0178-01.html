The Commonwealth is before us seeking to keep respondents in prison pending retrial, on first degree murder charges, for the slaying. It contends that this remains a capital case, and therefore, respondents are not entitled to bail. We agree.</p>
    <p id="b372-7" data-blocks='[["BL_372.6",372,[246,929,1161,474]]]'>Evidence from respondents’ first trial established that Martorano and Daidone recruited Willard Moran to kill McCullough, planned the execution, assisted in its preparation, and helped Moran flee from the murder scene. Respondents wanted McCullough killed because he was organizing a new union in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which would have competed with an existing union controlled by organized crime. At the time of the murder, Respondent Daidone was vice-president of the existing union, Local 54.</p>

Following a sentencing hearing, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict as to penalty for either respondent; therefore, pursuant to Section 9711(c)(l)(v) of the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9701 et seq., the trial judge imposed sentences of life in prison. After being awarded a new trial by the Superior Court on appeal, respondents petitioned the lower court to set bail. That court denied the petition on March 10, 1992, because the Commonwealth had not yet exhausted its appeal rights. After this court denied the Commonwealth’s allocatur petition, respondents again sought bail in March, 1993. The Commonwealth opposed bail, arguing that respondents were not entitled to release because they could be sentenced to death if convicted upon retrial. The trial court disagreed, and ruled that imposition of life sentences in the first trial precluded imposition of the death penalty upon retrial. The court then set bail at $2,000,000 for Martorano and $1,500,000 for <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>Daidone, and imposed non-monetary conditions of bail as well.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After the trial court set bail and denied the Commonwealth’s petition to stay respondents’ release pending appellate review, the Commonwealth filed a Petition for Review of Bail Order and Revocation of Bail and sought a stay from the Superior Court, which granted a temporary stay pending a hearing on the Commonwealth’s petition. Argument was heard on April 12, 1993. On April 22, 1993, shortly before 5:00 p.m., the Superior Court issued a per curiam order vacating the stay of respondents’ release, and denying the Commonwealth’s petition. The court entered the order “without prejudice to the Commonwealth’s position that the proceedings are capital in nature”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>On April 23, 1993, the Commonwealth came to this court, seeking an emergency stay of respondents’ release. Following argument before Chief Justice Nix and Justice Montemuro, a temporary stay was entered pending argument before the court <em>en bane. </em>On May 5, 1993, the court had before it two petitions filed by the Commonwealth: 1) a Petition for Stay of Respondents’ Release, and 2) a Petition <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>for Review of the Bail Order of the Lower Court. Counsel for both sides advanced arguments in favor of or in opposition to the entry of a stay, and argued the issue of whether the Commonwealth could seek the death penalty upon retrial. Following argument, the court entered an order continuing the stay entered on April 23, 1993.</p>

This was an abuse of discretion. As stated above, the issue on appeal was whether the Commonwealth is precluded from seeking the death penalty on retrial.

Respondents have both the motive and the means to flee. Absent a stay, they would be free on bail when receiving our decision whether they would be facing the death penalty upon retrial. This possibility of being sentenced to death provides a significant incentive to flee. As noted in <em>Truesdale, supra, </em>the framers of our constitution recognized the virtual certainty of flight in the face of a possible death penalty. Here, ties to La Cosa Nostra effectively ensure that respondents have access to unlimited funds and other means necessary for escape. There is no amount of cash bail sufficient to deter flight in this case. Likewise, none of the non-monetary conditions of bail imposed by the trial court can adequately insure against flight. Respondents’ submission to electronic monitoring is no guarantee that they will not flee; at most, it can only alert law enforcement authorities to their flight after they are gone. Since the monitoring equipment is manned only during the day, respondents could flee during the night and their absence would not even be noted until the following morning. Finally, both respondents are aware that the Commonwealth has two <em>new </em>witnesses who, upon retrial, will testify that the murder of McCullough was a contract killing ordered by Philadelphia’s organized crime family.</p>

At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge again sentenced the defendants to death, finding both aggravating circumstances. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld the death penalty, concluding that there was sufficient evidence of “pecuniary gain”.

Since it made no decision, there could not in fact be any “acquittal on the merits.” Nor did the imposition of a life sentence by the trial judge operate as an acquittal. Under Pennsylvania’s sentencing scheme, the judge has no discretion to fashion sentence once he finds that the jury is deadlocked. The statute directs him to enter a life sentence. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(v) ( ... if ... further deliberation will not result in a unanimous agreement as to the sentence, ... the court <em>shall </em>sentence the defendant to life imprisonment.)

Likewise, there is no justification for presuming vindictiveness if respondents are reconvicted and choose to be sentenced by a judge. In the first trial, the judge exercised no discretion in imposing sentence. Respondents were awarded a new trial because of prosecutorial misconduct, not because of any error committed by the court.

The Commonwealth has stated that it is pursuing the death penalty based upon three aggravating circumstances: killing for hire, 42 Pa. <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>C.S. § 9711(d)(2); killing committed while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); and creating a grave risk of death to another, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7). It has also made an offer of proof regarding the evidence that it intends to introduce in support of the designated aggravating circumstances. The constitutional requirement of "proof evident” to deny bail is satisfied.</p>

Even if we were to conclude that the procedural rules do not give the court jurisdiction over the substantive issue, we could assume jurisdiction of the case pursuant to our King’s Bench Powers, 42 Pa.C.S. § 726, in order to conserve judicial resources, speed the subsequent retrial in this case and provide guidance to the lower courts on a question that is likely to recur. <em>Commonwealth v.

Missouri law, like Pennsylvania law, contains substantive standards to guide the discretion of the sentencer, and affords procedural safeguards to the convicted defendant to ensure that the death penalty is imposed only where there are aggravating circumstances sufficient to warrant such an extreme punishment. When the state is seeking the death penalty, the prosecution has the burden of proving the existence of aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. If the jury is unable to agree, the statute compels imposition of the sentence of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 434-35, <a href="/us/451/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="451 U.S. 430" data-case-ids="6187109" data-case-paths="/us/451/0430-01">101 S.Ct. at 1856</a>.</p>
