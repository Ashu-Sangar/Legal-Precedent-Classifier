        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Tyrone Davis, was convicted by a jury of murder in the second degree. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to a term of six to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nThis appeal arises from the homicide of Vanessa Davis, wife of appellant, on November 12, 1972, in Philadelphia.\nThe facts surrounding this homicide and confession are as follows: On November 12, 1972, appellant\u2019s wife was found dead of multiple stab wounds. Pursuant to the investigation of this homicide, appellant was interviewed at the Police Administration Building on November 12, 1972, the night of the homicide, and again on January 13, 1973. Detective Brown, who was in charge of the investigation, testified that the interviews with appellant were for the purpose of obtaining background information on his wife. At the end of each interview, appellant was allowed to return to his home. On March 29, 1973, at 7:00 a. m., the police arrived at the residence of appellant and asked to speak to him. Appellant was taken to the Police. Administration Building, arriving at 7:25 a. m. The police took appellant into an interrogation room, warned him of his Miranda, rights, and at 7:45 a. m. appellant confessed the homicide of his wife.\nAppellant first argues that his confession should have been suppressed because it was the product of an illegal arrest. Assuming arguendo that appellant was illegally arrested, we are nevertheless of the opinion that appellant\u2019s confession was admissible, because the confession was not the product of the illegal arrest, but rather an independent act of his own free will.\nThe testimony of appellant establishes the reason for his confession was not police interrogation; rather, it was his own sense of remorse. Appellant\u2019s confession shows in two instances that remorse or conscience motivated his confession rather than his alleged illegal arrest. In his formal confession, appellant told police that he was confessing \u201cbecause it is bothering me. I want to get it off my mind.\u201d At trial, appellant contested the voluntariness of his confession, but the jury resolved the issue against him. Finding the motivation for appellant\u2019s confession as being his own remorse rather than the police interrogation, we find his confession was voluntary. Cf. Commonwealth v. Daniels, 455 Pa. 522, 317 A.2d 237 (1974). See also Commonwealth v. Bishop, 425 Pa. 175, 228 A.2d 661 (1967).\nAppellant next argues that the court erred in permitting the district attorney to cross-examine him regarding a statement that he made to his mother-in-law related to his want of affection for his deceased wife. We do not agree. Evidence tending to show want of affection for one\u2019s wife is admissible to show motive on the part of the husband charged with the homicide of his wife. See Commonwealth v. Littlejohn, 433 Pa. 336, 250 A.2d 811 (1969) and Commonwealth v. Westwood, 324 Pa. 289, 188 A. 304 (1936). Having found the above testimony relevant, we also find no error in the district attorney\u2019s reference to the evidence in his closing argument to the jury.\nAppellant argues, based on our decision in Commonwealth v. McCusker, 448 Pa. 382, 292 A.2d 286 (1972), that since he introduced psychiatric evidence which tended to prove that he acted out of the heat of passion at the time he murdered his wife, the homicidej as a matter of law, could rise no higher than voluntary manslaughter. We do not agree. In McCusker, supra, we held that psychiatric evidence was admissible only to show that a person acted out of the heat of passion at the time he committed the homicide, but that psychiatric evidence, like any other evidence, was for the jury to consider and to determine what weight it should be given. In the instant case, the jury obviously rejected the psychiatric testimony presented by appellant and they were, therefore, left with ample evidence to convict appellant of murder in the second degree.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joins.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Significantly, the alleged illegality does not question the veracity of the contents of the confession.",

        "text": "ROBERTS, Justice\n(dissenting).\nThe majority\u2019s misunderstanding of the doctrine of \u201cthe fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d has led it to approve a blatant violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights. Appellant\u2019s confession was the product of an illegal arrest and thus should not have been admitted into evidence. Therefore, I dissent.\nIt is a fundamental right of every person to be free from arrest unless there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime. U.S.Const, amend. IV; Pa. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, P.S. In this case, appellant\u2019s right was violated. As the trial court concluded in overruling appellant\u2019s post-trial motions,\n\u201c[W]hen the police officers took the defendant in a police patrol car to homicide headquarters for questioning, probable cause for arrest did not exist and the arrest was therefore unlawful. At that time, the police were acting solely on the basis of an anonymous \u2018tip\u2019 . .\nIt is equally fundamental that evidence, including confessions, that is a product of an unlawful arrest is not admissible in a criminal trial. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). The majority concludes that appellant\u2019s confession was nevertheless admissible. Finding the \u201creason\u201d or \u201cmotivation\u201d for appellant\u2019s confession to be \u201cremorse or conscience,\u201d the majority apparently determines that it is \u201c \u2018sufficiently an act of free will,\u2019 . . . despite the illegality of the arrest.\u201d Commonwealth v. Bishop, 425 Pa. 175, 183, 228 A.2d 661, 666 (1967); see Wong Sun v. United States, supra, 371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 416. This is fundamentally wrong.\nCourts have always been suspicious of claims of \u201cacts of free will\u201d in the context of custodial interrogation following an illegal arrest. See, e. g., Wong Sun v. United States, supra, at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 416; cf. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Thus, this Court has adhered to the view that a significant objective criterion in determining that a confession is not tainted by an illegal arrest is proof of\n\u201cthe intervention of other circumstances subsequent to an illegal arrest which provide a cause so unrelated to that initial illegality that the [confession] may not reasonably be said to have derived from, and thereby tainted by, that illegal arrest.\u201d\nPennsylvania ex rel. Craig v. Maroney, 348 F.2d 22, 29 (3d Cr. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1019, 86 S.Ct. 1966, 16 L.Ed.2d 1042 (1966); see Commonwealth v. Jackson, 459 Pa. 669, 676 n. 6, 331 A.2d 189, 192 n. 6 (1975); Commonwealth v. Richards, 458 Pa. 455, 327 A.2d 63, 68 (1974); Betrand Appeal, 451 Pa. 381, 389, 303 A.2d 486, 490 (1973); Commonwealth v. Bishop, supra, 425 Pa. at 183 n. 7, 228 A.2d at 666 n. 7.\nIn those cases in which we have held that a confession was purged of the taint of an illegal arrest, we pointed to the intervention of some causal factor, such as the accusation of an alleged accomplice, that is independent of the primary illegality. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Wright, 460 Pa. 247, 252, 332 A.2d 809, 811 (1975); Commonwealth v. Fogan, 449 Pa. 552, 557, 296 A.2d 755, 758 (1972); Commonwealth v. Marabel, 445 Pa. 435, 448, 283 A.2d 285, 291 (1971); cf. Commonwealth v. Richards, supra, 458 Pa. at 466-468, 327 A.2d at 68-69. Factors that are not independent of the arrest, such as the passage of time or police interrogation, have never been held to suffice to render a confession free of taint. See Commonwealth v. Jackson, supra; Commonwealth v. Daniels, 455 Pa. 552, 317 A.2d 237 (1974); Betrand Appeal, supra; Commonwealth v. Brown, 451 Pa. 395, 301 A.2d 876 (1973) (opinion announcing the judgment of the Court).\nNo such intervening independent circumstances are present in this case. Appellant\u2019s confession was preceded by nothing but arrest and interrogation. To say that appellant suffered \u201cremorse\u201d and confessed as a result is merely to say that his will was overborne by interrogation. Unless the Commonwealth can point to some independent intervening circumstances that caused \u201cremorse\u201d or desire to confess, any such \u201cmotivation\u201d can be attributed to nothing but the illegal arrest and consequent custody. In short, absent some independent intervening cause, the \u201cremorse or conscience\u201d that leads to a confession is itself the fruit of the illegal arrest. By no stretch of the imagination can it be called an independent cause of the confession.\nFurthermore, the majority ignores our settled test of \u201can act of free will.\u201d In Commonwealth v. Bishop, supra, Mr. Justice Eagen wrote for the Court:\n\u201cBy \u2018sufficiently an act of free will,\u2019 we mean that not only was the confession truly voluntary, but also free of any element of coerciveness due to the unlawful arrest.\u201d\n425 Pa. at 183, 228 A.2d at 666 (emphasis original; footnote omitted). A demonstration of mere voluntariness is not sufficient. \u201c \u2018 \u201c [I] f a mere showing that a confession during a period of unlawful detention was \u2018voluntary\u2019 were sufficient to establish its admissibility, Wong Sun would be an empty promise, for the inadmissibility of \u2018involuntary\u2019 confessions has long been fully recognized.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Whitaker, 461 Pa. 407, 336 A.2d 603, 608 (1975), quoting Betrand Appeal, supra, 451 Pa. at 391-92, 303 A.2d at 491.\nIn this case, the majority merely concludes that appellant\u2019s confession was \u201cvoluntary.\u201d It does not even attempt to demonstrate (because it could not) that the confession was \u201cfree of any element of coerciveness due to the unlawful arrest.\u201d\nBecause the Commonwealth has failed to establish that appellant\u2019s confession was free of the taint of his illegal arrest and detention, I would reverse the judgment of sentence and grant him a new trial.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this dissent.\nIn its ruling on appellant\u2019s post-trial motions, the trial court stated:\n\u201cIn many [homicide] cases proper investigation requires interrogation of persons against whom probable cause for arrest has not been established but who are, nevertheless, suspects, or at least material witnesses, In our view, in light of the importance to the public of solving cases of murder, the right of the police to question such persons within proper safeguards outweighs the absolute right of the individual to be free from such interrogation-in the absence of probable cause for arrest.\u201d\nThis breathtaking assertion is nothing less than a repudiation of the Fourth Amendment as it applies to arrests. It is absolutely fundamental to our scheme of liberty that the State is prohibited from depriving a person of his liberty, even if only for investigation, unless there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime.\n\u201c[T]o argue that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the investigatory stage is fundamentally to misconceive the purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Investigatory seizures would subject unlimited numbers of innocent persons to the harassment and ignominy incident to involuntary detention. Nothing is more clear than that the Fourth Amendment was meant to prevent wholesale intrusions upon the personal security of our citizenry, whether these intrusions be termed \u2018arrests\u2019 or \u2018investigatory detentions.\u2019 \u201d\nDavis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 726-27, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 1397, 22 L.Ed.2d 676 (1969) (footnote omitted); see also Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975). Exceptions to the requirement of probable cause before detention for investigation' are limited in number and very circumscribed in scope, see, e. g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).\nIn support of its view, the trial court stated that the requirement of probable cause wrongfully deprives the police of the opportunity \u201cto make what they consider necessary and reasonable investigations of homicides,\u201d adding:\n\u201cFrom our experience, we conclude that many police officers do not know that probable cause for arrest is a legal mandate and believe that they have the right to \u2018take in for investigation\u2019 suspects, even in less serious cases.\u201d\nIt would be the complete destruction of our constitutional liberties to find justification for the deprivation of rights in the ignorance of the police; of course it is not a justification. Ignorance of rights is not even a defense in a civil proceeding seeking damages for the violation of rights, see Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 321, 95 S.Ct. 992, 1000, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975) (\u201c[A]n act violating a student\u2019s constitutional rights can be no more justified by ignorance or disregard of settled, indisputable law . than by the presence of actual malice.\u201d).\nIn addition, I am unwilling to accept the proposition that the police are ignorant of basic constitutional guarantees. Large sums of public money have been spent in educating police forces. See, e. g., L. Schwartz & S. Goldstein, Police Guidance Manual No. 4: Patrol \u2014 Frisk\u2014Arrest (Philadelphia, 1968), the preparation of which was financed by the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance, United States Department of Justice.",
