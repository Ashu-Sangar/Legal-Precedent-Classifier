        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nAppellant, Byron Collins, was tried and convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree for the killing of one Richard Johnson. Post-verdict motions were denied and this appeal followed.\nIn his post-verdict motions, appellant contended that the conduct of the prosecutor throughout the trial deprived the appellant of a fair trial because of the prejudicial effect the prosecutor\u2019s conduct had on the jury. The court en banc, with one member dissenting, agreed that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was on many occasions \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201ccensurable,\u201d but denied relief, holding that the misconduct and improprieties constituted harmless error.\nIn this appeal, the prosecution admits that, the conduct of the prosecutor during the trial was reprehensible and censurable. The prosecution also admits that \u201c[f]or many of the remarks there can be no rational justification. . . .\u201d The only issue before us, therefore, is whether the admitted misconduct of the prosecutor was harmless error. We conclude that it was not.\nIn recent years, this Court has had the unfortunate duty to consider allegations of improper prosecutorial trial conduct on several occasions. In Commonwealth v. Potter, 445 Pa. 284, 285 A.2d 492 (1971), we reversed appellant\u2019s conviction and granted a new trial saying,\n\u201cThis Court has made clear \u2018 . . . that the prosecuting attorney enjoys an office of unusual responsibility, and that his trial conduct should never be vindictive or attempt in any manner to influence the jury by arousing their prejudices.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)\nId. at 287, 285 A.2d 493-494.\nIn Commonwealth v. Revty, 448 Pa. 512, 295 A.2d 300 (1972), we reversed appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence and granted a new trial saying,\n\u201cthe district attorney is a quasi-judicial officer, representing the Commonwealth, which seeks no victims, but only justice; . . .\u201d\n[A] society cannot permit its agent to attempt to prejudice the minds of the jury against the accused by making wholly unsupported inferences that the accused deliberately deceived the jury.\u201d\nId. at 516 and 517, 295 A.2d at 302.\nAgain in Commonwealth v. Toth, 455 Pa. 154, 314 A.2d 275 (1974), appellant was granted a new trial because the district attorney \u201ceither intentionally or because of a lack of knowledge of the rules of evidence, misled the jury.\u201d Id. at 157, 314 A.2d at 277. See also Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, 455 Pa. 525, 317 A.2d 205 (1974).\nIn all of these opinions, we referred to the ABA Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function. These standards recognize that \u201c[t]he prosecutor is both an administrator of justice and an advocate; he must exercise sound discretion in the performance of his functions,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice, not merely to convict.\u201d ABA Standards, Prosecution function, supra, \u00a7 1.1(b), and \u00a7 1.1(c).\nSection 5.8 of the Standards deals with the prosecution\u2019s argument to the j ury. It provides:\n(a) The prosecutor may argue all reasonable inferences from evidence in the record. It is unprofessional conduct for the prosecutor intentionally to misstate the evidence or mislead the jury as to the inferences it may draw.\n(b) It is unprofessional conduct for the prosecutor to express his personal belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence or the guilt of the defendant.\n(c) The prosecutor should not use arguments calculated to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury.\n(d) The prosecutor should refrain from argument which would divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence, by injecting issues broader than the guilt or innocence of the accused under the controlling law, or by making predictions of the consequences of the jury\u2019s verdict.\nThough there is no dispute in this case that the misconduct of the prosecutor was most serious, we have reviewed our recent decisions because they clearly indicate that the misconduct of a prosecutor may have serious consequences in unfairly influencing the jury and depriving the accused of a fair trial. In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct began with his opening address to the jury and continued throughout the trial until he had completed his closing argument. The record of the trial in this case is over 1,000 pages long. A reading of the record discloses that the misconduct of the prosecutor was not limited to isolated moments of error in the heat of trial advocacy. The record is replete with instances of prosecutorial misconduct which permit only one reasonable conclusion: from the very beginning of the trial, the prosecutor adopted a strategy calculated to try the case on his own terms rather than within the rules of evidence and the standards of professional conduct. He attempted to divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence. He appealed to the passions and prejudices of the jury. He attempted to curry favor with the jury by being overly solicitous of their need to obtain the truth. He responded to defense objections, most of which were sustained, by constantly indicating that defense counsel was using delaying tactics. He said to the jury in referring to defense witnesses \u201cI don\u2019t know which liar you want to believe.\u201d He dramatically portrayed for the jury what a slow and painful death the victim must have suffered if he had to lie a number of hours after he was shot in the mud and rain. He injected his own personal opinions about the cruelty inflicted on one who has had to \u201clie with his face in the mud, with the rain coming down, without a blessed soul there to put their hand on his shoulder and say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it; everything will be all right,\u2019 even though he was dying . . . . \u201d\nHe persisted throughout the trial in trying the appellant as a heroin pusher even though this was not an issue of fact in the trial, and even though the appellant admitted his occupation when he took the stand. Even though the appellant was on trial for murder, he told the jury \u201cthere comes a time when you either push justice or indirectly you push the filth that is heroin . . . \u201d He called the crime a \u201cclassic, vicious, violent first-degree murder\u201d and told the jury they had to have \u201ccourage\u201d to say yes to a first degree murder verdict. He told the jury to \u201clet the message go out into the community that the citizens which we all are will not put up with \u2018this kind of viciousness and violence.\u2019 \u201d\nHe constantly made it appear that the defense counsel were not trying the case properly. He spoke to the jury about the \u201csmoke screen\u201d being put up by defense counsel, who were, according to the prosecutor, only attempting \u201cto throw mud in the eyes of the jurors.\u201d He then compared the mud allegedly being thrown by defense counsel to the mud that the victim \u201chad to lie in and die.\u201d\nHe told the jury that in most homicide cases which he had tried, he was always able to find \u201csomewhere inside some sorrow, some pity for the defendant.\u201d He also said, however, that \u201cthis is the first case I have ever had where I have reached inside myself and I have tried to pull up some kind of concern or pity for the defendant, and I can\u2019t find it.\u201d\nOn many occasions throughout the trial, the court admonished the prosecutor. The prosecutor\u2019s conduct occasioned, at various times during the trial, the following remarks from the court:\n\u201cWhat you are saying, in effect, is that we can disregard the rules of evidence.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you always appeal to the jury and say the jury is entitled to. The jury is entitled to hear only relevant testimony. I wish you would stop making those remarks.\u201d\n\u201c . . . I do direct the district attorney not to interpose these side remarks, particularly your remark that these witnesses know each other. It was completely uncalled for.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your suggestions except at the bar-side.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t characterize every objection as a delaying tactic. He has a right to object.\u201d\n\u201cI have asked what you intend to prove and you have avoided me . . . \u201d\n\u201cThere you go again, avoiding my question. You have avoided it twice. Are you going to avoid it a third time?\u201d\n\u201cThere you go again.\u201d\n\u201cOff on a tangeant [sic], as you always do.\u201d\n\u201cI feel that way strongly. You say, T have a right to cross-examination,\u2019 with a tone as though it is unlimited, not under the control of the Court. It is under the control of the Court . . . But you can\u2019t divert the trial into a long exploration of the drug traffic.\u201d\n\u201cThere you go again, twisting something. You\u2019re twisting what we were just discussing into something else.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t subject this jury to matters that are irrelevant.\u201d\n\u201c . . . The statement was read to the jury, in my opinion, by the district attorney as to give the impression or implication that the defendant had not arrived at [the] apartment at 9:10i but at 9:30, and, in my opinion, as I read the statement, it doesn\u2019t bear that interpretation . . . It\u2019s my duty to correct what I consider to be a grave mistake on your part,\u201d\n\u201cMay I say that is typical of the tactics that he has demonstrated in the entire trial.\u201d\n\u201c . . .1 have had quite a time in controlling you in your cross-examination. I will not allow you to divert the main issue in this case.\u201d\n\u201cSir, you ought to be committed for a statement like that, that I am restricting you from showing the motive in this case. That is ridiculous. To what exaggeration and heights will you get?\u201d\nWe cannot agree with the prosecution that the impact of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was harmless. As we stated in Commonwealth v. Davis, 452 Pa. 171, 177, 305 A.2d 715, 719 (1973), \u201c[o]ur analysis of the gravity and impact of the error is guided by two general precepts.\u201d We must first be able to declare a belief that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt before it will be held harmless and a judgment of sentence affirmed. Furthermore, the burden of establishing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt must be borne by the prosecution. Applying this two part analysis in Davis we said that if there is a reasonable possibility that the error \u201cmight have contributed to the conviction . . . might have moved \u2018the minds of an average jury\u2019 (footnote omitted) toward conviction . \u201d the error cannot be held harmless.\nIn presenting his case at trial, the defendant here contended that he was not present at the scene of the homicide, but was at his father\u2019s house at the time. Central to the success of such a defense is the credibility of the defendant and of his witnesses. There is no doubt that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct could have affected the jury\u2019s determination of the credibility of witnesses. The prosecution contends that the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming. This would be true only if it was accepted that the prosecution witnesses were telling the truth. This however, is exactly what the jury was to determine in an atmosphere worthy of an American court of law, not a gladiator\u2019s arena.\nThe prosecution argues that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was provoked by the conduct of defense counsel. We must unequivocally disagree. Although there are one or two instances in the record where defense counsel made inappropriate remarks, defense counsel did not improperly provoke the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. Frequently the prosecutor improperly attempted to characterize defense counsel\u2019s actions as delaying tactics; these remarks were \u201cprovoked\u201d by defense counsel\u2019s objections. We can hardly fault defense counsel, however, for objecting in an attempt to guarantee a fair trial to his client. Most of the objections were sustained. A lawyer\u2019s legitimate objections can hardly be an excuse for unprofessional conduct.\nJudgment reversed and a new trial granted.\nJONES, C. J., not participating.",
