Conner, while represented by privately-retained counsel, was found guilty by a jury of voluntary manslaughter. Post trial <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>motions were denied, and a sentence of six to twelve years imprisonment was imposed. A counseled appeal to this Court resulted in the affirmance of the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[303,588,1162,801]]]'>On June 17, 1974, Conner filed an uncounseled petition in the trial court pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. § 1180-1 et seq. Therein he alleged prejudicial remarks of the prosecuting attorney during trial operated to deny him his constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair trial. He contended that after the trial court properly refused to permit his wife to testify on behalf of the Commonwealth, the prosecuting attorney remarked in the presence of the jury and again in his closing argument, that the witness was not permitted to tell her story. The lower court, ruling the claim pertained to trial error challengeable only in a direct appeal, held that the issue was waived and denied the petition without a hearing. This appeal followed.</p>

The record, therefore, will be remanded to the trial court to determine in proper proceedings, whether Conner is indigent and, if so, if his decision to forego the assistance of counsel in these proceedings was knowing and intelligent.</p>
