In this case, the prosecutor’s misconduct began with his opening address to the jury and continued throughout the trial until he had completed his closing argument. The record of the trial in this case is over 1,000 pages long. A reading of the record discloses that the misconduct of the prosecutor was not limited to isolated moments of error in the heat of trial advocacy. The record is replete with instances of prosecutorial misconduct which permit only one reasonable conclusion: from the very beginning of the trial, the prosecutor adopted a strategy calculated to try the case on his own terms rather than within the rules of evidence and the standards of professional conduct. He attempted to divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence. He appealed to the passions and prejudices of the jury. He attempted to curry favor with the jury by being overly solicitous of their need to obtain the truth. He responded to defense objections, most of which were sustained, by constantly indicating that defense counsel was using delaying tactics. He said to the jury in referring to defense witnesses “I don’t know which liar you want to believe.” He dramatically portrayed for the jury what a slow and painful death the victim must have suffered if he had to lie a number of hours after he was shot in the mud and rain. He injected his own personal opinions about the cruelty inflicted on one who has had to “lie with his face in the mud, with the rain coming down, without a blessed soul there to put <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>their hand on his shoulder and say, ‘Don’t worry about it; everything will be all right,’ even though he was dying . . . . ”</p>
    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[288,480,1162,689]]]'>He persisted throughout the trial in trying the appellant as a heroin pusher even though this was not an issue of fact in the trial, and even though the appellant admitted his occupation when he took the stand. Even though the appellant was on trial for murder, he told the jury “there comes a time when you either push justice or indirectly you push the filth that is heroin . . . ” He called the crime a “classic, vicious, violent first-degree murder” and told the jury they had to have “courage” to say yes to a first degree murder verdict. He told the jury to “let the message go out into the community that the citizens which we all are will not put up with ‘this kind of viciousness and violence.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b532-6" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[285,1207,1158,363]]]'>He constantly made it appear that the defense counsel were not trying the case properly. He spoke to the jury about the “smoke screen” being put up by defense counsel, who were, according to the prosecutor, only attempting “to throw mud in the eyes of the jurors.” He then compared the mud allegedly being thrown by defense counsel to the mud that the victim “had to lie in and die.”</p>
    <p id="b532-7" data-blocks='[["BL_532.6",532,[284,1606,1157,363]]]'>He told the jury that in most homicide cases which he had tried, he was always able to find “somewhere inside some sorrow, some pity for the defendant.” He also said, however, that “this is the first case I have ever had where I have reached inside myself and I have tried to pull up some kind of concern or pity for the defendant, and I can’t find it.”</p>

As we stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Davis, </em><a href="/pa/452/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="452 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="574191" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0171-01">452 Pa. 171</a>, 177, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%20715" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="305 A.2d 715">305 A.2d 715</a>, 719 (1973), “[o]ur analysis of the gravity and impact of the error is guided by two general precepts.” We must first be able to declare a belief that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt before it will be held harmless and a judgment of sentence affirmed. Furthermore, the burden of establishing that <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt must be borne by the prosecution. Applying this two part analysis in <em>Davis </em>we said that if there is a reasonable possibility that the error “might have contributed to the conviction . . . might have moved ‘the minds of an average jury’ (footnote omitted) toward conviction . ” the error cannot be held harmless.</p>
    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[205,667,1152,694]]]'>In presenting his case at trial, the defendant here contended that he was not present at the scene of the homicide, but was at his father’s house at the time. Central to the success of such a defense is the credibility of the defendant and of his witnesses. There is no doubt that the prosecutor’s conduct could have affected the jury’s determination of the credibility of witnesses. The prosecution contends that the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming. This would be true only if it was accepted that the prosecution witnesses were telling the truth. This however, is exactly what the jury was to determine in an atmosphere worthy of an American court of law, not a gladiator’s arena.</p>
    <p id="b535-6" data-blocks='[["BL_535.5",535,[199,1385,1156,741]]]'>The prosecution argues that the prosecutor’s misconduct was provoked by the conduct of defense counsel. We must unequivocally disagree. Although there are one or two instances in the record where defense counsel made inappropriate remarks, defense counsel did not improperly provoke the prosecutor’s misconduct. Frequently the prosecutor improperly attempted to characterize defense counsel’s actions as delaying tactics; these remarks were “provoked” by defense counsel’s objections. We can hardly fault defense counsel, however, for objecting in an attempt to guarantee a fair trial to his client. Most of the objections were sustained. A lawyer’s legitimate objections can hardly be an excuse for unprofessional conduct.</p>
