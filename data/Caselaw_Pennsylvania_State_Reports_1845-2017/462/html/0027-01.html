Pursuant to the investigation of this homicide, appellant was interviewed at the Police Administration Building on November 12, 1972, the night of the homicide, and again on January 13, 1973. Detective Brown, who was in charge of the investigation, testified that the interviews with appellant were for the purpose of obtaining background information on his wife. At the end of each interview, appellant was allowed to return to his home. On March 29, 1973, at 7:00 a. m., the police arrived at the residence of appel<a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>lant and asked to speak to him. Appellant was taken to the Police. Administration Building, arriving at 7:25 a. m. The police took appellant into an interrogation room, warned him of his <em>Miranda, </em>rights, and at 7:45 a. m. appellant confessed the homicide of his wife.</p>

Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that appellant was illegally arrested, we are nevertheless of the opinion that appellant’s confession was admissible, because the confession was not the product of the illegal arrest, but rather an independent act of his own free will.</p>

Appellant’s confession shows in two instances that remorse or conscience motivated his confession rather than his alleged illegal arrest. In his formal confession, appellant told police that he was confessing “because it is bothering me. I want to get it off my mind.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At trial, appellant contested the voluntariness of his confession, but the jury resolved the issue against him.

We do not agree. In <em>McCusker, supra, </em>we held that psychiatric evidence was admissible only to show that a person acted out of the heat of passion at the time he committed the homicide, but that psychiatric evidence, like any other evidence, was for the jury to consider and to determine what weight it should be given. In the instant case, the jury obviously rejected the psychiatric testimony presented by appellant and they were, therefore, left with ample evidence to convict appellant of murder in the second degree.</p>

To say that <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>appellant suffered “remorse” and confessed as a result is merely to say that his will was overborne by interrogation. Unless the Commonwealth can point to some independent intervening circumstances that caused “remorse” or desire to confess, any such “motivation” can be attributed to nothing but the illegal arrest and consequent custody. In short, absent some independent intervening cause, the “remorse or conscience” that leads to a confession is itself the fruit of the illegal arrest. By no stretch of the imagination can it be called an independent cause of the confession.</p>
