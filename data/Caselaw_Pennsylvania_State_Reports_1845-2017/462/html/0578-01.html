As they were running from the bar after the hold-up they were observed by a police officer, who pursued them and captured the co-felon. The defendant escaped arrest by entering a nearby house. Once inside the building, he broke into the second floor apartment then being occupied by a Mrs. Margaret Mitchell and her eleven year old son, Ardies, who were awakened when Brown burst through the door. At gunpoint, the appellant informed the Mitchells that he had just robbed a bar and that he merely wanted to hide out in the house “until everything would be cool.”</p>
    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.6",616,[251,1269,1158,476]]]'>Learning from the Mitchells that there was a third floor tenant, William Bogier, Brown forced the Mitchells to accompany him to Bogier’s apartment. Brown then confronted Bogier and demanded money from him. Bogier said that what money he had was in his trousers pocket, whereupon Brown ordered the Mitchell boy to search Bogier’s clothing. The boy found $5 which he turned over to the defendant. Dissatisfied with this small sum, Brown shot Bogier once in the chest.</p>
    <p id="b616-6" data-blocks='[["BL_616.7",616,[250,1768,1155,95]],["BL_617.1",617,[235,303,1153,587]]]'>This accomplished, Brown forced the Mitchells and the wounded Bogier to go with him from floor to floor while <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>Brown had Ardies Mitchell ransack the house for more money. The search turned up approximately $77 found in Mrs. Mitchell’s pocketbook and in two jars of pennies. The group then returned, on Brown’s order, to the third floor, where once again he compelled Ardies Mitchell to search Bogier’s clothing. This time approximately $50 or $60 was found in a jacket. Declaring that he had known that Bogier had had more money than had been found previously, Brown shot Bogier five more times. These bullets struck the victim in the head, chest and thigh, and proved fatal.</p>
    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[236,911,1152,471]]]'>The mad rampage continued with Brown forcing the Mitchells downstairs in a renewed search for money. When no more was found, the Mitchell boy was trussed up and placed in the bathroom. Brown then proceeded to rape Mrs. Mitchell, after which he shot her in the head. Returning to the boy, Brown shot him three times in the head. Miraculously neither the boy nor his mother died from their wounds; both were able to testify at trial to the above occurrences.</p>

At trial, Miss Robinson testified that appellant gave her a gun, which she soon threw away, telling her at the same time that he had just shot three people on Ginnodo Street. He described them as a little boy, a lady and a man. Two months later Brown was arrested for the murder of Bogier and the related crimes.</p>

That motion was based on the fact that appellant at the time of his preliminary hearing on May 6, 1970 had been found to be incompetent to stand trial on another unrelated offense, and had been committed to a mental institution. It is contended that permitting a hearing under those circumstances deprived the accused <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>of due process of law, and also that the hearing violated Section .409 of the Pennsylvania Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Like the court below, we conclude that the appellant has waived his right to assert this alleged impropriety in the proceedings against him; we therefore do not reach the merits of the claim.</p>
    <p id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[272,652,1160,533]]]'>As noted above, the preliminary hearing was held on May 6, 1970. No motion to quash the indictment was filed until April 12, 1971, the very day that trial was scheduled to commence. Jury selection began on April 14, 1971 and the jury was sworn on April 21, 1971. Whichever of these two dates is considered to be the one on which the trial began, it is clear that appellant’s motion was untimely under our rule of criminal procedure governing the time for the filing of applications for pretrial relief,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> of which a motion to quash is one.</p>
    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.5",618,[271,1214,1158,317]],["BL_619.1",619,[245,266,1152,582]]]'>The motion to quash fails to set forth any reason which might excuse its untimeliness. At the time the motion was submitted to the court, however, defense counsel stated that the motion was filed as soon as he became aware that there were grounds for it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Defendant’s other counsel,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> however, was present at the prelimi<a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>nary hearing and there specifically objected to the hearing going forward on the ground that it had been determined that the defendant was not able to cooperate with counsel and was incompetent to stand trial. It is thus apparent that at least one of the defendant’s trial counsel was aware of defendant’s mental condition, if not of his commitment, at the time of the preliminary hearing. The eleven month delay in presenting the motion to quash on the ground of defendant’s mental state cannot, therefore, be excused for want of knowledge concerning it.</p>
    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.4",619,[242,882,1154,863]]]'>Second, appellant claims as error the refusal of the trial court to grant his motion for a bill of particulars. The motion was denominated a “Petition for Bill of Particulars and Examination of Evidence,” but its text indicates that in reality it was a motion for pretrial discovery. As such, its consideration must be governed by Rule 310 of our rules of criminal procedure, 19 P.S. Appendix (Supp.1974-75). That rule limits pretrial discovery to the written statements and confessions of the defendant himself unless “exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons” are shown warranting additional discovery. Appellant’s petition requested virtually all of the evidence gathered by the Commonwealth in connection with thiá case, but it contained no showing of exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons for such extensive discovery. The motion was properly denied.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The court denied the motion because it failed to comply with. Pa.R.Cr.P. 323(d) requiring that motions to suppress contain, <em>inter alia, </em>the particular facts in support of the motion. Defense counsel gave as the reason for the failure to include specific facts the lack of cooperation by the defendant.</p>

An in-court identification following an illegal out-of-court identification is admissible into evidence if, considering the totality of circumstances, it is determined that the in-court identification had an independent origin “ ‘sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.’” <em>United States v.

That testimony was elicited on re-direct examination of Stella Mae Robinson, the defendant’s girl friend, who was a Commonwealth witness. The error, it is argued, was in allowing this re-direct testimony, since it went beyond the scope of cross-examination. This claim must fail. It is clear that a trial judge has wide discretion to vary the normal order of proof and may permit a party to bring out on re-direct examination relevant evidence which inadvertently the party failed to bring out on direct examination.
