He assigned May 9, 1969, as the date of the accident and excess noise at his place of employment as the cause of the injury. While conceding that he had lost no time from work on account of his injury, except for a one-hour period when he underwent a hearing examination, Hinkle nevertheless contended he had a right to a compensation award for a partial disability.

However, if, as must be conceded, hearing loss precipitated by one particular outburst of noise would be compensable, we would frustrate the remedial purposes behind our workmen’s compensation legislation if we were to deny relief to one injured by a series of similar noises, all occurring in the course of his employment, no one of'which caused the injury. Manifestly, each outburst of noise contributed to the <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>hearing loss, with each particular effect being sudden. Viewing, as we do, each outburst of noise as a miniature accident operating to break down the claimant’s physical structure, we rule that loss of hearing resulting from protracted exposure to noise during the course of employment may constitute a compensable accident within the meaning of the Act. The right of a claimant to compensation should not be barred because he cannot definitely fix the date of the accident resulting in his disability, either because he cannot remembér the precise time when the accident occurred or because the accident was of such a nature that there is difficulty in ascertaining when it happened.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The Supreme Court, reversing the lower court, held that no compensable accident had occurred since the condition was the result of an occupational disease, normally of slow development and not arising from some undesigned event occurring at a particular time.

The Court today holds, however, that the usual, expectable and to a large degree unavoidable noise factor incident to employment in a can factory subjects the employee to an infinitude of “miniature accidents” comprised of “each outburst of noise” which has been emitted in the factory during the claimant’s twenty years of employment there. This is nothing more or less than a holding that any work-related physical disability of gradual, imperceptible development over the years is compensable. The result is no doubt socially desirable, but it is not what the legislature intended, at least before 1972.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>
