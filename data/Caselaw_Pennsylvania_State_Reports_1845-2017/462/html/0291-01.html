After an extensive colloquy conducted, pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 319, 19 P.S. Appendix, to determine the voluntariness of the plea, the plea was accepted by the trial court. During the course of this on-the-record examination, appellant, his court-appointed counsel, and the assistant District Attorney informed the court that the Commonwealth had agreed, in exchange for Hayes’ plea of guilty, to certify that the offense rose no higher than murder in the second degree, but would recommend that the maximum sentence, i. e. ten to twenty years imprisonment, be imposed. On October 30, 1970, after conclusion of a hearing to determine the degree of guilt, the court found Hayes guilty of murder in <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>the second degree and deferred sentencing until an investigation relevant to that issue had been conducted.</p>

As the basis for his motion to withdraw his plea, appellant averred that he had decided to enter the guilty plea only upon the willfully misleading assurance by Mr. Galante that the plea bargain accepted by the Commonwealth included a promise that any sentence imposed would be made to run concurrently with a sentence already being served by Hayes for an unrelated federal offense. This same accusation of deception also formed the ground for his request for appointment of new counsel. After a hearing, and believing that Hayes’ obvious lack of trust in defense counsel, whether or not well-founded, impeded a proper attorney-client relationship, the court dismissed Mr. Galante as attorney of record and appointed another lawyer to represent defendant. The court also scheduled an evidentiary hearing for assessment of the merits of appellant’s allegations, and for sentencing. At this hearing, held on February 24, 1971, wherein appellant was represented by new counsel, Mr. Galante unequivocally denied his former client’s charges. To the contrary, he stated that he had explained to Hayes that the prosecution had flatly refused even to discuss the possibility of recommending to the court that the state and federal sentences be made to run concurrently. Accepting Mr. Galante’s testimony as true, the court found that the plea bargain as it had been disclosed to the court during the guilty plea proceedings was, in fact, the agreement to which Hayes had given his fully informed consent, and that, accordingly, his guilty plea had been entered voluntarily and intelligently. The petition for leave to withdraw' the plea was, therefore denied. Appellant was <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>then sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten to twenty years, such sentence to run consecutively with that being served in the federal penitentiary.

At the evidentiary hearing conducted below, Mr. Hayes testified that his lawyer had assured him at various times during the year which followed the imposition of sentence that the lawyer was diligently preparing an appeal. Mr. Atkinson, on the other hand, testified that he had early informed appellant that, in his opinion, an appeal would be fruitless, and that appellant had accepted this conclusion. In disposing of the matter, the court believed it to be unnecessary to resolve this conflict in testimony and to render a decision on the mer<a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>its of the issue because a denial of appellant’s <em>Douglas </em>rights would be, at most, non-prejudicial error.

A different situation obtains when, having entered a plea of guilty to murder generally, an accused is found guilty of murder in the first degree following a degree of guilt hearing. “ ‘Since the Commonwealth is required to prove the elements of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt, ... a defendant so convicted may have other errors to press on direct review [in addition to the validity of his plea and the legality of sentence]’ ” <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, <a href="/pa/460/0658-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="460 Pa. 658" data-case-ids="482732" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0658-01">supra, </a></em><a href="/pa/460/0658-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="460 Pa. 658" data-case-ids="482732" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0658-01">at 663</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0658-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="460 Pa. 658" data-case-ids="482732" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0658-01">334 A.2d at </a>284 quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s additional contentions, i. e. that his plea of guilty was involuntarily entered and that the trial court erred in denying his petition to withdraw the plea would have been cognizable on direct appeal in light of the extensive post-plea evidentiary hearing which the trial court conducted with regard to these issues.

In recent decisions, we have emphasized that for purposes of assessing motions for plea withdrawal, a significant difference exists between those which occur pre-sentencing and those which are made subsequent to' the imposition of sentence.

Where the motion for withdrawal is made in a post-sentencing petition, “a showing of prejudice on the order of manifest injustice is required before withdrawal is properly justified.” <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starr, supra </em>at 490-91, 301 A.2d at 595.</p>

It should be noted that although appellant’s motion was filed prior to sentencing, the Commonwealth had already presented its entire case at the degree of guilt hearing. In light of our disposition of the issue, there is no need to consider the Commonwealth’s contention that this fact alone amounts to such prejudice to the prosecution as would justify denial of a pre-sentence motion for plea withdrawal.</p>
