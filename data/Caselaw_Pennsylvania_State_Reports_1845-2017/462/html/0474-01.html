It should be noted, however, that the rule exemplified by the cases above cited, viz., that local governmental units were liable for the negligent maintenance of the highways, was based upon statutes requiring municipal officers to keep streets and roads in repair.

Thus, a third alternative was in fact open to the Court in <em>Rader; </em>it could have held that the Commission was an entity governmental in nature but that unlike that of local governmental units, its immunity had not been waived by any statute.

The issue in <em>Ewalt </em>was whether the Turnpike Commission was liable for consequential damages arising out of the construction of the Western Pennsylvania Extension. The basis of the holding that the Commission was liable for such damages was Section 6k of the Western Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension Act of 1941. The Act of 1941 having authorized liability for such damages, it made no difference whether or not the Commission was otherwise generally immune from suit or, more importantly, whether any immunity it might enjoy was the same as that of the Commonwealth or was some other type of immunity. Thus, the “concession” by the Court in <em>Ewalt </em>that the Commission was correct in stating that it possessed the same immunity from suit as does the Commonwealth is more properly viewed as an assumption for the purposes of the case than a genuine decision of the point.</p>
