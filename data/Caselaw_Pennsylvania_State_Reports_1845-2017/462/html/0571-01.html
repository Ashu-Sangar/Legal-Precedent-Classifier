Immediately after the shooting, the appellant proceeded to a nearby police station and informed the police that he had shot his wife. The following morning the appellant gave the police a signed confession.</p>
    <p id="b605-10" data-blocks='[["BL_605.10",605,[230,1554,1150,812]]]'>Following a coroner’s inquest, the appellant was held over for action by the grand jury on a charge of murder. The grand jury returned indictments for voluntary manslaughter, murder, and involuntary manslaughter on May 16, 1963. A nonjury trial before two judges was held on October 21, 1963, at which the appellant, with privately retained counsel present, pled guilty. Following a degree of guilt hearing, the appellant was found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. The involuntary manslaughter indictment was <em>nolle prossed. </em>The appellant did not file a direct appeal. On April 20, 1971, following a post conviction hearing pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act, appellant was permitted to file post-verdict motions as if timely filed, and to take a direct appeal.</p>

      <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>The sole issue raised here concerns the validity of the appellant’s 1963 guilty plea. Appellant claims that his plea was invalid in that it was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered. Appellant advances two specific reasons in support of this claim. First, he claims that the on-the-record colloquy prior to the court’s acceptance of the plea fails to establish that appellant understood the nature of the charges, the significance of the plea, the consequences of the plea, and the availability of other alternatives. Secondly, appellant claims that the court erred in accepting his plea because it was coupled with his assertion of innocence. For reasons hereinafter stated, we affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>

    <p id="b607-4" data-blocks='[["BL_607.4",607,[227,652,1151,644]]]'>The appellant does not claim that an on-the-record colloquy was required, but asserts that from the brevity of the colloquy, with its lack of questioning as to the nature of charges, the consequences of the plea, the significance of the plea, and the availability of other alternatives, it can be inferred that appellant’s plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered. This inference does not follow. At the time of his guilty plea, the appellant was represented by privately retained counsel, whose competency is not challenged here. In <em>Commonwealth v. Brandon, </em><a href="/pa/440/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="440 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1932336" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0147-01">440 Pa. 147</a>, 149, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20653" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="269 A.2d 653">269 A.2d 653</a>, 654 (1970), this Court stated that,</p>

He further testified that the reason he visited his wife on the night of the shooting was to take a box of clothing to the children, and to persuade his wife to reunite the family. The box of clothing concealed the .32 caliber Colt pistol used to kill the wife. The appellant asserted that he only took the gun along to scare his wife and he did not know that it was loaded. He further testified that he took the gun out of the box and pulled back the trigger “to let her know it was real.” The victim was found dead with bullet wounds in the chest, abdomen, left thigh, left forearm, and three wounds in the right forearm.</p>
