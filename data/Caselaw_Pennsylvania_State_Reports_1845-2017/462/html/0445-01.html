(Chester-dale), proposed to erect apartments on a tract of land located in Willistown Township (the township). This proposal was rejected because the tract was zoned RA-1, Residential, which did not permit apartments. Some six months later, Chesterdale again submitted a plan for approval, but it, too, was refused. Chesterdale then applied for a building permit, which was refused. Shortly after that refusal, this court decided <em>Girsh Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/437/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="437 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1927788" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0237-01">437 Pa. 237</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20395" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="263 A.2d 395">263 A.2d 395</a> (1970), in which we held zoning that totally excluded apartments to be unconstitutional. Subsequent to our decision in <em>Girsch, supra, </em>Chesterdale again applied for a building permit and, in addition, filed an action in mandamus, alleging that the township’s zoning ordinance was unconstitutional in light of <em>Girsh, </em>and further alleging that it was entitled to a building permit as a matter of right.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The township thereupon passed a new zoning ordinance which provided an area of eighty acres in the township on which apartments could be built.

Both Chesterdale and the township then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which, being equally divided, affirmed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas.

The minutes of the meeting of the Board of Supervisors of Willistown Township held on August 27, 1970, the day the amendatory ordinance was adopted, indicate to me a bona fide undertaking to bring the Township zoning structure into harmony with the Court’s decision in <em>Girsh Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/437/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="437 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1927788" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0237-01">437 Pa. 237</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20395" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="263 A.2d 395">263 A.2d 395</a> (1970).

      <blockquote id="b484-5" data-blocks='[["BL_484.6",484,[343,1695,1084,262]]]'>“Mr. Reitman, on behalf of the planning commission, then read a letter dated August 25, 1970, from the commission to the board of supervisors describing the long and intensive study and investigation of the planning commission, which led to the amendments under consideration, explaining the views of the planning commission on such amendments and recommending passage of the ordinance.</blockquote>
      <blockquote id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.7",484,[340,1973,1084,375]]]'>“Mr. Ewing then read from the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Girsh </em>v. <em>Nether Providence Township, </em>observing that the language of that case obliged all townships with a demand for apartments to provide for them. Failure to act, he . noted, would only, increase the risk that builders could obtain court approval for apartments in areas of their, selection. It was therefore important that the township act responsibly to provide a reasonable area for apartment use consistent with the orderly development of the township and furnishing of necessary township services.”</blockquote>
