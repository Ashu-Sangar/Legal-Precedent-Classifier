The report, sometimes called the “Jaffe Report” after its author, was entitled “Report to the Committee of Censors <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> of the Philadelphia Bar Association of the Investigation into Unethical Solicitation”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Philadelphia Bar Association submitted the report to the court and sought an order establishing procedures to be followed in implementing it. The court entered such an order on April 26, 1971, followed by an amended order on June 3, 1971, and by a supplementary order on August 19, 1971. The latter order, <em>inter alia, </em>transferred responsibility for the investigation from the Committee of Censors to special counsel to be appointed by the court. A further amended order was entered by the court on its own motion on October 28, 1971, and it is this order which is the basis of the instant proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Appellants contend, however, that the authority of a court of common pleas to act in cases of lawyer misconduct, and the manner of its acting, is found exclusively in a statute, <em>viz., </em>the Act of June 4, 1919, P.L. 384, § I, as amended, 17 P.S. § 1665.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> It is argued that there was no application by any committee for the convening of the special disciplinary court which acted in these cases or for the institution of the investigation of appellants’ conduct, the order of October 28, 1971 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> having <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>been made upon the court’s own motion. This argument misreads the statute, which simply; empowers a court to issue its subpoena, upon application of a court-appointed or approved investigating committee, “directed to any person whom such committee may desire to examine in connection with any such charges” of professional misconduct. The statute was so utilized in this proceeding; it does not purport to limit in any way the court’s role in cases of alleged professional misbehavior and discipline to the narrow procedural framework there envisaged, and had this been the statute’s purpose and effect, it would be of doubtful constitutionality.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

In those cases, as in this, the procedure followed was developed by the court itself. The president judge of one of the Philadelphia courts of common pleas (No. 2) by letter to the chancellor of the Bar Association requested the appointment of a committee to conduct an investigation to ascertain “the possible connection with organized crime of lawyers who practice largely in the criminal courts”. The committee was appointed, was vested with subpoena powers by the court, took testimo<a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>ny, and rendered a report. The court then issued a rule upon various lawyers identified by the committee as guilty of improper conduct to show cause why they should not be disciplined. The lawyers so cited were furnished with the committee’s report and a summary prepared by the committee of the testimony taken, as it affected them. After answers filed, trial proceeded before a special five-judge court (composed of the president judges of the five courts of common pleas of Philadelphia County), and the lawyers were disbarred. Appellants in those cases, as here, challenged the regularity of the proceedings. In an opinion of the Court by Chief Justice Kephart, those challenges were examined and rejected. The Court thus summarized its conclusions:</p>

Under Rule 17-24, this Court has received an authenticated copy of an adjudication entered October 17, 1973 in the case of <em>United States of America v. Sheldon R. Portner, </em>No. 73-405 in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. From the record supporting this judgment, it appears that Portner pleaded nolo contendere to two counts of filing false and fraudulent income tax returns for the years 1970 and 1971, and in each count received a suspended prison sentence, was placed on probation for 3 years, and fined $1,500. The indictment to which the pleas were entered states that the joint taxable income of Portner and his wife for the years in question was $30,733.70 and $47,054.04, respectively. Because of the pendency of the instant appeal, action under Rule 17-24 was deferred temporarily. In light of the disposition of the appeal which we make today, there will be no need for an additional suspension prior to disposition of a disciplinary proceeding before the Disciplinary Board based on the federal conviction.</p>
