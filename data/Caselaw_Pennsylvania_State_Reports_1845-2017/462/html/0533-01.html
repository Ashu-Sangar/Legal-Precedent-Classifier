At 5:10 P.M. appellant was placed alone in an interrogation room. Twenty minutes later a detective entered and, after warning appellant of his Miranda rights, proceeded to question him. Appellant was questioned at various intervals thereafter by this detective and, although appellant did not refuse to speak with the police, he steadfastly denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the incident. At 10:12 P.M. appellant was confronted with a statement by one of the Shaw brothers implicating appellant. Thereupon appellant admitted participating in the robbery. Appellant was permitted to rest and during this period attempted to telephone relatives. He was also questioned concerning the identity of a third participant. At 4:30 A.M. the following morning, appellant made a formal statement which was signed at 6:27 A.M. Appellant was slated at 10:46 A.M. The record, is unclear as to the time of arraignment, but it was sometime after 10:46 A.M.</p>

One of those questioned, an Andrew Shaw, admitted he had participated in the robbery and that he had done the shooting. He also named the others who were with him at the time and assisted in committing the robbery. The appellant was one of those named. When the appellant was told of Shaw’s implicating statement, he immediately changed his story and admitted having participated in the robbery. This occurred at 10:12 p. m. Thereafter, appellant rested and attempted to contact relatives by phone. Beginning about 4:30 a. m. the following morning, he repeated his admission of guilt, giving greater detail. This statement was recorded on a typewriter. At trial, evidence of appellant’s recorded statement and of his initial incriminating admissions were introduced into evidence against him. The jury found appellant guilty of murder in the second degree and other related crimes. A majority of this Court now reverse these convictions, and order a new trial. The majority say the police violated Rule 118 [now 130] of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure by detaining and questioning the appellant from <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>5:30 p. m. until 10:12 p. m. without having him arraigned before a committing judicial officer and, since the incriminations were the product of that detention, evidentiary use thereof was reversible error. I cannot in good conscience be any part of such a ruling. I believe courts should studiously protect those accused of crime from overzealous and unfair police tactics. However, effective law enforcement requires that the police be allowed some reasonable period to ferret out the truth by questioning those who appear to be involved. Law abiding citizens have rights too, and the police should not be unreasonably shackled in the protection of these rights.</p>
    <p id="b573-4" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[219,987,1149,469]]]'>Please keep in mind appellant’s self-incriminations were not the result of any coercive tactics or circumstances. This is not even suggested. The one and only reason why these incriminations are ruled to be tainted and, hence, inadmissible is that the police detained and questioned the appellant for four hours and forty-two minutes without having him arraigned before a judicial officer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The complete unreasonableness of this position is self-evident.</p>

Goodwin, </em><a href="/pa/460/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="460 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="482856" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0516-01">460 Pa. 516</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="460 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="482856" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0516-01">333 A.2d 892</a> (1975). Not only was this “nexus” not established instantly, but the record irrefutably proves the contrary. The appellant did not come around to telling the truth because he was detained without arraignment for four hours and forty-two minutes. He did so because his co-defendant Shaw had let the “cat out of the bag”. The majority <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>may cavalierly dismiss the significance here, of our decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

Saying <em>Fogan </em>is inapposite because the Futch issue was not there involved is to effectively remove the requirement that there be proof of a “nexus” between the incrimination and the “unnecessary delay”.</p>

It was being confronted with a statement by a co-defendant which implicated Bey in the killing that prompted Bey himself to confess. The fact that this happened to take place five hours after arrest rather than, say, three hours afterwards is of no significance; the motivation was the fact that Bey’s companion had “fingered” him. Thus Bey’s confession was not, in my view, the product of any delay in arraignment.</p>
