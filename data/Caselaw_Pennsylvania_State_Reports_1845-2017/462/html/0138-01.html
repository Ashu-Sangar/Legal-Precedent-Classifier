Shertzer, Esquire, had at various times served as an officer and director of both Rimar and Mt. Joy and as counsel for all three appellees; that in representing appellant in the instant suit Mr. Shertzer was making use of confidential information which he had acquired by virtue of his positions with the appellees, including his capacity as their lawyer; and that such conduct constituted representation of an interest adverse to that of his former clients, the appellees, in violation of the Canons of Professional Ethics.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

This disclosure is made in the strictest confidence, relying upon the attorney’s honor and fidelity. To permit the attorney to reveal to others what is so disclosed, would be not only a gross violation of a sacred trust upon his part, but it would utterly destroy and prevent the usefulness and benefits to be derived from professional assistance. Based upon considerations of public policy, therefore, the law wisely declares that all confidential communications and disclosures, made by a client to his legal adviser for the purpose of obtaining his professional aid or advice, shall be strictly privileged; — that the attorney shall not be permitted, without the consent of his client, — and much less will he be compelled — to reveal or disclose communications made to him under such circumstances.” 2 Mecham on Agency, 2d Ed., § 2297.</blockquote>

Joy was to sell to Rimar 23,406 shares of Rimar’s stock in consideration of the cancellation by Rimar of a debt in the amount of $140,389.58 owed to it by Mt. Joy. It was averred that on and before the date of this agreement Rimar had an option to purchase 100,000 shares of Rimar common stock at a price of $1 per share.

Slater was barred, additionally, from disclosing to any other person any information received from Shertzer “in connection with any matter related directly or indirectly to the complaint,” or “related directly or indirectly to any matter involving any of the defendants.” (¶ 7 of the decree, R. at 2b). Shertzer, in turn, was directed (1) not to disclose to any other person “any information concerning the complaint [or] relating to any matter or thing involving any of the defendants,” (2) to return to the defendants, without making any copies, all files, pleadings, documents, etc. and “every piece of paper” relating to the defendants, (3) to return all shareholder lists of Mt.
