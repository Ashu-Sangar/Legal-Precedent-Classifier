    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[216,488,1151,694]]]'>The appellant, John R. Conner, was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter on June 13, 1969.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Subsequently, he filed two separate petitions for writs of coram nobis with the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County alleging his conviction was tainted by the use at trial of four prior uncounseled convictions to impeach his credibility as a witness and to enhance his punishment. In each petition Conner sought the grant of a new trial or, in the alternative, a reconsideration of sentence. The lower court, while recognizing the invalidity of the four prior convictions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> nevertheless denied Conner the requested relief. This one appeal, consolidating the two petitions, followed.</p>

Rather, he should have initiated a proceeding under the Post Conviction Hearing Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and followed the procedures set forth therein.</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[219,1505,1151,368]],["BL_318.1",318,[273,280,1159,966]]]'> By its own terms, the Act “establishes a post-conviction procedure for providing relief from convictions obtained and sentences imposed without due process of law.” It “encompass [es] all common law and statutory procedures for the same purpose that exist when this statute takes effect, including habeas corpus and <em>coram nobis.” </em>[Emphasis supplied.] 19 P.S. § <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>1180-2.

However, inasmuch as the trial court has already given consideration to the merits of Conner’s petitions, we believe it would conserve judicial time and avoid further post conviction litigation if we were to presently consider Conner’s claims.</p>

While recognizing that the petitioner in <em>Sheehan </em>was not eligible for relief under the Act, we nevertheless permitted the petition to be considered and treated as a petition for a writ of coram nobis. In so doing, we adopted the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Morgan, </em><a href="/us/346/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="346 U.S. 502" data-case-ids="6931559" data-case-paths="/us/346/0502-01">346 U.S. 502</a>, <a href="/us/346/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="346 U.S. 502" data-case-ids="6931559" data-case-paths="/us/346/0502-01">74 S.Ct. 247</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%20248" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="98 L.

We note that Conner has asked, in the event of a remand back to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, for a change of venue to assure him a fair and impartial tribunal. He alleges there exists an overall prejudice towards him by reason of a civil rights action filed by him against the district attorney and assistant district attorney of Dauphin County and the former warden of the Dauphin County Prison. We refuse to grant the request because the allegation that a judicial officer would be unfavorably prejudiced against Conner simply because of pending civil litigation against other county officials is an affront to the integrity of the judiciary and without reasonable basis.</p>
