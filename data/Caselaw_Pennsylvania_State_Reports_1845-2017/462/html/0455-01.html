The question is not why the parties acted the way they did, but what sort of legal relationship they intended to create. The best evidence of their intent is the agreements they signed when they established their respective joint accounts. These agreements are legally binding contracts, and, like other contracts, if their terms are unambiguous they can be contradicted only by clear and convincing evidence of fraud, accident or mistake. <em>Olson, Estate, </em><a href="/pa/447/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="447 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1942918" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0483-01">447 Pa. 483</a>, 487, <a href="/citations/?q=291%20A.2d%2095" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="291 A.2d 95">291 A.2d 95</a> (1972). Where a signature card clearly establishes an intent to create a relationship of joint ownership within the scope of § 241 of the Act, neither the source of the funds nor the fact that the relationship happens to suit the convenience of the parties has any bearing on the incidence of the tax.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[270,1289,1159,638]]]'>In <em>Olson Estate, supra, </em>two brothers, Paul and William, established two joint bank accounts with funds provided exclusively by Paul. The signature cards signed by the brothers expressly provided that they would own the accounts as joint tenants with right of survivorship. On William’s death, the Commonwealth included-the accounts in the appraisement of his estate, and assessed a tax on half their value. The estate contested the tax, and offered evidence that Paul who was in poor health, had set up the accounts so that William could look after his needs. Accepting this evidence at face value, we nonetheless sustained the imposition of the tax.</p>

It is perhaps unfortunate that Anna Gillespie and Ethel Winger ter will be taxed for regaining full ownership of property which was theirs alone before they established the joint accounts.

In these circumstances the existence <em>vel non </em>of a confidential relationship is irrelevant, even where the dispute is between the two parties to the transaction. A <em>fortiori, </em>it is difficult to see how the existence of such a relationship as between the two sisters in the case at bar could serve to place a burden of proof on a third party, such as the Commonwealth, who was unconnected with the transaction. Appellees’ contention is thus beside the point, and need not be considered further.</p>

The orphans’ court found in both cases that the survivors did not intend to transfer any ownership interests to the decedents, but sought merely to empower the decedents to deal with the accounts for the benefit and convenience of the survivors. Since transfers made without donative intent are not completed gifts effective to transfer any interests in property, the clear implication of the orphans’ court’s findings is that the decedents owned no interests in the accounts as against the survivors. While this conclusion does not affect the incidence of taxation, it does raise a question why the transactions assumed forms that were so divergent from the parties’ intentions.</p>

Moreover, the appellant conceded both at trial and at oral argument before this Court that these were, in fact, convenience accounts. Nonetheless, the majority blindly refuses to look beyond the four corners of the signature cards to ascertain the true intent of the parties.</p>
    <p id="b495-6" data-blocks='[["BL_495.7",495,[247,1366,1151,806]]]'>While I agree with Mr. Justice Roberts that “the clear implication of the orphans’ court’s findings, is that the decedents owned no interests in the accounts as against the survivors,” I disagree that “this conclusion does not affect the incidence of taxation.” Section 241 of the Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, 72 P.S. § 2485-241 (1964) defines a transfer subject to tax as the <em>accrual of the right </em>to the immediate ownership or possession and enjoyment of the whole property upon the death of one of the joint tenants. Since the survivors in the present cases never intended to transfer any ownership interests or rights to the decedents, they could not, upon the deaths of the decedents, have <em>accrued </em>a right which they had always possessed. Thus, there were no transfers in these cases upon which tax could properly be imposed.</p>
