Addressing itself to the general aviation market, the advertising described the helicopter as “safe, dependable,” not “tricky to operate,” and one that “beginners and professional pilots alike agree ... is easy to fly.” Brantly had experienced some difficulties in designing its rotor blades and autorotation in the development stage and modified the system to some degree prior to its distribution. In January, 1962, Mr. Berkebile, a businessman, purchased the <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>helicopter from defendant’s distributor. Mr. Berkebile flew alone on July 9, and while in climbing flight the seven-foot outboard section of one of the three main rotor blades separated.

      <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>The law of products liability developed in response to changing societal concerns over the relationship between the consumer and the seller of a product. The increasing complexity of the manufacturing and distributional process placed upon the injured plaintiff a nearly impossible burden of proving negligence where, for policy reasons, it was felt that a seller should be responsible for injuries caused by defects in his products. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A, comment, <em>c. </em>We therefore held in <em>Webb v. Zern, supra, </em>that the seller<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> of a product would be responsible for injury caused by his defective product even if he had exercised all possible care in its design, manufacture and distribution. We emphasized the principle of liability without fault most recently by stating that the seller is “effectively the guaranter of his product’s safety,” in <em>Salvador v. Atlantic Steel Boiler Co., </em><a href="/pa/457/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="457 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="477689" data-case-paths="/pa/457/0024-01">457 Pa. 24</a>, 32, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20903" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="319 A.2d 903">319 A.2d 903</a>, 907 (1974).</p>

Also, plaintiff must prove that the defect causing the injury existed at the time the product left the seller’s hands; the seller is not liable if a safe product is made unsafe by subsequent changes. <em>See Bialek v.

In strict liability, the manufacturer is liable even if he has exercised all due care. Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 402(A)(2)(a). Foreseeability is not a test of proximate cause; it is a test of negligence. <em>Hoover v. Sackett, </em><a href="/pa-super/221/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="221 Pa.

Plaintiff must prove a defect existing in the product at the time the product left the seller’s hands and he must prove proximate cause.

Plaintiff contended that the blade fractured because of a defect in manufacture; defendant’s contention that the blade fractured from impact with the “stops” rebutted the contention of this defect. Plaintiff contended the autorotation system was defective because it gave a pilot insufficient time to activate it. The autorotation system is a safety device existing for the sole purpose of preventing a crash in the event of engine failure <em>for any reason. </em>The reason the engine failed is irrelevant.

Nor can it be said that the failure of decedent to go into autorotation “within the necessary time” rebuts the contention that the autorotation system was defective in not allowing sufficient time for its activation. What constitutes “necessary time” is the key to the issue of the defect. For example, if defendant showed that an average pilot required one second to achieve autorotation and also showed that this helicopter gave decedent one second to achieve autorotation in climbing flight, he would rebut the contention of this defect. Whether decedent actually attempted autorotation is relevant to the issue of causation. If the jury were to conclude, for example, that a non-defective system would allow two seconds for autorotation and that the decedent did not attempt autorotation for three seconds; even if a defect was shown, it could not have been the proximate cause of the crash.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> In conclusion, evidence which would be admissible in a negligence case to prove “abnormal use” is admissible in a strict liability case only for the purpose of rebutting the plaintiff’s contentions of defect and proximate cause.

This is for <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>the jury to determine. The necessity and adequacy of warnings in determining the existence of a defect can and should be considered with a view to all the evidence. The jury should view the relative degrees of danger associated with use of the product since a greater degree of danger requires a greater degree of protection. <em>E. g., Thomas v. Avron Products, Inc., supra. </em>In this case, plaintiff argued that the most serious emergency in the event of power failure w&amp;s in climbing flight, since there would be the greatest rotor decay and thus least amount of time available for activating the autorotation system. In cruise flight, rotor decay upon engine failure is the least serious emergency and thus gives the greatest amount of time in which to achieve autorotation. In hovering flight, rotor decay is in an intermediate amount. Defendant’s flight manual for the helicopter’s operation gives the maximum detailed warnings in regard to the minimum emergency (cruise) and the minimum warnings (none) in the maximum emergency situation (climb). One study done by defendant and specifically excluded by the trial court showed a concern on the part of defendant’s chief test pilot regarding rapid rotor decay in climbing flight.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> If the jury determined this was an insufficient warning, the product would be defective even if the product had been perfectly designed and manufactured.

As an example, the failure of a seller of ordinary knives to warn of dangerous propensities can not be considered the proximate cause of a consumer’s cutting his finger since the potentiality of its danger is generally known and recognized. It is sometimes necessary to consider whether <em>any </em>warnings are required. Here the only issue was the adequacy of warnings since FAA regulations and the defendant’s own inclusion of some warnings in regard to the autorotation system demonstrated the necessity of warnings. The issue of necessity and adequacy of warnings and instructions for use must also be considered in light of any contradictory promotional activities on the part of the seller. <em>Incollingo, supra.</em>
