They were accosted by three older youths who demanded to know their gang affiliation. When Nathan and his friends denied belonging to any gang, a scuffle ensued. As the younger boys attempted to escape, fourteen-year-old Nathan was fatally shot in the chest.</p>

Leroy Newsome was first contacted by a detective at 6:10 A.M. in an interview room. The detective explained to appellant why he was in custody and gave him his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. At that time, appellant indicated a willingness to talk. Approximately two and one-half hours later, between 8:10 A.M. and 8:30 A.M., after a meal, Leroy Newsome made his first oral admissions of his involvement in the shooting. In the course of his statement, appellant admitted that he did the actual shooting. He remained in custody while the officer continued their investigations seeking the whereabouts of the murder weapon. That afternoon between 4:30 and 6:20 P.M., after several polygraph tests, appellant gave a signed, written statement detailing the entire incident.</p>
