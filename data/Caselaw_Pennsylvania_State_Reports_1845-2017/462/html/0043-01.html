On August 19, 1969, the automobile which Eckert had been driving was found abandoned in Leesport, Pennsylvania. Found in the automobile were several articles of clothing identified as belonging to Miss Sheckler and Eckert. On October 24, 1969, while making a search in a wooded area in Berks County, State Police officers discovered under some rocks near a stone wall, a decomposed body partially clad in a yellow dress.

    <p id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[214,501,1149,1294]]]'>At approximately 1:00 a. m., on August 13, 1969, Stoltzfus, Eways, Bailey and Robert Martinolich, pursuant to a plan to kidnap a girl for the purpose of satisfying each of the group member’s sexual whims, drove to Skyline Drive, located on the top of a mountain overlooking Reading, Pennsylvania. After driving around for a short time, they stopped alongside a parked vehicle occupied by Eckert and Miss Sheckler. Stoltzfus, Bailey and Martinolich entered the parked vehicle, and took the young couple captive. They then proceeded to follow Eways, who was driving a panel truck, to Leesport where the Eckert vehicle was abandoned. Miss Sheckler was forced to undress in the rear of the panel truck where a variety of sexual abuses were performed upon her by Stoltzfus and his companions. Subsequently, the four proceeded with their captives to Dreamland Park where their “clubhouse” was located. However, on approaching it, they discovered two police vehicles parked across its entrance. Stoltzfus, Bailey and Martinolich, along with the two captives, then exited from the panel truck and entered the woods wherein Miss Sheckler’s body was eventually discovered. Eways then drove away in the panel truck and, shortly thereafter, Bailey left the woods in order to find transportation for the group.</p>
    <p id="b83-5" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[214,1836,1148,526]]]'>In addition to the foregoing, Bailey testified to three conversations he had with Stoltzfus following their arrest. In one, Bailey asked Stoltzfus what happened to the boy and girl [Eckert and Miss Sheckler], and the latter replied, “Don’t worry about it, we took care of them, just forget you ever saw them.” In the other two conversations, Stoltzfus explained that he attempted to choke Miss Sheckler and when she wouldn’t die he crushed her skull with a rock and buried the body underneath rocks obtained from a nearby stone fence.</p>

Dr. Desjardins, who performed the autopsy upon Miss Sheckler’s remains, testified: “My opinion is that this young lady died as a result of a blow to the left side of the head producing a depressed skull fracture.” It is argued that, because Dr. Desjardins failed to state his opinion in terms of “beyond a reasonable doubt”, the testimony was insufficient to establish the required causal connection between the death and the criminal act.</p>

Defense counsel stated to the trial court that he was satisfied with the questions asked of the selected jurors. Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that Maurer was excused from further service on the jury because of the problem of hardship and that his excusal had no relation to the merits of the case or to the guilt or innocence of Stoltzfus. Under these circumstances, we believe the motion for a mistrial was properly denied. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

Instantly, defense counsel was permitted to question Eways and Bailey as to their appearance on August 13th. Eways testified that he had a beard that “came down along the jawline” and that he had not had a haircut for “a couple months”. Bailey testified that he had a “full beard” and that he hadn’t had a haircut in “[a]bout eight months”. Since evidence of the appearance of Eways and Bailey on August 13, 1969, was before the jury in the form of their own testimony, it was clear that there was no need to duplicate such evidence by placing it before the jury in the form of photographs.
