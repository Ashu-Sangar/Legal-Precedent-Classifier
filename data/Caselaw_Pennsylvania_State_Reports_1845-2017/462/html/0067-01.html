The Board stated that it reached its conclusions and recommendations in spite of Judge Dandridge’s “exemplary service as a trial judge . . .his noteworthy efforts in civic activities, and . . .his excellent reputation for judicial temperament and integrity,” and in spite of what the Board described as “the unfortunate and improper practice which apparently exists in Philadelphia County of some judges retaining proceeds from dinners held in their honor.”</p>
