We disagree. At trial, the Commonwealth produced evidence which can be summarized as follows. On January 11, 1971, a fire occurred at 2927 N. Fairhill Street in Philadelphia, the home of appellant’s estranged girl friend, Gwendolyn Harris. Three people were killed as a result. Appellant, in a written statement, admitted that he and his brother, Donald, had secured paraphernalia to make firebombs and, after warning one of the members of the Harris household by telephone to remove the children from the home, the two brothers had gone to the Harris home where appellant threw the lit firebomb through the window resulting in the fatal fire. Testimony by several persons, including Gwendolyn Harris, revealed that appellant had been at the Harris home on January 9th, two <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>days before the fatal fire and had threatened Ms. Harris, “I’m going to get you”, when she had refused to resume their relationship. Appellant admitted that upon leaving the Harris home on the 9th, he had walked through the vacant house at 2925 N. Fairhill Street which adjoined the Harris home. Shortly thereafter a fire was discovered in this building which appellant was also accused of starting. Appellant admitted lighting matches and dropping them in this building giving as his reason that he was using the light from the matches to find his way through the darkened interior.</p>

The balance swings to the side of exclusion <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>because the probative value of the evidence of the other fire, when properly considered and regardless of its relevance, is exceedingly slight.</p>

But there was no evidence from which this could have been inferred. The Commonwealth concedes that the “other fire” evidence proves <em>no more </em>than that appellant “lit several matches to see where he was. going. As a result of lighting these matches, he started a fire which consumed the premises.” Brief for Appellee at 3-4. Only pure speculation on the part of the jury could have supplied the element of intent, for the evidence surely did not. I must conclude that the “other fire” evidence, properly considered and without speculation, proves little or nothing relevant to the January 11 fire.</p>
