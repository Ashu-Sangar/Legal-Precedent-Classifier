Takiff, respondent herein, charged the January 1974 Grand Jury as a special investigating grand jury to investigate, <em>inter alia, </em>corruption in the Philadelphia Police Department. On March 26, 1974, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania established the Office of the Special Prosecutor by appointing respondent Walter M. Phillips, Jr., as Deputy Attorney General to investigate and prosecute police corruption in Philadelphia. The convening of the grand jury and the appointment of the Special Prosecutor were actions taken in response to a Report by the Pennsylvania Crime Commission on Police Corruption and the Quality of Law Enforcement in Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b549-4" data-blocks='[["BL_549.4",549,[236,1011,1153,803]]]'>In June and July of 1974, the twelve policemen/petitioners were subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. Each officer was represented by petitioner Anthony D. Pirillo, Jr., Esquire and/or by Mr. Pirillo’s associate, Salvator J. Cucinotta, Esquire.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> As was customary, before any witness testified, Judge Takiff held an <em>in camera </em>session with the Special Prosecutor or his representative during which the Judge was informed as to the proposed scope of inquiry for these witnesses. It was revealed by the Special Prosecutor that each witness would be questioned about the conduct of other police officers, and in most cases, about the conduct of each other. Most of the officers had been named in the Crime Commission Report as persons who had taken bribes from the owners of Philadelphia bars.</p>

After an evidentiary hearing on the conflicts matter, the judge decided that Mr. Pirillo and his associate, Mr. Cucinotta, must be disqualified from representing all twelve of the policemen/witnesses before the grand jury. His decision was based on the following grounds:</p>
    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[251,642,1160,361]]]'>(1) The multiple representation interfered with the individual witness’s right to effective counsel. For example, if witness <em>A </em>has information about witness <em>B’s </em>criminal conduct, one attorney could not represent both. It may be in A’s best interest for counsel to advise A to cooperate. However, this would operate to the detriment of <em>B.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[242,1038,1164,749]]]'>(2) The attorneys’ fee compensation arrangement with the Fraternal Order of Police, by whom the petitioners/attorneys were referred and paid, constituted a serious question of conflict because of the Fraternal Order of Police’s avowed public policy of strenuous opposition to any form of cooperation by individual policemen with the Special Prosecutor’s office and with the investigating grand jury. This would not only interfere with the public function of the investigating grand jury but would also jeopardize the rights of the individual witnesses to effective assistance of counsel because the attorneys might be compelled to pursue the dictates of the F.O.P. which pays them rather than the best interests of the witness.</p>
    <p id="b550-6" data-blocks='[["BL_550.6",550,[238,1826,1158,373]]]'>(8) There would be a serious detriment to the investigative function of the grand jury because of the multiple representation. With one attorney representing all witnesses in a particular area of investigation, the Special Prosecutor could not convince counsel to elicit cooperation of one witness since such cooperation might seriously implicate the attorneys’ other clients in illegal activity.</p>

For example, when the Crime Commission subpoenaed Police Commissioner Joseph O’Neill to testify, the F.O.P. sought to intervene and quash that subpoena on the ground that the investigation would violate the rights of police officers. <em>See Pennsylvania Crime Commission Subpoena, </em><a href="/pa/453/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="453 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="577574" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0513-01">453 Pa. 513</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20401" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="309 A.2d 401">309 A.2d 401</a> (1973).

In addition, the F.O.P. sought to quash subpoenas issued by the June, 1972, Grand Jury. In each of these matters, the F.O.P. was represented by petitioner Pirillo. The F.O.P.’s attitude of broad noncooperation is apparently shared by respondent Pirillo, the attorney paid by the F.O.P. to represent its individual members. Thus, petitioner Pirillo testified that whenever a police officer indicated that he might consider cooperating, he would immediately remove himself as counsel and advise the witness to hire another attorney. This fee arrangement clearly has a chilling effect upon a police witness who is considering cooperation, since his access to F.O.P. paid counsel depends directly on his agreement not to cooperate. Moreover, the limited viability of the options open to a police witness suspected of illegal activity is further demonstrated by petitioner Pirillo’s testimony that he would discuss the possibility of a witness cooperating only when the witness had come to him and raised the possibility. The failure of petitioner Pirillo to raise the subject of cooperation, apparently as a result of his fee arrangement with the F.O.P., deprives the witnesses of their right to the full and complete loyalty of their attorney.</p>

      <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>The majority’s decision, denying the witnesses their choice of attorneys, is rooted in a presumption that the witnesses are guilty of crimes, even though there is not one shred of evidence in this record to warrant such a conclusion, and even though under state and federal law, the witnesses must be presumed innocent — not guilty. I cannot agree with the novel proposition that the <em>state </em>can deprive a citizen of his right to be represented by the attorney of his choice by speculating that he may be guilty.</p>
