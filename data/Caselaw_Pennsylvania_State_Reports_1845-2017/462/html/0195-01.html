It is well-settled that any finding supported by evidence of record is entitled to the same weight given a jury verdict, and the finding must be sustained unless the court abused its discretion or committed an error of law. <em>See, e. g., Button Estate, </em><a href="/pa/459/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="459 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="481069" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0234-01">459 Pa. 234</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="459 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="481069" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0234-01">328 A.2d 480</a> (1974); <em>Smith Estate, </em><a href="/pa/454/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="454 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="579859" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0534-01">454 Pa. 534</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%2021" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="314 A.2d 21">314 A.2d 21</a> (1974); <em>Masciantonio Estate, </em><a href="/pa/392/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="392 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="8845544" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0362-01">392 Pa. 362</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20362" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="141 A.2d 362">141 A.2d 362</a> (1958).</p>

However, we need not consider the merits of this contention as no objection to Mr. Doll’s testimony was made by the appellant at the hearing. She failed, therefore, to properly preserve the issue for appellate review. <em>Dilliplaine v.
