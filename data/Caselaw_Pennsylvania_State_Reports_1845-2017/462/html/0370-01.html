The court of common pleas concluded that, because school directors of this district are voted for by the electors of the entire city of Pittstown, the number of signatures required was 100 as provided under subsection (d). Appellant, however, contends that school directors are not specifically mentioned in section 912, and that therefore nominations for that office fall into the residuary clause, subsection (f),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and that only 10 signatures are required.</p>

It follows that where a governmental unit contains not only “an entire city” but additional areas as well, as in the present case, a candidate seeking an office elected by the voters of that unit must likewise obtain 100 signatures on his petition.</p>

Subsection (d) also makes no reference to mayors, city councilmen, or any other official elected by the voters of a city. However, these offices, because they are “voted for by the electors of an entire city,” are subject to the 100 signature requirement of subsection (d). The same reasoning leads us to conclude that school directors of districts containing “an entire city” are also subject to the requirements of subsection (d).</p>

School directors have taxing powers equal to, if not greater than, those of city council' men; their educational duties are as vital to the well-being of the community as are the governmental responsibilities of elected city officials. It is therefore highly improbable that the Legislature intended that candidates for school director could obtain a place on the ballot with only one-tenth the signatures required of candidates for the offices of a city included within the school district.

My reading of the statute as a whole compels the conclusion that the number of signatures required for a position on the ballot for the office of School Director is controlled by subsection (f) of Section 912 of the Election Code.

      <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>The drafting scheme of the entire section is clear. It first covers an office to be filled “by a vote of the electors of the state at large, . . . . ” It then refers to offices to be filled by electors of a senatorial district. Later, it speaks of an office to be voted for by the electors of an entire county, and then makes reference to an office to be elected by the electors of an entire city. <em>In those cases where offices customarily may cover more than one municipality, or portions of municipalities, the section makes specific reference by naming the office. </em>This is done in the case of a Representative in Congress, delegate or alternate delegate to a National party convention, State senator, Representative in the General Assembly, and member of a State committee. These are offices which may include portions of various municipalities within the area they cover, or which may include within their area all of a single municipality. Unlike these specifically named offices, the office of School Director is not mentioned in this section. When read in this context, the phrase “an office to be voted for by the electors of an entire city . . .” refers to offices of that city only, and not to offices to be voted for by the <em>electors of an entire school district. </em>Strictly speaking, a school director is elected by the voters of an entire school district, not those of a county or of a city. It may be that by geographical accident the area covered by the school district could be coterminous with the area of a certain city or county, but it is still the <em>electors of the school district, </em>not those of the city or county, who vote for its directors.</p>
    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[236,1971,1146,375]],["BL_414.1",414,[277,296,1155,312]]]'>In Section 912, three different descriptions are used when referring to electors. The section sometimes refers to <em>electors of an entire city, </em>it sometimes refers to <em>electors of an entire county, </em>and it sometimes refers to <em>electors of the state. </em>In the context of the entire section, it is clear that the <em>same elector </em>is described in three different ways indicating that three different meanings were <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>intended depending upon whether the nomination petition is for a city office, a county office, or a state office. Thus, the legislature was clearly not referring only to the residency of the electors, but was referring to the kind of office — a city office — to be voted for by the electors when it used the phrase, “electors of an entire city.”</p>
    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[266,644,1162,1017]]]'>The scheme of the section is not necessarily one which increases the number of signatures required on a nominating petition as the geographical area or population increases. Subsection (c), for instance, requires 200 signatures for a representative in Congress, and the same number of signatures for a State Senator, even though a congressional district is greater in population, and in some situations larger in area, than a senatorial district. Subsection (d) requires 100 signatures for an office to be voted for by the <em>electors of an entire county </em>and the same number of signatures for an office to be voted for by the <em>electors of an entire city. </em>In all situations in .Pennsylvania, except Philadelphia, <em>an entire county </em>is larger both in geographical area and in population than <em>an entire city </em>located in that county. Yet, 100 signatures are required in both cases. I am therefore unable to perceive any scheme in the section establishing a direct ratio between required signatures and either geographical area or population.</p>
