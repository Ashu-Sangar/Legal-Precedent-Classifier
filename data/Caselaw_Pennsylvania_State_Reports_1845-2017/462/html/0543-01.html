Following a brief conversation, Hawkins went upstairs, dressed and left the house in the company of Davenport. The two men entered a red Mustang with a white racing stripe, driven by a black male. At 8:00 a.m. the same morning, Hawkins’ lifeless body was found lying in the roadway of Gribbel Road, near Royal Avenue, in the Wyncote section of Cheltenham Township, Montgomery County. Death occurred between 2:30 and 4:30 a.m. The victim had suffered a violent assault during which he sustained approximately forty-five stab wounds. Articles of the victim’s clothing and two knives were found near the scene. The left rear pocket of the victim’s trousers was ripped off. No wallet was found on his person.

Davenport and one William Clifford Bartlett entered the bar and engaged in a conversation with the victim. In the course of the conversation, the victim said to Bartlett in the presence of Davenport, “I have the five bills”. On January 12, 1970, approximately one day before his death, Hawkins was visited at his residence by David Byrd. Hawkins threw a roll of bills onto the drainboard of the sink and asked Byrd to count the money. The roll of bills amounted to approximately five hundred and forty dollars. On January 19, 1970, five days after the death of Hawkins, a wallet was removed from a sewer at 21st and Spencer Streets in Philadelphia. The wallet contained no money, but contained photographs, papers and identification which indicated the wallet belonged to the victim. Mrs. Hawkins, however, found no money in the house after her husband’s body was recovered. The sewer inlet at 21st and Spencer Streets is located within a few blocks of Davenport’s residence, the residence of the victim and the. Babydoll Bar. William Clifford Bartlett, a black male, was at the time registered as the owner of a red Mustang with a white racing stripe, similar to the one Hawkins and Davenport drove off in shortly before the victim met his death. Davenport had been employed from May of 1968 until June of 1969. by the Sanitation Department of Cheltenham Township. The truck to which he had regularly been assigned collected trash in the Wyncote section, including the area of Gribbel Road and Royal Avenue.</p>

    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[223,808,1158,1554]]]'>On January 20, 1970, following Davenport’s arrest, the Montgomery County coroner at the behest of police officials extracted a blood sample from him to type and compare with that of the victim. No prior judicial authorization was obtained for this seizure. At a hearing on a motion to suppress, the district • attorney presented a search warrant application to the court for a second blood sampling. Defense counsel, although admitting that probable cause existed and the results of a second opposed the application as untimely. This blood test would be identical to the first, suppression court found it unnecessary to rule upon the application, and upheld the legality of the initial seizure on the grounds that Davenport had consented thereto. The evidence of the blood test was introduced into evidence at trial. On appeal to this Court, we reversed Davenport’s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. Mr. Justice Pomeroy filed an opinion in support of the reversal order stating, inter alia, evidence of the blood was not properly admitted at trial, because the record failed to demonstrate that Davenport had knowingly and intelligently waived his Fourth Amendment rights in submitting to the extraction. Mr. Justice Eagen and Mr. Justice O’Brien joined in the Pomeroy opinion. Mr. Justice ¡Roberts, Mr. Justice Nix and Mr. Justice Manderino did not join in the opinion, but did join in the Court’s order. Mr. Chief Justice Jones noted a dissent. See <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>Prior to Davenport’s second trial, the Commonwealth presented to the trial Court a second application for a search warrant, termed a “petition to require a blood sample”. The court, after hearing argument, granted the application. A second blood sample was then taken. A subsequent motion to suppress this evidence was denied, and the results of this blood test were introduced into evidence at Davenport’s second trial in November 1973.</p>
    <p id="b584-4" data-blocks='[["BL_584.4",584,[249,847,1161,1027]]]'> Davenport’s first claim pertaining to the second blood sample is that the Commonwealth in presenting its case to the grand jury prior to his first trial in effect certified that it had concluded its investigation upon which the presentment was based, and accordingly should be precluded from continuing its investigation by securing a second blood sample. No authority is cited for this claim, and we are not persuaded thereby. In theory, the function of a grand jury in our system of criminal justice is to ascertain whether the Commonwealth’s evidence makes out a prima facie case. See <em>Commonwealth v. Webster, </em><a href="/pa/462/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="462 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="485147" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0125-01">462 Pa. 125</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="337 A.2d 914" data-case-ids="485147,485196" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0125-01,/pa/462/0124-01">337 A.2d 914</a> (1975). The Commonwealth by its presentment to the grand jury indicates its belief that there is sufficient evidence to justify bringing a defendant to trial on the charges specified. No certification is made that the investigation has been completed, and we know of no authority saying the Commonwealth may not continue its investigation even after an indictment is returned.</p>
    <p id="b584-5" data-blocks='[["BL_584.5",584,[246,1929,1158,417]]]'>Secondly, and in a related vein, Davenport argues that the thirty-nine month time lag between indictment and the extraction of the second blood sample renders the seizure unreasonable. However, this contention overlooks the fact that the second blood sample was secured pursuant to a search warrant.

These contentions are: (1) that a statement made by the trial judge in the course of overruling defense counsel’s objection to admission of the second knife was prejudicial; (2) that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence three photographs presented by the Commonwealth showing a view of the victim’s home with a police car parked in front of it; and (3) that the trial judge permitted a certain David Byrd to testify to a conversation he overheard between the victim and co-felon Bartlett in the presence of Davenport.</p>

Appellant’s demurrer to the. evidence should have been sustained and a. directed verdict entered in his favor. The majority correctly notes that none of the facts proven by the prosecution, together with the rea<a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>sonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, would be sufficient to establish guilt when considered individually. I cannot, however, agree with their conclusion that the collective strength of the evidence presented is sufficient to warrant a jury in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In my opinion, such a verdict could only be based upon conjecture, suspicion, and surmise.</p>

    <p id="b594-6" data-blocks='[["BL_594.7",594,[278,1064,1161,917]]]'>In the suppression motion filed preceding his second trial, appellant clearly questioned the applicability of the “plain view” doctrine to this case. See <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em><a href="/us/403/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="403 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="12027286" data-case-paths="/us/403/0443-01">403 U.S. 443</a>, <a href="/us/403/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="403 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="12027286" data-case-paths="/us/403/0443-01">91 S.Ct. 2022</a>, <a href="/us/403/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="403 U.S. 443" data-case-ids="12027286" data-case-paths="/us/403/0443-01">29 L.Ed.2d 564</a> (1971). The suppression court, concluding that it was bound by the views on this issue expressed in the plurality opinion in appellant’s first appeal to this Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> refused to hear evidence on this question and ruled the evidence admissible. The court having ruled on the claim, further objection by appellant was unnecessary until post-verdict motions were filed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Moreover, any attempt to offer to “introduce any testimony to fortify the challenge," <em>ante </em>at 75, would have been futile in light of the court’s ruling. Therefore, appellant did all that was necessary to present the issue- to the suppression court and has not forfeited his claim that the evidence was illegally seized.</p>

At this suppression <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>hearing, he should have been allowed to raise any issue not decided adversely to him in his previous appeal. Cf. <em>Kuchinic v. McCrory, </em><a href="/pa/422/0620-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="422 Pa. 620" data-case-ids="1901683" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0620-01">422 Pa. 620</a>, 625-26 n. 7, <a href="/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20897" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="222 A.2d 897">222 A.2d 897</a>, 900 n. 7 (1966). Here, as the majority correctly concludes, this Court did not rule on whether the trousers, rags, and jacket should have been suppressed. The appellant was therefore entitled to an opportunity to urge their suppression at the new suppression hearing and to obtain a ruling on their admissibility. Because he was deprived of that opportunity, I would vacate the judgment of sentence and remand the case to the suppression court to consider appellant’s suppression claim. If the suppression court found the evidence to have been seized in violation of the fourth amendment of the Constitution of the United States, or article I, section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, a new trial would be required; if the supression court determined that suppression was properly refused, appellant would be permitted an appeal from that decision.</p>
