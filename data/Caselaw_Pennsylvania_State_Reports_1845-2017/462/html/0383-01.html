That case is not only distinguishable because of the difference in the length of police detention but equally as important is that the authorities permitted the accused’s relatives to be with and confer with him at crucial stages during the interrogation. Irvin’s parents returned to police headquarters in response to a telephone call at approximately 3:00 P.M. advising them that they could see their son. After spending five <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>hours attempting unsuccessfully to see their son they returned home and did not see him until after the contested statement had been secured. It is thus apparent that although the parents were present they were denied the opportunity to confer with their son during the period that ultimately proved to be the most critical of the entire interrogating process.</p>
    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[244,711,1151,635]]]'>While the record does not conclusively establish that the inability of the parents to see their son at this point was as a result of the deliberate design of the officers conducting the investigation, it is fair to conclude that it does suggest the probability of this fact. While this Court has not stated that police officials have an affirmative duty to provide a youthful accused with the benefit of a parent’s counsel during questioning, any indication that they (police) prevented this right of consultation during interrogation strongly suggests an intention to preserve the isolation of the accused and to employ it as a tool to overcome his will.</p>

At trial the defendant, as was his right, again challenged the voluntariness of the confession. Pa.R.Cr. P. 323(j), 19 P.S. Appendix (Supp.1974-75). The jury was instructed at length concerning the voluntariness issue and was specifically told that if they determined that the confession was involuntary they should “disregard [it] completely” and could properly find the defendant not guilty. The appellant has no quarrel with the judge’s charge on this issue, and took no exception to it. Notwithstanding these decisions by the finders of fact at the trial level, the Court today holds as a matter of law, that the confession “was not the product of a free will but rather the result of coercion.” Opinion, <em>ante </em>at 134. My own examination of the record satisfies me that the lower court result is supportable, and I would abide by its decision. I therefore dissent. <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Commonwealth v.

The case cited by the majority which is perhaps the closest factually to the case at bar is <em>Commonwealth v. Eiland, </em><a href="/pa/450/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="450 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1947027" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0566-01">450 Pa. 566</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20651" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="301 A.2d 651">301 A.2d 651</a> (1973). In that case, the defendant was a 20 year old with a 10th grade education who when interrogated by the police initially denied any involvement in the crime of which he was ultimately convicted and who was isolated for several periods of time during the span of the interrogation. He confessed 11 hours later and was not arraigned until 25 hours after arrest. In <em>Eiland, </em>however, it was not merely the length of interrogation which rendered the confession involuntary but the fact that what precipitated the confession 11 hours after interrogation began was a promise of lenien<a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>cy by the police if the defendant would confess. We there held that the <em>combination </em>of these factors “constituted a subtle but nonetheless powerful form of impermissible psychological coercion.” Id. at 574, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20651" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="301 A.2d 651">301 A.2d at 654</a>.</p>

While almost 19 and one-half hours passed between the time appellant was first questioned and the time he completed signing his formal written confession, the interrogation was not continuous during that period; Irvin was given frequent and ample opportunity to rest, eat and use the bathroom. He was permitted to see and converse with his parents. Furthermore, appellant first admitted his presence at the scene of the crime approximately 4 and one-half hours after the onset of interrogation. His admission of participation in the stabbing was made within 7 hours of this first inculpatory statement and less than 11 hours following commencement of the questioning. I find nothing in these time spans to justify this Court in accusing the police of a “blatant effort” to undermine appellant’s capacity to resist, or of having “tortuously extracted” each concession from him. On the contrary, the suppression court and the jury at trial had ample evidentiary support for a finding that the entire period was taken up with legitimate efforts on the part of the police directed towards the solving of two stabbing assaults, one involving Irvin and another which occurred almost simultaneously, in order to charge those who were shown to have participated. It is for these <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>reasons that I am unwilling to declare, as does the majority, that the final product of appellant’s interrogation was coerced and involuntary as a matter of law.
