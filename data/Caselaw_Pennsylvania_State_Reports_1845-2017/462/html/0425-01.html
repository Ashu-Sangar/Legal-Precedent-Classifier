As we have seen, judgment as to the existence of such a relationship for purposes of this Act must be made with more then the common law concepts in mind.

While the Register of Wills is ex officio Clerk of the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas, a degree of separation between the two offices is maintained. The joint requests for certification of the union as collective bargaining agent provided that the employees of each office would constitute a separate bargaining unit. However, a single collective bargaining agreement covering both groups of employees was executed by Register King and the union.

While the collective bargaining agreement has expired, we conclude that this does not render the case moot.

There is much dispute between the parties regarding the degree of control vested in the Register regarding such questions as holidays, vacations, sick leave, etc. The agreement involved in this case provides that these benefits shall be the same as those granted to employees of the City represented by a specified union (which apparently represents all of those employed directly by the City who are covered by the Public Employee Relations Act). Appellant maintains that he is powerless to deviate from City practice in these matters. Appellee maintains, that, despite a long tradition of uniformity on these matters, appellant is free to make such provision for them as he deems proper, subject only to the constraints imposed by the overall appropriations available to the office. We find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute in view of the uncontested fact that the City provides several key benefits not included in the budget of the Register of Wills.
