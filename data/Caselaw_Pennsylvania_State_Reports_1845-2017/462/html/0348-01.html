Peter and Paul Greek Catholic Church of Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania, a corporation, is and has been since its founding a uníate Greek Catholic Church in union with Rome. The appellants are former officers of the church corporation. The appellee is Ambrose Senyshyn, Archbishop of The Philadelphia Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Catholics of the Byzantine Rite of the United States, who instituted this action to enjoin the appellants from interfering with “the operation” of the church and to secure from the appellants an accounting of certain church assets alleged to be in their possession.</p>
    <p id="b382-6" data-blocks='[["BL_382.6",382,[261,1189,1155,908]]]'>The dispute arose when two separate factions of the congregation elected different sets of officers and directors of the church corporation. On November 15, 1969, an annual meeting was called by the appellants, the then officers and directors, for the purpose of electing new officers and a Board of Directors. This meeting was, however, adjourned without any balloting. When appellants, after repeated requests, failed to reconvene a meeting for the aforementioned purpose, the pastor of the church, Father Paul Burak, called a meeting of the congregation. This meeting was conducted May 31, 1970, and resulted in the election of certain officers and directors. On June 18, 1970, the appellants convened another meeting at which they were re-elected to the offices they had previously held. Thus, there were two competing groups laying claim to the same offices. The appellants remained in control of the church property and assets.</p>

    <p id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[281,676,1159,475]]]'>The appellant’s main argument is that the chancellor erred in going beyond the 1893 charter of the church corporation to resolve the instant dispute. The chancellor, relying in part upon our decision in <em>St. John Chrysostom Greek Catholic Church of Pittsburgh v. Elko, </em>supra, ruled that the charter was inconclusive as to the ecclesiastical nature of Sts. Peter and Paul and in his search for the ultimate authority in the church admitted evidence of subsequent rituals and practices.</p>
    <p id="b384-5" data-blocks='[["BL_384.6",384,[278,1182,1157,420]]]'>Specifically, the appellants urge the following four aspects of the charter conclusively determine the intent of the church founders to establish an independent church free of hierarchical authority: (1) the name given the church; (2) the purpose expressed; (3) a consideration of what the charter omits to state; and (4) the provision vesting control of church property in the majority of lay members of the congregation.</p>

This Court has previously noted that the term “Greek Catholic” can refer to: (1) an independent church; (2) an orthodox church under a patriarch; or (3) a uniate church (i. e. <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>in union with Rome). <em>St. John Chrysostom Greek Catholic Church of Pittsburgh v.

    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[238,584,1146,421]]]'>The purpose of the charter suffers from the same ambiguity. The charter recites the purpose of the proposed corporation to be “the support of the public worship of Almighty God according to the faith and the doctrines of the Greek Catholic Church in the United States . ” Again, since the term “Greek Catholic” is not clear and free of ambiguity, a definitive conclusion cannot be deduced from the purpose clause.</p>
    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[235,1028,1149,630]]]'>The appellants urge that the omission of any words such as “uniate” or “united” demonstrates a lack of intention on the founders’ part to affiliate with any hierarchical organization. If the founders’ intent were so to affiliate, appellants argue, there would have been no simpler way to express that intent than by the inclusion of such words. This argument, however, is a two-edged sword. It can just as readily be inferred that the absence of the term “independent” or “autonomous” or words of like import indicates a lack of intention on the founders’ part to be independent of any hierarchical affiliation.</p>

Peter and Paul was incorporated. Since, at that time, power of control over church properties was by force of this statute lodged in the lay members of the church or their authorized representatives, the incorporation of the language of this statute into the corporate charter merely described the situation that would have obtained in the absence of such language.

Archbishop Sembratovich sent a Father Ivan Volansky to the Shenandoah area in December 1884. Father Volansky had the jurisdictional faculties granted to him by Archbishop Sembratovich, and also jurisdiction from the Pope to act as a missionary in the United States. Following his arrival Father Volansky established parishes in Shenandoah, Shamokin, and also Mount Carmel. On February 10, 1893, a corporate charter, issued in the name of “The Greek Catholic Church of Mount Carmel”, was granted by the Court of Common Pleas of Northumberland County.

That act vests control and disposition of church properties in the officers or authorities of the- church, congregation or religious society having a controlling power according to the rules thereof; this control shall be exercised in accordance with and subject to the rules and regulations of the religious body, denomination or organization to which such church congregation or religious society shall belong, any provision in the charter to the contrary notwithstanding. The legislature was thus of the opinion that a charter provision providing for lay control of church property did not exclude the possibility of hierarchical control.</p>

Such an approach is unlike any used when we have before us the problems of any other legal person — including profit and nonprofit corporations. When we consider a dispute involving the control of a business corporation, we do not consider whether that corporation is a “uníate” with its parent corporation. We do not consider any kind of “nature” — eccesiastical or otherwise — about the business corporation. When we have before us a dispute involving a nonprofit corporation — for example, a charity — we <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>do not consider whether that corporation is in “uniate” with some national or international organization interested in a particular charitable purpose.

There is absolutely no need to consider the dispute in mysterious nomenclature, which has its proper purpose in other sciences, but not the law. Our law recognizes individual persons and corporate persons, and we have laws and regulations which tell us how to determine who properly has control of a corporation at any given moment. My review of this record indicates that the appellants are the duly elected officers and directors of the corporation. Until they are legally removed, a court should not interfere.</p>
    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[254,1253,1161,469]]]'>The majority opinion speaks of “uniate,” “ecclesiastical nature,” “hierarchical,” “rituals and practices,” “allegiance,” “religious authority”: language proper to the world of theology and religion — a world in which the constitution says we do not belong.

Appellants denied that appellee had any authority over the Church and refused to participate in the inquiry.

The “denomination . to which such church . . . shall belong,” if any, can then be determined from these authorities and its “rules and regulations, usages, canons, discipline and requirements” ascertained in a similar manner.
