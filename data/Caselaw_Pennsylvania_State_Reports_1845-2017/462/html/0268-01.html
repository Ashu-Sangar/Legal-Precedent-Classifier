The Commonwealth filed a complaint in assumpsit seeking judgment in the amount of $10,000 plus interest and costs against appellee, Transamerica Insurance Company. The asserted liability was predicated upon a bond (entitled Public Employe Faithful Performance Blanket Position Bond) is<a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>sued by Transamerica’s predecessor company which undertook to indemnify the Commonwealth against any loss, up to a maximum of $10,000 caused to the Commonwealth through the failure of designated Commonwealth employees to faithfully perform duties and/or properly account for all monies and property received by virtue of their position. Preliminary objections of appellee were overruled and an answer was filed. Thereafter, both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.4",303,[258,843,1152,417]]]'>Judge Kramer, on March 8, 1974, entered an order denying the Commonwealth’s motion, granting the motion filed by Transamerica, and dismissing the complaint. The single issue presented in this appeal and answered in the affirmative by Judge Kramer was whether the Commonwealth was barred from recovery under the term of the bond limiting the period of time in which suit could be instituted.</p>

Prior to a definite determination of the <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>suspected wrongdoing of this employee, the Commonwealth notified appellee of a possible claim, on November 4, 1968. On November 15, 1968, appellee responded by requesting the results of the investigation then being conducted by the Commonwealth. In compliance, the Commonwealth, through its investigators, made available the results of its investigation up to that point. On March 28, 1969, the employee was arrested for embezzlement and on April 16, 1969, appellee forwarded proof of loss forms to the appellant. On May 22, 1969, the employee, Mr. Davis entered a plea of guilty to the indictment charging embezzlement and on August 28, 1969, the Commonwealth returned the proof of loss forms claiming a loss of $48,094.11 during the period of the bond coverage. On October 17, 1969, the Commonwealth sent to appellee a copy of its investigation to complete the file. On November 24, 1969, appellee expressed a desire for further information and was advised by appellant on November 26, 1969, that all written reports had been submitted. At this juncture, the Commonwealth expressed willingness to permit Transamerica’s agent access to its complete files in the matter. This offer was accepted and an adjuster for appellee did examine the files of appellant. Additionally, at request of appellee, appellant supplied them with copies of specified checks. Appellee in June or July of 1970, requested photostatic copies of the back side of the checks in question. This request was also fully complied with by appellant. During August 1970 appellee’s agents again visited with Commonwealth agents and made further examination of the records. After August 6, 1970, but before August 25, 1970, the expiration of the three-year period, appellee decided to refuse to honor the claim of appellant. Despite the cooperative negotiations that had theretofore transpired, the decision to refuse the claim was not communicated to appellant before the expiration of the contractually agreed period during which suit was to have been <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>instituted. Having received no information as to the status of the claim, appellant wrote to Transamerica on October 27, 1970, requesting information. This letter was not answered. Appellant was first advised of the decision to reject the claim in a telephone conversation in November 1970. After an offer of settlement of $5,000 was made by appellee and refused by appellant, this suit was instituted on May 13,1971.</p>

In the <em>Howard </em>appeal, the act which was asserted as misleading to the plaintiff-appellee occurred during litigation.
