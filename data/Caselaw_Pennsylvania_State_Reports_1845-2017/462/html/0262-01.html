Moreover, the photographs were never identified or characterized as “mug shots” or even as photographs from a police file. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

In addition, there was no suggestion that the photographic identification was conducted in a Police Identification Unit, or that when the photograph was displayed a portion of it had to be deleted or covered over. In other words, aside from the fact that a police detective displayed the photograph, there was nothing else linking it to the police. It is highly unlikely that a juror would conclude from this alone that Carlos had engaged in prior criminal conduct. Thus, “there was nothing that should reasonably suggest to a jury that the photographs were obtained by police officials as a result of the defendant’s prior criminal activity.” <em>Commonwealth v.

However, he offered the testimony of his mother arid two brothers who stated Carlos was unmarried and resided in their home in Baltimore, Maryland, continuously from December 25, 1971, to March of 1972. During cross-examination, the assistant district attorney asked one of these witnesses, “Do you know the woman he [the appellant] was living with in Philadelphia?” An immediate objection to the question was sustained. The Commonwealth’s officer then inquired, “You know his wife, Barbara Carlos, who lives in Philadelphia?” An immediate objection to this ques<a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>tion was likewise sustained. A mistrial was not requested. It is now urged that by pursuing this line of questioning, “the [assistant] district attorney tried to paint an unfavorable image of the Appellant in the minds of the jury, which was completely misleading”. We are not so persuaded. Without ruling on the propriety of the challenged questions, we are hard pressed to see any resulting prejudice to Carlos under the circumstances. Clearly, it was not such a situation that would create a fixed bias in the minds of the jury and prevent an objective and fair verdict. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.
