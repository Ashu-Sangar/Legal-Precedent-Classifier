On June 8, 1972 the body of 14 year old Joey Wells was discovered lying in a creek in Fawn Township, Allegheny County. The deceased’s hands were wired behind his back and there were indications that he had been shot three times. During the subsequent police investigation it was learned that John McDade may have been the last person to have seen Joey Wells alive. McDade was first interviewed concerning the Wells homicide on July 13, 1972. At that time he was not suspected as being involved in the crime; No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given to him, and no inculpatory statements were made. The next day the defendant was transferred from the police station at the Borough of Tarentum to the Allegheny County Jail to commence serving a two-week sentence on a summary conviction for an unrelated offense. On the same day he was taken by county detectives to the Detective Bureau, where he remained in custody of the detectives for approximately eight and one-half hours.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

By this time he had become the focus of the investigation, and the questioning was preceded by the giving, apparently for the first time, of warnings concerning his constitutional rights, which were waived in writing. From noon until midnight of that day, the defendant was questioned intermittently, first at the. Mill-vale police station,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> then at the scene of the discovery of Wells’ body, again at the nearby Fawn Township Municipal Building where he was allowed to talk for about an hour with his mother and sister, and finally at the Allegheny County Detective Bureau. During this period, McDade made various incriminating statements to the police, culminating in a seven-page written confession obtained after his return to the Detective Bureau. The taking of this formal statement began at 12:26 A.M., July 18, 1973, prior to which the defendant was again advised of his constitutional rights, which he again waived. He then was told by one of the officers that he was under arrest for the Wells slaying.</p>

The defendant was permitted to converse with the women in a room out of earshot of the police. After this conversation one of the women then told the police that McDade wished to change his story, but that he was afraid that the police would “be angry with him because he told you a lie with regard to the gun.” Upon being assured that the police would not be angry, the woman requested McDade to repeat to the police the story he had told her and her friend. This he proceeded to do. He was not advised of <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>his constitutional rights before reciting this altered version of his story.</p>

A weapon was found, but, as it turned out later, it was not the gun used in the Wells murder. Upon returning to the Allegheny County Detective Bureau early on July 19, 1972, McDade made a supplementary written statement to reflect the changes in his earlier narrative.</p>

Accordingly, on July 28, 1972, after having served his fortnight’s sentence on the unrelated summary offense, McDade was released from the Allegheny County Jail and allowed to go free. Three months later, on November 1, 1972, while serving time in jail on still another unrelated offense, the defendant again made an incriminating statement concerning the Joey Wells slaying, this one to a fellow-inmate. The statement was communicated to the police by the inmate by letter.</p>

We thus must accept as a premise the decision of the suppression court that the formal statement was vitiated by the initial failure of the police to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings on July 13. Although we do not have that particular statement before us, it apparently was of a seriously inculpatory nature. As such it formed an additional link in the chain of causality leading from the initial failure to .inform appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights to his eventual admissions to his friends. See <em>Commonwealth v. Whitaker, </em><a href="/pa/461/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="461 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="483746" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0407-01">461 Pa. 407</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="461 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="483746" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0407-01">336 A.2d 603</a> (1975).</p>

Such factors, if truly present, would of course go a long way to dissipate any taint of previous illegality. Under the facts of this case, however, we cannot agree that these factors were established. The apparently damaging nature of McDade’s formal statement to the police understandably created a compulsion upon him to “come clean” by giving the correct details about disposition of the <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>murder weapon. Realistically, viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances, the statement to the women, repeated to the police, was in the nature of a mere amendment to the previous invalid statement which appellant, apparently out of fear, chose to transmit through an intermediary rather than directly. The detectives were aware that McDade’s purpose in requesting to see the two women was to discuss the homicide with them, and that conversation took place with police permission while they waited in the next room. Although this episode occurred outside of a police station, McDade was at all times in police custody and was under observation even during the conversation. We thus conclude that the Commonwealth did not sustain its burden of proving that the statement to the women was purged of the taint of the prior illegal statement; hence the new statement was properly suppressed. <em>In re Betrand, </em><a href="/pa/451/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="451 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1948584" data-case-paths="/pa/451/0381-01">451 Pa. 381</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=303%20A.2d%20486" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="303 A.2d 486">303 A.2d 486</a> (1973).</p>

Based on these facts the court concluded, in light of the exclusionary rule announced in <em>Commonwealth v.

It was for that reason that the appellee was neither arraigned nor otherwise administratively processed in connection with the Wells slaying, but instead was released upon the conclusion of his sentence on the summary conviction. At that point he was no longer in police custody and he remained at liberty until his arrest on another unrelated offense. It was during his incarceration on that offense that the statement was made to the fellow-inmate. McDade was not rearrested for the Wells slaying until April 23, 1973 and on that same day was preliminarily arraigned. For Rule 118 and <em>Futch </em>purposes, the critical time was that between his arrest and arraignment on that date.

It is to be noted that the oral motion to suppress did not comply with the requirements of Pa.R.Cr.P., Rule 304 and Rule 323, 19 P.S. Appendix (Supp.1974-75). <em>Cf. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turra, </em><a href="/pa/442/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="442 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="1935437" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0192-01">442 Pa. 192</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=275%20A.2d%2096" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="275 A.2d 96">275 A.2d 96</a> (1971). The court apparently permitted the defendant to proceed on the basis of an oral motion to suppress because the court was aware of the fact that the defendant was represented by new counsel, and that previous counsel had prepared a written motion which had become misplaced before it could be filed.</p>

However, I believe that it was also improper to suppress the statements made to appellee’s two women friends. The majority concludes that because the statements given to the women were “in the nature of amendment [s] to [the] previous [inadmissible] statement . . . there was a ‘real and direct causal connection’ between the two.” Moreover the majority finds that the statement to the women was tainted by the initial statement because appellee felt a “compulsion” to “come clean.”</p>
    <p id="b455-8" data-blocks='[["BL_455.8",455,[227,1222,1149,203]]]'>In my view the statements to the women were totally voluntary and independent of the initial illegality and the exclusionary rule to curb improper police conduct should not be applied to these statements.</p>

Indeed in this case appellee requested that he be taken to see the women. He talked with them alone and the statements made to them were totally voluntary. Clearly if a defendant, in custody, makes statements which are not the result of initiated interrogation, those statements are admissible. See <em>United States v.

The majority relies heavily on the fact that appellee felt compelled to use the women as intermediaries in order to “come clean” regarding misstatements in his initial statement. On the contrary the record reflects that appellee wished to speak to these women not because of the earlier statement, but rather because he wished to obtain advice and guidance concerning his predicament at that time. There is no evidence that he wished to tell the truth (i. e. “come clean”) at the time he voluntarily initiated the conversation with the women or that he was coerced by the police to speak to the women. It was only after this conversation occurred that the police were told that he wished to be candid and to correct certain misstatements in his prior statement to them.</p>
