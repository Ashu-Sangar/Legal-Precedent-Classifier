These students had been bused to school- for the past six or seven years on account of their classification as elementary students; but, because of the opening of the East Scranton Junior High School in the Fall of 1973, approximately sixty students from the Oakmont area were reassigned to the new Junior High School and reclassified as secondary students. The policy of the School Board as announced at a meeting on July 9, 1973, is to provide transportation for resident pupils in grades seven through nine attending elementary or secondary schools if no public transportation is available <em>and </em>the residence of the child is two or more miles from school, or for a lesser distance if a certified hazardous condition exists. The policy was against busing on the basis of hazard alone. Because the two and one-half mile route which the reclassified Oakmont students would have to traverse to and -from the new Junior High School was certified as a hazardous traffic area by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and because the lower court felt that the School Board “may” have abused its discretion in choosing not to bus the Oakmont seventh and eighth graders, a decree issued requiring the Board to bus these children conditioned upon the entry of security by the appellants. On appeal to the Commonwealth Court, the decree was vacated on the grounds that the lower court had not found the requisite clear abuse of discretion and that the lower court failed to make a finding as to adequate alternative transportation facilities available to the Oakmont students. The Commonwealth Court remanded for a reconsideration of these deficiencies. <em>Board of Directors of the School District of the City of Scranton v.

We add that the only evidence produced by the appellants was that a certified hazard to pedestrian traffic existed on the main artery between the Oakmont section and the new Junior High School, and that seventh and eight grade students had been bused in past years. The crux of appellants’ contention was that it was arbitrarily unreasonable for the appellee School Board to establish a policy which would be applied city-wide rather than creating a more flexible policy which could be tailored to the needs of individual areas. They also attacked the Board’s reclassification of seventh and eighth graders as unreasonable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The appellee countered that the reclassification of the junior high students in Oakmont was an entirely rational classification which merely served to standardize the student classification in this area with the already existing student structure in all other areas of the city. The <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>Board further claimed that it was required to apply its busing policy uniformly throughout the city because the language of Act 372 required all areas and all students in similar circumstances to be treated equally; the resulting increase in costs to the district from the busing of public and non-public school students from all other areas where pedestrain travel was hazardous would be prohibitive. The record shows that the Board, before announcing its policy, made an extensive city-wide investigation of the situation, including cost, number of students affected by the no-busing decision, relative geographic and hazardous situation of these pupils, and alternative available transportation.</p>

Judicial interference with the discretionary exercise of a school board power is permissible where the action of the board was based on a misconception of law, ignorance through lack of inquiry into the facts necessary to form an intelligent judgment, or the result of arbitrary will or caprice. <em>Zebra v.

However, it does not follow that a preliminary injunction is justifiable in every case in which judicial interference is acceptable. There is a higher standard to be met for the issuance of a preliminary injunction — and even more so for a mandatory preliminary injunction. Therefore, any misconception of law entertained by the school board must be <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>found to be an error of law which caused the school board to act outside its statutory authority before a court can issue a preliminary injunction. <em>Cf.
