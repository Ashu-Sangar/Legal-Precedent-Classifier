On September 24, 1973, the co-executors filed a Statement of Debts and Deductions with the Westmoreland County Register of Wills claiming as deductions for inheritance tax purposes $81,922.66 in administrative expenses. Included in this sum were executors’ commissions of $43,000.00. Thereafter, on October 29, 1973, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue notified the appellant that the sum of $66,922.66 was deductible. The reason given for the reduction from the amount claimed was the disallowance of executors’ fees in the amount of $15,000.00.</p>
