Goddard, Secretary of the Department of Environmental Resources, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Robert Broughton, Paul E. Waters, and Gerald H. Goldberg, individually, and as members of the Environmental Hearing Board, Department of Environmental Resources, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The appellant’s petition in the Commonwealth Court requested that a writ of prohibition issue to prevent the Environmental Hearing Board from proceeding with a scheduled reargument of a matter involving the appellant. In dismissing appellant’s petition, the Commonwealth Court held that it did not have statutory authority to issue the writ. The Commonwealth Court therefore did not reach the merits of the controversy. This appeal followed.</p>

As we said in <em>Carpentertown Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>the writ of prohibition is precisely the kind of writ that a court might issue to protect its appellate jurisdiction. It is “a means by which a court protects its appellate jurisdiction and may therefore be regarded as a writ ancillary to the exercise to such jurisdiction.” <em>Id. </em>at 100, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20426" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="61 A.2d 426">61 A.2d at 429</a>.

We cannot agree. The Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970 specifically repealed the first six paragraphs, designated(a) through (f), of Section 8 of the Commonwealth Court Act, but did not repeal subsections 8(g) or 8(h). Act of July 3, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223 art. V, § 509, <em>as amended </em>17 P.S. § 211.-509(a) (7).

Assuming for the moment that the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act is silent on this point, we can hardly read such silence as indicating a legislative intent to deny authority to the Commonwealth Court to issue writs of prohibition. This is particularly true in view of the legislative action of retaining subsections 8(g) and 8(h) of the Commonwealth Court Act, while repealing subsections 8(a) through 8(f). Such silence, if its exists, may well have resulted from the legislature’s belief that broad authority existed in the unrepealed subsections 8(g) and 8(h).</p>

Since the General Assembly provided a broad grant of original jurisdiction to the Commonwealth Court in Section 401, it would have been superfluous to refer specifically to its original jurisdiction over writs of prohibition, mandamus, and quo warranto.</p>

Section 201 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act gives the Supreme Court “original but not exclusive” jurisdiction in cases of prohibition to courts of inferior jurisdiction. (17 P.S. § 211.201).
