Pyle, on July 25, 1978. Following his arrest on the charge of criminal homicide, appellant petitioned the Chester County Common Pleas Court to transfer the matter to Juvenile Court for further action pursuant to the provisions of the Juvenile Act, Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, No. 333, § 7, 11 P.S. § 50-303 (Supp. 1974-75). Thereafter, on August 15, 1973, a rule was entered upon the Chester County District Attorney, to show cause why the charge should not be transferred. At that time the Commonwealth announced the filing of a juvenile charge of theft against appellant<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and petitioned the court to transfer this latter charge for adult criminal prosecution, pursuant to the Juvenile Act, id. § 28, 11 P.S. § 50-325.
