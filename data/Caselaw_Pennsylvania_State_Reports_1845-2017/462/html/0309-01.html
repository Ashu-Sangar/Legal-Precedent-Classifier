F. and Louise L. Zahorchak (who are, respectively, the president and vice-president and also directors of the company), had, purportedly on behalf of the corporation, alienated certain real estate of the company to Carl Lubetsky, Louis Zelekovitz and Morris Lubetsky, appellees herein. The complaint, brought against the Zahorchaks, the company and the three transferees, averred that although the deed contained a statement of authorization of sale by the board of directors, there had been in fact, no prior director approval. As to the shareholder-defendants, the Zahorchaks, equitable relief in the nature of an accounting for the proceeds of sale was sought, as well as injunctive restraint against any disbursement of those proceeds until after the final disposition of the litigation. The relief requested as to the three purchaser-defendants was a declaration that the sale was a nullity and an injunction prohibiting the vendees from taking possession of the premises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Even if the sale of the property to them was done without the proper authorization, there are no allegations of their knowledge or complicity in the impropriety.

The majority holds that the procedure may be disregarded and that the alleged sale of <em>all or substantially all </em>of the corporation assets is valid. In this case, the failure to comply with the statutory procedure may not seem important since there are only a few shareholders and the real estate allegedly sold was the sole asset of the corporation. The holding of the majority, however, would be just as applicable to a large corporation whose assets are many and varied. The evaluation of corporation assets in many cases is a difficult and time consuming matter. Intangible as well as tangible corporate assets may be located in many parts of the state or many parts of the country.
