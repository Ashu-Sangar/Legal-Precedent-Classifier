McComb, Appellant and Joseph Grosso, the deceased, had entered into an agreement which provided that the deceased was to care for appellant’s dog for a stipulated weekly payment. Disagreement arose over a delinquency in the payment for the services performed by deceased. On February 17, 1973, the deceased confronted appellant, while he was in the course of his employment, and demanded the balance of the money that was then due him. The appellant promised that he would be able to pay the balance outstanding at 7:00 P. M. that evening. During this encounter, the deceased told the appellant that if he did not receive the money that evening he, the deceased, would fight for it.</p>
    <p id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[200,1013,1150,534]]]'>Later in the afternoon of the same day, the deceased again met appellant by chance and demanded payment and threatened to drag appellant from the delivery truck on which he was working and take the money from him. Appellant then responded by stating that he had an ice pick, to which the deceased replied that if he (appellant) wanted to fight with weapons, he (deceased) would get a knife. At some point after this second encounter, appellant armed himself with a loaded revolver and then proceeded to finish making his deliveries.</p>
    <p id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[198,1571,1150,421]]]'>At 7:00 P.M., the deceased, with two friends, drove to the place of appellant’s employment. Appellant’s employer, desirous of avoiding any difficulty within his store, suggested that appellant meet the deceased outside. The deceased left the vehicle alone. As appellant approached the point where deceased was standing, he withdrew a revolver from his pocket, firing twice, fatally wounding the deceased.</p>
    <p id="b539-6" data-blocks='[["BL_539.6",539,[195,2017,1151,315]]]'>The appellant, in his statement to the police, attempted to explain his action by saying that he fired the weapon when the deceased approached him with something in his hand.

At the conclusion of the instructions given in response to the jury’s request, counsel for the defense requested:</p>
    <blockquote id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.4",540,[322,696,1112,370]]]'>“I’m specifically requesting that your Honor state that as a matter of law, the mere possession of the weapon does not make one the aggressor nor the provocateur, nor does the possession of a weapon in the pocket of the defendant in his approaching the automobile to discuss the matter with the deceased make him the provocateur and aggressor . . . ”</blockquote>
    <p id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[278,1105,1154,152]]]'>This request was complied with and the jury was so instructed. At the same time counsel for the defense also requested the court to instruct the jury:</p>

The argument of the appellant ignores the fact that the trial court is not required to give a categorical affirmance of the requested jury instruction even where the statement of law therein is correct, particularly where the court in its sound discretion believes that additional information, not included in the requested point, is necessary to assist the jury in its understanding of the issue involved. <em>Commonwealth v.
