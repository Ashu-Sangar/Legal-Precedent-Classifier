The mere fact that an accident happened is not proof of negligence, nor in this case is the fact that the boy had his middle finger in the comb of that escalator proof of negligence. There is no claim here that the boy’s finger got into that comb through any fault of the defendant, and that is particularly important that you keep that in mind. The negligence of the defendant as alleged by the plaintiffs in this case is that the boy’s finger, having been caught in- that comb, and the mother trying to keep the rest of the boy’s hand out, giving notice that the accident had happened, the employees of the store failed to use reasonable care in turning that escalator off so that when she grew faint after a time the boy’s hand went into the moving part between the tread and the comb, as <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>I understand the plaintiffs’ theory, and so you must start with the situation that the boy’s middle finger is caught in the comb and from that situation, just for our purposes, the fault of nobody, determine whether or not from that point on the defendant was negligent in failing to exercise reasonable care in preventing further accident and further harm to that boy.”</p>

That duty was performed as appears by plaintiffs’ abandonment of any claim for liability for the injury resulting from what we have referred to as the accident. The performance of defendant’s duty required something more than merely furnishing a proper escalator; it was also necessary to see that it was operated with due regard for the reasonable safety of such persons as should be expected to be brought in contact with it. The proper management of such operation necessarily involved stopping the machine if emergency required. The minor’s accidental predicament created the emergency. The first notice of it was the mother’s warning. It then became the defendant’s duty to do what was reasonably necessary in the operation of the machine to save the minor from additional injury, and if necessary, to stop the escalator. It could be stopped by pressing a button on the end of it at the floor where the mother stepped from the escalator or at the floor from which she descended. Defendant’s duty to the minor as a business visitor <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> required defendant to release him from the con<a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>tinuing effect of the moving machine, after having a reasonable time in which to stop it: compare <em>Frederick v.

Was it stopped in a reasonable time? If it was, plaintiffs have no case because the injury was purely accidental. If it was not stopped in a reasonable time, what injury, not sustained in the accident, was sustained after a reasonable time elapsed? Those questions, on the evidence produced, were for the jury, and while the great weight of evidence on this point was with the defendant, the jury found for the plaintiffs.</p>

Escalators are in common use in large cities. Photographs of the one in question were put in evidence. Considering the manner in which it was constructed and operated, it is, to say the least, highly improbable that a small child’s finger could have been lodged against the comb at the floor (under which the steps of the escalator disappear) for a period of from five to seven minutes, especially in view of the evidence that the escalator moved at the rate of 90 feet a minute; it is more likely that the finger would be torn off and his hand released long before such a period could elapse. Seven witnesses, called on behalf of defendant, testified with respect to the time that elapsed between the mother’s warning and the stopping of the escalator. They describe this period in various forms, such as, “less then a minute”; “about a minute”; “about a minute or so”; “almost immediately”; “a matter of a few seconds”; “a second”; “a few seconds, probably maybe fifteen seconds.” Some evidence, called by defendant, would indicate that at the time of the child’s injury the mother was not on the escalator with him; <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>that she was standing nearby. A witness testified that he stopped<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the escalator and “I realized that his finger was canght between the comb of the escalator and the tread on the steps and I called for someone to get a key to reverse the escalator.” The escalator was reversed and he took the child to the hospital in the store.</p>

(It was travelling at the speed of 90 feet a minute) and that three to five minutes elapsed between the time the fingers were caught and the time they were released. While the case was reversed because of error in the instructions as to damages, the Supreme Court of Indiana said: “. . . there could have been no incidental duty on the appellant to anticipate the accident, to instruct its employees, or to keep someone in attendance when the machine was in operation . . [but] it may be deduced that there may be a legal obligation to take positive or affirmative steps to effect the rescue of a person who is helpless and in a situation of peril, when the one proceeded against is a master or an invitor or when the injury resulted from use of an instrumentality under the control of the defendant. . . In the case at bar the appellee was an invitee and he received his initial injury in using an instrumentality provided by the appellant and under its control. Under the rule stated above and on the authority of the cases cited this was a sufficient relationship to impose a duty upon the appellant. Since the duty with which we are presently concerned arose after the appellee’s initial injury occurred, the appellant cannot be charged with its anticipation or prevention but only with failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid aggravation.”</p>

Law, properly so-called, whether civil or criminal, means essentially those rules of conduct which are expressly and publicly laid down by the sovereign will of the state and are enforced by the sanction of compulsion. ... If its [the law’s] full significance is to be appreciated, larger conceptions than those of the mere lawyer are essential; conceptions which come to use from the moralist and the sociologist, and without which we cannot see fully how the genesis of law has come about.” Excerpt from address of Rt. 1-Ion.
