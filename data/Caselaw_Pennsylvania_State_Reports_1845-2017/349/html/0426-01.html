He averred that in 1928, Sidney Blauner, Vice-President and General Manager of defendant, authorized to do so, called a meeting of certain of its employes who were named in the statement. He informed them that defendant was about to issue new stock and desired the employes to become stockholders and agreed that defendant would indemnify any who purchased stock against loss resulting from the purchase <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>if they were discharged; that, accepting the offer, plaintiff gave his order for 50 shares to Sidney Blanner’s secretary who transmitted it to stockbrokers from whom plaintiff purchased the stock. He avers that, as such employes were discharged, defendant indemnified them by paying them what they had paid for their stock.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The learned court sustained two of the objections made in the affidavit of defense raising questions of law, holding first that plaintiff could not recover on the oral contract because it was not in writing as required by the Act of May 19, 1915, P. L. 543, as amended by the Act of April 27, 1925, P. L. 310, 69 PS section 42,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and second, that the agent’s authority was inadequately averred.</p>
    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.7",451,[196,829,1150,314]]]'>We agree that if this had been a mere contract for the purchase of stock there could be no recovery.

The eighth para<a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>graph, quoted above, was a new paragraph not contained in the original statement, and is to the effect that, as employes, participating as described in the statement, were discharged, the defendant indemnified them “. . . by paying to them the said price for the said stock which they, these discharged employees had paid, pursuant to the said oral agreement of defendant. . .” The fact that the defendant, in cases of other employees, pursuant to similar contracts, indemnified them against loss on their shares at the time of discharge, is evidence to go to the jury, sufficient, if believed, to prove Blauner’s authority: compare <em>Dobbs v. Zink, </em><a href="/pa/290/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="290 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1104463" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0243-01">290 Pa. 243</a>, 247, <a href="/citations/?q=138%20A.%20758" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="138 A. 758">138 A. 758</a>; <em>Herman Nelson Corp. v.
