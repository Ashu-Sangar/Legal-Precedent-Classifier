Appellants were legatees and devisees under the tenth paragraph of the last will and testament of William Shannon and as such they claimed that they were entitled to a certain interest in a “three foot vein” of coal underlying lands devised in that will and they asked for an accounting for all rents, issues and profits which may have been received by one of the appellees from the leasing, mining and sale of that coal.</p>
    <p id="b573-10" data-blocks='[["BL_573.12",573,[216,1419,1152,639]]]'>Shannon, the testator, owned, inter alia, a tract of land of 230 acres. By an agreement dated February 4, 1896, he leased to the Beaver Coal and Coke Company, the “three foot vein” of coal under these acres for a term of 20 years unless terminated sooner under circumstances named in the lease. Coal in this vein was never mined under this lease, though minimum rentals as provided in the lease, were paid up to and including the year 1909. Thereafter there was complete default in the payments specified. It is admitted that the lease expired by its own terms, on February 4,1916, which was twenty days prior to the death of William Shannon.</p>
    <p id="b573-11" data-blocks='[["BL_573.13",573,[216,2071,1150,309]]]'>It is the tenth clause in Shannon’s will which gives rise to this litigation.

This contention the court below rightfully sustained. When Shannon leased the “three foot vein of coal” in and under the tract of land described in the agreement of February 4, 1896, his only interest in that coal became personal property. His interest in that coal as <em>real </em>property was a mere possibility of reverter. We said in <em>Smith v. Glen Alden Coal Co., et al., </em><a href="/pa/347/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="347 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="1217423" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0290-01">347 Pa. 290</a>, 301, 302: “This is not an estate, present or future, but merely a possibility of having a future estate” in the coal leased.

In the case of a fee limited upon a condition subsequent, it is a contingent right of re-entry upon condition broken”: <em>Copenhaver v. Pendleton, </em><a href="/va/155/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="155 Va. 463" data-case-ids="1852888" data-case-paths="/va/155/0463-01">155 Va. 463</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20S.E.%20802" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="155 S.E. 802">155 S.

He made provision for the other three sons and the two daughters who did not receive any real estate; by bequeathing to each of them $2500 in cash. He also made other cash bequests to his sons.</p>
    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[205,1494,1152,806]]]'>The tenth paragraph of his will referred exclusively to a legacy of personal property, which was the testator’s interest in the coal lease above referred to and in the royalties arising therefrom. In the tenth paragraph the testator specifically directed his executors “to collect and divide” “whatever is realized out of the three-foot vein of coal for which” he “gave a lease some years ago”. This provision clearly contemplated the devise of <em>personal </em>property, for testators do not direct the “collection” of real estate. On the day the testator died and for 20 days previously the coal in the three-foot vein had been by operation of law <em>real estate </em>and nothing else and its descent must be controlled by those provisions in the will which relate to devises of real estate. What these are we have already pointed out.</p>

In the <em>Hyde </em>case there was <em>no question </em>raised as to whether the property in dispute was <em>real estate or personal property. </em>There had been no lease <em>of any Jcind </em>ever executed on the coal, gas and oil under the farm described. The only question was whether the testatrix intended by her will to give the surface of her farm to her son and to devise the minerals under the ground on the farm to her four children. It was purely a question of interpreting the words of a will, which, as the court said, “was drawn by a minister of the gospel, who, it is apparent, was not an apt draughtsman.” The court said: “This case is not free from difficulty” but came to the conclusion that the testatrix intended to give the minerals under the farm to her four children. In the instant case the lease is well drawn. Nothing could be clearer than the fact that the testator expressly gave all his <em>real estate </em>to the children we have above mentioned, and that by the tenth paragraph he intended to divide among his eight children the proceeds of the lease which he had executed over twenty years previously, which had produced no royalties for over six years preceding the testator’s death, and which at the time of his death was absolutely non-existent. In other words, the tenth paragraph of the will applied to only <em>personal </em>property which was non-existent at the time of the testator’s death.</p>

Judicial <em>speculation </em>as to an individual’s intentions can never prevail over the unmistakable <em>language </em>of that individual’s legal documents. What is said in the Statutory Construction Act of 1937, P. L. <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>1019, about <em>not disregarding </em>“the words of a law” which “are clear and <em>free of </em>all ambiguity” “under the pretext of pursuing its spirit,” applies also to the construction of wills. When the words of a will are free and clear from all ambiguity, as this will is, its words should not be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing the testator’s “intentions.” 28 R. C. L., sec. 174, p. 215, lays down this principle “The purpose of construction, as applied to wills, is unquestionably to arrive at the intention of the testator, that intention is not that which existed in the mind of the testator, but that which is expressed by the language of the will.” (Citing numerous cases.) This court said in <em>Groningen’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/268/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="268 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1061559" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0184-01">268 Pa. 184</a>, 187, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.%20465" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="110 A. 465">110 A. 465</a>: “. . . our first duty is to examine the will, and if possible ascertain its meaning without reference to canons of construction.” We have repeated this in many other opinions. In 69 Corpus Juris, see. 1119, p. 59, is stated this principle: “The intention which controls in the construction of a will is that which is manifest, either expressly or by necessary implication, from the language of the will, or, as is sometimes said, the testator’s intention must be ascertained from the four corners of the will.” (Citing numerous cases.)</p>

The coal remaining unmined at the expiration of the lease, and at the death of William Shannon, passed, not under the tenth paragraph of his will, but under the other provisions thereof as part of the land therein devised.”</p>

Unquestionably, it was real estate at testator’s death. Upon execution of the lease for a term the law created a possibility of reverter in said coal: <em>Smith v. Glen Alden Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/347/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="347 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="1217423" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0290-01">347 Pa. 290</a>, 302. This purely contingent right existed in testator during the term, and, had he died during said term, in his heirs at law. The majority opinion erroneously calls this possibility of reverter a “contingent right of reentry upon condition broken.” These contingent interests are not identical and rights arising therefrom are entirely distinct. A right of reentry for condition broken is created by act of the <em>parties; </em>a possibility of reverter is created by operation of law. The former arises only when a condition in a deed, grant, or devise has been broken, thereby giving rise to a cause for forfeiture of the estate. A reentry upon the land must be made by the grantor or his heirs before the grantee’s estate is divested. In the latter, where the estate terminates by normal expiration the law returns the original estate to the grantor or his heirs. No act is required by him; he need not enter into actual possession, as in the ease of a reentry for condition broken: <em>Lyford v. City of Laconia, </em><a href="/nh/75/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="75 N.H. 220" data-case-ids="1797850" data-case-paths="/nh/75/0220-01">75 N.

Upon the normal expiration of the term of the lease in question Shannon became seized in fee of the coal as fully as if no lease had ever been executed. That there was also a condition subsequent in the lease— nonpayment of rents or royalties — the breach of which created a cause for forfeiture and the right to terminate the lessee’s estate by reentry for condition broken is of no effect in this case; no re-entry was ever made to effect the forfeiture. That the coal is real estate as of the date of testator’s death resulted by operation of law and not reentry for condition broken.</p>

Clearly, this theory of the law has no application to this case. The gift here remains the same. All that appellants were entitled to receive had testator died prior to the termination of the lease were the proceeds of the coal.
