      <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>One Abraham Plotnik, desiring to set np in his own behalf a business of publishing and distributing a daily paper or pamphlet devoted primarily to horse racing, similar to that of his former employer, this appellant, filed a complaint with the commission, alleging, inter alia, that the telephone company refused to render the necessary service to him and that such refusal was discriminatory. He presented copies of appellant’s publication as the model of his proposed activities. After hearing, the commission, on July 8, 1940, found that the refusal to provide telephone and teletypewriter service was justifiable, for the paper Plotnik contemplated publishing and distributing was a “scratch sheet” such as generally used by bookmakers in connection with the registering and recording of bets on horse races and that the facilities of the telephone company, if furnished to him, would be used, or might be used, in furtherance of horse race betting, which is contrary to the law of this Commonwealth. On appeal, the learned Superior Court affirmed the action of the commission: <em>Plotnik v. Pa. P.U.C., </em><a href="/pa-super/143/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="143 Pa.

On July 23, 1940, appellant filed its complaint with the commission, praying for an order on the telephone company to continue the service that it had been furnishing to appellant. Later an injunction was granted in the court of common pleas to prevent the threatened removal of service. After a mumber of hearings and the taking of much testimony, [the commission ordered the complaint dismissed. The commission relfdied its conclusion by a three to two majority, after one of the five commissioners, upon objection of counsel for appellant that he was disqualified by reason of bias and prejudice against appellant, withdrew <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>from taking part in the deliberations and decision of the commission.

The latter corporation maintains in New York City a racing library which is used not only by its handicappers and selectors, but also by the public and the Turf Writers Association — those interested in breeding and racing thoroughbred horses. Appellant’s publication, which has no subscribers and is only sold from newsstands at the price of twenty-five cents a copy, is devoted almost exclusively to furnishing information regarding horse racing at the various tracks throughout the United States. It gives the names of the horses running, jockeys, post positions, weights which the horses carry, probable odds, scratches, condition of the tracks, and other data of interest to followers of horse racing. Practically all of this information is given daily on the sports page of every newspaper in the country. There also appears in appellant’s paper, immediately preceding the name of each horse, what is called the “Armstrong Number”. This number, according to the testimony, indicates~9ie order in which appellant’s experts believe the horses will finish.

It is for the purpose of disseminating such information that the teletypewriters and the 40 lines and five ‘order turrets’ connected therewith are maintained by complainants. Information as to race results is received by teletypewriter and is given to anyone who requests it. In furnishing the results of any race the number listed at the left of the horse’s name on complainant’s sheet is given but the name of the horse itself is never mentioned . . . While the exact use made of each Armstrong sheet that is sold cannot be ascertained, the sheet, is employed extensively by horse-race bookmakers, i.e. those who receive bets on h^rsesrixiNNnladelphia. in the conducho! their business. FromTHíéuncontradicted testimony of Captain Craig Ellis, head of the vice squad of the Philadelphia police, it appeared that for the past 10 years bookmakers have used Armstrong sheets, and that in the past several years practically every one of the numerous raids conducted by the Philadelphia vice squad on bookmakers and bookmaking establishments have revealed the use of complainant’s publication.”</p>

The publication of a newspaper featuring horse racing is not illegal. Horse racing is not prohibited by law in Pennsylvania, and there is nothing in our legislative history to indicate that it is contrary to public policy. Furthermore, there is nothing inherently wrongful in horse racing, and it is nó more objectionable than baseball, football and other sports. Betting is not a necessary concomitant of horse racing. It is a well <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>known fact that many lovers of horses never place a bet on the result of a race, that while opposed to gambling they have a deep interest in developing and racing horses. Thousands upon thousands of people attend race meetings regularly for the enjoyment they get from the contests but have no interest in betting. A racing publication conveying information such as does the paper of appellant, though useful to the gambler in placing his wagers, is not a device or apparatus for gambling: <em>People v. </em>Engeman, <a href="/nys/114/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="114 N.Y.S. 174" data-case-ids="3341268,3362899" data-case-paths="/nys/114/0174-01,/nys/114/0174-02">114 N.

Similarly, the publication by the newspapers of the country or the announcement over the radio of the results of baseball and football games, prize fights and other such activities may be an aid to gamblers, yet no one would seriously contend that the furnishing of such news was against the public policy of this Commonwealth, and therefore such newspapers and radio stations should be deprived of telephone or teletypewriter service.</p>

This business exists not by reason of telephone service furnished by the respondent, but rather by failure of the law enforcement agencies to apprehend and put out of business such law violators. It is manifestly impractical for the Bell Telephone Company to seek out and discontinue service to every law violator, or to everyone who aids and abets in law violations within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and such an order would impose an undue burden on the Bell Telephone Company. Consistent with the majority opinion, the respondent should immediately attempt to ascertain the names and cease furnishing service to everyone in any way connected with the publication or distribution of this sheet, such as the carrier who transports it from New York, those parties who distribute it to the news stands, the printer who prints the information contained therein, as well as the individual who might merely, out of curiosity, desire information such as is furnished by the complainant and who purchases a sheet and uses his own telephone to call for this information . . . Merely 'because someone happens to use this sheet illegally is no reason to deprive those who, for reasons which may be perfectly legitimate, also desire to use the service furnished by the complainant.
