In execution, the sheriff sold the property to the plaintiff for $100, delivering his deed December 16,1940. On January 15, 1942, which was within six months of the approval of the Deficiency Judgment Act, plaintiff filed the petition to fix the fair value pursuant to the Act. On the same day, on motion of plaintiff’s attorney, the <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>court fixed April 21,1942, for the hearing and ordered a copy of the petition to be served on the defendants in the manner set forth in sections 4(a) and 4(b) of the Act or by publication pursuant to section 4(c). At that time the validity of the act was in litigation in a proceeding not terminated until December 4,1942, when the act was held constitutional: <em>Penna. Co. v. Scott, </em><a href="/pa/346/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="346 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="1216508" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0013-01">346 Pa. 13</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%20328" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 A.2d 328">29 A.2d 328</a>. At plaintiff’s request, the court continued the hearing, which had been set for April 21,1942, until the constitutional question was decided. After that, the clerk of the court, at plaintiff’s direction, and in accord with established practice, placed the case on the hearing list for September 21, 1943. A copy of the petition to fix the fair value, with notice of the hearing to be held September 21st, were served on one of the defendants on June 16th and on the other on June 17th, 1943. They answered and moved to dismiss, June 24, 1943, and on January 11, 1944, moved to strike off the service for want of jurisdiction over them.</p>
    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[236,1309,1153,479]]]'>The court below, in an opinion written by the learned President Judge, held that the continuance of the hearing set for April 21, 1942, was a proper exercise of the court’s discretion; that the clerk’s action in placing the case on the list for hearing on September 21, 1943, pursuant to the praecipe of counsel, was in accord with the practice of the court and that there was no basis for defendants’ contention that the court had not fixed a time for the hearing required by the statute.</p>

The sheriff’s return in this case showed that such returns were made. Section 4(c) goes <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>on to provide that if such service cannot be made, the court may direct publication. Section 4 contains a provision that “Any debtor, obligor, guarantor, mortgagor, and any other person, directly or indirectly, liable to the petitioner for the payment of the debt, and any owner or owners of the property affected thereby who is not named in said petition nor served with a copy thereof or notice of the filing thereof as provided in this section shall be deemed to be discharged from all personal liability to the petitioner on the debt, interest and costs, but any such failure to name such person in said petition or to serve the petition or notice of the filing thereof shall not prevent proceedings against respondent or respondents named and served.” Section 5 requires the return of service to set forth particularly the time, place and manner thereof and that it be filed before the time fixed for hearing. That was done. It also provides: “No hearing shall be had until the court shall be satisfied that service has been made upon all the respondents in any of the methods herein provided.” That provision vests discretion in the court.</p>

After the sale, as the law then was, defendants remained liable for the balance of their judgment debt. Thereafter, in the regulation of executions against real estate, the legislature passed the Deficiency Judgment Act of July 16, 1941, P.L. 400, 12 PS section 2621.1, which, in section 7, provided that if a plaintiff desires to hold a defendant for anything more than was realized at the sheriff’s sale, he must, within six months, file a petition to have the fair value fixed and credited on the judgment debt, and “That, if the sale occurred prior to the effective date of this act [as in the case disclosed by this record] the plaintiff pha.11 file such petition within six months after the effec<a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>tive date of this act.” The act therefore is a regulation of the execution process, affording a judgment creditor the right to elect whether to accept the amount realized at the sale in discharge of the obligation or to elect to have the court, by fixing the fair value of the property, proceed to establish the amount for which further execution might be issued if property could be found.</p>
