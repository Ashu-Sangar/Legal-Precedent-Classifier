In 1929, the .Association acquired, by gift and purchase, a dwelling house and lot in Glenshaw, Allegheny County, which was extensively remodelled and dedicated as a Presbyterian Home for the Aged in November, 1930. It has been in active operation since that time. Becently there has been acquired, by gift, an adjacent property <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>so that appellant now has two dwellings and approximately one and one-half acres of land, free from debt. It also has a building fund of $27,000 and an endowment fund of $105,000. The original home accommodated nine persons. At the time of reargument before this Court counsel stipulated that the number of guests had increased to fifteen.</p>

The lower court said: “Miss Mcllvaine’s will is dated November 23, 1936, but this paragraph was copied verbatim from an earlier one prepared in August of 1934, and <em>there is nothing to show that she knew anything of these plans, or that the Association was in existence </em>. . . Since the legacy provided for the establishment of a home by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, a good deal of testimony was adduced to show that this particular Association met that condition.</p>

From its present progress and plans, and the character of the Association’s management, <em>I should say that it is very likely to qualify, but that is a matter for the future.” </em>With reference to “establishing a home” by appellant, the court said: “It has an excellent start and the trustees are wise in proceeding carefully. <em>If this were at the expiration of the twenty-year period instead of its beginning, we might decide that the trust fund should be awarded to the exceptant as most nearly complying with the general intention of the testatrix, but we are not at that point.”</em>

Careful consideration of the eighth paragraph of testatrix’s will and the testimony adduced before the Orphans’ Court evidence an intention to provide a gift to assist in the maintenance and support of a home established by the Presbyterian Church at some point in Western Pennsylvania. It is proper to assume from the evidence that she intended her gift to be for such a home, when and where established. For the reason that she was unaware of its existence, she wisely placed the amount in trust, the interest to accumulate thereon, with the direction to pay both principal and accumulations to such home when it was established. Realizing the possibility that a home might not be established within the period permitted by law for the accumulation of income, she named alternative beneficiaries.</p>

The twenty-year period is not a controlling factor in determining whether the home she had in mind was established. The gift is absolute and not restricted by any requirements with regard to size, the number of persons to be accommodated, and the assets of such home. That appellant’s home was not established merely for <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>the purpose of securing the benefit of this gift is clear since it was organized and established prior to her decease. The fact that the home is small, in comparison with other well known institutions of a similar nature, does not negative its existence as an established institution. A majority of this Court are of opinion that, considering the terms of the will in their ordinary meaning, there being no reason appearing in the will for considering them in any other sense <em>(McGraw’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/337/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="337 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1197271" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0093-01">337 Pa. 93</a>), the court below properly said that appellant <em>“has </em>‘established’ a home within the usual meaning of the word” but was in error in concluding as a matter of law “but not within the meaning of the will . .</p>
