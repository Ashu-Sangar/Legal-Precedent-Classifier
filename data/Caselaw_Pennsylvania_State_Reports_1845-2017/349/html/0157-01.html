Mrs. Taylor was a passenger in a car driven by Samuel E. Sweet, which came into violent collision with defendant’s motor bus at a street intersection in Erie. The case was clearly one for the jury, as we decided in the opinion this day filed in the case of Sweet v. Rounds, <a href="/pa/349/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="349 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="458500" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0152-01">349 Pa. 152</a>. The decision in that case controls this case for the attorneys for the defendants filed a stipulation that if this court decided that “the evidence was sufficient to justify submitting” to the jury <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>the question of defendants’ negligence, “the lower court was correct in awarding a new trial” because of the inadequacy of the verdict in favor of the husband-plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[251,452,1149,422]]]'>Since the actions of both husband and wife “shall be redressed in only one suit brought in the names of the husband and the wife” (Sect. 1 of the Act of May 8,1895, P. L. 54,12 P.S. 1621, and Rule 2228(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Civil Procedure), and since this act is mandatory <em>(Donoghue v. Consolidated Traction Company, </em><a href="/pa/201/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="201 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="925592" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0181-01">201 Pa. 181</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.%20952" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="50 A. 952">50 A. 952</a>), it follows that a new trial must also be granted as to Mrs. Taylor’s claim.</p>
