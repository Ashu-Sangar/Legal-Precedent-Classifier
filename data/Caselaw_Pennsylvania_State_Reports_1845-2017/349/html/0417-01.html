If, as contended by the appellant, the Register improperly issued letters to Margaret McCarty, the appropriate remedy provided by statute was to appeal to the Orphans’ Court under Section 21 (a) of the Register of Wills Act of 1917, P. L. 415, 20 PS, section 2005.</p>

The Orphans’ Court Act of 1917, Section 9 (e), P. L. 363,20 PS, section 2245, confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Orphans’ Court over “The distribution of the assets and surplus-age of the estate of decedents among creditors and others interested.” Identity of legatees is a matter for an orphans’ court determination at the audit of the account : see cases cited in Hunter’s Commonplace Book, Vol. II, p. 759, <em>et seq.</em>
