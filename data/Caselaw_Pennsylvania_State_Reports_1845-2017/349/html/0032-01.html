Apparently great stress was placed upon the use of the word share <em>in the singular. </em>They regarded this as referring to the share of the <em>son </em>(upon which a son received income) as contra-distinguished from the “share [payable] to the <em>child, children or issue” </em>of the son, as interpreted by the majority.

When the document was executed testator had no grandchildren. He was planning the ultimate distribution of the <em>corpus </em>of his estate “at long range”. His general testamentary scheme is plainly expressd in correct language. It was his clear intention that his children should share equally in the <em>income </em>until the death of the last surviving child, at which time the <em>corpus </em>was distributable to his grandchildren. This situation has frequently been before the court. It has always been held that such a gift to grandchildren, as a class, is per capita. In our opinion, what confuses this construction is that the testator substituted issue of deceased children by representation <em>in income </em>until the death of the last surviving child, and also substituted issue of deceased grandchildren by representation in such per capita share of <em>corpus. </em>A reading of the cases cited by Judge Hunter, which we later cite, reveals that such provisions have never been held to indicate an intent to change a per capita distribution to one per stirpes. Another confusing element is the direction that sons could receive portions of the principal, and the method of repayment <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>by the <em>issue of sons </em>when such issue received their share of corpus. And lastly, confusion in thought is created by the curious circumstance that one child left ten children surviving, two of the other three children left but one child surviving, and the fourth child, while having had two children, left but one child to participate in this distribution. It may well be that testator never contemplated such a distribution of grandchildren among his children, especially since the will was executed before he had any grandchildren. His testamentary scheme, erected by well-defined technical language, should not be torn down by a <em>supposed </em>contrary intention, which is merely <em>inferred </em>from what appellants presume would be testator’s intention had he been acquainted with the family composition at the time of the distribution of the corpus.</p>
    <p id="b59-4" data-blocks='[["BL_59.4",59,[227,1171,1147,866]]]'>It is conceded by all that the general testamentary scheme is plain and unequivocal. It is not unusual for a parent to give income to his children for life until the death of his last surviving child, and then to give the <em>corpus </em>to his grandchildren. Under such a testamentary plan, a gift to grandchildren as a class, of necessity, means a <em>per capita </em>distribution. A study of the philosophy underlying this principle will disclose that when a testator makes a gift to a group of individuals of the same class, he is not mentally dividing them stirpitally, and increasing or decreasing their shares depending upon the fecundity of their parent. He is thinking of each member of the class as an <em>individual. </em>Thus a gift to grandchildren, nephews, cousins, etc., as a class, can-notes an equal share to each individual of the class, i. e.: per capita.</p>

Moreover, the burden is increased where the language depended upon to alter the meaning immediately follows the clause creating the gift.

This, according to appellants’ view, suggests per stirpes distribution. However, each trust was dependent upon the others in respect to its termination, i. e., until the death of the last surviving child when the <em>corpus </em>was made payable to “grandchildren” as a class —thus per capita. Had it been testator’s unequivocal intention to pass the corpus <em>stirpitally </em>upon the termination of all the trusts, it would have been quite a simple matter for testator to provide that the grandchildren or their issue should take the share of principal upon which their respective parents had enjoyed the income.

In the Sixth Item, immediately following the gift of the corpus to the grandchildren in language which we have always held to mean a gift per capita, this phrase appears : “I <em>direct that the share which may thus be paid to the child, children or issue of any of my sons to whom </em>
      <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>
      <em>an advancement may have been made as provided in the Fifth Item of this my will shall be taken subject to such advancement and the amount thereof be deducted from such share”. </em>Appellants maintain that the direction to deduct the son’s advancement “from such share” refers to the son’s share upon which he was to receive <em>income. </em>They therefore conclude that this indicates a testamentary intent to pay the remaining part of the corpus per stirpes to the son’s issue. We are unable to accept this construction. After directing distribution to grandchildren in language which we have always construed to mean per capita, it is plainly stated that it is the <em>Cishare which may thus be paid to the </em>child, <em>children or issue” </em>of a son who received an advancement Avhich is to be “subject to such advancement” and the “amount thereof (to) be deducted from such share”.

President Judge Van Dusen suggests that the per capita share of a grandchild might be less than the amount of an advancement to the father, in which event, that branch of the family would get no principal, and which “the testator could hardly have intended”. It is not unnatural or unjust for a testator to direct that an advancement to a father be deducted from his child’s share in distribution. Here the advancement was to a son to enable him to enter business. If the child of such son gets nothing in this distribution, the result cannot be considered contrary to <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>what testator contemplated. Furthermore, the son received this part of the principal shortly before the termination of the trust, and it is quite within the realm of possibility that the grandchild now affected inherited that amount from his father. But whether he did or did not, such fact cannot influence this question.</p>
    <p id="b63-4" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[216,621,1148,1252]]]'>Appellants suggest that a child of a deceased child might have been receiving <em>income </em>on a fourth of the principal, and on distribution of corpus only receives a one-twelfth share. This is regarded as an anomaly. The answer appears plain. It is precisely what testator directed. There are many cases where <em>income </em>is given in different proportions than the <em>principal. </em>As noted above, there is nothing to prevent an equal distribution of <em>income </em>to children or their issue until the death of the last surviving child and then a distribution per capita to his grandchildren as a class. Nor are the various possibilities of increase or decrease of per capita shares to grandchildren, depending upon advancement to sons, sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the words of precise and technical grant. It may well be that, had testator contemplated that one of his children would leave such a vastly disproportionate number of children as compared with his other children, he would have made other testamentary dispositions. But he did not. He passed his residuary estate to his grandchildren, per capita, as a class. We find nothing in other parts of the will which indicates any contrary intent than that which he so clearly and unequivocally expressed.</p>
