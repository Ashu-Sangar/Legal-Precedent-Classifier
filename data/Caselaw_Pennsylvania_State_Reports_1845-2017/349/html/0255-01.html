There is but one important question involved. May testatrix’s heirs and next of kin supersede the provisions of the will <em>and prevent its probate </em>by a written contract? In considering this question there are two subordinate elements to be examined. Do the grandchildren possess a vested interest freed from all trust limitations? Are the contracting parties the <em>only </em>persons in interest?</p>
    <p id="b278-8" data-blocks='[["BL_278.11",278,[244,1711,1151,267]]]'>To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the facts and issues in this irregular proceeding has required an examination of the record itself, the excerpts printed in appellant’s paper book being inadequate for such purpose.</p>

Martin, the testatrix, was survived by a husband, John Martin, and one daughter, Daisy E. Boyd. Mrs. Boyd is married to Larry Boyd, and has three children: Laurence, Betty and James. While the record is silent on the subject we assume from the argument that all three grandchildren are sui juris and have not yet reached 35 years of age. Larry Boyd, their <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>father, still survives. Before testatrix married, she and her intended husband entered into an antenuptial agreement wherein each waived inheritance rights in the estate of the other. At the date of the marriage testatrix was 76 years of age. The marriage was bitterly opposed by the daughter and her husband. Their relations became decidedly unfriendly. Testatrix’s animosity was directed largely against her son-in-law. By the terms of the will the residuary estate, of modest proportions, was placed in trust with a named corporate fiduciary, having active duties, to pay the net income in equal shares to her three named grandchildren <em>during the lifetime of their father </em>with remainder to such grandchildren, as they respectively attained 35 years of age. Testatrix made certain <em>in terrorem </em>provisions. She directed that if any one or all of the grandchildren should permit their father to live with him or her, or should aid, assist or comfort him in any financial manner, the income should go to the.others, and if <em>all </em>grandchildren so acted, the trust was to terminate and pass to a named charity. The will repeats the provision that no part of the corpus is to be paid to any of the grandchildren before the death of their father <em>“nor until such child has reached thirtyfvoe years of age”. </em>The husband of testatrix was named as executor.</p>
    <p id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[201,1660,1151,209]]]'>The death occurred August 1, 1938. Caveats were filed against the probate of the will by the daughter and two of the grandchildren. An appeal bond was filed, but to date no steps have been taken to prosecute the appeal.</p>

The petitioners prayed that the will be set aside, as superseded by the family agreement, and- that the court appoint the testa<a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>trix’s daughter, sole party in interest, as administratrix.</p>

See cases cited in <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.L.R.%201249" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="317 A.L.R. 1249">317 A. L. R. 1249</a>, Annotations; 28 R. C. L. section 359, page 357; 4 Page, Wills, section 1760, page 947. One view is that such suppression is invalid as against public policy. The other view looks solely to the property rights of the parties to the contract. These <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>jurisdictions hold that since the parties could dispose of property rights acquired under the will, a contract is valid which disposes of such rights, even though the contract takes the form of suppressing the will under which they claim. In commenting upon the two views Mr. Page observes in volume 4, section 1760, page 950, “To suppress a will is usually criminal, and it would seem contrary to policy to enforce a contract which provides for suppressing a will and for rendering a collusive decree which makes a finding of fact contrary to the truth”.</p>
    <p id="b281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_281.4",281,[210,815,1154,1084]]]'>This Court, in several cases, has accepted the principle that the parties in interest, by family agreement, may supersede a will and prevent its probate.

It is clear, however, that under all of our cases any valid contract to suppress a will and prevent its probate must be executed by <em>all </em>interested persons ; also that the actions of the parties may be restricted by testamentary trusts. Under the Wills Act valid testamentary directions are required to be fulfilled. Beneficiaries under a will cannot unfetter testamentary limitations by the simple expedient of a family agreement. Compare: <em>Lloyd’s Estate, </em>supra, <em>Stewart’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/253/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="253 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1024038" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0277-01">253 Pa. 277</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.%20569" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="98 A. 569">98 A. 569</a>.

The former is for the register; the latter is none of his concern. Distribution is for the court alone, and, on distribution, and not before, is the validity of the provisions of a will to be passed upon”. <em>This will erects a trust. </em>It may well be that the <em>in terrorem </em>trust provisions are void, yet there remains for consideration the trust provisions creating estates in the grandchildren pur autre vie, <em>and until each grandchild attains 35 year's of age. </em>In addition to the reasons assigned by the court below for refusing the petition, it is to be observed that <em>all parties in interest </em>are not joined in the agreement. It is true that a copy of an alleged antenuptial agreement was attached to the petition. There is, however, nothing in the record to reveal whether such agreement has been either affirmed or repudiated by the surviving spouse. Furthermore, the corporate trustee was not joined. A trustee is required to defend the trust. The surviving spouse and the trustee should be parties to the agreement or brought into the proceeding.
