Thompson, employees of Philadelphia Transportation Company, August 12, 1941, while repairing a trolley switch on Fifth Street, just north of Allegheny Avenue, in the city of Philadelphia, were fatally injured by being struck by a heavy dump truck owned by Pasquale Capanna and operated by his brother, Philip. The wives of these decedents, as administratrices of their estates, brought separate actions in trespass in which they named as joint defendants the truck owner, the driver, and Eastern Asphalt <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>Company. The cases were consolidated and tried together, and at the conclusion of plaintiffs’ testimony as to agency, the trial judge entered a nonsuit in behalf of Eastern Asphalt Company. The jury returned verdicts against the remaining defendants in the sum of $4,000 for each plaintiff and in the sum of $2,000 for Helen Thompson, daughter of one of decedents, although she was not a party. Each plaintiff moved for a new trial because of the alleged inadequacy of the verdicts, and also to take off the nonsuit entered in favor of Eastern Asphalt Company for the reason that, under the testimony adduced, it was for the jury to determine whether or not the driver was an employee and under the control of that company when this unfortunate accident happened. Defendants, Pasquale Capanna and Philip Capanna, moved for judgment n. o. v. on the ground that there was no evidence to go to the jury on the question of the negligence of defendant-driver and the trial judge should have so declared as a matter of law.</p>
    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[247,1306,1152,752]]]'>After argument, the learned court below refused to remove the nonsuit entered in favor of Eastern Asphalt Company, because “The relation between Pasquale and Philip Capanna was that of master and servant but the relation between Pasquale and the Asphalt Company was that of contractor and contractee”; granted the motions for a new trial as to the other defendants, for the reason that “The verdicts for the plaintiffs were irrational and inconsistent and should be set aside”; and overruled the motions for judgment n. o. v., on the ground that the question of negligence of Philip Capanna, who was driving the truck involved, was for the jury to decide. These six appeals then followed, and being argued together, will be disposed of in one opinion.</p>

The driver was not that company’s servant, and, <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>therefore, it was not liable. The record shows that aside from and clearly independent of his employment as a service man for Eastern Asphalt Company, Pasquale Capanna was engaged in the business of general hauling for anyone applying. For this purpose, he purchased and was the owner of two trucks, one of which was involved in this accident. The hauling service rendered included the furnishing of a driver and truck. At the time of the happening of this accident, the truck was engaged in hauling material for Eastern Asphalt Company, to Avhich it had been hired by Pasquale Avith his brother and employee as driver. Under the hauling contract Avith the Asphalt Company, the driver was to take material from the company’s plant to consignees designated by its superintendent. Separate and apart from his compensation received as service man and having no connection with it, Pasquale was paid weekly by the company for his truck and driver, sometimes on an hourly basis and sometimes on the amount of tonnage hauled. He garaged the vehicle at his own home, paid his driver and also supplied all necessary tires, gasoline and oil, as well as made the required repairs.</p>

It is well-settled that the distinguishing criterion in determining whether the employment is an independent one establishing the relation of contractor and contractee^ or that of master and servant, is the right to control the means of accomplishing the result: <em>Lenhart v.

He never for a moment parted with that control of the management of the truck by the driver, whom he alone hired, paid and could discharge. The Asphalt Company was not in the business of hauling; that, however, was the business of Pasquale. He directed his driver to report with the truck to the yard of the company and its superintendent determined merely where the truck was to go and the load it was to carry. The company had nothing to do with the operation of the truck, nor did it attempt to assume such control. The employment was an independent one establishing the relation of contractor and contractee.</p>

Superior Ct. 487</a>, 489, where the facts were quite similar to those of the instant case, Mr. Justice Linn, when a member of the Superior Court, said: “The direction to one engaged in ‘general hauling’ to haul property to or from a specific place does not change the nature of, or convert a special employment into the general relation of master and servant; a man does not become answerable for the negligence of a taxi-driver, or of a carrier merely by specifying where he wishes to go or to have his property delivered.
