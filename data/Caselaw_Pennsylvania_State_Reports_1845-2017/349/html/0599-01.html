At that time the only amount which had been actually received by the Clerk of the Court, in addition to the $25,000 from Maryland Casualty Company, was a dividend payment from the Receiver of the bank of approximately 2.6% ($2,600), made on January 16, 1935, but by subsequent payments during that same year and further dividends paid from 1937 to 1942 there were received dividends aggregating 50%; a final dividend of 6.9% in 1943 brought the total of such payments on the claims of the bankruptcy depositors to approximately $57,000, so that the liability on the two surety bonds which secured those deposits was ultimately reduced to about $43,000.</p>

A hearing was accordingly held before the Special Deputy Insurance Commissioner, who, on March 30, 1942, filed a report recommending to the court that the claim be allowed in the full amount of $75,000 notwithstanding the previous receipt of the dividends from the Receiver of the bank, but without prejudice to the right of the Liquidator to cease paying dividends on the claim when .the claimant should have received from all sources the sum of $100,000, and without prejudice also to the rights of Maryland Casualty Company against National Surety Company arising from the payment by the former of the entire amount of the obligation under its bond; thus the <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>Commissioner did not express any opinion concerning those respective rights. But on February 21, 1942, a month before this report was filed, the Liquidator had paid to the Clerk of the United States District Court the sum of $25,000, which, by order of that court of April 8,1942, the Clerk was authorized to accept and to receipt for without prejudice to the rights of the Clerk and the Amicus Curiae against the Liquidator, and without prejudice also to any vested rights of subrogation of Maryland Casualty Company in dividends paid by the Receiver of the bank; it was further ordered that the Clerk and the Amicus Curiae <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> should assign to Maryland Casualty Company any unpaid balance of their claim in the liquidation proceedings, subject to any rights therein of the Liquidator by reason of payments made on account of the liability of National Surety Company on its bond.

Contending that the claim had been fully discharged by that payment, the Liquidator filed objections with the Dauphin County Court to the report of the Special Deputy Insurance Commissioner; those objections were sustained by the court and the claim was disallowed. The present appeal is by the Clerk and the Amicus Curias to the use of Maryland Casualty Company, but it is obvious that the legal appellants, as distinguished from the equitable appellant, have no interest in the outcome.</p>

      <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>From the recital thus made of the transactions involved in this litigation there emerges the outstanding fact that Maryland Casualty Company paid on its bond more than it owed and National Surety Company paid on <em>its </em>bond less than it owed. Since the net ultimate liability on both bonds proved to be approximately $43,000, and since the liability of Maryland Casualty Company compared to that of National Surety Company was as one to three, the former should have paid $10,750 and the latter $32,250, so that to make the proper adjustment at this time Maryland Casualty Company, having paid a net amount of approximately $21,500,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> .should receive from National Surety Company $10,750; the right to recover that sum <em>in these proceedings </em>is the subject of the present controversy. National Surety Company does not deny that Maryland Casualty Company is entitled to recover the amount it claims, but insists that such recovery cannot be effected under and by virtue of the claim of the Clerk but only as a direct claim of its own for contribution; if the latter course had to be pursued the claim would be paid only to the extent of 50%, that being the extent of the dividends declared in the liquidation proceedings of National Surety Company, and indeed would probably be barred altogether because not filed within the time prescribed for the presentation of claims.</p>

This question has been frequently considered both by our own courts and the Federal courts and the principle definitely established that when a receiver is appointed for an insolvent corporation the rights of creditors are fixed by the facts as they then exist; the creditors immediately become equitable owners pro rata of the insolvent estate, and from this it follows that if payments are received thereafter by a creditor from other sources to which he may have recourse, as for example, from a principal for whom the insolvent was a surety, nevertheless dividends are payable from the insolvent estate upon the basis of the claim as it existed when the receiver was appointed and without regard to such subsequent reductions, provided always, of course, that the creditor shall not receive more than the total amount of his claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The court said (p. 275) : “In America, and certainly in Pennsylvania, a surety paying the debt of his principal <em>is entitled tobe subrogated to all the rights and remedies of the creditors as against his co-sureties in precisely the same manner as against the principal debtor </em>and as substituted in the place of the creditor, and entitled to enforce all his liens, priorities and means of payment. . . .

The court said that there could be no doubt that if the creditor were pursuing the insolvent estate of the co-surety the claimant could prove the claim for, and be entitled to a dividend upon, the whole amount due, and therefore the surety who paid the claim was <em>entitled by subrogation to exactly the same rights as the creditor would have been allowed to exercise.</em>

The court said that the paying surety stood precisely in the shoes of the creditor whose claim he paid and <em>was therefore entitled by subrogation to the dividends to which such creditor would have been entitled, on the whole claim, as against the insolvent surety.</em>

It was required to pay a debt part of which, in equity and good conscience, was payable by National Surety Company. Tbe right of subrogation is not lost because tbe debt of tbe principal is satisfied or extinguished by tbe surety’s payment; on tbe contrary, it is just because of such satisfaction or extinguishment that tbe right of subrogation arises. When a surety pays tbe debt of a principal it is just as if tbe surety bad purchased tbe claim; tbe payment operates as an assignment of tbe debt pro tanto and of all rights of tbe creditor with regard thereto, including, as tbe authorities thus indicate, tbe right to proceed in tbe name of tbe creditor against a co-surety liable for tbe same debt. Tbe assignment executed by tbe Clerk and the Amicus Curiae to Maryland Casualty Company added nothing to tbe latter’s rights; these arose from equitable principles of subrogation which required no formal assignment either to create or to evidence them. In short, it is established that a surety may, at its election, work out its right of contribution against a co-surety not only through tbe medium of an independent and direct claim, but by way of subrogation to tbe rights of tbe creditor whose claim it has paid. Tbe contention of National Surety Company must rest for its support upon tbe time element, which is a purely adventitious factor; thus, if Maryland Casualty Company bad deferred its payment until after tbe claim of tbe Clerk bad been presented in <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>the liquidation proceedings of National Surety Company, dividends would undoubtedly have been recoverable to the full extent of the claim on the bond, namely, three-fourths of the loss after deduction of the dividends received from the bank, and then Maryland Casualty Company would have been obliged to pay only the remaining one-fourth of such loss; certainly the amount payable by each surety should not be made to depend on which paid first, nor should the one so paying be penalized for meeting its obligation with the greater promptitude.</p>

We are also of opinion that interest should be allowed on the dividends from the respective times they were paid to other creditors of National Surety Company but withheld on the present claim, with an appropriate credit, of course, for interest on the $25,000 which was paid: <em>People v.

The one is that, since there is no evidence on the record to the contrary, the law of New York is presumably in accord with that of Pennsylvania as herein discussed. The other is that the present claim comes within the scope of the agreement between the New York Liquidator and the Pennsylvania Ancillary Receiver; the fact that part of it is due to a use-claimant by way of subrogation does not affect the situation in that regard. It is at least <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>doubtful whether the Pennsylvania courts would not have had the right to adjudicate this claim even in the absence of such an agreement; in any event the Liquidator, by contesting the claim on its merits, submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the Dauphin County Court and thereby made the result binding upon himself, not only in Pennsylvania, but, under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution, in New York as well. Maryland Casualty Company, having the equitable right to work out its claim through the medium of subrogation to the rights of the Clerk, could exercise that right only in the jurisdiction where the claim of the Pennsylvania claimant was presented; to hold otherwise would be to make its right of subrogation abortive.</p>
