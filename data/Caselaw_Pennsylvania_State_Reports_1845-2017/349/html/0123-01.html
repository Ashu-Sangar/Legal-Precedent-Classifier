    <p id="b146-6" data-blocks='[["BL_146.9",146,[218,656,1149,807]]]'>The plaintiffs, LaAvrence Morata and Lawrence Valera, brought separate actions against the defendant, the Reading Company, on account of injuries sustained in an accident at a grade crossing. In the Valera case the defendant brought in Morata as an additional defendant. State highway route No. 54 in Northumberland County, intersects the Reading’s railroad single track at Richard’s Tunnel Crossing. On the night of November 14, 1941, an automobile driven by Morata, with Valera as a guest passenger, was struck at this crossing by the defendant’s train. Both appellants were injured and the car was destroyed. The cases of these two plaintiffs were tried together and the trial judge directed verdicts for the defendant company. Motions for new trials were refused. These appeals followed.</p>
    <p id="b146-7" data-blocks='[["BL_146.10",146,[217,1474,1151,639]]]'>On this state of the record we must assume that the plaintiff’s evidence “disclosing the true version of what took place”: <em>Grimes v. Pa. R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/289/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="289 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1103349" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0320-01">289 Pa. 320</a>, 323. The facts as testified to are as follows: A single track of the defendant crosses public highway route No. 54 at right angles; the road runs north and south and the track east and west; the crossing is comparatively level. The highway at the crossing is 30 feet wide. A hill starts about 25 feet north of the crossing. The track as it approaches the crossing from the west has an ascending grade of 3.4%. In the day time one had a clear view of this track 400 or 500 feet.</p>

The car’s windows were closed. The plaintiff, Morata, was driving a 4-door Packard sedan northward, and Valera was sitting on his right side. As the <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>car approached the crossing, the driver saw a truck stopped ahead of him on the tracks, and he brought his car to a full stop about 25 feet behind it. A car coming down the hill with bright headlights prevented Morata passing the truck, and his car stopped for about a half minute. Morata testified that when the truck started he looked and listened and did not see or hear anything, that there was no light on the engine and that he “listened for a whistle and they didn’t blow one” and there was no bell rung or any other warning given by the engine. In this he was corroborated by his guest passenger, Valera. Morata also said that he then proceeded to cross the tracks and at that time the other car which was coming down the hill passed on his left. That car was not struck. When his automobile was between the rails, he suddenly heard something and “saw a black thing coming toward” him. He couldn’t tell what it was because “it was too quick for him and it hit” him. The passenger, Valera, testified that there was a second stop when they came to about two or three feet from the first rail before Morata drove on the crossing, although on cross-examination he said that he didn’t “know as it exactly stopped but going real slow for time to look and listen”. He looked up and down the track and heard no noise except noise from an air compressor in the compressor house on the colliery grounds of the Colonial Coal Company about 300 feet from the railroad on the right hand side of the road. It runs all day. The crossing was in total darkness. The plaintiffs were acquainted with the crossing. After the engine struck the car it traveled about 150 feet. The driver did not know how fast he was traveling nor did he know how fast the train was traveling.</p>

The oral testimony of the defendant showed that the train consisted of an engine, five cars of loaded coal and a caboose; that both the <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>whistle and the bell were sounded in time to warn one at the crossing; that the electric headlight was shining on the engine on high beam, and that the train was traveling between six and ten miles an hour. The engineer testified that he saw the car coming 150 feet away from the crossing and the car did not stop at any time before it went over the crossing.</p>

He testified that he “was fifteen or twenty feet away from the crossing when (he) looked the last time” and his car was then moving.

    <p id="b149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_149.4",149,[217,455,1153,920]]]'>As to appellant, Valera, the rule is well established that “the negligence of the driver of a vehicle can be imputed to a passenger therein only when the evidence justifies a finding of the passenger’s right to a share in the control of that vehicle at the time of the negligence”: <em>Rodgers v. Saxton, </em><a href="/pa/305/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="305 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="1134604" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0479-01">305 Pa. 479</a>, 488, <a href="/citations/?q=158%20A.%20166" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="158 A. 166">158 A. 166</a>. That statement is in accord with the Restatement-Torts, Vol. 2, Secs. 490 and 495. See <em>Delling v. McKnight, </em>325 Pa; 251, 255, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20859" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="188 A. 859">188 A. 859</a>, and <em>Landy v.

The noise he heard he identified as that of “the air compressor”. His failure to investigate a noise in no way related to a moving train does not make him negligent. We said in <em>Nutt v. Penna. R. R., </em><a href="/pa/281/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="281 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="1087027" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0372-01">281 Pa. 372</a>, 377, 378, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20803" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="126 A. 803">126 A. 803</a>. “The phrase, Testing danger’ used in many of our decisions, is not accurate as applied to a passenger who rides as an invited guest.

In many such cases the right degree of caution may consist of inaction. In situations of great and sudden peril, meddlesome interference with those having control, either by physical act or by disturbing suggestions and needless warnings, may be exceedingly disastrous in results. While it is the duty of such guest or passenger not to submit himself and his safety solely to the prudence of the driver of the vehicle, and that he must himself use reasonable care for his own safety, nevertheless he should not in any case be held guilty of contributory negligence merely because he has done nothing.” See also Huddy Automobile Law, 5-6, p. 241, sec. 136.</p>
