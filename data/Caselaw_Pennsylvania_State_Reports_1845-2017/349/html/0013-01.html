The Board claimed credit of this sum on the basis of alleged discounts earned. The claim was heard by the Auditor General and the State Treasurer under the Act of March 30,1811, P. L. 145, 5 Sm. L. 228, Sec. 29, amended by the Fiscal Code of 1929, P. L. 343, Secs. 1003-1004, and this tribunal awarded the claim-ant the total sum claimed. No petition for settlement or review was filed by the Liquor Control Board. The Board refused to pay the award and a petition for mandamus <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>was presented to the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas. The return filed by the Liquor Control Board set up the defense that the Auditor General and State Treasurer failed to request the advice of the Attorney General on the légal questions involved and refused to accept and follow the law set forth in the brief of the Department of Justice. The Court below directed a peremptory mandamus to issue for payment of the award to the Distilling Company.</p>
