About 1890 defendant made a survey there for a single track branch line, and shortly thereafter the line was built; an embankment about 18 feet in height was filled in between low ground or marsh land and Little Sewickley Creek. A three-foot stone and pipe culvert was placed to carry a small sulphur stream under the track, and it was located about 400 feet from the lower end of the marsh. For many years this low ground was swampy with water in varying amounts, more in winter than in summer, but never amounting to much. About two years before this accident, the culvert became blocked by debris which had flowed into it, and the water which should have passed through it was diverted and flowed back over the low ground or marsh and formed a pool about 250 feet in length, about <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>90 feet across at its widest point, with a depth of 10 to 12 feet toward the center. This pool was plainly visible from the railroad track and defendant’s foreman, whose duty it was to keep the culvert open, passed this place many times in the two years before the accident but did nothing to remedy the condition. There is no doubt defendant knew, or should have known that the culvert was closed for a long period of time, and that the water that should have gone through it had formed a large' pool on its land and that of an adjacent owner. That defendant was negligent in not opening the culvert and releasing the water, is conceded. That such could be done and at-small cost is admitted.</p>

Where was the string? A. The string was on the pond. Q. What did they do? A. Yunko took hold of the string. Q. Yunko, that is Johnny, Jr.? A. Yes. Q. Then what happened? A.

This case must not be confused with those where the injured person is a trespasser on property of another who causes the injury.

Unless such action by defendant was the proximate cause of the accident it is not liable in damages. We said in <em>Hoag v. Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railroad Co., </em>supra, p. <em>298: “. . . </em>in determining what is proximate cause, the true rule is, that the injury must be the natural and probable consequence of the negligence — such a consequence as, under the sur<a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>rounding circumstances of the case, might and ought to have been foreseen by the wrongdoer as likely to flow from his act.” And in <em>Rugart v. Keebler-Weyl Baking Co., </em>supra, we approved the following language of the learned court below, p. 413: “Without attempting to define formally what is meant by the term ‘proximate cause’, we may safely affirm, in the case of a tort, that, in order to fall within this category, an act must be such as will probably result in harm, and that a cause is regarded in law as remote if an injury complained of was an unlikely or improbable consequence thereof.” The test is whether the injury or death would probably result from the act of omission or commission; not whether it may result. In <em>Pass. Ry. Co. v. Trich, </em><a href="/pa/117/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="117 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="555783" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0390-01">117 Pa. 390</a>, 399, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20A.%20627" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="11 A. 627">11 A. 627</a>, we said: “But things or results which are only possible cannot be spoken of as either probable or natural. For the latter are those things or events which are likely to happen and which for that reason should be foreseen. Things which are possible may never happen, but those which are natural or probable are those which do happen, and happen with such frequency or regularity as to become a matter of definite inference. To impose such a standard of care as requires, in the ordinary affairs of life, precaution on the part of individuals against all the possibilities which may occur, is establishing a degree of responsibility quite beyond any legal limitations which have yet been declared.”</p>

It would be impossible for anyone to visualize the actual occurrence, the children running out upon the ice in pursuit of the kite, of the catching of the kite in the tree near the center of the pond, the breaking of the string which was held by two of the. children, of the efforts of the children to get the kite and the string, and the giving way of the ice and the tragedy that followed.</p>

There it was said: “The decedent was not moved by temptation, if any, offered by the ice upon the canal or its attractiveness to play thereon, but by his wish to recover his ‘nipsie’ [a stick sharpened at one end]. Therefore we need not consider what effect might be given to a situation where children have played in the neighborhood or upon the canal and without objection from the plaintiff in error, or occasions when they have sometimes been ordered away. . . .

It is equally indisputable that “the children were not trespassers, they had a right to be on the Montecupo property”; and children of the neighborhood played around this pool “practically every day”, as one witness testified, from the time the area was flooded. In the winter they played on the ice and in the summer they played around the pool. Notice of the flooded condition, as well as the children playing there, was brought home to the defendant company not only by the length of time that this condition existed, but also by notice to its track foreman whose duties were to keep in condition this section of the track with the sewers and culverts under it and who testified that he spent his full time as foreman on this section of track which was nineteen miles long, and that for over thirty years he was familiar with the piece of ground that Montecupo leased.

That the defendant “controlled” this pond is a fact in this case for it was defendant’s failure to keep the culvert open which created the pond.

W. 101</a> (Nan.), the action was for the death of two twin boys, 6 years and seven months old by drowning in a pond, which was created upon private property by the city constructing a high fill for a street. After the pond was created it remained for 19 years preceding the drowning of the boys. The city had notice of the common practice of children in the neighborhood playing upon and about the pond. While playing on the ice, the ice gave way and the boys were drowned. The Supreme Court of Missouri held that “The legal obligation rests upon all who create <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>or allow such dangerous conditions, to use reasonable precautions to see that no unnecessary injury shall flow therefrom to others, and if that duty is violated and injury results, the guilty party will be held liable in damages.” In the <em>City of Elwood v. </em>Addison, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20N.E.%2047" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="59 N.E. 47">59 N. E. 47</a> (Ind.), the complaint alleged that the death of the plaintiff’s child, 7 years old, was caused by the negligence of the city in constructing a culvert in such a manner that it was easily obstructed, and that the water in which the child was drowned was thus accumulated at the side of the street. Children would stop there and throw sticks into the water. The child, which was drowned, stopped and threw some sticks in and in some manner slipped from the edge of the sidewalk into the water and lost his life. The court there held: “. . . the theory of the pleading, so far as the appellant’s negligence is concerned, is the maintenance of the culvert in a condition which caused a large and dangerous pool of water to form in close proximity to the street and sidewalk. The immediate cause of the death was the pool of water near the street and sidewalk, but this was necessarily incident to the city’s wrongful act in maintaining an insufficient culvert to carry away the water. The result that did happen would not have happened had there been a sufficient culvert. The maintenance of the insufficient culvert was the proximate, although not the immediate cause of the death. We fail to see upon what principle a wrongdoer may be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong by stating that the injury resulted from a more immediate cause, when this immediate cause was put in operation by his own wrongful act . . .” In <em>City of Altus v. Milliken, </em>98 Oklahoma 1, the city assumed the duty of constructing a spillway to prevent the creation of a pond. The city failed to construct the spillway and a pond was created, which had. a considerable shallow area, but contained a deep and dangerous hole. The boy was wading in the pool and stepped into this hole and was drowned. The court held that “. . . If this had been <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>done [the spillway constructed], and this duty had been discharged, the accident would not have occurred. The proximate cause of the accident was a question of fact for the jury under proper instructions . . .” In <em>City of Omaha v. </em>Richards, <a href="/neb/49/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="49 Neb. 244" data-case-ids="2646424" data-case-paths="/neb/49/0244-01">49 Neb. 244</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20N.W.%20526" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="68 N.W. 526">68 N. W. 526</a>, a boy ten years old was drowned when he fell from a wooden sidewalk which was then floating upon a pond of water part of which was in a public street and a part upon private property. The pond was created by the negligence of the city in grading the street but leaving no sufficient outlet for the surface water which accumulated in said drain, except a manhole to drain the water. The court said in sustaining a verdict for the plaintiff: “It was the duty of the city to have constructed the sewer and street in question in such a manner as to provide a proper and adequate outlet for the water that might have been reasonably expected to come down this ravine. In failing to do so, the city authorities were guilty of negligence. That such negligence was the direct and approximate cause of the death ... is established to a moral certainty.”</p>

In that case Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for the Supreme Court, said: “Were the case merely one of an accessible wharf, it could not be said that the District would be subject to liability from the fact, without more, that a child <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>strayed there and fell from, the wharf into the water. The duty must find its source in special circumstances in which, by reason of the inducement and of the fact that visits of children to the place would naturally be anticipated, and because of the character of the danger to which they would unwittingly be exposed, reasonable prudence would require that precautions be taken for their protection. Here, . . . the location of the wharf, unfenced, close to the street with the barrier partly down, taken with the use of the wharf for unloading-sand, make it a likely place for children to play. Sand-piles close at hand would constitute “a bait” they would inevitably follow. . . . They did follow it and they used the wharf as a playground at their pleasure. As the authorities of the District had reason to anticipate that use, there was a duty to take reasonable precautions either to prevent it or to keep the wharf in such proper state of repair that children would not be exposed to the danger of falling through holes.”</p>
