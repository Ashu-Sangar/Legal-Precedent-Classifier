Lippincott, dated March 4, 1913, as to the paying oyer of the principal of her daughter Mabel’s share of a trust fund of “$25,367.50 after her daughter Mabel’s death, to testatrix’s daughters Bessie and Helen and their issue in equal shares.” Helen (Mrs. James H. Donnon) died on March 19, 1928, and her estate was settled and awarded by the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County to her son, as her residuary legatee, J. Henry Donnon, Jr. Francis Donnon claimed that he was a son of Helen Lippincott, and after Mabel Lippincott’s death he made a claim to share equally with his brother Henry in the principal of the trust fund which had been set apart as provided in the codicil for Mabel Lippincott’s “comfortable maintenance and support” during her life. Francis’ claim to be a child of Helen Lippincott Donnon <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>was accepted by the court aud no appeal was taken from the adjudication to that effect. The question for us to determine is whether or not the appointment in the codicil gave to Helen a vested remainder. If it did, Francis’ claim to a part of the “principal of her [Mabel’s] share” must be rejected, because by her will Helen gave her estate to her son, J. Henry Donnon, Jr. But if the word “issue” is used in the codicil in a substitutionary sense, that is, as a word of purchase and not as a word of limitation, both sons take in their own right directly from the appointer.</p>

There is no such “unbending rule” as to the word “issue” as there is in respect to the word “heirs”, and courts when called upon to construe the word “issue” as used in this codicil should determine from either the context or the entire instrument whether the testator meant by the use of this word to describe the quality of the estate of the first taker or meant to create a substitutionary gift for the first taker’s “issue”. The word “issue” has never been more than <em>prima facie </em>a word of limitation; in many instances it has been interpreted as a word of purchase. Baron Parke and his judicial associates in <em>Lees v. Mosley, et al., </em>160 Eng. Reports [589] 241 (1836), said: “The word ‘issue’, however, is more flexible than the expression ‘heirs of the body’. In the case of <em>Cursham v. Newland </em>(2 Bing. N. C. 58) the word ‘issue’ was held to be a word of purchase, . . . The words ‘heirs’ and ‘heirs male’ . . . must be words of limitation, because heirs are not co-existent. That does not necessarily apply to the word ‘issue’ which may mean <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>existing issue, or all the descendants, Alderson, B. When the words ‘heirs of the body’ are used in their proper sense, it is certain that heirs in succession are meant. Therefore, a devise to heirs of the body, ‘share and share alike,’ is an inconsistency; but a devise to the issue, ‘share and share alike,’ is not necessarily so.”</p>

In <em>English’s Estate, </em>supra, where the will was executed in 1904, this court said: “We must first see what fixed legal meaning, if any, that word [issue], as here used, had at the date of the will.” We also said in that opinion that the Act of July 9, 1897, P. L. 213, placed a different meaning on the phrase “failure of issue” as used in a will and that since that Act the phrase no longer imported “an indefinite failure of issue” and that the testatrix in that case in using the word “issue” was not “indicating a line of inheritance from the devisee” but was describing “the persons next to take from her”; (2) that as early as 1870, it was declared by this court in <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em><a href="/pa/63/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="63 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1019043" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0481-01">63 Pa. 481</a>, in an opinion by Justice Si-iarswood that the word “issue” when used “in a will is to be construed as a word of purchase or of limitation, as will best effectuate the intention of the testator gathered from the entire instrument.” Justice Sharswood added “This was well expressed long ago by Chief Justice Wiles : Why does the word issue in a will signify the same as heirs of the body? Only because it may be supposed that the testa<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>tor, who was ignorant of the law, intended it should have that construction. It does not, therefore, ex vi termini create an estate tail in a will as heirs of the body do in a deed, but only when it appears to be the intent of the testator that the word should have that construction, or, at least, that it does not appear that the intent of the testator was otherwise”: <em>Ginger v.

The first was one-third of the property over which she had “the right of appointment,” and this she gave to each of her “daughters, Bessie Lippincott and Helen Lippincott absolutely”. The <em>income </em>of one-third still undisposed of she gave to trustees for the support of her daughter Mabel and the “balance” of that income she gave to her “daughters Bessie and Helen or the survivor of them”. If one daughter predeceased the other, the latter would receive all of that “balance” of income. That left the <em>principal </em>of the above “one-third” undisposed of. If the testatrix had intended to give this to her two daughters Bessie and Helen “absolutely,” she knew how to execute that intention, for she <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>had just done that very thing in respect to the <em>other </em>two-thirds of the property. If she had intended that upon the death of either Bessie or Helen, before Mabel the life-tenant, the <em>survivor </em>of these two daughters should take all of the principal of that, one-third, she also knew how to execute that intention for she had just done that very thing with the “excess income” from that one-third. She did neither; but, on the contrary, she provided that upon Mabel’s death “the principal of her share” should be paid over to the “daughters Bessie and Helen and their issue in equal shares.” We think that in so doing she used the word “issue” as a word of purchase and intended to create a substitutionary gift for the respective issue or children of Bessie and Helen in case either or both of these daughters died before the distribution provided for on the death of the life-tenant should be made.</p>
    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.4",568,[227,1168,1151,1135]]]'>This conclusion is strengthened by the following circumstances. In her first codicil, dated November 9,1912, the testatrix disavowed any intention of exercising the power of appointment given her by the will of her husband. A son, this claimant, was born to her daughter Helen, in Chicago on January 26, 1913. On March 4, 1913, or 37 days after “issue” was born to Helen, the testatrix exercised the power of appointment given her by her husband in his will. It was certainly a natural thing for this grandmother to provide in that codicil for Helen’s recently born “issue” should Helen not be living when the time arrived for the distribution of the principal which had been set apart for the support of the life-tenant. The use of the word “or” instead of the word “and” after the names of the daughters would more clearly have effectuated the intention we have found to exist in the mind of the testatrix, but it is well known that the words “and” and “or” are frequently used interchangeably. We said in <em>Hemphill’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/345/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="345 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1213367" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0451-01">345 Pa. 451</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%203" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="29 A.2d 3">29 A. 2d 3</a>: “To effectuate the intention of a testator, the word ‘and’ may be read ‘or’.”</p>

Kime, </em>1 Salk. 224 (issue) ; <em>Bowles’ Case, </em>11 Co. 79 b (issue) ; <em>Bannester v. Lang, </em>17 L.T. N.S. 137 (issue) ; <em>Evans v. Evans, </em>[1892] 2 Ch. 173 (persons).” In <em>Wallace v. Wallace, </em><a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.%20116" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="130 A. 116">130 Atl. Rep. 116</a>, the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut said: “Where the term ‘issue’ is used in correlation with parent, we have held, in construing other wills, that children were meant by issue, and such has been the general holding elsewhere.”</p>

      <p id="b567-6" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[186,1550,1156,632]]]'> The modern tendency, since the Buie in <em>Shelley’s </em>case no longer serves its ieudal purpose, to throw off the fetters of that Bule and the fetters forged out of it when the words “issue” or “children” were used in devises as a possible equivalent of the word “heirs,” is manifested in the statutes passed in many states in reference to that Buie and the statutes passed in England and Pennsylvania relative to the conveyance of a fee. In England it was provided by statute, 1890 Victorian Statute 3626, that in devises of land, words of limitation should no longer be necessary to pass a fee. By our own Act of April 1, 1909, P. L. 91, Sec. 3, it was provided that the words “grant and convey, or either one of said words in any deed hereafter executed, shaU he adjudged an express covenant to the grantee, his heirs and assigns, to wit . . .” See also the Act of April 30, 1925, P. L. 404.</p>
