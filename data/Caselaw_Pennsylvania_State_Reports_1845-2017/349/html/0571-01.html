We have said in <em>Warren’s Estate, </em>supra, p. 113: “In testing any given case under the rule there is a distinction made between the effect of testamentary or inter vivos provisions made by the testator or settlor himself, and those made by a donee of a power of appointment under the terms of the trust. The distinction while narrow, is, nevertheless, extremely important. In cases of trusts created by a testator or settlor the validity of the disposition is governed by <em>possible </em>events, not necessarily by actual events as they may have happened to materialize. For instance, if an interest <em>could </em>arise beyond the limit fixed by the rule, the disposition is void irrespective of the fact that such a person <em>was in fact </em>born within the limitation of the rule. The test is whether, under the provisions of the trust, it is <em>possible </em>for a person to take an interest held to be too remote under the rule.

No one questions the validity of the testator’s grant of <em>life estates </em>to his children and their issue. We are only concerned with the validity of the trusts commencing 21 years after the decease of his last surviving child. Should it be decided that the powers of appointment to be so exercised at the expiration of 21 years after the decease of the last surviving child of testator are void for remoteness, then an intestacy would result. The estates of the three children would thereupon each receive one-third share absolutely. This is the contention of the beneficiary under the Francis H. Lewis will.

Lewis does not participate, <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>because this child of testator died, before his sisters, without issue, and without having exercised any power of appointment.

It will suffice to say that she gave a life estate to her husband; after the death of the husband she gave the net income to her children and issue until the death of her last surviving child, and then the principal to the descendants of her children per stirpes; if there were no descendants of the last surviving child, such child was to have power to appoint to charity; she conferred limited power upon her husband to modify trusts; she directed that if a share of income was inadequate for a child’s “maintenance and support”, portions of principal were to be applied therefor.</p>

The auditing judge further ruled, while parts of such exercise were invalid, that part was good which granted life estates to her children. He declined to terminate the trust irrespective of the question of invalidity of the remainder because of the existence of valid life estates, for which the trustees had active duties to perform. He regarded the trust of the life estates in the nature of separate use trusts because of the provision for maintenance and support. Upon exceptions the adjudication was confirmed by a majority of the Orphans’ Court in an opinion by Judge Hunter. A dissenting opinion was filed by Judge Ladner, who agreed that the trust <em>as created by testator </em>was valid, but was of opinion that the exercise of the appointment by Mrs. Newton was void in its entirety. In his view the exercise was limited to within the time fixed by the testator for the termination of the trust, i. e., within the life of the survivor of testator’s children and 21 years thereafter.</p>
    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.4",599,[188,1492,1150,797]]]'>We agree with the court below that the trust as erected by testator did not transgress the rule against perpetuities. As pointed out in <em>Warren’s Estate, </em>supra, <em>the limit for the creation of executory interests to commence </em>is within the period of a life or lives in being and twenty-one years, allowing for the period of gestation. When, therefore, testator provided for payment of <em>income </em>“until the decease of the last survivor of [his] children and the expiration of twenty-one years thereafter” and at the expiration of such period to divide the <em>principal per stirpes </em>among the descendants of such children, there was no violation of the rule.

    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[215,441,1150,1078]]]'>What this appellant overlooks are the distinctions pointed out in <em>Warren’s Estate, </em>supra, between the effect of testamentary or inter vivos provisions made by a testator or settlor himself, <em>and those made by a donee of a power of appointment. </em>In case of trusts created by testator or settlor, the validity is governed by <em>possible </em>events. Where trusts are created by a donee of a power, the determination <em>depends upon the facts </em>as they actually exist at the time the appointment is made. While the remoteness of the appointed estate is still measured from the time of the creation of the power, it is the <em>fact </em>and not the <em>possibility </em>which rules. When both of testator’s daughters exercised their powers of appointment in favor of their children, <em>all of the children were living at the death of their grandfather, the testator. </em>It is therefore manifest that the exercise of these powers of appointment in favor of grandchildren <em>living at the date of the death of the creator of the trust </em>did not violate the rule. It merely constituted the lighting of other candles, while the original candle was still burning.</p>

Counsel argues that since under the terms of the trust <em>distribution of the principal </em>occurs <em>“at the expiration of </em>a period of twenty-one years after the decease of the last survivor of my children,” such distribution necessarily occurs <em>after </em>the life and lives in being and 21 years thereafter have expired, and hence the trust, in this respect, is void for remoteness.</p>

No decision in Pennsylvania has been cited and we have been unable to find one. However, we approve of what Chancellor Warrington said in <em>English v. Cliff </em>(1914), 2 Ch. 376, 381: “The trust in the present case is to arise at the expiration of the term of twenty-<a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>one years, and if looked at from one point of view that trust arises coincidently with the last moment of the term, although, if looked at from another point of view, it may be said to arise at some infinitesimally small .fraction of time after the last moment of the term. In my opinion, however, the only sensible view to be taken of such a limitation is that the term determines and the trust arises at the very moment of time, and if looked at in that way it is impossible to say that the trust arises at a later period than that allowed by law. It seems to me therefore that the term determines and the trust arises at mathematically and identically the same moment, and so far as that objection goes I am of opinion that the trust is a good one.” See also: <em>Kolb v.

    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[219,979,1153,695]]]'>Mrs. Newton’s special power of appointment was limited to her descendants. What she did was, as hereinbefore indicated, (1) give a life estate to her husband; (2) give the <em>income </em>to her children, with remainder to their issue <em>per stirpes-, </em>(3) give a power of appointment to her last surviving child (if there were no decendants of the children) to name a charity; (4) confer limited power upon the husband to modify the trust. It is conceded that except for the provision of income for her children, every other part of the appointment is void. It exceeded in part her authority under her special appointment and transgressed, in part, the rule against perpetuities.</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[218,1687,1152,315]]]'>We need not cite all the cases where the <em>valid </em>parts of a trust or estate under appointment are salvaged from invalid portions. In most of them there was a valid life estate and an invalid remainder, which of course were readily separable: <em>Whitman’s Estate, </em>supra, <em>Ewalt v. Davenhill, </em>supra, <em>Warren’s Estate, </em>supra.</p>

Indeed, this power was exercised by a <em>will. </em>As we view Mrs. Newton’s will she did not intend to grant immediate life estates to her children. On the <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>contrary, such life estates were subject to a preceding life estate to her husband, who was also granted power to modify the trust. In our view the appointment regarded as a whole obviously constitutes such an integrated scheme or pattern that the component parts cannot be separated from one another without defeating the organic plan: <em>Feeney’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/293/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="293 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1111143" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0273-01">293 Pa. 273</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=142%20A.%20284" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="142 A. 284">142 A. 284</a>; <em>Johnston’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/185/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="185 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="898030" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0179-01">185 Pa. 179</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%20879" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="39 A. 879">39 A. 879</a>; <em>Quigley’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/329/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="329 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1181434" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0281-01">329 Pa. 281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%2085" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="198 A. 85">198 A. 85</a>.
