The claim was based upon a contract between the parties covering a period from November 30,1936 to May 31,1938 and was to continue for another two years if neither party had given written notice of termination three months prior to the end of the term. On May 28, 1938, the Board advised Warehouse of its intention to seek bids for a new contract for the period from June 27,1938 to May 31,1940, but requested Warehouse to continue its services and transportation for the month of June 1938 on the contractual basis. For these services during June 1938 Warehouse was paid. Warehouse on June 17,1938 filed its complaint to restrain the Board from awarding, the contract to any person or company other than the claimant. The Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, after a hearing granted a permanent injunction on May 20,1939. This court reversed the decree of the Dauphin County Court enabling the Board to make a new contract: <em>Merchants’ Warehouse Company v. Hitchler, </em><a href="/pa/335/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="335 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1193076" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0465-01">335 Pa. 465</a>. However, Warehouse continued to provide services and transportation in the Philadelphia district for the Board from July 1, 1938 until December 31, 1939, and Warehouse claimed that since there was no contract or agreement covering its services that it was entitled to a reasonable value for these services during that period, amounting to $249,020.32. It made an additional claim against the Board for transportation services in the. amount of $36,930.70, which was based upon the legal tariffs filed with the Public Utility Commission by the Union Transfer Affiliated Company, the common carrier which actually performed the transportation services. There was a further claim of $2,832,86 for demurrage expenses incurred during the months of November and December of 1936. The total claim was for $288,783.88.-Warehouse gave credits to the Board totaling $156,-078.68, representing recoveries by Warehouse from insurance companies covering certain losses; the entire <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>credit given to the Board was for $180,176.52.

The Board claimed that the Terminal Warehouse Company of Philadelphia, Pa., was the lowest responsible bidder and that its bid would have been accepted and a contract executed pursuant thereto had the Board not been restrained from so doing by the injunction. It contended that between July 1, 1938 and July 21, 1939, it had no alternative than to permit Warehouse to furnish the services for which it fixed the charges set forth in its claim but that these charges were based upon rates higher than those that could have been secured from the Terminal Warehouse Company, set forth in their counterclaim, causing the Liquor Board a loss for this period of $57,251.84.

Tbe Auditor General and tbe State Treasurer, on July 21, 1942, in a formal opinion adjusted and settled tbe claim in favor of Warehouse in tbe amount of $50,681.40, and disallowed the counterclaim. No petition for resettlement or review and no appeal was filed with tbe Board of Finance and Review nor did either of tbe parties ask for a writ of certiorari to obtain judicial review of tbe action. The Liquor Board then upon advice of the Attorney General refused to pay tbe settlement. On November 10, 1942, Warehouse filed its petition for an alternative writ of mandamus setting forth that tbe decision of tbe Auditor General and State Treasurer bad tbe force and effect of a judgment, and praying that tbe Board be required to prepare its requisition in tbe amount of its settlement and to present it to tbe Auditor General for approval. The Court below awarded tbe alternative writ of mandamus to wbicb tbe Board duly filed its return. In this return, tbe Board averred that tbe settlement was not in accordance with law and equity, in that tbe settlement disallowed the Commonwealth’s claim for loss due to the injunction, and allowed upon a quantum meruit basis tbe claim of tbe plaintiff for warehousing and transportation services rendered during tbe last three months of tbe year <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>1939, and averred therein that “there was no dispute as to the facts, and the question of law arising therefrom should have been submitted by the Auditor General and the State Treasurer to the Attorney. General for his advice, as required by Section 512 of The Administrative Code of 1929 (Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 177, 71 PS Sec. 192).” It further “averred that the statutes under which the proceeding before the Auditor General and State Treasurer was instituted, to wit; the Act of March 30, 1811, P. L. 145 (72 PS Sec. 4087 et seq.) and The Fiscal Code of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343 (72 PS Sec. 1 et seq.) do not provide for an appeal by the Commonwealth or the Board from the settlement of the Auditor General and State Treasurer allowing a claim against the Commonwealth, neither do such statutes provide for any further proceeding by the Commonwealth subsequent to such settlement; . . .” Issue was joined by Warehouse and by stipulation of respective counsel the record before the fiscal officials was certified to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County without taking any additional testimony, and set down for argument. The court below found that the return presented no valid defense, overruled it and directed a peremptory mandamus to issue. From this final order the Board took this appeal.</p>

Otherwise it would follow that the constitutional permission set forth in Section 11, Article I, that “suits may be brought against the Commonwealth in such manner, in such courts and in such cases as the legislature may by law direct,” has not been availed of by the legislature and that there is no forum in which claims against the Commonwealth may be adjusted and settled.
