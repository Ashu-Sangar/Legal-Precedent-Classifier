The daughter was given the privilege of occupying certain designated real estate until she was qualified to occupy his home. The qualifications were death of testator’s wife and the separation of the daughter from her husband. The residue of the estate was placed in trust, the income to be paid to his wife for life. After the death of the wife, 15% of the principal of the trust was set aside to establish a foundation, the income to be used “to relieve the poor sick or poverty stricken in the Borough of Hamburg, Pennsylvania”. The balance, or 85%, was to be further retained in trust and <em>out of the net income </em>$1,000. was to be paid as <em>a birthday gift </em>to each of his grandchildren upon attaining 18 years and $1,000. each year thereafter during the term of the trust, with discretion in the trustees to withhold payment if in the best interest of grandchildren. <em>Out of the balance </em>of net income, $100. a month was directed to be paid to the daughter, under married woman’s separate use trust, and any remainder of income was to be added to principal. If the daughter became separated from her husband, the whole of the income, <em>after payment of the birthday gifts, </em>was payable to the daughter for life. After the death of the daughter the income was to be accumulated, <em>except as provided for birthday gifts, </em>and added to principal until the oldest grandchild arrives at 21, when the trust fund is to be divided into as many parts as there are grandchildren living and issue of grandchildren deceased. The income on each share is to be accumulated until the grandchild arrives at 21, and the income thereafter paid to the grandchild until he arrives at 30, when he receives one-fourth of the principal, and similarly thereafter until he reaches 35, and again when he reaches 45, and thereafter the income for life on the last or fourth portion thereof, with power of appointment over the principal, and in default, to such grandchild’s issue upon attaining 21 years, with provision respecting failure of issue.</p>

There is, however, a well defined exception to this general rule of acceleration. Where acceleration works a hardship, parts of the estate may be <em>sequestrated, </em>in accordance with equitable principles, for the benefit of disappointed legatees and devisees. An example of the operation of this principle will be observed in <em>Lonergan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/303/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="303 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="1130053" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0142-01">303 Pa. 142</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20387" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="154 A. 387">154 A. 387</a>. There the gross estate approximated $1,500,000. Under the will the residuary legatee would have received $900,000. The widow elected to take against the will, the effect of which was that the residuary legatee’s share was reduced to $500,000. Testator had erected a trust for his wife of $200,000., in which she was given a life estate. At the wife’s death the corpus was payable: $150,000. to the residue and $50,000. to the <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>wife’s testamentary appointees, and in default, to the wife’s sister and two sons. On the widow’s election, the court below awarded, by way of acceleration, the $50,000. to the widow’s relatives. We reversed. We directed sequestration of the fund of $50,000., and permitted the residuary legatee to receive interest thereon until the actual decease of the widow. Varying testamentary provisions render it impossible to promulgate rules of sequestration which will apply in every case. Each will must be considered on its own facts. The cases are collected in Hunter, Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court Commonplace Book, Vol. I, page 361 <em>et seq., </em>section 15. Judge Makx, in his well-considered opinion, demonstrated that in this case there was no portion of the estate susceptible of sequestration. The gift to the daughter was the <em>remnant </em>of income after the gifts of income to testator’s grandchildren had been satisfied. The gifts to the daughter of income were clearly subservient to those of her children. To sequestrate this fund for the benefit of the daughter would take away income specifically bequeathed to the grandchildren. This would be inequitable and will not be permitted.</p>

Indeed, we cannot <em>assume </em>that a testator did not contemplate the possibility of his widow’s election to take against his will. On the contrary, every married testator knows, or is presumed to know, that his surviving spouse may elect to take against the will. A testator may always condition his legacies depending upon the election of the widow: <em>Mohn’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/76/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="76 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1038865" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0092-01">76 Pa. 92</a>; <em>Carr’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/138/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="138 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="11251947" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0352-01">138 Pa. 352</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.%2018" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="22 A. 18">22 A. 18</a>.</p>

To gather the testamentary intention we must place ourselves in “testator’s arm chair” and consider the circumstances surrounding him when he executed his will: <em>Postlethwaite’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/68/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="68 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1024532" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0477-01">68 Pa. 477</a>; <em>McGlathery’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/311/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="311 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1146311" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0351-01">311 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20886" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="166 A. 886">166 A. 886</a>. The will reveals testator’s complete satisfaction with his own philosophy of life and his success. He perpetuated his memory by provision for maintenance of his mausoleum and the erection of a charitable foundation, named for him, to benefit the “poor sick” and “poverty stricken” of his native borough. The chief objects of his bounty were his wife and grandchildren, the children of his only child. One thing stands out prominently: it was <em>not </em>his daughter who was a principal object of his concern. Obviously the disaffection for the son-in-law was the reason why the daughter was to receive merely the remnants of income after the other gifts of income had been made to her <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>children. His method of distribution of income to the grandchildren may at first glance appear unusual. He fixed the birthday of each grandchild as the <em>time </em>for each annual distribution of $1,000. out of income. Throughout the will testator repeatedly reiterates such intent. We may not regard the payment of such birthday gifts as an obstructing or frustrating cause disturbing the testator’s plan for the distribution of his income. A careful analysis of the will will show that the <em>payment of such annual birthday gifts constituted the testators method of distributing income. </em>The daughter only received such income as thereafter remained, and then only under certain conditions.</p>

He may also have been too optimistic concerning the effect of the financial situation upon his estate between the date of his will in 1933 and his death in 1935. When his widow elected to take against the will, and received her one-half share under the intestate law, the value of this estate was reduced in exactly that proportion. There was an acceleration of the remainders. The balance in the estate must be held and distributed as directed by the will.</p>
