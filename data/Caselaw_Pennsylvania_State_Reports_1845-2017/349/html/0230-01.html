At the same time he provided in his will for the payment to the trustees of $75,000, the income to be used for the expenses of the museum, and also executed an indenture conveying to Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company in trust the sum of :$25,000, the income tó be paid to himself during his life and after his death to the trustees of the museum for its upkeep and operation. On the same day he entered into an agreement with the trustees in which he contracted to pay them during his lifetime sums sufficient for the maintenance of the museum, in consideration of which and of the provisions of the trust indenture and will they agreed to accept the duties and obligations of the trusteeship. Thereafter they conducted the management of the museum. Decedent died on September 12, 1942.</p>

Appellant seeks to <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>have the statute extended by a judicial interpolation to cover gifts by instruments inter vivos on the ground that the legislature probably intended to exempt all such gifts from the collateral inheritance tax and only through inadvertence omitted those made by deed. But however much we may speculate as to the legislative intent the fact remains that there is no ambiguity in the statute as enacted, and we are admonished by section 51 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, that “When the words of a law are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” (See <em>Farmers-Kissinger Market House Company, Inc., v. Reading, </em><a href="/pa/310/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="310 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1144320" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0493-01">310 Pa. 493</a>, 498, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%20398" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="165 A. 398">165 A. 398</a>, 400, 401; <em>Commonwealth v.

It was because of this familiar principle that in <em>Frick’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/277/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="277 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1079572" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0242-01">277 Pa. 242</a>, 265, 266, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.%2035" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="121 A. 35">121 A. 35</a>, 44, it was held that the exemption of all estates in any building, ground, pictures and statuary or other works of art, passing by will for the sole use of the public by way of free exhibition within the State of Pennsylvania, as provided by the Act of July 9, 1919, P. L. 794, prior to its amendment by the Act of June’24, 1939, P. L. 724, did not extend to moneys given for the purpose of maintenance, money gifts not being expressly included in the statute. Moreover, section 58 of the Statutory Construction Act, reiterating another well-known principle, declares that provisions exempting persons and property from taxation shall be strictly construed. (See <em>Frick’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/277/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="277 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1079572" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0242-01">277 Pa. 242</a>, 266, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.%2035" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="121 A. 35">121 A. 35</a>, 44; <em>Bayer’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/345/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="345 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="1213335" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0308-01">345 Pa. 308</a>, 312, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20A.2d%20202" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="26 A.2d 202">26 A. 2d 202</a>, 204.) Appellant urges that if, as we are thus obliged to hold, the exemption does not extend to gifts by deed, the omission would be so arbitrary as to render the Act of July 9, 1919, P. L. 794, as amended, unconstitutional, but that suggestion need not here be considered in view of the fact that appellant would not be helped thereby, for the exemption statute would then fall as an entirety: <em>Commowealth v.

It is therefore argued that decedent was contractually obligated to pay the $25,000, and consequently it constituted at his death a debt deductible from the assets of his estate. The fact is, however, that the indenture of trust by which the $25,000 was given was itself a performance of whatever obligation existed as to. that amount since it actually passed title thereto to the trustees, only the possession and enjoyment being deferred until decedent’s death; after its execution, no unpaid “debt” of $25,000 remained. Moreover, by the Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 721, amending the Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521, it is provided that “the deductions herein allowed in the case of any indebtedness of the decedent shall, when founded upon a promise or agreement, be limited to the extent that they were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth”. The consent of the trustees to serve in the management of the museum was not a consideration “in money or money’s worth” contemplated by the statute as necessary to convert what would otherwise be a gift or legacy into a deductible debt.
