From that decree the present appeal is taken to this court. The executors now move to quash this appeal on the ground that it is not from a final decree. The motion is well founded; the decree of the orphans\u2019 court was clearly interlocutory and in no way settled the real contention between the parties. The merits of the whole case can be raised at a filial adjudication. The appeal to this court is, therefore, quashed.",
