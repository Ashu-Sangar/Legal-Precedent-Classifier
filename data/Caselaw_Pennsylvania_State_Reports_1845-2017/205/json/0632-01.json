        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe court below found on competent evidence that the words appointing executors were not on the will at the time it was executed by the testatrix, but were added at a later date. Disregarding these words therefore we have a will in due form signed by the testatrix at the end thereof as required by the act of 1888. Such a will can be revoked, under the express words of the statute, only by \u201c some other will or codicil in writing, or other writing declaring the same, executed and proved in the same manner .... or by burning, cancelling,\u201d etc. The object of the statute was to secure evidence in the instrument itself of the completed intent of the testator, and that having been fully shown by the signature at the end is not to be revoked except by equal evidence of a subsequent completed change of intention. The evils under the former system of accepting a signature in any part of the instrument, or even unsigned memoranda as a valid will are forcibly stated by Strong, J., in Heise v. Heise, 31 Pa. 246.\nThe words added in the present case do not indicate any intention to revoke the will but rather to make a codicil supplementary to its provisions. But the intent whatever it was being incomplete for want of the testatrix\u2019s signature, is not operative for either purpose.\nDecree affirmed.",

T., 1903, by defendant, from decree of C. P., No. 5, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1902, No. 701, in case of Albert Saunders v. J. R. T. Samarreg Company.\nBefore Mitchell, Dean, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for specific performance and to remove cloud on title.\nFrom the record it appeared that the plaintiff had contracted to sell certain real estate in the city of Philadelphia to the defendant. To this real estate plaintiff derived title from Mary W. Grant. Defendant claimed that the title was not marketable, owing to the alleged fact that Mrs. Grant had not sign\u00e9d her will at the end thereof. The will in question is as follows:\n\u201c 169 S. Carolina Avenue, Atlantic City, N. J.\n\u201c January 26, 1894.\n\u201c I, Mary W. Grant, being in health and of sound mind, do make this my last will and testament, revoking all other wills by me made.\n\u201c Item: I wish all my funeral expenses and just debts to be paid.\n\u201c Item: I will and bequeath to the Spring Garden Unitarian Society, Broad and Brandywine Streets, Phila., the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) to be paid in cash, without any deductions, as soon as possible after my death.\n\u201cItem: The rest and residue of my estate, real and personal, I will and bequeath to my nephew, Albert Saunders, unconditionally, in case of his death before inheriting my estate, I will it to his child, or children, the above mentioned real and personal estate; if there should be no child or children of his, I wish all my convertible property turned into money and given to the above mentioned Unitarian Society to be used according to the best judgment of said Society. My clothing I wish given to the deserving poor, according to the judgment of my executor.\n\u201c To this my last will and testament I set my hand and seal this 26th day of January, 1894.\n\u201cMary W. Grant. [Seal]\n\u201c 169 S. Carolina Ave.\n\u201c Atlantic City, N. J.\n\u201c As executors of this my last will and testament I appoint J. Pemberton Ellis and Albert Saunders.\n\u201c In witness of this will and testament of Mary W. Grant we, the undersigned, do sign our names.\n\u201cHoward Humpton,\n\u201cMarton E. Humpton.\u201d\nThe court entered a decree in favor of plaintiff.\nError assigned was the decree of court.\nAlfred D. Wiler, for appellant.\nGr. Heide Norris, for appellee.\nMay 11, 1903:"
