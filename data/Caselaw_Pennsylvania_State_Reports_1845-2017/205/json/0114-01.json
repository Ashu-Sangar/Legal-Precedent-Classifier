Frankford Steel & Forging Company, Appellant.\nEquity \u2014 Injunction\u2014Preliminary injunction \u2014 Receiver\u2014Corporation\u2014 Intercorporate conspiracy.\nA bill was filed by a minority stockholder of a corporation for the purpose of setting aside an alleged fraudulent contract between her company and another company, the holders of a majority of shares in both companies being the same. The parties defendant were the two corporations and the persons who held the majority of shares in both companies. The bill alleged that the complainant was induced to vote in favor of the contract at a stockholders\u2019 meeting by reason of certain misrepresentations made to her. The bill charged that plaintiff\u2019s company had been deprived of profits which had been wrongly appropriated by the other company, and that defendants proposed to transfer the business of the first company to the second company. The court entered a decree appointing a receiver and enjoining the officers from in any manner dismantling the plant of the plaintifi\u2019s company, removing its machinery or otherwise materially changing its present method of operation until final hearing. Held, on appeal that the portion of the decree appointing a receiver should be reversed, and that the remainder of the decree should be affirmed, but in such a way as not to enjoin the officers of plaintiff\u2019s company from operating the company or from removing the superintendent and such employees as they might deem expedient.\nArgued Feb. 11, 1908.\nAppeal, No. 37, Oet. T., 1908, by defendant, from decree of C. P. Lawrence Co., on bill in equity in case of Annie M. Devine v. Frankford Steel & Forging Company, the Tindel-Morris Company, Adam Tindel and L. 1. Morris.\nBefore Mj.tch.bll, Dean, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, J J.\nReversed in part.\nBill in equity for an injunction, and for the appointment of a receiver. Before Wallace, P. J.\nThe bill averred that plaintiff was the owner of 205 shares of stock of the Frankford Steel & Forging Company, and that the defendants Adam Tindel and L. I. Morris were the owners of a majority in interest of the capital stock of the Frankford Steel & Forging Company and the Tindel-Morris Company; that Tindel and Morris through their control of the two corporations fraudulently conspired to bring about an agreement between the two companies by which the Tindel-Morris Company was to take over the business of the Frankford Steel & Forging Company in consideration of the guaranty by the Tindel-Morris Company of a dividend of ten per cent per annum upon the capital stock of the Frankford Steel & Forging Company; that plaintiff was induced to vote in favor of this agreement at a stockholders\u2019 meeting by reason of misrepresentations made to her by Tindel and Morris. The complaint specifically charged as follows:\n7. Your oratrix is informed and believes, and so charges, that the consideration for said transfer by the Frankford Steel & Forging Company of its business to the Tindel-Morris Company was appropriated by said Tindel and Morris; that said transfer was made illegally, without proper warrant or authority, upon terms and conditions that were unfair, inequitable and unjust to the Frankford Steel & Forging Company and its stockholders, and that said arrangement, contract or agreement, in whatever form made, would never have been made except for the fact of the conspiracy, confederacy and fraudulent intent of said Tindel and Morris as aforesaid, and could never have been effected except through the control of both of said companies by said Tindel and said Morris, who, by specious promises lulled the suspicions of your oratrix and induced her by protestations of friendship and interest in her and her children to consent to such transfer, she at the time having no sufficient knowledge or information in the premises to enable her to form any intelligent opinion upon the subject.\nThe defendants in their affidavits denied that there had been any misrepresentation.\nThe court granted a preliminary injunction [enjoining the defendants Adam Tindel, L. I. Morris and the Tindel-Morris Company from in any manner interfering with the present operation of the Frankford Steel & Forging Company, and the said Tindel and Morris and other officers of the Frank-ford Steel & Forging Company from in any manner interfering with the present management and operation of said Frankford Steel & Forging Company, and from dismissing, discharging or removing any of the managers, employees or operatives of said Frankford Steel & Forging Company except by and with the consent of its present superintendent and manager, Robert F. Devine, and that the said Tindel and Morris and the officers of said Frankford Steel & Forging Company be further inhibited and enjoined from discharging, dismissing or removing until the further order of court said Robert F. Devine as manager and .superintendent of said Frankford Steel & Forging Company, and the said Frankford Steel & Forging Company and its officers and managers are inhibited and enjoined from in any manner dismantling the plant, removing its machinery, transferring the same, or otherwise changing its present method of operation.] [1]\nSubsequently the court continued the injunction and [appointed receivers to take charge of the property, estate and effects of the Frankford Steel & Forging Company, and to manage the same; make all contracts necessary to keep it in operation, conduct and manage its business, employ the necessary clerks, assistants, laborers and workmen to carry on and conduct the business as heretofore conducted, etc.; to demand of Adam Tindel, L. I. Morris and Tindel-Morris Company that they turn over to the said receivers all the orders received by them for the manufacture of products by the Frankford Steel & Forging Company, and all other orders for the manufacture of products hereafter coming into their possession for the use, benefit and advantage of the said the Frankford Steel & Forging Company.] [2]\nErrors assigned were portions of decrees as above, quoting them.\nJohn Q-. Johnson, with him E. Ilunn ITanson, for appellants.\u2014\nThe majority stockholders entered into the contract, acting in entire good faith.\nNo misrepresentation was made to the appellee to induce her to vote in favor of the contract.\nThe contract not being tainted with fraud was valid: Graham v. Pancoast, 30 Pa. 89; Atlantic Delaine Co. v. James, 94 U. S. 207; Oglesby v. Attrill, 105 U. S. 605; Malone v. Lancaster Gas Light Co., 182 Pa. 309.\nThe appellee is estopped, under all the circumstances, from disputing the validity of the contract.\nEven though the contract was invalid, a preliminary decree appointing a receiver was without warrant.\nEven though the contract was invalid, the grant of a special injunction was unwarranted.\nA. Leo Weil, with him Winternitz \u00a3 MeConaghy and Charles M. Thorp, for appellee. \u2014\nCourts view with suspicion contracts made between two companies controlled by the same officers and stockholders, and will sustain such contracts only when they are fair, free from any taint of fi\u2019aud or misrepresentation. The following will be in point: 2 Cook on Stock and Stockholders, sec. 662; Meeker v. Winthrop Iron Co., 17 Fed. Repr. 48; Gilman, Clinton & Springfield R. R. Co. v. Kelly, 77 Ill. 426; San Diego v. San Diego & Los Angeles R. R. Co., 44 Cal. 106; Brewer v. Boston Theatre, 104 Mass. 378; Bill v. Western Union Tel. Co., 16 Fed. Repr. 14; Wardell v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 103 U. S. 651.\nFebruary 11, 1903:"
