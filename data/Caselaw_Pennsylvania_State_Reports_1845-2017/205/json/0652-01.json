T., 1902, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 2, Phila. Co., Dec. T. 1890, Nos. 782 and 788, overruling exceptions to auditor\u2019s report in case of Jacob Rossbach and Leopold Rossbach, trading as J. H. Rossbach & Company, v. Marcus Beebe and Junius Beebe, trading as Beebe & Sons.\nBefore Mitchell, Dean, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to report of Thomas B. Price, Esq., referee.\nFrom the record it appeared that the form of proceeding was a sheriff\u2019s interpleader to test title to certain skins and hides. The question at issue was whether the skins and hides had been sold by the plaintiffs to one Albert A. Guigues, on representations by the latter alleged to be false. The case was referred to Thomas B. Price, Esq., as referee, who found as a fact that the representations were not false, and awarded a verdict in favor of the defendant.\n\u25a0 Exceptions to the referee\u2019s report were dismissed by the .court.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions to referee\u2019s report.\nHenry 0. Terry, for appellants.\nJames Collins Jones, with himdf. Hampton Todd, for appellees.\nMay 4, 1903 :"
