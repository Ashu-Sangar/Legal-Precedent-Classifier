Hathaway, 135 Pa. 274. But if the substance was there the act was not intended to increase mere technicality of presentation. The statement in the present case sets forth an indebtedness on \u201c a book account for merchandise sold and delivered to the defendants at their request,\u201d with a further averment that the charges are \u201c just and reasonable\u201d and a copy of the account showing in detail the articles and their prices. This would have been entirely good as a common count with bill of particulars under the previous practice, and no defect has been pointed out as to precision or certainty of parties and amounts, which would make it bad in any of the features the procedure act was intended to require. The defendant instead of filing an affidavit of his defense, if any lie had, chose to demur and the court had a right to hold Mm to the strict legal consequences.\nJudgment affirmed.",

But if the substance was there the act was not intended to increase mere technicality of presentation.\nA statement in assumpsit set forth an indebtedness on a \u201c book account for merchandise sold and delivered to the defendants at their request,\u201d with further averment that the charges are \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d and a copy of the account showing in detail the articles and their prices.
