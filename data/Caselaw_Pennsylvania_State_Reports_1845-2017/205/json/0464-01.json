He further found that the gateways complained of had existed as openings in the rear walls of defendants\u2019 lots for forty years, and used from time to time, though for a part of that period not appearing exactly, the openings had been boarded up and disused. On these facts the judge, quoting Weiss v. So. Bethlehem Boro., 136 Pa. 294, found that Reese street was a public street, and the use of it by defendants was under their right as abutting owners. He therefore dismissed the bill. We have not been convinced that he was in error in his view of the facts, and on them the law is not open to question.\nDecree affirmed with costs.",
