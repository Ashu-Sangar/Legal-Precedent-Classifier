That the consideration therefor failed by reason of the fact that Lengert, who was the owner of said stock, had not paid the ten per cent in cash upon his original subscription as required by law, but had resorted to an artifice to withdraw $10,000, the amount of this subscription, in cash, and subsequently withdrew the balance of his said stock, some 600 shares, <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>of the value of $60,000, in real estate from the company, whereby the said 166 shares sold to the defendant became valueless.</p>

That at the time of the organization of the company, to wit: on or about April 18,1891, the plaintiff contributed to the real estate, machinery, stock, book accounts and plant for the organization of the company, the property then belonging to the said Lengert, and also agreed to pay in the ten per cent in cash necessary for the organization of the company. The arrangements for obtaining the said money in cash, were made by the plaintiff and his counsel, but the details of the negotiation with Meyers or with the bank were unknown to your deponent at the time. Your deponent was subsequently informed that the plaintiff had raised the $10,000 by a bond and mortgage for that amount secured upon the real estate in question and that the money had been deposited in the name of the treasurer of the company. When at the recorder’s office at the time the certificate was signed deponent called the attention of the plaintiff and his counsel, who was also counsel for the company, that the incumbrances against the real estate were not mentioned in the certificate, your deponent was then advised by counsel for the company and the plaintiff that it was not necessary or proper to do so, that only the equity in the property was contributed and that it was entirely proper to omit them and your deponent relying upon and acting under the advice of counsel for the company signed the certificate of incorporation, believing the same to be entirely regular and in accordance with the law. That subsequently your deponent was elected secretary and at a meeting of the company held some thirtjr days thereafter the stockholders passed a resolution authorizing the payment of the $10,000 mortgage. All of which was done as far as your deponent is concerned under the advice of the counsel for the company, in whom your deponent placed implicit confidence, and upon whose advice your deponent is advised he had the right to rely without the slightest doubt at the time as to the entire regularity and integrity of the transaction, and your deponent received no portion whatever of the said $10,000, the entire amount having been paid over to the. plaintiff.</p>
