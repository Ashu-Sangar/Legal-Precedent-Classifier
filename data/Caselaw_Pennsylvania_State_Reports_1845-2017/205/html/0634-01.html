It gave to Abraham Yellis no right to go upon the lands of John Deichman for the purpose of conveying that water in any other lines or by any other route than by the natural water course of the creek. And John Deichman granted that it should not be used for irrigating purposes for watering his other lands. He granted and guaranteed to Abraham Yellis and his heirs and assigns that there should be no gristmill or sawmill erected upon his premises, the remaining premises owned by him, and he granted further that the water should be given to Abraham Yellis in the full quantity that flowed there through his premises.</p>

Neither could he use the water in such a way as to appreciably or noticeably diminish the quantity that should flow in the stream naturally. So he might, if he had not entered into this contract, have changed the water course upon his premises so <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>that when it left his premises it left at the same place that the natural water course did. He might have used it for manufacturing purposes so long as he did not interfere materially with the flow of water upon the land of the lower property adjoining the creek. But by this he covenanted that he would not use it for the purpose of irrigating his meadow land, would not use it for the purpose of erecting a grist or sawmill upon his premises. A good deal of evidence has been given as to the value of this spring. Witnesses have testified with a view of establishing what the value of the spring was for the purpose of supplying water to the villages and towns, for the purpose of using it for a mill power, or as a water power for other purposes. You can readily see, gentlemen, that the question as to whether this spring or this creek is valuable for those purposes is a question that depends upon the rights that a person would have of diverting the water from its natural course, or of using it for such purpose.</p>

Abraham Yellis nor his grantees under the deed that they had, while they bad the right to receive the full amount of Avater that flowed through there had no right to go upon those premises and take the water above land which they purchased. It is not like something that a person could go upon the premises and remove. The water was there, flowing, it could not be changed, and while this plaintiff could not part Avith that Avater privilege in any Avay so as to deprive the persons farther down the stream, Abraham Yellis and his successors, grantees, from receiving the water there in its usual Aoav, and the full quantity of Avater except what they might Avant to use for culinary and domestic purposes, they have a right to do that.</p>

The question upon which I had the most doubts at the trial, was as to the evidence of William Yellis in regard to the value of the large spring upon the lands taken by the defendant company. I am free to say my first impressions and inclinations were that this was not proper evidence. However, a more thorough and careful investigation of the authorities upon that subject, and further consideration has convinced me, that the offer was proper and legitimate evidence. Many authorities might be cited, that while the true measure of damages, in such cases, is the value of the property before any portion was taken, as affected by the taking a portion thereof under the right of eminent domain, or in other words, the difference between the value of the property before any was taken, and the value of the remainder of the property after a portion was so taken, as affected by the taking, considering advantages and disadvantages, yet that in arriving at this matter in order that jurors or viewers may know all the circumstances and elements of damage, witnesses <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>may testify to specific elements of damages that enter into the whole question of damages.

Yellis’s testimony, introduced for the purpose of showing one of the several elements of damages, was properly admitted by the trial court. “ It has never been said or held,” says the court in Danville, Hazleton and Wilkesbarre Co. v. Gearhart, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20260" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="81* Pa. 260">81* Pa. 260</a>, “ that the elements of computation are not to be given in evidence as the. means of enabling the viewers or the jury to reach a just conclusion upon the whole matter.

The grant gave to Yellis and his assigns the right to have the water of the creek flow unobstructed through the land now owned by the plaintiff and to the grantee’s land in the accustomed or natural channel. It did not invest Yellis or his. grantee with the right to enter the premises of the plaintiff and take the water. No such authority can be found in the grant. It deprived Deichman of the use of the water for “ watering and improving the meadow ground,” and prevented him, his heirs, or assigns, from erecting a grist or sawmill along the creek and on the ground now owned by the plaintiff. The trial judge told the jury that such was the effect of the grant and that it gave to the defendant the right to use all the water that flowed through the plaintiff’s land and, in the natural channel, entered the defendant’s premises. This, of course, included the water that came from the spring on that part of the plaintiff’s land now condemned by the defendant company. But, as properly observed by the court, the ■ plaintiff was entitled to have considered as an element of her damages the value of this spring to her land as affected by the right of the defendant company to have its water flow materially undiminished to the company’s land in the channel of the creek as the other water did. These instructions as to the interpre<a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>tation of the grant and the water rights of the defendant under it were as favorable as the defendant company could reasonably ask.</p>

He admonished the jury that tbey “ must consider tbe evidence of the witnesses themselves and not take it from the court.” If, as claimed by the defendant, the plaintiff’s witnesses were discredited by their cross-examination, the jury having the whole testimony before them with comments of counsel would, under the charge, be in a position to consider the testimony elicited on cross-examination without special attention being called to it by the court.</p>
