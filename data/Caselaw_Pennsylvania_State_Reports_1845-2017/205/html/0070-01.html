A township may be very populous and require urban necessities and conveniences and yet not possess 10,000 inhabitants or constitute a village, and it may not require as elaborate machinery for carrying on its government as is provided for boroughs.

The township is one of the “ first class ” under the Act of April 28, 1899, P. L. 104.

That in all respects townships of this class are completely assimilated to boroughs.

This is conceded by the learned judge and he says: “ The question is one of first impression so far as we have been able to discover.” In holding that a railway companjr is not answerable for imposing such a burden on the property owners we are met first by section 8, article 16 of the constitution : “ Municipal and other corporations and individuals invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use shall make just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of their works, highways or improvements, which compensation shall be paid or secured before such taking, injury or destruction.”</p>

Then in Penna. R. R. Co. v. Montgomery County Passenger Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/167/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="167 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="866789" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0062-01">167 Pa. 62</a>, we held that until there was legislation relating to them specifically authorizing the construction of street railways upon the highways or in country districts without the consent of the abutting owners, that consent must be obtained. In both these cases we as plainly held, as language could put it, -that to construct an electric railway track or pipe line on or under apublic road was an additional burden on the abutting owner, and therefore, was a taking of or injury to his property, for which the constitution, not the legislature, guaranteed him compensation. Whether it be expedient or wise <em>to </em>grant the right of eminent domain to a railway to the extent of occupying a public highway, is purely a political question for the legislature to answer, but whether such occupancy be a taking of private property or whether the use is a public one, are purely judicial questions for the courts to determine. We have in the cases cited and others, declared that such appropriation is a taking of ■private property, and that under the constitution the owner is guaranteed compensation. In Hannum v. Media, etc., Electric Railway Co., <a href="/pa/200/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="200 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="924425" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0044-01">200 Pa. 44</a>, opinion by Justice Mitchell, we distinctly announced our adherence to the principles enunciated in Sterling’s Appeal and Montgomery county cases.

It is settled law, that abutting owners on streets and alleys in cities and boroughs have no claim for damages by reason of the appropriation of the surface or subsurface for public improvements to the advantage and benefit of all the inhabitants; it is much easier to say that such is the settled law, than to give a <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>wholly satisfactory reason for it; the one usually given both in McDevitt v.

If it abridges his control of the soil, it makes him a sharer in the public advantage resulting from the appropriation. In a legal sense, it is an invasion of his rights, but that is damnum absque injuria. But whether the reasoning to sustain the law be satisfactory or not, as a fact, the law is so deeply imbedded and firmly fixed as a rule of action, that it is not likely to be disturbed, at least in our day. We assume then, that if the plaintiff were an abutting owner on a street in a borough he would have no standing to complain; but he is not on a street of a borough but on an ordinary country road in a township ; how then can the railway company claim that he is in the same situation as a lot holder in a borough ? The court below points out some special powers conferred upon townships of this class which are the same as the express or implied powers of boroughs under our general laws, and then says: “ They (that is townships of the first class) are in all these respects completely assimilated to boroughs and cities. ... We cannot see therefore why a street railway should be considered an additional burden in such a municipality if gas lines and the like are not.” This reasoning is not convincing.</p>

We inherited an aptness and desire for their organization from England. In our earlier colonial history the large area of territory was divided into counties of such immense extent that it took several days traveling on horseback to reach the county seat; these again were divided into townships, some of them the size of our present counties ; then from special causes, such as trading posts, ferry approaches or heads of river navigation, settlers became grouped in villages or towns and from these last came a demand for local government specially adapted to their needs; so they severed from the larger territorial government of the township and erected the borough municipality. It conveyed the idea, adopted from England, of a compact settlement, as <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>distinguished from a township and county. So through all the legislation since, the suggestion in thought is, of a town or village identical with the borough. The general act of 1884, not quite seventy years ago, provided for the method of incorporation of any town or village into a borough. Although under the general act of 1851 incorporation of boroughs with less than 300 inhabitants was authorized, the idea of compactness of population and territory was still adhered to. In Borough of Little Meadows, <a href="/pa/28/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="28 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="981657" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0256-01">28 Pa. 256</a>, it was held, that the court had no jurisdiction to incorporate a territory one and three fourths miles square, a part of the lines of which run through a wilderness and which contains no collection of houses, collocated after a general plan in regard to streets and lanes.</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[258,1042,1194,1396]],["BL_105.1",105,[144,363,1182,607]]]'>Then came the.act of 1863 which authorized the inclusion of farm lands adjoining a town or village in a borough, but at the request of the parties owning them the boundaries should be run so as to exclude them. But in all the subsequent legislation there is no departure from the original idea, that to erecta territory into a borough it must have as its base a town or village. The act of classification does not attempt to create a hybrid borough, neither township nor borough; it obviously intends to preserve the old township organization with all its powers and duties except where it expressly enacts otherwise. The preamble states : “ Whereas, in those more populous townships which are in large measure devoted to residential purposes, there is need of a form of municipal government having greater powers than are now possessed by the local governments of townships under the existing laws.” It then declares that townships having a population of at least 300 to a square mile shall be townships of the first class, and that all existing laws relating to townships except as modified by that act shall continue in force. Then the powers which such township ought to possess but which it did not have under the old organization are particularly specified as heretofore referred to; nowhere in the act is it intimated, that as to existing roads and highways, have the commissioners any other or greater power than theretofore existed as to the imposition of an additional servitude, such as street railways. Nor could such servitude have been imposed by the legislature without at the same time providing compensation to the abutting owner for his property <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>taken for public use. Calling the township a first class township did not make it a borough in name, nor do its physical characteristics make it one in fact. It is not enough that many of its wants and perhaps necessities are those of a borough or city, and that some of these the legislature attempted to enumerate ; street railways are not one of them ; legislative silence excludes them. However often the maxim “ Expressio unius exclusio est alterius ” has been misapplied, it is in point here. There is no sound reason on which we can sustain the decree in this case, therefore it is reversed, the bill reinstated and injunction directed to issue in accordance with the prayer of the bill.</p>
