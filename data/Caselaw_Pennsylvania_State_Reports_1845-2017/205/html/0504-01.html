The same is true of the issue of any nephew or niece so named who might have died during the lifetime of the testator. The words of the first two clauses are so plain and the intention of the testator is so unmistakably expressed that, though lie unquestionably could by a later clause provide that the interest should be purely contingent and not vest until the happening of an event after his death, he will not be understood to have done so unless such later clause must be read as expressing a change of his intention so clearly found in the lines immediately preceding it: Kiver v. Oldfield, 4 De G. &amp; J. 30; Good v.

If the main provision plainly covers the whole subject, and is defined in terms that exclude all doubt, and the subsidiary provision may by conjecture be made either general or partial, and may be capable by construction either of subverting entirely or of modifying only the original gift, such a subsidiary provision must in the ordinary ease be confined to its partial and restricted operation. It is said in 1 Redfield on Wills, *438, that ‘plain and distinct words are only to be controlled by words equally plain and distinct.’ Such words, to have a controlling effect, must at least possess a definite and certain meaning. The clearly expressed purpose of a testator is not to be overborne by modifying directions that are ambiguous and equivocal, and may justify either of two opposite interpretations. Such directions are to be so construed ás to support the testator’s distinctly announced main intention : ” Sheetz’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/82/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="82 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="1047966" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0213-01">82 Pa. 213</a>.</p>

Its last <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>words are — and upon these alone the appellants rely — that no estate shall vest until the nephews and nieces, or their issue, are entitled to receive their respective shares, which would be upon the death of both sisters-; but what precedes the last words of the clause is consistent with the intention of the testator, as expressed in the first two clauses, that the interest should vest at his death. In providing that his executors should not be annoyed by his nephews and nieces, whose dispositions from the appeals before us we can fairly assume he knew, he restricted not only their right, but that of the “ representative of any such ” to call the trustees to account. “ Representative,” as here used, can have no other than its natural meaning of personal representative — an executor or administrator — and, in giving it such meaning, the intention of the testator is continued; for the words were useless if the interest of each nephew and niece was only in expectancy and ceased with his or her death. But because the testator intended that the interests should vest immediately, he extended his restriction to the personal representative of any deceased nephew or niece. How, then, did he use the word “ vest ? ”</p>
    <p id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[293,1454,1189,408]]]'>“ If the testator has himself subjoined to the gift a declaration that it shall vest at a stated period, and if there be nothing in the context to show that the word ‘ vest ’ is to be taken otherwise than in its strictly legal sense, all discussion is, of course, precluded; for a legacy cannot vest at two different periods. But a question generally arises in these cases as to the real meaning to be attributed to the word:” 2 Jarman on Wills (Am. ed.), 467.</p>

The manifest purpose of the clause being protection to the accountants, and all but the last eight words being consistent with the clear intent expressed in the two preceding clauses, the meaning of the word “vest” which ought to be adopted is one which will not strike down, but sustain a clear and general intent. In attributing to it such meaning, often given to it, the apparent inconsistencies in the will disappear and the intention of the testator cannot be obscured by any argu<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>ment based on what is generally regarded as the mere technical meaning of the term.</p>
