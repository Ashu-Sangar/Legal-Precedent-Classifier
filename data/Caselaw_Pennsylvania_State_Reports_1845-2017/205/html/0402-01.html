These tracks were laid in <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>1873 by the People’s Railway Company, a corporation chartered by act of assembly of April 4,1865, and since 1895 have been used by agreement by the Schuylkill Electric Railway Company. The People’s Railway Company had the right to lay its tracks in the borough without municipal consent, and the fundamental question at the hearing was whether the defendants had exceeded their powers in entering into an agreement for the use or lease of the tracks. This question could be raised only by the commonwealth. It was properly held by the learned judge that “ whether any of the above companies exceeded their lawful authority by becoming a party to the contracts entered into, is a question of excessive exercise of power by a corporation, for which it is amenable to the commonwealth but not to a private suitor, or another corporation, unless such suitor has sustained a private injury, or such corporation has had its rights and franchises invaded. We hold that this plaintiff has not sustained such injury, and, as to that part of the road now under discussion, have no standing to maintain their bill:” Western Pennsylvania Railroad Co.’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/104/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="104 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="452211" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0399-01">104 Pa. 399</a>.</p>
