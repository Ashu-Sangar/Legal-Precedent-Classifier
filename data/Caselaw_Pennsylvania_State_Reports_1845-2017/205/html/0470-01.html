    <p class="summary" id="b497-7" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[168,1235,1181,303]]]'>There has been no serious effort made by either party to establish an adverse possession or to set up a prescriptive right as opposed to the records of title and grants. The question therefore is one of real estate law, depending more on the interpretation of recorded deeds than on the conduct of the various holders of the titles, as testified to by the witnesses called.</p>

Joshua Paxon, owning both the dominant and the servient tenement, sold his land in two portions, the one, now belonging to the respondent, being expressly subjected to a right of way in favor of the other, now owned by the complainant. As will appear from the deeds themselves, the conclusion is unavoidable, that this easement was created as appurtenant to the lot now owned by plaintiff. It was binding upon Paxon himself, and, by record notice upon his immediate successor, Grau.</p>

In general, an easement created by express grant cannot be destroyed by anything-short of a new grant of equal solemnity or adverse possession constituting a prescriptive right. Nonuser, even if established, would not terminate it, and I have found that there is no evidence of a release and none showing adverse posses<a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>sion. That nonuser is immaterial is shown by McKee v.

There the subject of contention was .an alley which was fenced through" the middle and had stables, coal houses and other buildings upon it with trees and bushes, for a period of more than twenty-one years. It was held that as the right to the alley was conveyed by express grant and as the obstructions were not shown to have been accompanied by adverse possession, the easement must be sustained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[267,772,1190,772]]]'>It was urged, however, that in the present case, there is a lack of continuity in the line of deeds transferring the easement to the present claimant. The contention is that, granting the previous existence of the right, it expired because it was omitted from a deed by which the sheriff transferred the dominant tenement. I am unable to see how this omission can affect the rights of the parties. There is nothing amounting to a release, for the owner of the servient tenement was not privy to these transactions, and was fully informed of the existence of the easement by the record in his own line of title. Moreover, the presumption is that where notice is given to the servient holder either by apparent use of the way, or upon the record, all rights created to assist in the enjoyment of the dominant land, become appurtenant thereto, and pass therewith even though not mentioned in the deed.</p>

On page 111, Judge Thayer, in delivering the opinion of the court, says : “It would be a very dangerous doctrine to establish, that a covenantee who is not a party to the proceedings for the collection of the taxes, and who had no notice of their existence, should, without any fault of his, be deprived of a valuable right — a right which is as much property as the land itself. Such a doctrine would furnish a very easy method by which covenantors and their assigns <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>might evade the most solemn obligations, and fraudulently rid themselves of troublesome servitudes for which they have received a large price. Such a construction of the laws relating to the collection of taxes does not appear to be necessary in order to secure the payment of the tax, and would produce a manifest injustice without any important advantage to the state or the city. This then is precisely the case in which the argument from inconvenience is decisive of the construction. The words of the various acts of assembly relating to the levying and collection of taxes have no such necessary meaning or effect as that which the argument for the plaintiff attributes to them, and this being so, the great inconvenience which would result from the construction which he contends for supplies a powerful reason for believing that such a construction was never contemplated by the legislature, and fully warrants us in rejecting it. The decisions and the general current of legislation upon this subject tend greatly to strengthen this conclusion. That a ground rent was not divested by a judicial sale for taxes assessed upon the land was settled by the courts before the passage of the act which expressly so enacts : Irwin v. Bank of United States, <a href="/pa/1/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="1 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="949902" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0349-01">1 Pa. 349</a>; Salter v. Reed, <a href="/pa/15/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="15 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="408694" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0260-01">15 Pa. 260</a>. The legislation which protects mortgages which are prior to tax claims is also a clear indication of the policy of the state upon the subject. The right which is acquired by the covenantee and his assigns in a building restriction, such as that which exists in that of the line of his title, is a right not in the land, but appurtenant to the land. Like a ground rent, it is an interest not in the land itself, but incident to the ownership of another, and arising out of a covenant fastened upon it by a former owner. The same reasoning and the. same policy which protects a ground rent from being divested by the sale of the land for taxes, ought therefore to protect the right which a covenantee and his assigns have in a building restriction.”</p>
