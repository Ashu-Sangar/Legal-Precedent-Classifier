This sale was confirmed absolutely on October 20, 1894. It was subsequently set aside by an order made January 13,1896. On June 20, 1899, at the request of the receiver, he was permitted to make a sale of the property to M. M. Garland, at $10,000 for the real estate and $1,300 for the personal property, the said Garland to take the property as of September 29, 1894, receiving the benefits of all sales made by the receiver after September 29,1894, and assuming all expenses incurred by the receiver after that date wfith respect to the said property. The sale to M. M. Garland was consummated by the receiver, and the purchase money paid. The expenses in connection with the sales of the real estate, as shown by the accounts, amount to $936.15, tmd the net proceeds from sales of real estate for distribution amount to $11,063.85.</p>

Black, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Phila.%20635" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Phila. 635">14 Phila. 635</a>. That the receiver thoroughly appreciated this fact appears from his testimony, in which he says very frankly that in operating the works he acted upon his own responsibility. That the operation of the works resulted in a large loss does not now admit of doubt. The expenses incurred by the receiver in the operation of the works not only exceeded his receipts, but, as shown by the findings of fact, his expenses exceeded the value of the merchandise coming into his possession and disposed of prior to September 29, 1894, plus all the moneys realized from bills and accounts receivable, by $2,183.86. In other words, he had a deficit of that amount. So that, as a matter of fact, the loss occasioned by the conduct of the receiver in this respect would amount to the difference between the assets coming into his hands at the date of his appointment and the amount remaining in his hands on September 29, 1894. But looking at the case in this aspect, the receiver would be entitled to some reasonable allowance for collecting these bills receivable and disposing of the personal property in the condition in which it was at the time he took charge of it. No testimony has been <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>presented to the auditor to enable him to make a finding upon this theory. Taking into consideration all of the circumstances of the case, and the receiver’s statement that in the operation of the works he acted upon his own responsibility, it seems to the auditor that the least responsibility to which he could be held would be to require him to bear the amount of the deficit which he incurred : in other words, require him to pay the excess of his expenditures over the value of the property taken possession of and disposed of by him. He certainly cannot charge this deficit, occurring in the operation of the works, as against the moneys realized from the sale of real estate, nor has he any right, as it seems to your auditor, to deduct it from the amount found to be due from him to the creditors by reason of his conduct in purchasing at his own sale.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[299,1093,1188,455]]]'>The auditor is therefore of the opinion that the accountant should be surcharged with the amount of the net deficit arising from his management of the trust estate between October 11,1893, and September 29,1894, which amounts to $939.85. In ascertaining this amount the auditor has allowed the accountant credit for $1,244.01, being the amount shown as the loss incurred on the Pennsylvania railroad contract, which contract was authorized by the court, and also the loss on the item of bar iron, $3,564.</p>

The great number of cases in which attempts have been made by executors, administrators, trustees, assignees and receivers to purchase the trust property at their own sales, either directly or through the intervention of third parties, probably illustrates the necessity for the strict rules established by the courts in this class of cases. Be that as it may, in Pennsylvania it is certainly well established by an unbroken line of decisions extending from Moody v. Vandyke, 4 Binney, 31, to French v.

It requires but a small knowledge of the world, to be sensible of the wisdom of this rule. The person entrusted with the sale has so perfect a knowledge of the subject, and so great an opportunity of taking advantage, by appointing the time and place of sale, and employing the agents who conduct it, that to permit him to become the purchaser, would be placing too much confidence in the infirmity of human nature.”</p>

      <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>A further question arises as to whether this liability of the receiver can be enforced by a surcharge on the present audit.

He did become interested in the firm, and upon the filing of his account was surcharged with the difference between the appraised value of the property, as shown by the inventory and the amount realized on the sale. In Rosenberger’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/26/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="26 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="977333" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0067-01">26 Pa. 67</a>, executors were authorized to sell real estate at public sale, and one of them became interested with a third party in purchasing the property which the purchasers subsequently sold at an advance, and upon a settlement of the executors’ account, they were surcharged with the entire amount of profit made by the purchasers. In Wallington’s Estate, 1 Ashmead, 807, President Judge King fully discusses this same question, and sustains a surcharge for the difference between the real value and the price obtained at the public sale.</p>

Nearly all of the cases in which the question has arisen, and in which the trustee has been held guilty of a breach of trust in purchasing, are cases of public sales ; and the cases are clear that the principle applies equally whether the sale be public or private: Walling-ton’s Estate, 1 Ashmead, 307. But in the present case, the sale to Garland was in no sense a public sale. There was no competitive bidding at all. The receiver applied to the court by petition for leave to sell the property to Garland for a fixed sum, stated that he had accepted ten per cent of the purchase <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>money on account, and recommended that said sale be made, whereupon he received authority to make sale direct to the purchaser.
