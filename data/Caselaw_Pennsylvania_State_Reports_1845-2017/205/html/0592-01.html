It is true the act designates the clerk, as the one who shall receive the $5.00 on filing the application, and further designates him as the one who shall select the newspapers in which the advertisements required shall be published, but it further provides that the cost of publication shall not exceed the usual rates charged by such newspapers and in no event shall in the aggregate exceed the $5.00 thus provided. These limitations to the cost of publication are significant, as showing the intent of the legislature in not permitting contracts <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>for advertising to be made which would be more than usual charges for similar work and under no circumstances, be in excess of the amount paid, and thereby create a claim against the county treasury in excess of the amount collected for such purposes. Evidently the county treasury is to be protected by these provisions and not the individual clerk, and if this is true, is not the money collected to be paid to the county treasury, from which amount, thus paid, the expenses, referred to in the act, are to be cared for under the provisions of the salary act? The act of 1897 places no unusual duties on the clerk, except empowering him to designate the papers in which the license advertisements are to be published, in which respect it differs from former acts, and the reasons for the change may well be imagined, as being for political and revenue purposes of a private character, than for any public good.</p>

This rale was not violated in this case. The only question for decision was whether the defendant was entitled to retain money paid him as clerk of the courts of Schuylkill county in pursuance of section 3 of the act of July 30, 1897, by persons applying for liquor licenses, or whether this money was an earning of the office and belonged to the county under the act of March 31, 1876. The question put to the court in the last paragraph of the case stated was whether the defendant had “ the right to retain the balance as his special fee in addition to his salary under the act of 1876.” It was wholly unnecessary for the court to inquire whether the act of 1876 was in force in Schuylkill county, and to find the fact that the county contained more than 150,000 inhabitants. That the act of 1876 applied to the defendant was not questioned. It was assumed by the parties, and was a necessary and irresistible inference from the language in the case stated. In Luzerne Co. v.

This depended entirely upon the population of the county at the time when he assumed the duties of his office. This was not agreed upon nor admitted, and the whole case turned upon it. The agreement as to the population was argumentatively stated, but the fact was left to be ascertained by inference by the court.</p>

The Act of March 31,1876, P. L. 13, was passed to give effect to section 5 of article 14 of the constitution, which requires that in counties containing over 150,000 inhabitants, all county officers shall be paid by salary. The act provides that all fees received shall belong to the county; that all <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>county officers, tbeir deputies and clerks, shall be paid for their services by fixed and specific salaries to be paid from the amounts paid into the county treasury from the office. The fee of 15.00 which the act of July 80, 1897, requires an applicant for a liquor license to pay to the clerk of the court of quarter sessions when he files his petition, is a fee of the office and like all other fees belongs to the county.
