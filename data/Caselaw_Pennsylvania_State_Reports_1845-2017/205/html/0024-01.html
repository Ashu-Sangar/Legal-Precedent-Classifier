    <p id="b52-4" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[287,504,1187,656]]]'>But it is not forbidden by this act, nor made illegal in anyway, to create by grant or devise an estate with the same attribute of survivorship as joint tenancy at common law. Thus a grant to three for their joint lives with remainders to the survivors and survivor, and to the heirs of the survivor in fee would be unquestionably good and yet it would be practically a grant to the three in joint tenancy with survivorship as at common law. This was substantially the case of Arnold v. Jack’s Exrs., <a href="/pa/24/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="24 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="9503131" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0057-01">24 Pa. 57</a>, and it was there held that though survivorship as an incident of joint tenancy has been abolished, it may still be created or conferred by express words in a deed or will.

The statute had abolished this and provided that the estate holden should be considered “ in the same manner as if ... . they had been tenants in common.” When therefore the grantor declared in his deed that his grantees should hold “as joint tenants and not as tenants in common,” he made clear his intent not to follow the statute but to convey an estate subject to the right of survivorship, the distinguishing incident of joint tenancy at common law.</p>
