Burns, <a href="/pa/107/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="107 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="8856242" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0050-01">107 Pa. 50</a>. Yet it must be considered that, in the case before us, according to much of the testimony, the relations of the parties were much more intimate and confidential than those of mere strangers. From the testimony the petitioner seems to have been the decedent’s “sister’s son,” he held decedent’s written power of attorney and one of the witnesses (P. D. Manley) testified that Mr. Shaffer declared to him, that “he felt towards Mr. Zurflieli as though he were a son, and looked upon him just as he would upon a son.” And further on in his evidence that the relations between them were “ just like father and son.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b173-5" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[137,1025,1183,927]]]'>The rule of law is recognized in Edwards v.

The witnesses must have heard the parties repeat in each other’s presence. The contract is not to be inferred from the declarations of one of the parties. Quoting Ackerman v. Fisher, <a href="/pa/57/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="57 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="1010398" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0457-01">57 Pa. 457</a>, the opinion proceeds: “ The burden is no lighter when the alleged contract is set up by a son-in-law. It might well be argued therefore that inasmuch as the evidence discloses a relation like father and son, that the rule to which we have adverted in Allison v. Burns, would not apply, since the parties were not strangers, but that on the contrary, by reason, if not by positive authority, it ought to be held necessary to establish a claim such as this, by more than the declarations of one party to the contract, that is, by direct testimony of witnesses to the making of the contract, whose evidence should bring the parties “face to face.”</p>

None of the declarations of decedent, as testified to bj^ the witnesses, relate either to the past or to the present; they all refer to the future.

Giving the language of the decedent its extreme effect, it is significant only of a voluntary intention to reward the petitioner for his services, which it is true seem to be satisfactory, or, to show his appreciation of petitioner’s conduct, which he declares to be that of a son.</p>

So far then we have found evidence in abundance of an intention on the part of the decedent to devise the Cherry street property to the petitioner, but none at all of an agreement with Zurflieh to do so; and ample evidence, too, of a disposition “ to reward Peter,” “ to give Peter,” to “ leave Peter,” but none of a gift actually accomplished or consummated between parties.</p>

The whole matter of course rests in parol, and as we have observed, standard of proof required to take such contract, if a contract had been proven, out of the statute of frauds, is exceedingly strict as of right it should be. We refer to some of the many authorities on the subject: Hart v. Carroll, <a href="/pa/85/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="85 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="440531" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0508-01">85 Pa. 508</a>.</p>

Here, in our opinion, is precisely where the petitioner failed, and failure here must rule the case against him.</p>

Further, that the uncle had declared to several third persons, that he was going to give the house and lot to his nephew Peter, because he rendered him valuable services. It was further <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>shown, that the nephew had made valuable improvements to the property, had married and moved into the house with his wife and was in possession when the uncle died. There is no question but that the nephew for a number of years faithfully performed valuable services for the uncle at the latter’s request. Nor is there any doubt that the uncle often acknowledged to others the value of these services and declared his intention of compensating him; to several he said he would give to him or deed to him this house. But this proceeding for specific performance of a parol contract to convey land involves no question as to the value of the services nor of an intention to convey or devise in the future. Still this proof while it might be sufficient to maintain assumpsit on a quantum meruit falls short of that required to meet our statute of frauds and therefore will- not sustain a decree for specific performance. An intention announced to others to compensate the nephew in the future is not sufficient. As is said in Edwards v. Morgan, <a href="/pa/100/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="100 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="498449" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0330-01">100 Pa. 330</a>, “ The contracting parties must be brought together face to face. The witnesses must have heard the parties repeat it in each other’s presence. The contract is not to be inferred from the declaration of one of the parties.” Adopting this rule, which is, in substance, the same in all of our many cases on the question, the learned judge of the court below in a very satisfactory opinion dismissed the petition. We affirm his decree for the reasons given by him.</p>
