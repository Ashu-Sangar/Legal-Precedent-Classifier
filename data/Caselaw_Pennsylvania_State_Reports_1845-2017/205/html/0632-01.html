Disregarding these words therefore we have a will in due form <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>signed by the testatrix at the end thereof as required by the act of 1888. Such a will can be revoked, under the express words of the statute, only by “ some other will or codicil in writing, or other writing declaring the same, executed and proved in the same manner .... or by burning, cancelling,” etc. The object of the statute was to secure evidence in the instrument itself of the completed intent of the testator, and that having been fully shown by the signature at the end is not to be revoked except by equal evidence of a subsequent completed change of intention. The evils under the former system of accepting a signature in any part of the instrument, or even unsigned memoranda as a valid will are forcibly stated by Strong, J., in Heise v. Heise, <a href="/pa/31/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="31 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="985023" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0246-01">31 Pa. 246</a>.</p>
