    <p id="b561-7" data-blocks='[["BL_561.8",561,[169,1118,1183,451]]]'>This action is for breach of covenant to exchange lands. The covenant sued on provided that “ the titles in both cases (are) to be clear of all liens, marketable and insurable,” etc. In 1895 a bill was filed by the present plaintiff for specific performance of the same covenant, and after hearing on the merits, was dismissed on the ground that plaintiff’s title was not marketable. This was a final adjudication of that question between these parties. The court was therefore right in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>
