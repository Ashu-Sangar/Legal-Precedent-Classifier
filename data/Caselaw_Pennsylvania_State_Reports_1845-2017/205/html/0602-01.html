Superior Cb. 36), among others, the following facts appeared: Stephen Pangburn was married to Sarah Giles in January, 1863, at Plainfield, N. J. On December 31, 1863, a daughter was born who was called Louisa. She is the plaintiff. Pangburn deserted his family shortly after the birth of the child. He went to Williamsport, Pa., and was there known as W. S. Allen. He died intestate, the owner of the lands in dispute. After coming to Williamsport, on November 11, 1865, he married Sarah Harman, his Plainfield wife being still alive. He had by Sarah Harman four children. He died in 1888. Administration was raised on his estate. On April 24, 1890, a petition in the orphans’ court was presentedby Edward Allen, a <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>son by the second marriage. The petition recited that W. S. Allen died seized of the lands described and set forth that he left a widow and four children, naming the family, resident in Williamsport. After the return of the rule to take or refuse at the appraisement, the court made an order of sale and the property was sold and the defendants in this ejectment purchased it, and the administrator delivered a deed to the purchasers pursuant to the order of the court. The plaintiff, Louisa L. Perrine, daughter and sole heir of the decedent, had no notice of the partition proceedings</p>
