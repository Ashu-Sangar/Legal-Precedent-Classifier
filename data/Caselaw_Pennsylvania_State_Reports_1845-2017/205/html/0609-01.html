The workmen had been notified earlier in the day that there would be no single track movement (i. e., that trains would not run in both directions) on the south track. The usual way for the railroad company to operate its road was to run its trains when its exigencies required it for short distances both ways on each of the tracks. Ample space was provided where workmen could escape injury from passing trains on either track. When in or near the tunnel, it was impossible to tell on which track a train was coming except from the direction in which it entered the tunnel, ordinarily west-bound trains passing through on the north track and east-bound trains on the south track. A train entered the tunnel going west and the deceased, with others, stepped on the south track to avoid it. The train instead of being on the north track was on the south track, and striking the deceased inflicted injuries from which he died. <em>Held, </em>that the notice to the employees that the trains would be run as usual on both tracks was notice that trains might come on either track in both directions, and that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>

Sanker, the plaintiff’s husband, being then in the employ of the defendant company as a track repairman, with a number of other employees, was engaged in putting new rails in the northern railroad track of the Gallitzin tunnel, in Cambria county. Traffic over that track was wholly suspended until the work of laying the new rails was completed. The northern track is what is called the west-bound track; the trains westward bound <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>usually use that track. The other, or what is called the southern or east-bound track, was not disturbed during the progress of the work on the northern track.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b637-3" data-blocks='[["BL_637.4",637,[125,514,1179,460]]]'>It appears that the work of replacing the old rails with new ones on that track was practically completed and the connection made a few minutes before two o’clock in the afternoon of that day, and that track was then put into service. Therefore at that time both tracks in the tunnel were ready for service the same as before the work of renewing the northern track had commenced. Neither the plaintiff’s husband nor any of the other of the employees was injured in the tunnel while in the performance of that work.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b637-4" data-blocks='[["BL_637.5",637,[124,982,1181,398]]]'>When the connection was made and that track ready for service, tire employees, including Sanker, went to the tool house, a short distance west of the tunnel, and got their dinners. It appears that some additional bolts were required in the rail splices; and, after the employees had their dinners, they, or at least many of those who had been at work, in the forenoon, including Sanker, were ordered to go to the tunnel and put in these bolts.</p>

A heavy cloud of smoke was about the mouth of the tunnel when the employees reached it, and they were directed by the foreman not to enter the tunnel until the smoke would clear away. While they were waiting to enter, another train was heard coming through the tunnel, also going westward. Probably believing this train was on the northern or west-bound track, many of the employees, for the purpose of avoiding being struck by it, congregated on the southern or east-bound track. Unfortunately for them the train was running on that track; and, probably on account of the density of the smoke hanging around the mouth of the tunnel, they could not or did not see that it was on the track on which they were standing, until it struck among them, injuring quite a number, among them the plaintiff’s husband, who died the same day in the Altoona Hospital from the injuries he sustained.</p>

      <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>The principal question which arises in this case is, whether the railroad company was guilty of negligence in running this train, which was composed of three locomotives and three cabin cars, westward on the east-bound track.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b638-5" data-blocks='[["BL_638.5",638,[306,720,1187,566]]]'>It also appears that the employees knew, when they went to the mouth of the tunnel after dinner, that both tracks were in service. They were so informed at the tool house before they started for the tunnel. They heard the rumble of the approaching train in the tunnel; they saw the smoky condition of the atmosphere at the mouth of the tunnel, which prevented them from seeing into it and ascertaining upon which track the train was running. Unfortunately they assumed it was on the westbound track, while in fact it was on the east-bound track. They were not told it was on the west-bound track, but seem to have taken that for granted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b638-6" data-blocks='[["BL_638.6",638,[307,1295,1185,353]]]'>Both tracks being in service, the railroad company had a right to run its trains upon them as frequently as, and in whatever direction, it saw fit. The plaintiff’s husband, when he entered into the employment of the railroad company, assumed the risk of all dangers incident^ to his employment, however they may arise, against which he may protect himself by the exercise of ordinary care.</p>

The train which had passed around this blockade of cars and which struck the employees was desired to be hurried to its destination to relieve a blockade at a point west of the tunnel. We cannot see upon what principle it can be held for negligence in running a train around this blockade of its freight trains, that it might speedily reach its destination to perform the duties to which the locomotives and cabins which composed it were assigned.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b639-3" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[133,580,1180,356]]]'>As the railroad company had a right to use its tracks in such a way as it thought best to conduct its traffic, the sad mistake of these employees to assume that this train would run on a particular track is not to be imputed to negligence on the part of the company.

There is some evidence that Ehrenfeld, the supervisor of the defendant company, and in charge of the maintenance of the tracks through the tunnel, told the employees that there would be no single track movement of the trains in the tunnel while the employees were at work; there is no evidence that there was any such movement of the trains when the employees were in the tunnel, or until after both tracks were ready for service and the employees had notice of it.</p>

After giving this notice the defendant owed these employees the same and no greater, duty, it did, as if the first notice had not been given. The defendant reassumed its right to run its trains on both tracks as it saw fit and it was the duty of the trackmen to keep out of their way. There was no necessity for them to be on the south track. Ample space was provided, where they could have escaped injury from passing trains on either track.
