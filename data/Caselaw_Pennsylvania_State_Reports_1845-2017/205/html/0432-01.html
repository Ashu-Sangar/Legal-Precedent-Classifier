The direction complained of was as stated by the engineer: “ My orders were to run the southbound track carefully; that there were fifteen cars on the southbound at Front street, and that an engine was coming from Richmond to move them to Richmond; that I should follow those cars down carefully, and after they were shifted the engine would go in the house.” The engine and tender were accordingly run, carefully as alleged, but met the standing cars at Second street instead of Front as expected, with the result of a collision in which the plaintiff was injured. The character of these orders on the question of negligence was for the jury. It may be that in railroading where distances are so entirely a matter of time and speed, a direction to run carefully and be on the lookout for an obstruction at a point named is sufficiently accurate and specific though the obstruction be met in fact twelve or thirteen hundred feet nearer. If the order was not negligent under the customs and common understanding in the business, then the defendant is not responsible, for that is the only negligence averred on which the plaintiff can recover. <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>But as that is not the only or even the prima facie deduction from the order, it must go to the jury ou the evidence.</p>

The inference that if the sill here had been stronger the injury to the plaintiff would have been less or would not have happened at all, is a mere guess which the jury should not be permitted to make.</p>
