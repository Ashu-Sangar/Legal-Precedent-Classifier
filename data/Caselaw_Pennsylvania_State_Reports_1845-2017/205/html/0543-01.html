Such a system is opposed to the general policy of the law of Pennsylvania relative to the existence and treatment of disease.</p>

They have been a congregation for about ten years, and desire to be incorporated as a church under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania. The purposes for which they desire to be incorporated are stated in clause I of their application, as follows : “To establish and maintain a place for the support of public worship and to preach the gospel according to the doctrines of Christ Jesus as found in the Bible and the Christian Science Text Book, ‘ Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,’ by Mary Baker G. Eddy.” The witnesses uniformly agree <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>that the Christian Science Church “ differs from other Christian beliefs in endeavoring to practice the entire command of the Master who founded the Christian religion, in which he said, ‘Preach the Gospel and heal the sick.’ The ordinary church attempts merely to preach the gospel. The Christian Science Church preaches the gospel and heals the sick.” It appears that the method of healing the sick is simply and solely by inaudible prayer. The book of Mrs. Eddy, entitled, “ Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,” shows that the church is not only an organization to inculcate a creed or to establish a form of worship, but also to accomplish the cure of disease. Not only does the church preach the gospel as found in the Bible and in the book of Mrs. Eddy, but it also, through its healers, attempts the cure of disease. In fact, the longest chapter in the book is entitled “ Christian Science Practice,” and contains instructions in detail as to the mode of treatment. The fundamental principle of the teaching is that what is termed disease has no real existence. The doctrine is set forth on page 188, as follows: “ What is termed disease does not exist,” and on page 184 as follows: “ The so-called laws of health are simply laws of mental belief. The premises being erroneous, the conclusions are wrong. Truth makes no laws to regulate sickness, sin or death, for these are unknown to the truth and should not be recognized by man as reality.” Again, on pages 393-4 the doctrine is taught that man is never sick; that his belief that he is, is the disease and the cause of it, and that the universal and perfect remedy is to understand that his sickness is not real; and again, on page 395, “ When divine science overcomes faith in materia medica, and faith in God destroys faith in drugs and all material methods of healing — sin, sickness and death will disappear,” and again, on page 400 : “ When disease is once destroyed in mind, the fear of it is gone, and therefore it is thoroughly cured,” and again, on page 176: “Christian Science heals organic disease as well as functional. It finds that decided types of acute disease are quite as ready to yield to truth as the less distinct types and chronic form of disease. It handles the most malignant contagion with perfect assurance.”</p>

Medicine has been defined to be “ the art of preventing, curing, or alleviating diseases and remedying, as far as possible, the results of violence and accident.” The system taught by Mrs. Eddy’s book certainly would come under this definition of the word “ medicine,” and it would seem that she herself conceded it, for, on page 468 of her book, she states the result of her work as follows: “ In founding an ethical and medical system, I have labored to expound divine principle, not to exalt personality.” The witnesses who testified before the master in this case are very clear that one of the prime purposes of their church, and the one that distinguishes it from the orthodox church, is that it attempts to heal the sick.

Dimner Beeber as master, who reported that an examination of Mrs. Eddy’s book showed that the church which it was proposed to organize was not merely to inculcate a creed, or to establish a form of worship, but was also intended for the treatment and cure of disease, through the healers which it is to train and constitute. That the method to be pursued by these healers in curing the sick, is simply and solely by inaudible prayer, whether in the presence of the sick or at a distance, being immaterial. That to qualify for the practice of healing disease according to this method, nothing was necessary except the study of the system taught in Mrs. Eddy’s book, no knowledge of anatomy, physiology, pathology or hygiene being required. The fundamental principle of the teaching of Mrs. Eddy being that what is termed disease, has no real existence. That “ sickness, sin and death are unknown to truth, and should not be recognized by man as reality.” According to the testimony she teaches that inflammation, tuberculosis, hemorrhage and decomposition are beliefs and not real facts. The master points out that this theory is directly oppo§ed to the general spirit and purpose of the laws of Pennsylvania, with regard to the public health, and the treatment of disease. That the quarantine and inspection laws, and the enactments designed to prevent contagion and infection are all based upon the theory that disease is a reality, and that it exists without reference to the condition of mind of its subject. The master reaches the conclusion that “ it would be injurious to the community to incorporate a group of citizens who would teach the doctrine that there is no such thing as a contagious disease, or any disease, and practice the art of curing what are called contagious diseases in the manner above described.” He further refers to the established policy of the commonwealth, which in the interest of the public good, requires certain qualifications in persons who presume to treat and cure disease, and ha tersely adds, “ what the good of the community requires under <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>the law as it exists ought not to be imperilled by the incorporation of a group of citizens whose fundamental doctrine is, that the public good requires no such thing.” He therefore recommended that the application for the charter be refused.</p>

But the court below in its supplemental opinion, went beyond this question and adopted in substance the conclusion of the master, that the practice of the art of healing or curing disease in the manner set forth in Mrs. Eddy’s book is injurious to the community, because it is opposed to the general policy of the law of Pennsylvania relative to the existence and treatment of disease.

We are not to consider' the matter from either a theological or metaphysical standpoint, but only in its practical aspects. It is not a question as to how far prayer for the recovery of the sick may be efficacious. The common faith of mankind relies not only upon prayer, but upon the use of means which knowledge and experience have shown to be efficient. And when the results of this knowledge and experience have been crystallized into legislative enactments, declarative of what the good of the community requires in the treatment of disease, and of the qualifications of those who publicly deal with disease, anything in opposition thereto may fairly be taken as injurious to the community. Our laws recognize <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>disease as a grim reality to be met and grappled with as such. To secure the safety and protect the health of the public from the acts of incompetent persons, the law prescribes the qualifications of those who shall be allowed to attempt the cure or healing of disease.

It is only designed to secure competent service for those who desire to obtain medical attendance. In certain diseases the individual affected may be the only one to suffer for lack of proper attention; but in other types, of a contagious or infectious nature, they may be such as to endanger the whole community, and here it is the policy of the law to assume control and require the use of the most effective known means to overcome and stamp out disease which otherwise would become epidemic. In such cases, failure to treat, or an attempt to treat, by those not possessing the lawful qualifications, are equally violative of the policy of the law. It may be said that the wisdom or the folly of depending upon the power of inaudible prayer alone, in the cure of disease, is for the parties who invoke such a remedy. But this is not wholly true. “For none of us liveth to hiihself, and no man dieth to himself,” and the consequence of leaving disease to run unchecked in the community is so serious that sound public policy forbids it. Neither the law, nor reason, has any objection to the offering of prayer for the recovery of the sick. But in many cases both law and common sense require the use of other means which have been given to us for the healing of sickness and the cure of disease. There is ample room for the office of prayer, in seeking for the blessing of restored health, even when we have faithfully and conscientiously used all the means known to the science and art of medicine.</p>
