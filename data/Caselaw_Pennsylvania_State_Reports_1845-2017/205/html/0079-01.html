Diehl were the owners of all its stock, and on that date these stockholders entered into an agreement for the evident purpose of continuing the concern as a close corporation, and provided therein that in the event of the death of any one or more of the parties the remaining stockholders should have the - option to purchase and acquire the stock of the deceased party at its book value. This book value, it was further provided, should be ascertained by mutual agreement, but in case no agreement could be arrived at then each of the parties should have the right to appoint an arbitrator, who, with power to select an umpire, should fix a price for the stock, and the surviving parties should then have a right to take or refuse the stock at the price so determined.</p>

The plaintiffs thereupon notified the administrator and guardian of their desire to purchase the stock, but were unable to secure an agreement as to price, whereupon the plaintiffs made demand upon the administrator and guardian for the appointment of arbitrators to fix a price on the stock. This the administrator and guardian refused to do, and the plaintiffs now seek to compel the administrator and guardian to select an arbitrator and go into an arbitration. To this bill David G. Lindsay, the administrator, files a demurrer.</p>

If the administrator has revoked the submission by the decedent hi his agreement that fact should be averred by answer. It does not appear on the face of the bill and therefore cannot be set up by demurrer. And even h the administrator has revoked the submission it does not follow that the court under the prayer for general relief may not go on to ascertain “ the fair price or book value of the shares,” so as to give effect to the option provided for in the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b108-8" data-blocks='[["BL_108.9",108,[285,1605,1188,721]]]'>What the bill avers is that the administrator refuses to execute the agreement because he does not consider it legally binding. His objections are not tenable on demurrer. There is nothing illegal in the agreement on its face as set out in the bill. Each subscribing stockholder acquired a preferred right by way of option, to purchase the shares of the others if they died or withdrew from the business first. This was a mutual and sufficient consideration to make a binding contract. Whether equity will enforce it specifically will depend on the circumstances as they may be developed by the evidence. But the demurrer shows nothing in the bill inconsistent with the enforcement of the agreement upon the principles of Goodwin Gas Stove &amp; Meter Co.’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/117/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="117 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="555809" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0514-01">117 Pa. 514</a>, and Northern Central Ry.

No reason of overruling public policy is apparent why they should not also be sustained in relation to shares of stock in what is really only a private trading corporation.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[152,619,1179,561]]]'>But the objection to the jurisdiction of the court is well taken. The shares were the property of the decedent and on his death passed as part of his estate to the administrator who must account for them to the orphans’ court. Even conceding his right to revoke the submission which the agreement of his decedent provided for, his action in doing so must be justified before that court, and on the other hand the question of the complainant’s equity to have specific performance of his agreement must go to the same tribunal. The dismissal of the bill was- therefore proper on the ground of the want of jurisdiction in the common pleas.</p>
