At the time of his employment he stated to a representative of his client that the cost of the litigation might be as much as $50,000. During the progress of the litigation he was paid certain fees. Before the end of the litigation the client who lived in France sent to the attorney the sum of $20,000. A formal receipt was given for the money which simply stated that the attorney had received the amount of the order. Shortly afterwards <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>the attorney wrote to his client a letter in French, in which he used the following language: “ Je vous dois mille remerciements pour la facón genereuse dont vous avez daigne regler mes honoraires.” The letter as sent had been corrected by the attorney’s French teacher. The sentence as originally written by the attorney was follows: “Je vous dois mille remerciements poir votre genereux paiement.” The evidence as to the meaning of the word “ regler” was not uniform. Some of the witnesses testified that it meant “pay” and others that it meant “settle.” The trial judge construed the word to mean “ pay” and refused to permit the French teacher, who had corrected the letter, to testify that it meant “ payment on account.” The court charged that the payment of $20,000 was a payment in full to the date of the payment, and that nothing could be recovered, except for services rendered after that date. The testimony of a number of leading members of the bar was that the services rendered during the whole litigation were worth $100,000. The jury returned a verdict for an amount which showed that it covered merely services rendered after the payment of the $20,000, and judgment was entered on the verdict. On appeal the six judges of the Supreme Court who heard the argument were equally divided in opinion whether or not the testimony should have been received and the case left to the jury, and the judgment was affirmed.</p>

During the progress of the litigation and until April 26, 1898, Mr. Brewster received about $9,000 in fees. On May 16, 1898, he received from his client, who lived in France, an order for $20,000.

I have ruled upon numerous question of law during the presentation of the evidence ; and since the evidence was all in I have ruled upon a question of law, which largely diminishes the duties cast upon you as triers of fact. [I have ruled, as a matter of law, that the receipt or acknowledgment sent by Judge Brewster to his client in May of 1898, was in point of fact a receipt or acknowledgment of the payment of a sum of money satisfactory to him, for his services rendered for his client, up to April 11, 1898, and that his executor has therefore no right to recover from Mrs. Coleman anything for his services rendered back of that date.

I feel convinced that if I attempted to go over in detail the basis of the compensation to be made by the jury, I would rather retard or hinder you than I would aid you. I shall therefore leave the question to you, saying to you that, under my ruling on the law, you are limited to awarding compensation to the executor of Judge Brewster’s estate for his legal services on behalf of Mrs. Coleman, from April 11, 1898, down to the time of his death.
