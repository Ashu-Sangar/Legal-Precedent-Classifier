On the other hand, if the state of the evidence is such that the judge would not feel constrained to set aside the verdict, the dispute should be considered substantial and an issue should be directed. This simple and only safe test is supported alike by reason and authority.”</p>

Being unmarried and without issue, it is most natural he should select his grandnephew, who appeared to be worthy, intelligent and reputable in every respect, as the principal object of his bounty. He is his namesake and testator was evidently much attached to him and had contributed towards his maintenance and education. There is not the slightest proof that any request or solicitation was made by any person to testator that a gift should be made by him for his or her benefit except that by a sister of testator, (and, strange to say, a witness for the contestant and called to prove the mental unsoundness of her brother,) who requested his attorney, whom she knew was preparing his will, to recommend her brother to provide for her and her kindred. This is not consistent with the effort of the witness to ■ cast a doubt <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>upon the testamentary capacity of her brother. And as confirmation of the power of testator’s mind to discriminate and select the objects of his bounty, he complied with some of the requests of his sister and refused others.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b483-5" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[138,570,1183,714]]]'>There was no secrecy attending either the preparation or execution of the will. His intention was known to the persons composing his household. He gave instructions for its preparation to his counsel many days prior to its final engrossing and execution in the privacy of his room. And at its execution no one was present but his counsel, his assistant, well known to and familiarly greeted by testator, his attending physician, and the subscribing witnesses, both disinterested and strangers to testator until that moment, when they were formally introduced to and recognized by him as the persons who were to witness the execution of his will. The testamentary paper was previously read to testator by his counsel, whose clerk was present at the time, and testator expressed his entire satisfaction therewith.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b483-6" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[141,1301,1182,356]]]'>That he was not intoxicated at the time and had full knowledge of the testamentary act in which he was then engaged are clearly shown. All the facts and circumstances connected with the preparation and execution of the will strikingly resemble those shown in the case of Wainwright’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/89/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="89 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="1063238" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0220-01">89 Pa. 220</a>.

A careful examination of the entire testimony negatives the thought. The testator had long been engaged in active business, and continued his attention to his investments and business, being a member of a copartnership, down to the day of his death. He had, until a few years prior to his death, been temperate and abstemious, careful and cleanly in his person, dress and language, and then began to be the reverse. He used intoxicating liquors to excess until he undermined his health and caused the disease which eventually terminated in his death, and became filthy in his personal habits and language. Still he was able to attend to his business and conversed about its affairs until within a few hours of his death. He was also <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>able to consult his counsel aad give him instructions relative to the disposition of his estate and continuance of his firm’s business after his death. And not only this, but also to provide for the consumption of his remains by fire, rather than burial in the earth, even against the objections of his counsel and the contrary sentiment of his near relatives. But these were unavailing, and the testator insisted upon his own wish being carried out. The will itself, by its careful provisions for the benefit of those whom testator selected as recipients of his bounty, speaks forcibly of his entire testamentary capacity. And, as shown in Schusler’s Est., supra, to warrant an issue upon the ground of intoxication, it must be proved that this was the condition of the testator at the time he executed his will. See also Probst’s Will, 2 Lane. 97, Hannum v. Worrall, <a href="/del/2/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Del. 49" data-case-ids="1866182" data-case-paths="/del/2/0049-01">2 Del. 49</a>, Weisman’s Est., 5 Pa C. C.

    <p class="summary" id="b484-5" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[282,1212,1190,1185]]]'>The testimony is overwhelming that testator well understood the nature of the act in which he was engaged, not only when he gave the instructions to his counsel but at the time he affixed his trembling hand and assisted signature to the testamentary paper. That he possessed sufficient intelligence to comprehend what he was doing is also evident from his jocular remark that his will being executed the next “is the undertaker.” All the witnesses present at the execution, every one disinterested, unite in the opinion that testator evinced an intelligent comprehension of his act and was fully competent to dispose of his property. This was the testimony of the attending physician who was also the medical attendant upon the sister of testator, and at whose request he became the physician of testator, and whose testimony is attempted to be overcome by that of another physician, not in attendance upon testator, who related declarations by the attending physician tending to discredit his testimony but which were not only solemnly denied by him but which are wholly uncorroborated and incredible. The testimony of this blatant witness who by his rudeness and impertinence, over anxiety to blacken the character of a reputable physician, and display of personal animosity towards him in a matter of no personal interest to himself, may well be disregarded and safely said to have no Aveight whatever.</p>
