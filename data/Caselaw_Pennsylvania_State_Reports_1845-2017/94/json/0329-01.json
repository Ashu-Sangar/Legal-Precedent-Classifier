    "head_matter": "Bernar versus Dunlap.\n1. To support an action for malicious prosecution both want of probable cause for the prosecution and malice in the prosecutor must be shown.\n2. Want of probable cause does not establish legal malice to be declared by the court, but it is evidence of malice proper to submit to a jury.\n3. In an action against the prosecutor, if the plaintiff proves he was discharged by the examining magistrate, the burden of proof that there was probable cause, as a general rule, is cast on the defendant. If, however, the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony shows the existence of probable cause, it lifts that burden from the defendant.\n4. In an action for malicious prosecution by B. against D., the magistrate before whom the complaint had been made was called by B. and testified: \u201c D. was at my office with O.; the latter said he had seen the stolen property in possession of B. My recollection is that G. said they were D.\u2019s property. I then recommended the complaint to be made.\u201d This evidence was uncontradicted. Held, that there was sufficient evidence of probable cause to justify the court in ordering a nonsuit.\n5. Undecided whether the advice of the magistrate should have the same protective power as the advice of counsel learned in the law.\nMay 6th 1880.\nBefore Mercur, Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey and Sterrett, JJ. Sharswood, C. J., and Green, J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster county: Of May Term 1880, No. 107.\nTrespass on the case, by Samuel B. Bernar against Stephen H. Dunlap, for malicious prosecution.\nBernar was arrested, on the complaint of Dunlap, for the larceny of a pair of gloves. Dunlap did not appear, and the case was dismissed by the alderman. At the trial of the present case, before Livingston, P. J., the plaintiff gave his own testimony, and called various witnesses to prove his good character. He also called the alderman, who testified: \u201c Mr. Dunlap came to my office in presence of Mr. Curtis, and Mr. Curtis said he had seen Dunlap\u2019s gauntlets in possession of Mr. Bernar; my recollection is that Curtis said they were Dunlap\u2019s gauntlets; I then recommended the complaint to be made. Some three or four days after suit was brought, when the goods were not found, Dunlap came to have the complaint dismissed or discharged; plaintiff didn\u2019t wait for that suit at my office.\u201d\nWhen the plaintiff rested, the defendant moved for a nonsuit, which the court granted.\nThe plaintiff subsequently obtained a rule to strike off the non-suit, and assigned the following reasons therefor: 1. There was want of probable cause shown sufficient to send the case to the jury, since the plaintiff in the criminal prosecution \u201chad been discharged by the examining magistrate,\u201d and the burden of showing affirmatively that there was probable cause rested upon the defendant. 2. There was want of probable cause shown sufficient to send the case to the jury, when the plaintiff proved good character, and that he lived in the same neighborhood where defendant resided, and frequently met defendant, and knew him by sight. 3. Want of probable cause having been shown sufficiently, it was unnecessary to prove malice, that being a question for the jury. 4. There was sufficient evidence produced to either put the defendant to his defence or send the case to the jury.\nThe court discharged the rule, Livingston, P. J., saying: \u201c A full examination of the notes of the trial and the authorities cited, as well as other authorities bearing on the same point, satisfies us that the judgment of nonsuit was properly entered, and should not be stricken off.\u201d\nThe plaintiff took this writ, and alleged that the court erred in discharging the rule.\nBenjamin B. Davis, for plaintiff in error.\nIt was held in Smith v. Ege, 2 P. F. Smith 419, that where the plaintiff below had been discharged by the examining magistrate, the burden of showing, affirmatively, that there was probable cause rested upon the defendant. It is said in 2 Greenl. Ev. 455: \u201c The discharge of the plaintiff by the examining magistrate is prima facie evidence of the want of probable cause sufficient to throw upon the defendant the burden of proving the contrary.\u201d Substantially the same view was taken in Secor v. Babcock, 2 Johns. 203, and Stone v. Crocker, 24 Pick. 81. It is also laid down in Israel v. Brooks, 23 Ill. 575, that proof of good character is evidence of want of probable cause. As the plaintiff below in this case showed that the complaint for larceny against him was dismissed by the examining magistrate, and that he possessed a good character at the time complaint was made, this was sufficient evidence of want of probable cause to either put the defendant below on his defence or send the case to the jury.\nMay 17th 1880,\nThe advice of counsel to excuse the defendant in an action for malicious prosecution must come from a member of the bar: Walter v. Sample, 1 Casey 275. Defendant is not protected by the advice of the alderman.\nB. Frank FsMeman, for defendant in error.\nThe court sustained the motion for nonsuit, because the plaintiff had shown that a theft had been committed. A complete absence of any malice against the defendant was apparent, in that the parties were strangers to each other. Dunlap had shown that probable cause, or a reasonable ground for belief of guilt existed in the mind of the prosecutor, because he had been reliably informed that the stolen goods were in the possession of the suspected party; and he had further shown that which must give the prosecutor complete absolution from all liability, viz., that after he had heard all the facts, and they were stated to the alderman, that official advised the bringing of the criminal proceedings.\nTo support an action for malicious prosecution, both malice and want of probable cause must be shown: Dietz v. Langfitt, 13 P. F. Smith 234; Le Maistre v. Hunter, Bright. 494; Lyon v. Fox, 2 Bro. R., App. 67.\nA citizen will not be punished who acts fairly and honestly upon the advice of an alderman: Rosenstein v. Feigel, 6 Phila. R. 532; Thomas v. Painter, 32 Leg. Int. 90."
