When the report was asked for, the company protested against their liability, but the account was nevertheless settled against it. It then appealed to the Common Pleas of Dauphin county. Its specifications of objection were, 1.. That the companies are not coal companies. 2. Because the tax is claimed on coal which the companies did not mine nor purchase and sell. 3. Because the companies have not, and do not possess the corporate right or privilege to mine, or to purchase and sell coal, and, therefore, not liable to a tax on their corporate franchises, created by or used within this Commonwealth, of three cents per ton on coal, under the 7th section of the Act of April 24th 1874, under which said account was settled.</p>

It is to cause the same to be leased and worked, the veins to be opened, schutes and breakers to be built, screens to be erected, &amp;c., and do the various acts usually attendant on starting coal works. After this preparation the company was not to work the mines, but it is very clear that they were to be let out to others.

Is this tax now claimed imposed on the capital stock or dividends of the company ? It is certainly distinguishable from a tax on capital stock. This is on the coal mined by others by the ton. It is not <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>what is known in this state as a tax on ‘ capital stock,’ nor is it what we generally understand by a tax on ‘ dividends.’ That has a well-settled meaning in Pennsylvania. If the power of taxation is to be taken away from the state it should be by clear and unequivocal expressions, not by mere implication. Another reason exists. The charter of the Rausch Creek Company was granted after the amendment to the Constitution in 1857, which secures to the legislature the power to alter, revoke or annul any charter of incorporation whenever in their opinion it shall be injurious to the citizens. It might be well said that the prohibition from taxing one company equally with another was unfair, and should not be practised or tolerated. * * * On the whole we are clearly of the opinion that this corporation is subject to taxation in the mode imposed by the accounting department and for .the sum fixed by it.”</p>

The error of the court is in holding that all corporations owning land upon which unincorporated associations, partnerships and individuals mine coal, are liable to a tax of three cents on each ton of coal mined on the land; and that the purchase of land, preparing it for mining and leasing it for a royalty constitute the purchase and sale of coal.</p>

The corporate right to mine is certainly not given where it is expressly withheld. Corporate rights are not to be presumed or implied.

To purchase land containing coal, and to sell it as. a product separated from the land would imply the right to mine, which is expressly denied in the charters. Of course, it cannot mean that to purchase the land and sell it again, with coal beneath the surface, is the right to purchase and sell coal; for that is no more the purchase and sale of coal than it is the purchase and sale of timber, if there be trees growing on the land. To purchase the land, and lease the veins at a rent or royalty to lessees who mine the coal and sell it, do not constitute the'sale and disposal of the products of the land within the mean- • <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>ing of the charters.

The intention of this section was to tax corporations in respect to the coal mined; or, if no mining was done by them, in respect to the coal they trafficked in. The coal itself is untaxecl, and its amount is computed for no purpose except to measure the extent to which the tax is levied upon the corporate franchise. It is true this corporation does not have mining privileges, but mining corporations are only one of the classes of corporations taxed by that section. Another class that is there taxed, consists of those having corporate rights to make merchandise of coal, and to this class this company belongs. It has an undoubted corporate privilege within certain limits to buy and sell coal lands; to prove and open veins of coal, to prepare the same to be worked and leased and lease them. The kind of lease it can thus make depends entirely upon its discretion. It may be for a fixed sum, or it may be as in this instance for a royalty paid upon each ton of coal mined by the lessee. But in either event the lease so made amounts to a sale of coal, and the lessor, in the contemplation of this tax law, becomes a vendor of the coal: Lykens Valley Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Dock, 12 P. F.

The Act of 24th April 1874, intended to tax corporations trafficking in coal in respect to all coal mined upon their lands by ‘£ any unincorported association, partnership or individual, under any lease, contract, grant or mining privilege” from the corporation, and this corporation has the corporate right to traffic in coal within the meaning of that tax section.</p>

The object of the law is to reach every corporation which purchases and sells coal, which mines coal on its own land or land it has leased, or which causes coal to be mined under a lease, contract, grant or mining privilege, to unincorporated persons on property that it owns, or has a coal privilege or interest therein.</p>
    <p id="b457-7" data-blocks='[["BL_457.8",457,[174,1175,1172,897]]]'>This plaintiff in error has extensive coal interests. It has the corporate right to own coal lands, to open the veins of coal, to erect all proper buildings, machinery and improvements for mining, to construct a railroad, and when the veins are prepared to be worked, it may lease them on such terms as may be agreed between it and its lessees. It leased for a stipulated sum for each ton mined. Having no mining privilege, nor fight to purchase and sell coal, “in the ordinary method of buying, selling or mining,” in a critical argument, it claims non-liability to the tax, because the literal meaning of the words employed in the first clause of the seventh section, do not require it to make returns to the auditor general. But it is an owner of coal lands, with corporate coal privileges and interests therein, w'hich it leased to natural persons for mining, and we cannot doubt that it is plainly within the intendment of the statute. Here, if anywhere, the rule should apply that “ statutes are to be construed so as may best effectuate the intention of the makers, which sometimes may be collected from the cause or occasion of passing the statute, and, when discovered, it ought to be followed with judgment and discretion in the construction, though that.construction may seem contrary to the letter of the statute.”</p>
