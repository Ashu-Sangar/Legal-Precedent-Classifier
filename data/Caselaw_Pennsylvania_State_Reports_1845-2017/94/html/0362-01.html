The husband was the actor through whom the wife acted. Can she bind herself by acting with her husband in an arrangement of this character ? The language of the court in McCullough <em>v. </em>Wilson, 9 Harris 436, is so tersely applicable to this case that it is here quoted : ‘ True, she did not bind herself by a separate acknowledgment, but that form of proceeding does not apply to such an act. True, also, a door is here open through which the wife may be imposed upon by her husband; but we find it open and would not shut it, for it is opened by the very confidence that ought to exist between husband and wife.’ * * * With these views the auditor appropriates- the fund: 1st.

Brown had nothing to do with it. We contend that she had the undoubted right and power to make him a gift of the whole of the judgment-bond and the money thereby secured to her, and release and enter satisfaction for the same on the records of the court. And if she had this right, it follows as a logical conclusion that she had the right and power to make a gift to him of a lesser interest than the whole judgment owing to her by her husband. Thus having the right to do so, she made to her husband a gift of the incident of lien upon her real estate, which the law attached to her judgment to the extent of $3000, to enable him to borrow that sum of money from Mrs. Hiester. She did not release any portion of the debt owing to her by her husband. This was not an executory gift, but was executed by the delivery of the bond (upon which the endorsement of assent was written), by Mrs. Brown to her husband, Kirk Brown, and the placing of the same upon record. As an executed gift from wife to husband it required no consideration: Bond <em>v. </em>Bunting, 28 P. F. Smith 210. Mrs. Brown created no liability. She only acted in conjunction and with the assent of her husband in limiting the lien of her judgment against her husband’s real estate to the extent of $3000, so as to give Mrs. Hiester a lien prior to the lien of her own judgment against the same real estate. Her act in causing her endorsement on her bond to. be placed on record operated by way of estoppel.</p>
