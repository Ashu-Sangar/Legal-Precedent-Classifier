Akers, receiver of the Union Plorse Insurance Company, of Blair county, against Albert Hite, Joseph Brunner and John Dicken, for the recovery of two assessments on premium notes, made for the purpose of paying off the indebtedness of the company. One assessment of three per cent, on premium notes in the hands of the company was made by the directors January 1st 1878, and one of fifteen per cent, was made by the receiver of said company March 29th 1878. The company was chartered June 17th 1872,. by the Court of Common Pleas of Blair county,' under the Act of Assembly of March 26th 1867, and conducted its business on the mutual plan. The value of each animal insured was considered capital stock, and was, in case of loss, subject to assessment.</p>

Joseph <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>M. Brunner insured two horses to the amount of $275 for five years, from the 6th October 1874, and Albert Hite insured two horses to the amount of $200 for five years, from the 6th October 1874. Both gave the same kind of deposit notes as Dicken. In 1876 and 1877 the company, from numerous and severe losses, became heavily involved, and judgments to a large amount were entered against it. A great many members became dissatisfied with the management of the company, and the directors, on the 20th of October 1876, passed a resolution “ to allow all dissatisfied me.mbers to withdraw from the company after paying all assessments or dues if their policies are handed to the directors.” And again on April 3d 1877, passed another resolution : “ In accordance with the resolution passed on the ‘20th of October 1876,’ that the officers of the company shall cancel all policies of persons who have paid all their just dues to the company, or shall pay them within thirty days after due notice has been given to them, provided such persons wish to withdraw from the company, in all cases when a'policy is cancelled, the secretary shall return the application on which the policy was granted, with as little delay as possible, to the person who made the application.” Numerous parties availed themselves of this opportunity, surrendered their policies to the company, and had them cancelled. These three defendants, Hite, Dicken and Brunner, handed their policies to Samuel Whip, one -of the directors, with the request to have them returned to the company. Whip -gave them to the secretary of the company, J. Z. Smith, who accepted them and told Whip if everything was right he would lay them before the board, and, if cancelled, would send defendants their premium notes. On investigation, the secretary discovered that, on previous assessments made, Hite was owing to the company $1.50, Dicken $4.58; and these three policies were not cancelled by the company, but treated in the books of the company as still in force ; and, in January 1878, when the secretary made out the assessment lists he assessed these three parties and charged them with the amount of their assessment. Meanwhile the company became more and more involved, judgment-creditors issued execution, and, after due process of law, J. C. Akers was appointed receiver of the company, the officers of the company surrendering to him on request all goods and chattels and all the assets consisting of premium notes. Not having any cash assets wherewith to pay the debts, and not being able to ascertain the indebtedness of the company or the amount of premium notes which were still in force and uncancelled, the receiver, by direction-of the Court of Common Pleas of Blair county, laid an assessment of fifteen per cent, on all premium notes in his possession and was directed to collect this amount, and also an assessment of three per cent., laid by the directors January 1878, but still uncollected.</p>

The mere handing of a policy by a member of a mutual insurance company to one of the directors, with the request to have it can-celled, is not such an action as would, in the eyes of the law, justify the surrender of the premium notes. While in the sense of the contract the company and each member stand to each other in the relation of insurer and insured, both parties had to agree as to a cancellation of a contract entered into. As defendants did not tender their dues the directors were justified in not cancelling their policies.

Their membership is not terminated by a notice to the agent of the company: Buckley <em>v. </em>Columbia Ins. Co., 2 Norris 294.

It is clear, that the plaintiff’s company authorized the cancellation of policies of dissatisfied members upon certain conditions, and that those conditions were complied with on the part of the defendants. By the resolutions of the company, the defendants were required to pay only their just dues or assessments. This they did. Two of them had been assessed upon horses which died or were sold more than a year previous. This was illegal, as is fully established : Wilson <em>v. </em>Trumbull Mutual Ins.

The company retaining the policies and the money, the defendants had a right to suppose that their policies were cancelled. The plaintiff’s company having accepted the payment made by them, promised to cancel their policies without any conditions or reservations. If there was any mistake or legal objection to the cancellation, it was the duty of plaintiff to so notify the defendants. This they did not do, and retaining the money and policies upon promise to cancel waived all objections if any existed. If defendants had sustained a loss, they would soon have been told, “ you have surrendered your policy. It is cancelled. We will pay you nothing.”</p>

A policy of insurance and the premium note given therefor, constitute a contract between the company and the insured, and the parties .usually have the same power to rescind it by mutual agree^ ment as they had to make it. Such a power on the part of the company seems essentially necessary to the safe and proper transaction of its business: Roland <em>v. </em>Whitman, Receiver, <a href="/ind/33/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="33 Ind. 64" data-case-ids="1481363" data-case-paths="/ind/33/0064-01">33 Ind. 64</a>; Woodwarth <em>v. </em>Davis, Receiver, <a href="/ohio-st/13/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="13 Ohio St. 123" data-case-ids="8841870" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/13/0123-01">13 Ohio St. 123</a>. Most mutual companies insert stipulations in their policies that they shall become void, either <em>ipso facto, </em>or at the option of the company, for certain acts of omission or commission by the insured, and when avoided, the rights and liabilities of the member are ended, except his liability for debts already incurred: Columbia Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Masonheimer, 26 P. F. Smith 138; Wilson <em>v. </em>Trumbull Ins. Co., 7 Harris 372. The right of the company to cancel policies and thus terminate the contract, for various acts of the insured, though such right be not expressly reserved, has constantly been recognised, and it would be strange if it could not agree with the insured to abrogate the contract when deemed expedient or advantageous.</p>

In that case the note was given in pursuance of a section of the charter of the company, for security of those, concerned, and is not like the case of a note given in the contract of insurance.

Thus, when the assured surrendered his policy and received from the secretary of the company bis deposit note, there being contested claims which were <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>subsequently established and on which he paid nothing, and after-wards a receiver was appointed who made an assessment on the said assured for payment of said losses, it was held that the matter had been adjusted between the company and the assured, and the receiver could not impeach or disaffirm the lawful acts of the corporation : Hyde, Receiver of the Chenango Mutual Ins.

After the filing of a petition by a mutual insurance company, but before publication of the appointment of a receiver, the maker of a premium note paid an assessment thereon and surrendered his policy, under an agreement with an authorized agent of the company that such payment and surrender should be in full of said note, which was agreed to be given up, but was not; the note was extinguished and the receiver could not maintain an action thereon: Sands, Receiver of the Columbia Ins.

The value of the property insured was the amount of his capital stock, and he was liable to assessment for payment of losses' occurring during the time of his membership. When, for any cause, he ceased to be a member, he would not be liable for future debts, but-could afterwards be assessed for payment of debts made while he was a member, unless he had duly settled with the company. Section 8 of the charter provides, that all affairs of the company shall be managed and controlled by a board of directors. The verdict shows that in pursuance of resolutions of the board, the defendants paid all their just dues, as assessed against them, and handed their policies to one of the directors to return to the company to be cancelled; that they were so returned, and said board promised to cancel them and return the stock notes as soon as the secretary had time; that the assessment laid by the directors, being the. just dues so paid by defendants, was insufficient to pay the liabilities then existing; that said policies were not in fact cancelled, and said notes came into the hands of the receiver who laid the assessments in suit; and that under said resolutions the directors cancelled the principal part of the capital stock.</p>

The plaintiff has no more right to collect assessments on these notes than on those which had been actually returned on like terms.

Whether <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>there are facts which would make all, who were once members, liable to assessment for indebtedness created before the cancellation of their contracts, does not appear — they are not in the verdict.
