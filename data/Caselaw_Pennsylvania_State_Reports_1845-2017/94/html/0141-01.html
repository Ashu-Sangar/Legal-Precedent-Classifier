The same trust thrown around the father was, by the proviso, cast about <em>the </em>son. What governed the testator ? It is forbidden to guess. There are no facts proven by the will that cast any light. But Jacob’s only son was Frank. If Frank was allowed to take absolutely, under the will, and died intestate, leaving no issue living at the time of his death, all his (Frank’s) heirs, under the intestate laws, both in the Fitzwater and maternal' line could have inherited. This consideration appears to have reached and aroused the testator at the close, and just before the proviso was added. By the general bequest he had given Frank an absolute interest in the fifth, bequeathed to his father. He knew this, for he says, ‘ if Frank should die without issue, then I order and direct that the money coming to him out of my estate, at the death of his father, <em>as hereinbefore </em>provided, shall, &amp;c.’ Can anything indicate more clearly a purpose first formed and then changed by the new idea ? Can it be doubted that a competent testatpr grappling with testamentary ideas, may not modify a former by a later clause in his will ?</p>

But this old man has shown the cause of the after-thought. He wanted his money, if Frank had no children, to be kept in the line of his own blood. This does not depend upon fancy or conjecture. The testator goes on to say that in the event of his death childless, the fund shall go to his uncles and aunt, on his father’s side, or their <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>issue. What can be stronger ? There is an expressed intention; and the cause of that intention, as well as the reason for the intention in the original idea, are given in a way that forbids mistake. The will is clear, the intention is obvious. No rule of law forbids it being thus construed. Frank, upon his father’s death, takes his place in his rank* as a cestui que trust. His children, under the proviso, occupy his original situation. These exceptions are dismissed, but it is clear that the decree as to Frank’s interest must be remodeled. The rights of his issue must be regarded. And now report recommitted to the auditor to be reformed in conformity with this opinion.”</p>

If the testator had intended to provide for the issue of Frank, he would have used the words “ child or children,” as in other parts of the will, or he would have said that Frank, upon his father’s death, should only receive the interest or income. He seems to have contemplated but one contingency, and that was that Jacob and Frank might both be dead, leaving no issue at the death of the testator, in which event he did not desire any part of the bequest to descend to the maternal relations of Frank. His failure to provide trustees, his silence as to when it should vest in the issue of Frank, all tend to show that the view advanced here is correct.</p>

Without it the legacy would vest as contended for, and the proviso would be without meaning. But it is there, and we must presume it is there for a purpose. The purpose is obvious when we look at the whole will. Frank was the only child of Jacob. Should he die without leaving children, his mother, or the maternal relations, might take, and such a result would not comport with his idea of keeping his estate in the line of his own family. In cases of this kind, where there is a bequest of a life estate or interest followed by the words “ dying without issue,” and the appointment of a trustee to effectuate this intention, a life interest has been thought to follow inevitably. Such is the conclusion mentioned by the late Chief Justice Thompson in Mengel’s Appeal, 11 P. F. Smith 250.

He directed that the shares of John, Charles and Jacob, shall remain in the hands of his executors in trust; that they pay to them the income and interest during their lives, and at the death of either to pay the share of such deceased unto his children should he leave any surviving, but if no child survives then to pay said share to his surviving brothers and sister, and to the issue of any that may be dead, such issue to take the parent’s share; “and provided further that should the said Frank Fitzwater, son of my nephew, Jacob Fitzwater, die without issue, then I order and direct that the money coming to him out of my estate at the death of his father, as hereinbefore provided, shall go to his uncles and aunt on his father’s side, or if any of them be dead then to their issue, such issue taking their parent’s share.”</p>

Frank claims that his father’s share is now absolutely vested in him, and, had not the auditor and learned judge of the Orphans’ Court held otherwise, we should unhesitat<a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>ingly conclude that his demand is well founded. The five bequests first are made without condition. Then follows the trust provision for three of the legatees with direction that at the death of each his share shall be paid to his children if any survive. It is by virtue of this part of the will that the children of John, or Charles, or Jacob, become entitled to the principal sum; and it is this which entitles Frank to any portion of the testator’s estate. He takes precisely the same interest as is given to the children of John and Charles; and had Jacob left other children they all would have shared equally. If Frank were not the sole surviving child, the proviso would apply to the fraction he would then receive just as it now does to the whole. It declares that should Frank die without issue, the money coming to him, “ as hereinbefore provided,” that is as the child of Jacob, shall go to his uncles and aunt on his father’s side. Should he die leaving issue there is no bequest over to any one, not even to his issue or children. The executors are ordered to pay the money at Jacob’s death to his child — they are not authorized to hold it longer in trust. Jacob had right to the income of the money for life, at his death Frank takes the money itself. That is the difference, and, whatever the proviso really means, it is clear that it does not cast about the son the same trust as was thrown around the father.</p>

Strictly, this is within the rule given in Williams on Ex’rs 1261: “ If there is a bequest to one for life, and after his decease to A., and in case of A.’s death to B., the contingency is held referable to the lifetime of the first legatee ; and the bequest over takes effect in case A. dies during the continuance of the life estate; he takes absolutely, if he survives the tenant for life.

A condition is appended to the bequest to one of these children that if he die without issue it shall go over. This omits the trust for those who were to take the income-for life, omits to direct payment of the principal to his children,, and, even if here issue means children, it does not direct payment to his issue. If inference is warranted it is that the principal is given to Frank and his issue.
