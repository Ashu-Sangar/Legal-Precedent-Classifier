In a petition under the Act of June ilth 1879, to procure the satisfaction of a mortgage, the terre-tenant alleged that when the property was conveyed by the mortgagor to him, he had paid the mortgage debt to the mortgagee. In his answer, the mortgagee denied the payment, and the assignee of the mortgage alleged that she was the assignee for value without notice. The court directed an issue to try the question of payment, and the petitioner, who was plaintiff in the issue, testified that the mortgagee had undertaken to procure a conveyance of the property to him clear of encumbrances for a certain consideration; that plaintiff had accepted the conveyance on these terms, and the consideration was paid, but the mortgages were not satisfied. It was admitted that the mortgages were subsequently assigned for value to one of the respondents, the defendants in the issue. The court below directed a verdict for the defendants on the ground that there was no evidence of payment by the mortgagor to the mortgagee: Held, that this was error ; that the testimony of the plaintiff should have been submitted to the jury, as in the absence of any evidence on the part of the defendants, the plaintiff was entitled to the full benefit of his testimony, and any inferences of fact.which the jury might be justified in drawing therefrom, and that they might have found such a payment.</p>

Both mortgages were duly recorded. On the 29th of September Lewis Benner by deed conveyed the house and lot to Henry Sellers, the plaintiff. The consideration mentioned in the deed was $3000. The deed was recorded on October 8th 1877. The evidence was that the sale and conveyance by Lewis Benner to Henry Sellers was in consequence of an arrangement entered into between James F. Benner the mortgagee and Henry Sellers by which the latter agreed to transfer and deliver, and did transfer and deliver the stock of a livery stable to James F. Benner at a valuation of $3500, the consideration of which was that Henry Sellers should have a conveyance of the house and lot of Lewis Benner, and a note of James F. Benner for $500; that James F. Benner was to give the mortgages on the house and lot to Henry Sellers; that the mortgages should be cancelled, and that the house and lot should be free of all encumbrances. The note was given but the bonds and mortgages were never transferred, nor satisfied on the recsrd. There was no evidence that Lewis Benner, the mortgagor, had any knowledge of this arrangement between Henry Sellers and James F. Benner. It was also admitted that the bonds and mortgages in question were, on the 26th of June 1879, in writing and for a valuable consideration assigned by James F. Benner, the mortgagee, to Susan Bodder, wife of Charles Bodder, one of the defendants, and that the assignment was recorded on the 2d of July 1879.

Benner to Susan Bodder, the deed of Lewis Benner to Henry Sellers of the mortgaged premises was on record, by which Susan Bodder had constructive notice of the sale and conveyance by Lewis Benner, the mortgagor, to Henry Sellers, that this circumstance imposed upon Susan Bodder the duty of making inquiry of Henry Sellers, the vendee, as to any subsisting equity between him and James F. Benner in respect to said mortgages, and that her failure to make such inquiry entitles the plaintiff to a verdict. In other words it is' contended that in consequence of such constructive notice, the equity of Henry Sellers, the plaintiff, is superior to that of Susan Bodder a purchaser of the bonds and mortgages for value <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>without actual notice or knowledge of the arrangement between James E.

There is no doubt that Susan Bodder is bound by all the equities subsisting between Lewis Benner, the mortgagor, and James E.- Benner, the mortgagee, at the time of the assignment of the bonds and mortgages to her. But as there is no evidence of a prior payment by Lewis Benner to James F. Benner, the rule requiring her to make inquiry of the former does not apply to the vendee of the mortgagor of his equity of redemption. Holding these views we are of the opinion that under the evidence the defendants are entitled to a verdict.”</p>

    <p id="Au8" data-blocks='[["BL_212.6",212,[304,1103,1168,1289]]]'>The court below directed a verdict in favor of the defendants upon the authority of Mott <em>v. </em>Clark, 9 Barr 399, and kindred cases, which rule that the assignee of a mortgage takes it subject to the equities of the mortgagor alone, and not to the secret equities of third parties. This principle we do not question; we only deny its applicability. The equity which Mr. Seilers, the plaintiff below, set up on the trial, was the equity of the mortgagor growing out of the fact, as we contended, that he had paid the mortgages. All that Mr. Sellers claimed was the right, by devolution, to set up the mortgagor’s equity in defence of his own title. At the very outset of the trial, therefore, the question as to who had paid the mortgages. became one of the first importance; it was, moreover, a question of fact for the jury. It is alleged that plaintiff, by allowing the bonds and mortgages to remain in the hands of the mortgagee long after they had been paid, neglected a precaution requisite to protect those who came after him from imposition; that Mrs. Bodder was deceived thereby, and that plaintiff should bear the loss because his was the default. We contend that it was not necessarily negligence for him not to obtain possession of the mortgages : Horstman <em>v. </em>Gerker, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%20288" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Wright 288">13 Wright 288</a>.

H. 494</a>. Did Mrs. Bodder exercise due diligence to ascertain the truth before she took the assignments of these mortgages ? It is true, the mortgagor was dead at the time of the assignments, but this did not preclude inquiry of and notice to his legal representatives. Moreover, it does not appear that she knew of the death of the mortgagor, nor does it appear that she made any inquiry whatever as to whether there was any defence to the mortgages or note.</p>

He absolutely took no precautions to prevent any innocent person from buying the mortgages, according to their tenor, as they stood on the record and the mortgage index. His attitude, when he closed his case, was that of one who has by his supine negligence caused others to buy as a good security, and then defends himself by proving a secret arrangement had between himself and the seller that the security was in fact bad! He was at once confronted with the ordinary rule that. the assignee of a mortgage is not affected by the secret equities of third <em>parties </em>— i. <em>e. </em>parties who are neither mortgagor or mortgagee, obligor or obligee — and again with the rule that, where the loss must be borne by one of two innocent parties, he by whose fault the loss occurs must suffer it.

It cannot be doubted that they could have justly found that on or about September 29th 1877, the plaintiff sold and transferred to James F. Benner his livery stock consisting of stock on hand, horses, carriages, &amp;c., valued at $3500, in consideration of which he was to receive an endorsed note for $500, and a conveyance of the premises described in the mortgages at a valuation of $3000, clear of encumbrances. This, of course, involved the satisfaction of the mortgages held by Benner against his father, and • the plaintiff testified positively that they were to be satisfied on the record. At first it was proposed to procure a conveyance from the father to the son, and then from the latter to the plaintiff, but upon the suggestion of the scrivener that it would avoid unnecessary expense, the conveyance was made directly from the father to the plaintiff. The deed shows the date of the transaction, expresses the consideration named, and contains a special warranty against the grantor, his heirs and all persons lawfully claiming under him. This covenant as between the vendor and vendee would be available to the latter in case of eviction under the mortgages. The words, grant, bargain and sell also imported a covenant against encumbrances : Cathcart <em>v. </em>Bowman, 5 Barr 317; Shaffer <em>v. </em>Greer, 6 Norris 370. So that it was to the interest of Lewis Benner that the mortgages should be satisfied in the transaction, otherwise he might be liable on his warranty as well as implied covenant. There is no evidence that the conveyance was under and subject to the mortgages; on the contrary, the testimony is all the other way, and the jury would have been fully justified in finding as a fact that the conveyance was intended to operate and did operate as a payment to the extent of $3000 on account of the livery stock, and at the same time as a payment in full of the mortgage debt, or what amounts to the same thing, that the plaintiff, by transfer of the livery stock to the mortgagee, discharged the mortgage debt, and to that extent was reimbursed by the conveyance from the mortgagor. Viewing it in either light, it was a payment and extinguishment of the mortgage debt, and the plaintiff had a complete defence against the mortgages in the hands of the mortgagee. Why has he not an equally good defence against the assignee who subsequently accepted the assignment without making any inquiry ? The plaintiff who derived title from the obligor had an equal right with the latter to interpose the defence of payment, unless he did or omitted to do something that might be set up as an estoppel as to him. It is said that he permitted the bonds and mortgages to remain in the hands of the mortgagee, and thus enabled him to impose on Mrs. Bodder. This is all that can be truthfully urged against an otherwise valid and meritorious defence; and there might be some force in it if she had inquired of the obligor or his personal representatives and endeavored to ascertain whether the debts were unpaid, or there <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>was any defence to the mortgages. That this was a duty which the law imposed on her cannot be doubted: Eldred <em>v. </em>Hazlett, 9 Casey 307; Ashton’s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 153. It is not a sufficient answer to say that the mortgagor, having parted with his title, had no equities which he or his personal representatives were interested in asserting. We have already seen that recourse might be had against him or his estate on the warranty, and, moreover, the land might not be worth the mortgage debts, and in that event there would be a personal liability on the bonds for the deficiency. These equities were of sufficient importance to-render the usual inquiry necessary, and if it had been made before the assignments were accepted, it would doubtless have led to a discovery of the fact that the mortgages were paid and should have been satisfied at least it is fair to presume that such would have been the case.</p>

Benner, the rule requiring her to make inquiry of the former does not apply to the vendee of the mortgagor of his equity of redemption.” In this we think there was error. There was testimony from which the jury might have fairly found a payment. No other consideration than the payment of the mortgage debts was shown for the conveyance to the plaintiff. The testimony tended to prove that the mortgagee procured the conveyance, and that to the extent of the mortgage debts at least he received the consideration in the form of a credit on his purchase of the livery stock. Nor did the testimony justify the inference that nothing more than the mortgagor’s equity of redemption was conveyed or intended to be conveyed; on the contrary, in connection with the deed, it tended to prove that the conveyance was intended to be clear of encumbrances, and that the mortgages were to have been satisfied. It was not a secret equity of a third party that was attempted to be set up. It was the equity of the mortgagor against the mortgagee, based on the allegation of payment, that the terfetenant was seeking to enforce. If he had accepted a conveyance under and subject to the mortgages, or had assumed their payment, a very different case would have been presented. The case of Jeffers <em>v. </em>Gill, 10 Norris 290, on which defendants in error rely, is essentially different from the present case. There the terre-tenant had assumed the payment of the mortgage, had actually paid part of it, and gave his negotiable note for the residue, and renewed the same several times under a collateral agreement with Gill that the bond and mortgage were to be held as security for the note and its renewals. The mortgage was also accompanied with a certificate of no defence. In view of these and other circumstances it was <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>truly said in that case that the terre-tenant had been “ grossly negligent. He gave his note for the balance due on the mortgage when it was yet in the liands of McCullough, and when it came into Gill’s possession he took no steps to have the arrangement endorsed either on the papers or upon the record. The mortgage bond and certificate of no defence were left in Gill’s possession as security for the note ; in other words they were to be of full force until the note was paid.”</p>
    <p id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[201,769,1167,476]]]'>In the present case, if the position which the plaintiff’s testimony tended to sustain be correct, the mortgages were actually paid at the time the property was conveyed, and they should have been satisfied on the record and delivered to the mortgagor. The mortgagee in fraud of the rights of the mortgagor, as well as his vendee, afterwards assigned these paid securities to one of the defendants who took them without resorting to sources .of information from which, in all probability, she would have learned the fact of payment. Where inquiry becomes a duty the party who neglects to perform it should be visited with at least constructive knowledge of the facts which probably would have been revealed.</p>
