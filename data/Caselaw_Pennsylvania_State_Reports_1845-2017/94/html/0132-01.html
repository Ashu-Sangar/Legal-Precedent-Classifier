As civilization developed, more correct moral views, and a broader spirit of public policy prevailed. It was seen that gambling in any form was most demoralizing to the gambler; and very early statutory action was taken by the British Parliament. The progress of legislation on the subject will be found fully traced in Jacobs’s Law Dictionary, tit. <em>Grambling.</em>

A brief history of this legislation may not be uninteresting. By the Act of February 17th 1762, 1 Sm. Laws 246, it was enacted that unlawful games, called lotteries, have been set up, and it declares them to be common and public nuisances, and against the common good and welfare of the province. The preamble embodies the spirit to which I have referred. It is in these words: ‘ Whereas, many mischievous and unlawful games, called lotteries, have been set up in this province, which tend to the manifest corruption of youth, and the ruin and impoverishment <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>of poor families; and, whereas, such pernicious practices may not only give opportunities to evil disposed persons to cheat and defraud the honest inhabitants of this province, but prove introductive of vice, idleness and immorality, injurious to trade, commerce and industry, and against the common good, welfare and peace of this province; for remedy whereof be it,’ &amp;c. This most excellent preamble not only proves the wisdom of our Quaker ancestry, their morality, and vindicates their title to be called Friends, but is also the best summary of the evils arising from all gambling. This legislation was followed by the Act of the 20th of January 1792, and extends the Act of 1762 to vending tickets of lotteries carried on and maintained in other states: sect. 3, Sm. Laws 60. This also has a preamble embodying the same spirit. * * *</p>

Laws 180, forbids all betting on cock fights as well as cock fights themselves, all dicing or card playing for money on a public highway, as well as the playing billiards, bowls, shuffleboards, or any game of hazard for any valuable thing; and also forbids and prohibits horse racing for anything of value. Sect. 6 forbids all keepers of licensed houses to permit any games of address, hazard, cock fighting, bullet playing and horse racing, or to promote or encourage them. Sect. 8 declares that no person shall be compelled to pay any money or deliver any valuable article staked as a wager upon the result of the games already mentioned, and avoids all evidences of indebtedness given to secure such indebtedness. Sect. 9 provides that the loser, if he pays, may recover the forfeit.’</p>

By the Act of 10th of April 1849, billiards were authorized by obtaining license, but no gambling was permitted, and the same privilege was extended to bowling saloons and ten-pin alleys, Pamph.

It seems proper, with a view to the facts in the case stated, to particularly trace the legislation in regard to horse racing.

It is very apparent, under the statutes cited as to horse racing, that the trials of speed provided for and to enter which the check of the plaintiff was given, are nothing but horse racing. They are nuisances under the first section of the Act of 1820, already cited. All wagers and bets depending upon such trials of speed ‘so-called,’ horse racing in reality, and all executory contracts in relation thereto, are void, under section 3 of that act; and the horses engaged' in such races are forfeited. A purse to be trotted for is gambling under the laws of Pennsylvania. The winner cannot recover the premium, purse stakes or prize, unless the company chooses to pay him. The horse of each contestant is forfeited, and the whole arrangement is a palpable evasion of the law. But there can be no evasion of the laws against gambling, as it has been well ruled in Wagonseller <em>v. </em>Smith, <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a><a href="/watts/7/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 343" data-case-ids="1846759" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0343-01">7 Watts 343</a>. The court in that case in a per curiam opinion well say, ‘ The act was intended to avoid all bets, paid or unpaid, and to suppress anything connected with the practice. It is the duty of the courts, therefore, to give it full effect, and not to force an actual wager into the similitude of something else.’ To the same effect, and broadly sustaining this position, are the following cases cited by the defendant; 7 Johns. N. Y. Rep. 434 ; <a href="/johns/10/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Johns. 406" data-case-ids="2135935" data-case-paths="/johns/10/0412-01">10 Johns. 406</a> ; Bine’s Appeal, 5 P. F.

He laid no money by giving his check to the result of any race. He neither laid, betted nor made any wager on- the racing, running, pacing or trotting of horses, mares or geldings, as provided in the 3d section. All that he did, when he paid his entrance money of ten per cent, by an executory contract, was to violate the 5 th section of that act, which provides that ‘ If any person shall contribute to or collect, or shall ask or desire any other person to contribute to or collect any money, goods or chattels to make up a purse, plate, or other thing to be run, paced or trotted for as aforesaid, at any place within this Commonwealth, such persons so offending shall pay and forfeit the sum of $30 for each offence.’" Now all that the defendant did was to contribute. Could he, under existing legislation, recover the amount paid in by him ? Clearly not, in the absence of statutory provision, for he was in <em>pari delicto </em>with the plaintiff. Horse racing was lawful at common law; a wager upon it was, therefore, by the same authority lawful; and its recovery, or rather the recovery of the sum wagered could have been enforced by action. Where statutes derogate from the common law they must be strictly pursued; and when penal, as in the case of a forfeiture, must be strictly construed. For his act a penalty is imposed. Suppose defendant had paid the money ? He would be liable to the penalty, and could not recover the amount. The society and himself being in <em>pari delicto </em>and <em>arcades </em>ambo, the penalty could have been exacted from him for contributing ; from the society for soliciting the contribution. The contribution is a fact that inflicts the penalty.</p>

How then is the sum a wager ? Is it laid, betted, or made on a wager to be determined by a horse race ? There is ’nothing in the statutes of Pennsylvania which forbids a recovery here. But there is a fact in the case stated which, though it does not distinctly appear in the case stated, was admitted upon the argument. It is <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>embodied in rule 3, p. 22 of the by-laws of the ‘ National Association for the promotion of the interests of the American trotting turf,’ handed to the court and considered a part of the case stated. It is as follows: ‘ Buie 3, Entrance Fee. The entrance fee shall be 10 per cent, of the purse, unless otherwise specified; and any person failing to pay his entrance dues may, together with his horse or horses, be suspended until they are paid in full, which shall be.with an addition cf 10 per cent, penalty, and interest at 7 per cent, per annum until paid; the penalty to go to the National Association.’</p>

They have determined how the delinquent shall be punished, viz., by suspension, by a ten per centum increase, and by seven per cent, interest. If their penalty be void, their contract is void. If their penalty be in force, the remedy is prescribed. Having designated their remedy, they are estopped from proceeding by law. This is their contract. It is either good or bad. If good, their contract- remedy is their only remedy. If bad, there is no remedy. The logic of this reasoning is irresistible, and I am unable to see any escape from it.</p>

It provides that, ‘If any person or persons within this state shall print or cause to be printed, set up, or cause to be set up, any advertisement mentioning the time and place for the running, pacing, or trotting of any horses, mares or geldings, or shall knowingly suffer any advertisement as aforesaid to be set up, in or upon his, her or their dwelling house or outhouses, or shall knowingly suffer the same to remain up as aforesaid, any person so offending shall forfeit and pay the sum of $20.’ This section, and the first of the same act, are especially worthy the attention of the managers of these societies.
