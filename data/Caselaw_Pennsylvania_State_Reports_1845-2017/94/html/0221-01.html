Why are the taxes not uniform upon the same class of subjects within the same territorial limits ? Because one property is owned by a national bank, while the other is owned by an individual.

But, even if the restrictions in the new Constitution applied to the act, yet similar legislation has been sustained in states where, in their Constitutions, like provisions as to uniformity of taxation and exemption exist.
