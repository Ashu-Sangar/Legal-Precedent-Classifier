At the next term of court he procured an order of the court to sell the real estate of the assignee, consisting, of a valuable farm. It was sold on December 23d, the day it was advertised to be sold, without any adjournment, to Dr. Hale, whose lien came second after appellants’ judgments. The sale was confirmed January 8th 1877. The purchase-money was $17,011.74, one-third cash and balance in two equal annual payments with interest. On December - 13th 1878, the assignee filed his account to January Term 1879, charging himself with $17,01T.74, principal of sale, and $1441.74, interest on same, and claiming credit for $807.57 interest on payments made to various creditors, and also a credit for $850, for his commission on selling the farm. Exceptions were filed by Dr. Hale and appellants to the payments to the different judgment-creditors, and to the assignee’s compensation. The court at first reduced the compensation of the assignee to $500, and referred the amount in assignee’s hands to Joseph W. Parker, Esq., for distribution. The auditor reported to April 7th 1879, giving the assignee $500 for his services, and making distribution on the basis that interest on claims ceased on the day of sale, and the amount of sale, after deducting costs, was distributed as far as it would go to the judgment-creditors in the order of priority, and the interest on the deferred payments, together with the interest on the different payments made to the different creditors, up to the filing of the account of the assignee, was distributed 'pro rata to the judgments reached. Exceptions were filed to this mode of distribution, and to the reduction of assignee’s compensation. The court referred the matter back to the auditor, who reported, allowing the assignee $850 for his compensation, and making distribution on the principle of allowing interest on the different judgments up to the confirmation of the assignee’s account; also submitting another schedule of distribution, allowing interest on the different judgments up to confirmation of sale, and appropriating the interest on the deferred payments pro rata to the judgments reached. The appellants filed exceptions to this report: 1st. That interest should have ceased on the day of sale, and the accrued interest should have been dis<a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>tributed pro rata to all the claims reached. 2d.

The charge of $850 is excessive, it being five per cent, on the sale. On sales of real estate two and one-half per cent, is the usual compensation : Carrier’s Appeal, 29 P. F.

In two of these cases, it is expressly ruled that interest on the liens divested should be computed to the day of confirmation only, and not to the date of payment of the purchase-money. "When the liens, due and payable presently, are sufficient in amount to exhaust the purchase-money, the sale should be for cash, unless all parties interested unite in requesting a time sale. In the case before us, the state of the liens was not such as to justify a sale on time; but no objection was interposed by any of the creditors whose claims were due, and the sale was made, as directed by the court, for one-third cash and the residue in two equal payments in one and two years with interest.. The sale having been thus made and confirmed, the hand-money, less expenses, &amp;c., should have been applied to payment of the oldest liens, in their order, as far as it would reach. The second payment should have been distributed to the liens next in order, and in addition thereto, the interest on that instalment should have been ' divided pro rata among the same creditors in proportion to the amount each was entitled to receive out of the principal; and, in like manner, the last instalment should have been distributed to the lien creditors next in order, and the two years’ interest thereon divided among them in proportion to their respective shares of the principal. In this way the second and third classes of creditors would have received the interest which accrued on the respective instalments as a compensation or equivalent for the delay in payment of their respective claims. But, instead of thus paying some of the creditors in full, according to <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>the priority of their respective liens as they existed at the date of the confirmation of sale, the assignee made payments to the older creditors on account, leaving comparatively small balances due some of them.</p>
    <p id="b528-6" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[285,595,1170,806]]]'>In the schedule of distribution reported by the auditor and adopted by the court, interest appears to have been computed on the respective liens to January 8th 1879, two years after the sale was confirmed. In this there was error, and the case must be remitted for re-distribution of the fund in accordance, as nearly as may be, with the principles above indicated, taking into consideration, however, the respective dates and amounts of the payments made on account. The interest collected by the assignee justly and equitably belongs to the creditors who are entitled to the principal from which it accrued, and it should be distributed among them in proportion to the amount of their respective distributive shares and the length of time the payment of these shares is respectively postponed on account of the deferred instalments of purchase-money. Those who received nearly the full amount of their claims out of the hand payment, will be entitled to a relatively small proportion of the accrued interest, and those who received nothing until the last instalment matured, will be entitled to more relatively than those who received a portion of the second instalment.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[283,1413,1168,419]]]'>The manner in which the assignee stated his account is not to be commended. The items of expense, &amp;c., pertaining to the execution of the trust, and payments to creditors on account of their distributative shares, are blended together. This should never be done, The account should exhibit, on the one side, the several sums realized from the trust estate, and on the other, the expenses incurred in executing the trust, so that the full net balance for distribution may appear. To this may be appended a schedule giving the dates and amounts of payments to creditors on account of distribution. '</p>
    <p id="b528-8" data-blocks='[["BL_528.6",528,[282,1843,1167,300]]]'>If the items of interest amounting to $808.63 for which the assignee has taken credit in his account were-not paid to the respective creditors, he is not entitled to credit for the same. In the schedule reported by the auditor, the amount distributed among the creditors is about $7284, from which it appears that the assignee has been allowed credit for the items of interest referred to. This is not correct, unless the interest was actually paid by him.</p>
