    <p class="headnotes" id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[288,620,1170,479]]]'>1. The city of Scranton is an incorporated city. C., while driving through its streets, struck a water plug, projecting from the ground in the middle of the street, and he was thrown from his wagon and injured. The plug was placed in the street by a water company that was incorporated prior to the incorporation of the city. As originally placed, it only projected about two inches from the ground, but a few months previous to the accident the street had been lowered, and the plug was thus left to project about six inches from the ground. The street commissioners had frequently seen the plug, and knew of its existence at the time of the accident. C. brought an action for damages against the city, and the defendant asked the court to chai'ge that if the obstruction was placed in the street by the water company, under authority from the state, the city was not liable: <em>Held, </em>affirming the court below, that it mattered not who placed the obstruction in the street, provided the city had notice of its existence and failed to remove it.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[291,1105,1168,207]]]'>2. The water company had the right to put in the plug but it had no authority to place and maintain an obstruction on the street. Should they construct a dangerous public nuisance on the highway, the duty of the city, after notice, is plain. And where, as here, the plug was properly placed, and afterwards the city lowered the grade of the street, causing the obstruction, it was an .inexcusable neglect.</p>

The plug was about the middle of the street, and had been placed there by the Scranton Gas and Water Company before the incorporation of the city. It had originally only projected about two inches from the ground, but some few months before this occurrence the city had lowered the level of the street, and it was thus made to project several inches more. The plaintiff gave in evidence the Act of Assembly incorporating the city of Scranton in 1867, wherein it was authorized to open streets, and the duty imposed upon it of regulating them.</p>

No' question was made but that the Scranton Gas and Water Company is a corporation, with right to enter upon the highways to occupy, ditch, lay and repair pipes when necessary; and the court charged, in answer to defendant’s sixth point, that the company had the right to construct such works as the law-making power had authorized, but that the company could not put a structural obstruction in the public highway, and, if they.did, and the attention of the city was called to it, followed by neglect to remove it, the city would be liable for an injury caused by the obstruction, in absence of concurrent negligence by the person injured. In answer to the fourth point, the jury were instructed that “ it matters not who put the obstruction there, provided you find from the evidence the city had notice that the obstruction was there and permitted it to remain.” There was no evidence to warrant the jury in finding the facts on which defendant’s third point was based. In view of the evidence, the second, third and fourth assignments cannot be sustained, but it would be otherwise if the charter of the company vested them with power to erect and maintain the obstruction.</p>

    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[267,503,1181,1114]]]'>The first alleged error, and the one mainly relied on, is the rejection of the charter of the Scranton Gas and Water Company, offered for the purpose of showing their right to put the plug in at the point of the accident; that the city has no control over it, and that they are not the servants or agents of, nor responsible to, the city. The right of the company to put the plug in at that place, or any other which they deemed necessary, was not denied; but the real question is, have the company authority to place and maintain an obstruction on the street ? If so, the offer was admissible, and it was a fatal error to deny it. The charter might well have been received, and, had it been, the court would have declared its meaning. But if, on inspection, the court saw it contained nothing to the purpose of the offer, no harm was done by its rejection. The plaintiff in error has failed to point to any thing in the charter that authorizes the company to maintain a dangerous obstruction on any highway in the city. They may occupy the streets, for the necessary time, to ditch, lay and repair pipes and place plugs, but no testimony, or offer of testimony, shows that they may leave the top of a plug so far above the grade as to be dangerous to persons travelling the streets. Should they construct a dangerous public nuisance on the highway, the duty of the city, after notice thereof, is plain. If the plug was properly placed, and afterwards the city lowered the grade, thereby causing the obstruction, it was inexcusable neglect. We are of opinion that the charter contained nothing to relieve the city from liability for its sufferance of the nuisance.</p>
