He also gave to Mr. Leonard, on the 8th of April, his own judgment-note for $75, payable in two days, $25 of which was to be applied towards the payment of the Stapleton note, and the balance was intended to cover the costs of the execution above mentioned.</p>

On the 10th of April, Rees paid to Mr. Leonard the $25 balance on the Stapleton <em>note </em>and the costs of execution, and took up the $75 note which he had given two days before; that on the 8th of April Mr. Leonard executed a blank assignment of the Stapleton note and judgment, which he delivered over to Rees, along with the note itself, but whether this assignment passed into the hands of Lewis Davis, along with the note, does not satisfactorily appear. That during the first half of the month of June 1871, Rees Davis got the Stapleton note from his father, upon the pretext that it was necessary he should have it to lay before <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>the auditor, who had been, or was about to be, appointed to report distribution in the assigned estate of Stapleton.

That on the 16th of June 1871, Rees being unprepared to pay off the note which he had given on the 8th of April, at two months, gave in lieu thereof, his note for .$500, payable on the 1st day of April 1872, and at the same time he gave Mr. Leonard another note for $1500, also payable on the 1st of April 1872, and received from Mr. Leonard, in consideration thereof, a check for $1120, the difference of $380 being discount on the two notes, at the rate of two per cent, a month, retained for the use of the money. At the same time, and as a part of thé same transaction, papers were made and delivered, and Mr. Davis then passed over to Mr. Leonard the Stapleton note, together with the blank assignment which the latter had executed on the 8 th of April previously; but whether the words, <em>‘ </em>collateral for Stapleton and Whiteside bonds,’ were put on the notes at that time, or not until afterwards, the auditor is unable to determine, as the two witnesses who alone have knowledge on the subject stand diametrically opposed to each other.</p>

We have already seen that payment was what Mr. Leonard demanded and sought to enforce ; and we have also observed that the money was forwarded by Mr. Davis, accompanied by a stipulation that it was to be used in making payment of the obligation. But it is said this purpose which both parties had in view was not carried into effect, and that a transaction, essentially different in its consequences was substituted in its place. Why should this intention of the parties be so changed ? And would it not be a fraud upon' Lewis Davis to so act ? And could anyone privy to the transaction reap any advantage from it subsequently ?</p>

And it is also clear he believed at that time he had enough trust funds in his hands to pay 'off the obligation in full; and he actually had enough, and more than enough, before taking out his commissions as assignee. There was no motive or inducement to purchase which did not exist also to pay, or was superior in the former to the latter case. The moneys employed to take up the obligation were the trust funds belonging to Stapleton’s estate, and we are persuaded Mr. Leonard had knowledge of that fact' at the time the transaction was consummated ; at least the probabilities are in consonance with this opinion. * * * There was no consideration whatever for this contract for sale, and the delivery of the note in contract for sale, and the delivery of the <em>note in </em>question, and the blank assignment of the judgment, except what, if any, is to be found in the $1120 which Mr. Davis received from Mr. Leonard on the $1500 note. The design and real purpose was that these judgments should be pledged as collateral for the $1500 note; and the words on the note, “ collateral for the Stapleton and Whiteside bonds,” are a perversion of the truth, the fact being precisely the reverse of the statement therein contained. We are conscious that this finding in the face of the writing itself, may seem strange, but an acquaintance with all the facts makes the conclusion inevitable.</p>

Indeed, it might well be doubted, <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>as before intimated, whether the assignee could huy up the obligations of the assignor, and thus put himself in a more hostile attitude towards the estate or' its creditor, than he had previously occupied. He certainly could not do so with the trust funds, and it is very questionable whether he could do so with his own funds, unless some equity was to be enforced by reason of the proceedings. * * * Being a payment, the effect was an extinguishment of the debt — an absolute wiping it out of existence. And it was thenceforth incapable of being used for any purpose whatever. It follows, of course, that any attempt thereafter to sell or assign or pledge the security, would be invalid and fruitless. No title can be acquired to a dead security. But it may be contended that whilst payment with the trust funds would at law be an extinguishment of the debt, and the judgment could not afterwards be kept on foot without the consent of persons interested, yet in equity, the judgment would still exist, to enable the payor to indemnify himself in the marshalling of the assets or to obtain an order in his favor in the distribution, and that if he chose to assign or to allow an agent or attorney to assign to another, whatever sum he might be entitled to in distribution, there is no principle of law or equity will interfere to prevent it. * * * But Mr.- Leonard could not obtain title through this fraudulent proceeding; even if he were an innocent purchaser for value he would acquire no title. The fraudulent vendor having no title, he could not invest his vendee with any. * * * But we do not think Mr. Leonard is to be regarded in exactly the light of an innocent purchaser for value. There was enough in the case and in the manipulation of this particular security to have put him on inquiry. He was entirely acquainted with the transaction of 1871, and he knew or ought to have known that the bond had been taken up by Lewis Davis with trust funds. Whilst we do not imagine that he was cognisant of the fraud that was being perpetrated, or was lending a willing and knowing assistance thereto, we nevertheless think that he did not exercise that caution and make that inquiry which his knowledge of the circumstances and of the relation of the parties made it incumbent upon him to exercise. In other words, he was in default in accepting this transfer without first endeavoring to ascertain Bees Davis’s status in connection with the obligation. This is not to his discredit, but it is unfortunate for his claim.” * * * •</p>

He did as he pleased in every respect without being subject to question or inquiry. Being thus the agent of his father, it is necessary to consider what are the consequences of that relation. The rule which applies to principal and agent is thus stated by Mr. Bispham, in his treatise on Equity, sect. 368, p. 334, 2 ed., as deduced from the best authorities. “ Notice to an- agent is notice to the principal, and it is considered, as far as the principal is concerned, as constructive notice, because the principal and agent as to matters within the scope of the latter’s authority, are regarded in the eye of the law as one.”</p>

It is evident that the negligence imputed by the court to Mr. Leonard, not only does not appear, but that he was fully warranted in treating Rees Davis as the owner of the claim, and that if Lewis Davis was imposed upon by his son and agent, he had his own gross negligence and utterly misplaced confidence to thank for it.</p>

We have no means of satisfactorily solving the doubt except by what appears upon the face of the report itself. The testimony on which the auditor based his conclusions is not before us. It is a safe rule, and one that should be adhered to, that the facts found by an auditor should be accepted as true until the contrary is clea2’ly shown; and we are unable to say that this has been done in the present case. If the transaction was in fact a payment, as the auditor found, .the appellant has no reason to com plain. But, assuming the auditor was mistaken, and instead of being a payment, it was, as appellant contends, a purchase of the judgment, how would the case stand? If the appellant received the full amount of his judgment in cash and a note of $4.00, as the auditor finds, and surrendered the original judgment-note with an assignment of the judgment in blank, he of course ceased to have any interest in the claim. It belonged exclusively to his assignee, who was then in a position to accept payment from or make terms with the obligor or any one on whom the duty of discharging the obligation devolved. The mattet- stood in this condition for over two months, when the appellant negotiated for a .re-assignment of the note and judgment to himself. In taking the re-assignment he claimed that he had procured a certificate of no defence from the appellee, Lewis Davis, but the genuineness of that paper was disputed, and the auditor found that it -was not established. In approving this finding, the court says: “We agree with the auditor tliat an unbiassed view of all the testimony fails to satisfy the mind that Lewis Davis signed the paper intentionally or otherwise.” The certificate of no defence being thus properly out of the case, there was not a particle of testimony to show that any effort was made by appellant, or any one on his behalf, to ascertain from either the obligor or the trustee of his assigned estate whether there was any defence to the payment of the judgment. It cannot be doubted that it was his duty to make such inquiry: Eldred <em>v. </em>Hazlett, 9 Casey 307; Ashton’s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 153. As a general rule, inquiry of the obligor is sufficient; but where, as in this case, he has assigned all his property for the benefit of his creditors, and the assignee, by accepting the trust, has undertaken to pay them, as far at least as the assets in his hands will reach, inquiry should be made of him also. The reason of this is so obvious that a bare statement <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>of the proposition is sufficient. He has not only the right, but it is his duty, to discharge the obligations of his assignor, and, as a general rule, to make any defence that might be interposed -by the latter. The appellant was fully aware that the appellee was the person to whom he had to look for the payment of his judgment before he assigned it; and the fact that, in taking a re-assignment of it two months thereafter, he claimed to have procured from- him a certificate of no defence, which he sought to use for his own protection, shows conclusively that he understood both the duty and importance of making inquiry, and arming himself with evidence that would estop the trustee from setting up any defence to the payment of the judgment. Having failed to prove the genuineness of the paper, he was left without any evidence of inquiry or proof of facts that would estop the trustee from interposing any defence he might have. Where inquiry becomes a duty, the party who neglects to perform it should be visited with at least constructive notice of the facts that probably would have been brought to light if it had been duly made. Applying this rule to the appellant, what would have been the result if before taking a re-assignment of the judgment he had gone to the trustee, Lewis Davis, and inquired of him whether he had any set-off or dtefence to its payment ?• In view of the facts found by the auditor it is reasonable to conclude he would have been informed that, in the early part of April preceding he had furnished money to his son, Rees Davis, to take up the claim, and that the latter had done so ; that he had recently given the note to Rees-for the purpose of presenting the claim before the auditor, and obtaining a credit or dividend to which, as trustee, he was entitled, and that Rees had no authority whatever to otherwise dispose of the claim thus intrusted to him.' This would have terminated the negotiation with Rees Davis, and averted the unpleasant controversy that has ensued. As between Rees Davis and his father, it is very clear that the former never had any right to the judgment or its proceeds. He was furnished with money for the express purpose of taking up the claim, not for his own benefit but for his father, and it was of little consequence whether it was done in the form of a purchase or by actual payment. If the proper inquiry had been made by appellant he undoubtedly would have obtained information on which he could have acted with safety to himself and others. Having neglected to do so he is responsible for the consequences. But it is strenuously contended that, having b.ut a short time before sold and transferred the judgment to Rees Davis, and finding the papers in his possession, in the same condition they were when delivered, there was no necessity for further .inquiry. This position is clearly untenable. There was nothing in the relations between Rees Davis and his father, or anything else in the case to relieve the appellant from <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>the duty of making the usual inquiry; and the fact already adverted to, that he claimed to have procured a certificate of no defence shows that he not only recognised the duty, but fully appreciated its importance.</p>
