Improvement leases do not ordinarily contemplate the purchase of material for building and the employment of mechanics, but simply the labor of the tenant and his servants. The contracts'here under consideration are building contracts (as "well as a lease), with all the incidents of such contracts where no lease exists: Woodward <em>v. </em>Lieby, <em>supra; </em>Leiby <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2063" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Wright 63">4 Wright 63</a>; Reid <em>v. </em>Kennedy, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.N.C.%20452" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 W.N.C. 452">4 W.

But in Wainwright <em>v. </em>Barclay, <em>supra, </em>(the most recent case), this is repudiated, and the liability to lien put upon the fact that the building is erected by the tenant for the landlord with his assent and at his ultimate expense, being paid for out of the rent or from the use and profit of the premises.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b113-9" data-blocks='[["BL_113.7",113,[163,1802,1166,602]],["BL_114.1",114,[290,428,1163,86]]]'>“ In the case before us the tenants contracted to make the repairs and addition during the first year, in consideration of the low rent for that time. In other words, in consideration of receiving the use of the premises for that year rent free, for the rent required to be paid is but nominal — $5. The annual value of the premises is fixed by the parties at $600. $595 is therefore the sum which the landlord agreed to pay for the repairs and additions. The transaction was a contract for repairs and additions to be paid for at this rate. Calling the contractors tenants, paying them in the use and occupation or proceeds of the premises, will not avoid the ordinary incidents of a building contract. If it would then (as is suggested in some of the cases cited) might the owner have buildings erected or repaired and enlarged, and escape the provisions of the mechanics’ lien law by simply calling the contractor tenant, <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>putting him in possession and paying him for the proceeds of the property, instead of from the owner’s pocket. * * *</p>

It appears that the plaintiffs had then been employed and the work commenced. Mr. Hall inquired of Mr. Parker if he knew ‘ who they were working for ?’ Mr. Parker replied, ‘ Yes, for the tenants and Mr. Hall added, ‘ Yes, I will not pay for anything.’ Mr. Hall is not personally asked to pay for anything, and is not personally liable. If, by reason of depreciation, previous liens or other cause, the building should prove insufficient to pay, the plaintiffs cannot resort to him. The court cannot interpret Mr. Hall’s language, say how the plaintiffs should have understood it, and whether, therefore, it was sufficient notice to deprive them of their right to lien, if any notice could have this effect, as the point asked us to do. It may be proper to remark that the language attributed to Mr. Hall in the point differs from his language on our notes and quoted above. But we do not think any notice he could have given would be important. He required the tenants to make the repairs and additions to his property for his benefit at his ultimate cost.” * * *</p>
