This question has never been distinctly met and ruled in Pennsylvania; and in other states the rulings are conflicting. Haverstick <em>v. </em>Sipe, <em>supra, </em>is the case of a dominant tenant, and, while in dictum it is decisive, is, upon the question involved by this record, no more than a dictum. Though largely cited it does not definitely rule, as contended, or as quoted. One case has been ruled in Pennsylvania by Finletter, J., Kay <em>v. </em>Stallman, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.N.C.%20643" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 W.N.C. 643">2 W. N.

They conflict as to their conclusions; are to a great extent irreconcilable upon general principles, and are pressed upon the court by the able contending counsel, who have made this case a specialty ; and who, by their intellectual exertions, have awakened a vivid interest in the court. It cannot be denied that Story <em>v. </em>Odin, <a href="/mass/12/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="12 Mass. 157" data-case-ids="2052001" data-case-paths="/mass/12/0139-01">12 Mass. 157</a>, rules the point at issue, so far as the opinion of the court is concerned, squarely ; for it does declare that the owner of a servient tenement may not interfere with the light and air of the owner of the dominant tenement. This clearly is the force and scope of the opinion, though the special facts of the case would have sustained the judgment on the ground of necessity. If it stood alone I should be governed by it, notwithstanding the wise dictum of Haverstick <em>v. </em>Sipe, <em>supra, </em>and the modifying influences of Kieffer <em>v. </em>Imhoff, 2 Casey 445; 6 Casey 298 to 299, as well as of Washburn on Easements 589, 590, and authorities there cited. A careful examination of Maynard <em>v. </em>Escher, 5 Harris 226 (a case miscited through error in the syllabus), 6 Casey, <em>supra, </em>of <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20423" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="14 Wright 423">14 Wright 423</a>, and the authorities cited by Agnew, J., will demonstrate that the broad ruling of Odin <em>v. </em>Story, <em><a href="/mass/12/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="12 Mass. 157" data-case-ids="2052001" data-case-paths="/mass/12/0139-01">supra,</a> </em>has not been adopted in Pennsylvania. Still, as has been said, a respectful regard for the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, would induce me to follow its ruling were there no other adjudicated cases. But the same tribunal, at a much later period, in Keats <em>v. </em>Hugo, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20Mass.%20208" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="115 Mass. 208">115 Mass. 208</a>, adopts a different rule, and one which accords with my own views of this question, as affected by public policy and business interests. I understand this case to overrule Story <em>v. </em>Odin, or, at least, to explain it to such an extent that its rights as a precedent fall. Story <em>v. </em>Odin was ruled in 1815 by Jackson, J., and it will be noticed that it is based upon English authorities, and <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>that its reasoning is therefore weakened in Pennsylvania by what is said by our Supreme Court in Wheatley <em>v. </em>Baugh, <em>supra.</em>

This case rules that the easement of light and air is not implied from the grant of a house having windows overlooking land retained by the grantor. It declares that since Story <em>v. </em>Odin and the <em>obiter dicta </em>in <a href="/mass/12/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="12 Mass. 220" data-case-ids="2052053" data-case-paths="/mass/12/0194-01">12 Mass. 220</a>, 17 Id. 443, <a href="/f-cas/24/0841-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1 Sumn. 492" data-case-ids="6630043" data-case-paths="/f-cas/24/0841-01">1 Sumn. 492</a>, the cases have been more fully considered on principle, and that the tendency of judicial decisions in Massachusetts and most other states has been to deny the doctrine of acquiring a right to light and air by presumption or implication. Chief Justice Gray adds: ‘ In no judgment of this court, since Odin <em>v. </em>Story, has any right of light or air-been upheld except 'by express grant or agreement.’ In this most learned and exhaustive opinion, the learned judge first notes that Odin <em>v. </em>Story is based upon finglish authorities; that neither in the opinion of the court, nor in the argument of counsel is it suggested that a different rule may be required by the exigencies of a new country, with new wants, under a new and developing system of civilization and improvement; and that the facts of the case themselves did not require a decision upon the general principle. He then reviews' the authorities at great length. Among these is Collier <em>v. </em>Pierce, <a href="/mass/73/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="7 Gray 18" data-case-ids="1996175" data-case-paths="/mass/73/0018-01">7 Gray 18</a>, which has the authority of Chief Justice Shaw to uphold it. I will not pause to cite the other authorities quoted in the opinion. Many of them are used to show the tendency of the courts to hold, in this country, that easements of light, air, overhanging projections, are not implied in favor of the dominant as against the servient tenement. The principal case is strong, clear and most' emphatic, and its concluding reasoning is so sound that I cannot forbear quoting it <em>in extenso. </em>‘ By nature air and light do not flow in definite channels, but are universally diffused. The supposed necessity for their passage in a particular line or direction to any lot of land is created not by the relative situation of the lot to the surrounding lands, but by the manner in which that lot has been built upon. The actual enjoyment of the light and air by the owner of the house is upon his own land only. He makes no tangible or visible use of the adjoining lands, nor indeed any use of them which can be made the subject of an action by their owner, or which in any way interferes with the latter’s enjoyment of light and air upon his own lands, or with any use of those lands in their existing condition. In short, the owner of the adjoining land, has.submitted to nothing which actually encroached upon his rights, and cannot, therefore, be presumed to have assented to any such encroachment. The use and enjoyment of the adjoining lands are no more subordinate to those of the house where both are owned by one man, than where the owners <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>are different. The reasons upon which it has been held that no grant of a right to light and air can be implied from any length of continuous enjoyment, are equally strong against implying a grant of such a right from the mere conveyance of a house with windows overlooking the land of the grantor. To imply the right of sueh a grant in either case, without express words, would greatly embarrass the improvement of estates, and, by reason of the very indefinite character of the right asserted, promote litigation. The simplest rule, and that best suited to a country like ours, in which changes are continually taking place in the ownership and use of lands, is, that no right of this character shall be acquired without express grant of an interest in, or covenant relating to, the lands over which the right is claimed.’ * * * ‘ Considering, therefore, that by the preponderance of reason and authority no grant -of any right of light and air over adjoining lands is to be implied from the conveyance of a house, we have only to apply this rule to the facts.’ In 1876, Doyle et al. <em>v. </em>Lloyd et al., N. Y. Rep., per Earl, J., this doctrine, there styled the ‘ American doctrine,’ as to light and air, is distinctly recognised, the learned judge citing Keats <em>v. </em>Hugo, <em><a href="/citations/?q=115%20Mass.%20208" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="115 Mass. 208">supra;</a> </em>Parker <em>v. </em>Foote, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Wend.%20315" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="19 Wend. 315">19 Wend. 315</a>: 2 Sand.

I cannot see how this can affect the case. The purposes for which a former owner purchased pr-operty cannot affect the use and rights of his vendees or alienees, unless such purposes are covenanted for, are actually or constructively known to such alienees, and are in the nature of contracts or covenants which may be enforced between themselves or by others. The deed in fee bars the grantor, and a mere purpose on his part will not control his alieners. Mr. Widdecombe could have changed his purpose and built upon the lot while he was the owner of both; his vendee, unrestricted by covenant, may do the same. The bill cannot be sustained on this ground. The master has elaborated the other questions with sufficient clearness, and all the exceptions to his report are overruled.</p>

The motion for a preliminary injunctiou was refused after brief hearing; and though I then formed a clear idea of what the ‘ American doctrine’ ought to be, no time was given, nor argument made to and upon that hearing, which involved the exhaustive research displayed by counsel in the final argument.</p>

Public policy requires that in a new and developing country the spirit of improvements of betterments should not be chained and handicapped by the law. With the limitation of an implication arising from real and actual necessity, the time-honored and equitable maxim of <em>sic utere tuo non alienum Icedas, </em>is carefully observed. ■ If the principles of Story <em>v. </em>Odin were to prevail, one with a series of town lots would, after the sale of one, imply a grant as to two others immediately adjoining that would destroy them for building purposes, and a one-story house would be compelled to remain one story because its dominant tenement had two, All improvement would be stayed, values would bo destroyed, and alienations, except under special contracts, rendered dangerous for the future and ruinous in the past.</p>

The reason is that no lot could be filled up and graded, or be adapted to building purposes, if such rules prevailed in towns. If that conclusion be sound within the scope of the maxim, <em>sic utere </em>tuo, &amp;c., surely the same spirit of public'policy would protect lot-holders in boroughs, towns and villages in regard to implied rights of light and air, even though a different rule prevailed in agricultural lands. But I think this opinion shows that, except in Maryland and Nerv Jersey, a different rule does not prevail.”</p>
