The question therefore is, were the attachments of Riegel and Dundore liens upon the defendant’s interest in his deceased father’s real estate. It is objected that they are not, because the attachments do not specially describe or refer to land or interest in land, as the subject of the attachment. We contend that such a description or reference is not necessary in a case like this where the interest of the defendant in the estate of a deceased person is sought to be charged. If the subject of the attachment were the specific land of a living person, being the defendant in a judgment, the case would be different. In the Foreign Attachment Act 27th July 1842, sect. 1, 1 Purd. Dig. 717, pl. 5, this new subject of attachment is described as follows : <em>“ </em>All legacies given and lands devised to any persons or persons, by will or testament, and any interest which any person or persons may have in the real or personal estate of any decedent whether by will or otherwise,” &amp;c., &amp;c. Three things are, described, viz. : (1) Legacies (2) lands devised (both of these are in cases of wills), and (3) any interest in the real or personal estate of any decedent. As Jacob Harwi died intestate the subject-matter which we claim to have attached is “ any interest” of Jacob Harwi, Jr., “ in the estate, real or personal,” of'a person who died intestate. The foregoing act makes such an interest amenable to process of foreign attachment. A similar state of things is found in the legislation in relation to attachments in execution. The original act was passed in 1835 (1 Purd. Dig. 639, <em>et seq.), </em>but the act which made this new species of property right the subject of such attachment was not passed till April 1843 : 1 Purd. Dig. 640, pl. 37. With a few trifling verbal differences the language is the same as in the foreign attachment act, viz.: “ And any interest which any person or persons may have in real or personal estate of any decedent, by will or otherwise, which are subject to foreign attachment by the Act of 27th July 1842,” &amp;c.</p>
    <p id="b192-6" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[298,1861,1167,560]]]'>The subject-matter of the attachment is thus made practically the same in both classes of attachment. The interest which a person has or may have in a decedent’s estate is not any defined and specific property. It is not so many acres of land, or such and such articles of personal property. It may not amount to anything at all, because all the property of the decedent may be required for payment of his debts, or all of the personal property and a part of the real estate may be thus required, and in such a ease the interest in question would be nothing more than the share of the party in the money which is left after all the debts of the decedent and expenses of the administration are paid. It is entirely analogous to the interest which a member of a firm has in the partnership.</p>

The administrator of an intestate has no right of possession or custody of his lands. The possibility that the primary fund may be insufficient for payment of the decedent’s debts, does not prevent possession and control of the land by the heir until adjudication and conversion by proceedings in the proper court. One who acquires the title of the heir stands in his place and holds subject to liability for debts of the intestate, if there be not enough personalty to pay them.</p>

Upon the admitted facts the administrator was not in possession of the lands, and no service was made on the occupants. The personal estate of the decedent is more than sufficient for payment of his debts, but this fact matters little, if anything. On its face, the writ embraces nothing but the defendant’s interest, or his distributive share, in the personal assets in the administrator’s hands ; and the return of service shows no attachment of lands or interest therein. Clearly, the writ and service did not bind the defendant’s interest in the real, estate, and it is unnecessary now to decide how the writ for such purpose should be executed.
