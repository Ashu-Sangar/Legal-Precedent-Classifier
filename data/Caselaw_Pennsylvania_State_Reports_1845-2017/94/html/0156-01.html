As to the land he was a tenant, and the only one in possession. There was nothing in the relations of the parties which forbade him buying as he did. Under the circumstances this was the only change of possession of which the case admitted, which is all the rule of law requires. Here everything indicated ownership in Pearson. He held out to the world the sign that he was the farmer and owned everything on the premises. The owner of the fee was an invisible corporation, the only evidence of whose existence was the records of its creation and occasional trips of the members to their club house in Tinicum. It is not the case of a man, who is owner and possessor of chattels, parting with the title and retaining possession; hut it is a case where the possessor, with' all the <em>indicia </em>of ownership about him, completes his title by purchasing a latent interest of his landlord, which the world had no right to suppose ever existed.</p>

There may be no actual fraud in such transfer, and still it is fraudulent as against creditors. The leading case is that of Clow et al. <em>v. </em>Woods, 5 S. &amp; R. 275. The same doctrine has been uniformly carried through our state reports, till the decisions embrace every possible attempt of insolvent debtors to part with chattels, retaining the possession <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>without visible change of ownership. If in such cases the vendor of chattels retain possession, it is a fraud <em>per se </em>as to creditors. In this case there was no semblance of delivery to or an attempt to take the possession or exercise the rights of ownership on the part of the plaintiff. Nor is there in the cases of McKibbin <em>v. </em>Martin, and Sheldon <em>v. </em>Sharpless, cited by the learned counsel, the slightest variation from the settled principle laid down in Clow <em>v. </em>Woods.</p>

The court was asked to instruct the jury (see 1st assignment) that, “if the jury believe there was a bona fide sale of the sorrel horse, dearborn, pole and shafts, and the cart, and such a delivery of possession or other overt change of ownership as the nature of the property and the circumstances of the case admitted of, their verdict must be for the plaintiff for these articles.” The learned judge answered this point as follows: “ There must have been some visible change of possession. The purchaser being a servant of the vendor, could not acquire a lawful title as against a creditor without a change of possession.” The learned judge further instructed the jury (see 4th assignment): “ There is not sufficient evidence of a change of possession as to one horse, one cart, one dearborn, wheelbarrow, grindstone and two ploughs. For these articles the verdict ought to be for the defendant.” The learned judge based his ruling principally upon the fact that the plaintiff was a servant of the fishing company, the vendor, and therefore he could not acquire title without an open and visible change of possession. This was withdrawing from the jury the question of the relations between the parties. While it is perhaps true that the plaintiff was in a certain sense a servant, he was not so in the broad meaning of the term. He was employed to take charge of the fish house, at a salary of $400 per year. In addition he had the use of the farm ; this involved possession of some sort. So far as the land is concerned, it involved a possession of which he could not be deprived arbitrarily, but only in accordance with rules affecting landlord and tenant. Having a right to seed the land, he had a right to remain and gather the harvest; he was also in the ostensible possession of the property of the company. The latter was a corporation, and its members only visited the place occasionally. The plaintiff having purchased bona fide, for aught that appears, the personal property in question, what change of possession was necessary, or even possible ? The articles were in the actual possession of the plaintiff at the time of the sale; the <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>company had the constructive possession; the plaintiff if a servant had rights upon the premises. This is not the case precisely of a sale by a party who has the indicia of ownership, and who makes no delivery of possession. The indicia of ownership for all practical purposes was in the vendee.</p>

There is abundant authority for this. It is sufficient to refer to McKibbin <em>v. </em>Martin, 14 P. F. Smith 352. Later cases affirm the same doctrine.</p>
