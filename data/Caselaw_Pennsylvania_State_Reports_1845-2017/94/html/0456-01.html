In a former action for deceit, upon the same claim, the verdict was for defendant, and the latter pleaded specially “former recovery,” upon which issue judgment was entered in the court below for defendant, which judgment was afterwards reversed by this court, and “judgment entered for the plaintiff on the special plea.” (See report of case in 6 Norris 213.) No <em>venire </em>nor <em>procedendo </em>was awarded in the judgment of the Supreme Court. After the return of,the record, to the court below leave was obtained from said court to issue execution to enforce the judgment as entered by the Supreme Court. A rule taken by defendant to show cause why the execution should <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>not be set aside was discharged by the court. A writ of error was again taken, and this court reversed the order of the court below awarding execution and discharging the rule to set it aside, and a <em>procedendo </em>was awarded, the following opinion being filed by Mr. Justice Trunkey, on June 9th 1879:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="Ath" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[156,617,1171,906]]]'>The defendant pleaded non assumpsit under which he could have proved a former recovery. Afterwards he specially pleaded former recovery, to which the plaintiff replied and prayed that the same might “ be inquired of by the record.” The parties seem to have submitted, informally, the latter issue to the court, and a decision was made in favor of'defendant, which was reversed in this court and judgment entered upon the special plea for the plaintiff. Believing the issues of fact had been disposed of before the case was brought here, the point presented was considered. We did not apprehend the real state of the cause, else another course would probably have been adopted, though the opinion and judgment could not have been different if rendered at all. The parties did not file an agreement dispensing with a jury and submitting to the court, and there has been no trial in any mode known to the law. Hence, by their unusual procedure, they have obtained a formal judgment upon a single question which ought to have been tried with others of fact, to be followed by a lawful trial, and, possibly, more writs of error. The delay and costs will be persuasive that it is unprofitable to obtain a judicial determination of such questions by piece-meal. Nor is it always safe, for had there been an actual trial how could it be said every question of fact was not disposed of?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b459-7" data-blocks='[["BL_459.5",459,[156,1524,1170,686]]]'>Upon return of the record execution was awarded to the plaintiff. There was nothing to authorize this action. At most the j.udgment entitled him to an inquiry of damages, and in justice not to that. The pleadings raised the general issue which put upon the plaintiff the burden of proving his claim ; and the defendant had waived nothing, and had made no express or implied agreement that the court should examine any fact save one, and that by inspection of the record. By concerted action of the parties — one could not have done it alone — the court was induced to give judgment on the special plea. Neither could have intended that to settle the question of indebtedness or its amount, for they made no agreement to that effect, and the general issue remained of record. Therefore, the judgment for plaintiff upon the special plea must be held as only an adjudication that the former action is no bar to recovery in this. To suffer it to go farther would give one party an advantage to which he is not justly entitled.</p>

      <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>At the trial of the present case before McClean, P. J., the plaintiff produced evidencé in substance as follows: That plaintiff had purchased the farm in dispute from Durburow, the assignee, for the benefit of creditors of Eckenrode; that he went over the farm with Eckenrode, who was then in possession, and who then stated to him that there were one hundred and forty-four acres in the tract, and that the price was $5000. At this time the assignee was not present, but Eckenrode assured plaintiff that he had authority to sell and that Durburow would agree to any arrangement he Avould make, and that the articles could be made with Durburow. Subsequently the parties met again, when the assignee was present, when Eckenrode repeated the statement that the farm contained one hundred and forty-four acres. Schriver then made a calculation at $31.25 per acre for one hundred and forty-four acres, making $4500, and, showing it to Eckenrode, asked if he was sure he had one hundred and forty-four acres, and he replied yes, he would guarantee it. Schriver then offered $4500 to the assignee for the farm, who remarked that he would sell the land as he had advertised it, which was one hundred and forty acres more or less, that he would not guarantee what it contained, as he did not have the deeds in his possession. He afterwards agreed to accept Schriver’s offer, and Schriver and Durburow entered into an agreement for the sale of the farm for $4500.</p>

Pie examined it on his return home, and then found that he had in the farm hut one hundred and thirty-two acres and one hundred and twenty-six perches. In the spring of 1874 Schriver paid the balance of his purchase-money to Durburow. He claimed a deduction on account af the deficiency, but was advised by counsel that he could not withhold it from the assignee, with whom he had no covenant as to the quantity of land.</p>

    <p id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.7",462,[248,494,1172,771]]]'>If the court ordered the nonsuit, in this case, under the impression that the defendant’s parol guaranty could not be enforced because of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries it made a mistake. In this state it is well-settled law that an action will lie upon parol contracts concerning lands, though they be such that specific performance of them will not be enforced. Such is the doctrine of Thompson <em>v. </em>Shepler, 22 P. F. Smith 160, and of Frederick <em>v. </em>Campbell, 13 S. &amp; R. 136. The latter ease holding that, in an action upon a bond for purchase-money, parol evidence was admissible to show that at the time of the execution of the deed the vendor declared that he had good title to two hundred and twenty-five acres of land and would warrant that quantity. Now Eckenrode did expressly warrant that the tract of land, then about to be conveyed, did contain one hundred and forty-four acres, and though he had made an assignment of the premises to Durburow, for the benefit of his creditors, yet there was such an interest remaining in him as was sufficient to support the undertaking here alleged; in other words, he was not a mere volunteer.</p>
    <p id="b462-7" data-blocks='[["BL_462.8",462,[249,1270,1172,860]]]'>Thus, the very nature of the alleged contract between these parties was such that, had it been in'writing, specific execution of it could not have been compelled, for it was not intended that the deficiency should be made good in land. Schriver was about to pay $4500 fór a certain defined tract of land, and the warranty could have meant nothing more than this, that if there should turn out to be a deficiency in the guaranteed amount of land, Eckenrode would make it good, not in land but in money. Let us now suppose the plaintiff to have purchased on the faith of the agreement of the defendant that the farm should contain one hundred and forty-four acres, we have, then, this condition of affairs; the plaintiff has been obliged to pay the whole amount of the purchase-money to the assignee, who, of course, was not bound by the gfiaranty, and yet he gets but one hundred and thirty-two acres, whilst the price paid for the fourteen acres, which the defendant undertook to see that he should have, has, as we discover from the final account of the assignee, gone into Eckenrode’s pockets. This is neither just nor lawful, and if the jury should find, as they may find, the case to be as above supposed, this money honestly belongs to Schriver, and he ought to have it.</p>
