The substance of what is alleged seems to be that the original intention or negotiation was for a loan to improve her estate, but when the transaction came to be consummated she permitted her husband to receive the money for which the mortgage was given. It is not said that any fraud was practised on the wife in the execution or delivery of the mortgage.</p>

If such were the facts of the case there would be no trouble in the case and the mortgage would undoubtedly be valid and binding upon the wife. But such are not the facts. The affidavit of defence alleges clearly <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>and explicitly that the husband was not the borrower, but that the’ contract of loan was made with the wife, that she became the borrower, that the loan was made to her and not to the husband, that the loan was made to her for the improvement of her separate estate, but the money came into the hands and possession of her husband and was never applied to the improvement of her separate estate, but was used by him for other purposes. Hence the mortgage could not have been given to secure the debt of the husband but simply as a securityfor the wife’s contract,' and this mortgage in question cannot be held valid upon the theory on which the court below decided the case, namely, that a married woman can give a valid mortgage for the debts of her husband. A mortgage given by a married woman for money borrowed for the improvement of her separate estate is void unless it be shown that the money was actually used for that purpose; Heugh <em>v. </em>Jones, 8 Casey 432; Lippincott <em>v. </em>Leeds, 27 P.
