    <p class="headnotes" id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.4",90,[266,517,1174,765]]]'>In July 1793, James Sillyman obtained eighteen warrants, of four hundred acres each, previously applied for by him in his own name, and in the names of others, as warrantees. These warrants called for land on the “north side of Mahanoy mountain, supposed to be in Berks county.” Surveys were made under these warrants in July 1793, by I-Ienry Vanderslice, deputy surveyor of Berks county, whose location was subsequently found to have been made upon territory in Northumberland county. Vanderslice’s surveys were returned 16th July 1793. On the 18th July 1793, a caveat was filed against granting patents thereupon, for the reason that the location interfered with older warrant rights. No citation ever issued upon this caveat. In October 1793, a re-survey of fourteen of the eighteen warrants was made by William Gray, deputy surveyor of Northumberland county, partly upon the same ground previously occupied by Vanderslice, though avoiding the interferences complained of. Gray's surveys were returned loth March 1794. Rive paténts were granted upon tracts of the Gray location in 1806; two in 1808; one in 1813, and three in 1865. Upon tracts in the Vanderslice location a patent was granted in 1833, and one in 1870. John Bitler obtained a warrant for one hundred acres of land in 1827, and caused a survey under it to be made by George Reber, D. S., in June 1829. The Bitler survey, as located by Reber upon the ground, interferes with the Gray surveys in the warrantee names of Christian Troxel, Christian Immel, Casper Thiel, and John Shomo. .</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b90-6" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[265,1283,1170,1103]]]'>The Thiel tract was sold to the county for non-payment of taxes in 1834, and sold by the commissioners at public sale in 1843. The Immel and Troxel tracts were sold to the county for non-payment of taxes in 1844, and sold by the commissioners at-public sale in 1849. The Bitler tract was sold to the county for non-payment of taxes at the same time with the Immel and Troxel tracts, in 1844, and sold by the commissioners at the same time with the said tracts, by public sale, in 1849. The deed from the commissioners to the purchaser of the Bitler tract was not delivered, nor the purchase-money paid by him, until five years after payment of the purchase-money and delivery of the commissioners’ deeds to the purchasers at the same sale of the Immel and the Troxel tracts. In an ejectment by plaintiffs claiming under the Bitler warrant and survey : <em>Meld </em>(affirming the judgment below), that the eighteen warrants applied for and issued at the same time were intended to form a block of surveys, and that they were so located is clearly shown by the return of Vanderslice July 1793. There was nothing to show that the Vanderslice surveys were ever accepted. A patent was issued by the Commonwealth for the Anna Maria Shomo tract, as located by Vanderslice ; this, if done understanding^, would be some evidence of the acceptance of his surveys. But it was clearly shown that the patent was issued by mistake, and contrary to the intention of the party in interest: Meld, <em>further, </em>that the caveat, although never acted upon, afforded sufficient grounds for refusing to accept the Vanderslice returns. Another reason for not accepting them was the fact that the surveys were not within his proper district ; though the latter fact would not have invalidated the title if his returns had been accepted and patents issued in pursuance thereof: <em>Meld, further, </em>that the acceptance of Gray’s surveys, as well as his authority to. make them, may be inferred from the fact that nearly all the tracts included in his block of surveys have been patented. Granting a patent according to a return, of survey, is virtually an acceptance of the return :. <em>Meld, further, </em>that the plaintiffs’ claim was properly restricted to the Christian Troxel tract, as located by Gray, and does not embrace any portion of the Casper Thiel, John Shomo or Christian Immel tract.</p>

Also, under objection and exception, parol evidence that 'Elizabeth Bitler paid the taxes upon this tract from the year 1829 to 1841; and tax receipts of the supervisor of Union township to Hannah and Elizabeth Bitler for thirty-eight cents for road tax in 1834, and for four and a half cents for the year 1840, dated Union township, 1839. * * * They then gave in evidence, under objection and exception, the transcript-book of triennial assessments for Union township, with assessments to Hannah and Elizabeth Bitler, as follows: For the years 1832, 1833 and 1834, “ one hundred acres mountain land, fifty acres do.;” for 1835, 1836 and 1837, “ sixty acres unseated land ;” for 1838 and 1839, “ Bitler, Elizabeth, one hundred and three acres land; Bitler, Elizabeth and Hannah, thirty acres land on the Green Mountain,” and for 1840, “ Bitler, Elizabeth and Hannah, thirty acres land on the Green Mountain;” for. 1841, “thirty acres unseated land;” for 1842, “three hundred acres land unseated;” for 1843, “Bitler, Eliza<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>beth, one hundred and three acres of land; Bitler, Elizabeth and Hannah, three hundred acres unseated land.” The plaintiffs alleged that these assessments to Hannah and Elizabeth Bitler refer to the land in controversy; also that this land was assessed as seated land until the year 1841, after which date it was transferred to the unseated list without notice to Hannah and Elizabeth Bitler, the owners.

They then proved assessments for Union township, Schuylkill county, for the years 1841-3, in the names of Christian Troxel, Christian Immel and John Klinger respectively, “four hundred aires unseated land;” a sale by the county treasurer to the county commissioners of the Troxel, Immel and Klinger tracts, for non-payment of taxes, on the 10th June 1844, and gave in evidence a deed for each of them, dated respectively 13th July 1844, from the treasurer to the commissioners. They proved a sale of the said three tracts by the commissioners, on the 16th July 1849, to John W. Roseberry, B. Nehff and II.

The plaintiffs objected to the commissioners’ deeds that they do not show that jhe pre-requisites of the Acts' of Assembly relative to the sale of unseated lands had been complied with, and also that the deed of the Klinger tract was irrelevant, as not referring to land in dispute. The court admitted the deeds in evidence, and sealed a bill of excep<a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>tions for the plaintiffs.

Taylor and John Clayton, and a deed for the same from the commissioners to Taylor and Clayton dated 15th March 1843. The plaintiffs objected to this deed of the commissioners, as to those previously offered. The court admitted it and sealed a bill of exceptions. The defendants then proved that the title of Roseberry, Nehff and Krebs to the Immel and the Troxel tracts and the northern half of the Klinger tract, and the title of Taylor and Clayton to the Thiel tract, have vested, by sundry mesne conveyances of the same, in John II. Brown. They then gave in evidence, under objection and exception, a sale of the Casper Thiel tract by the sheriff of Northumberland county, and deed poll 'from him dated 22d August 1806, for the same to John Meyer, and showed that the title of J ohn Meyer to the said tract has become vested, by mesne conveyances, through Jacob Trout and others, in John H.

The plaintiffs objected to these patents that they were executed after suit brought. The court admitted them, and sealed a bill of exceptions. The defendants then showed that the title of Lewis Reeser in the Immel, Troxel, and the northern half of the Klinger 'tracts has vested in John H. Brown; this to show the claim of title in the. defendants to the land in controversy, and that the title held by the patentee tq these tracts is not an outstanding title. They then proved assessments to Hannah and Elizabeth Bitler in 1841, 1842, and 1843, upon three hundred acres of unseated land in Union Township, alleged by the plaintiffs to refer to the land in controversy, also a sale of the same for non-payment of taxes by <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>the treasurer to the commissioners <em>on </em>the 10th June 1844, and a sale thereof by the commissioners on the 16th July 1849, to C.

They proved that this tract was conveyed by Straub to Elizabeth Bitlér, “ as tending to show that she claimed the land in controversy under a worthless tax title to Straub, and that it was this title that she subsequently conveyed to Brandon and Snyder in 1858 and 1860.” They introduced the testimony of surveyors that the lines of the block of Gray surveys are clearly defined by marks still existing upon the ground, which conform to t'he calls of the original returns made by Gray, as also to the official location of eleven older surveys adjoining the Gray block, of which the defendants gave in evidence a certified connected draft. The surveyors testified that the John Bitler tract interferes with the Christian Troxel, the Christian Immel, the Casper Thiel, and the John Shomo tracts as located by Gray. It appeared from the testimony of surveyors that the lines had been skilfully shortened in the official return of the John Bitler survey, so as to conform to the quantity of land returned, one hundred and ninety-nine acres sixty-three and a half perches, though that tract, as actually located, embraces two hundred and ninety-nine acres sixty-three and a half perches of land. It also appeared that the territory upon which the surveys of Yanderslice and those of Gray were made was ascertained to have been in Northumberland county by the line run for the purpose of defining the limit of that county in accordance with the Act of 1795, and that this territory became a part of Schuylkill county in 1818.

To be followed by evidence of the location of these surveys, of their return into the land office, and of their having been filed without objection. To be. followed by evidence that the Commonwealth granted patents upon the John Shomo survey, as made by Yanderslice, and rejected the John Shomo, Ann Maria Shomo, 'and the Casper Thiel surveys, as made by Gray, but subsequently adopted the Gray Casper Thiel, pursuant to a -warrant of acceptance issued by the surveyor-general in 1813, before the patent granted thereon to Jacob Trout; that such patent was only in pursuance of such warrant of acceptance and upon payment of the whole purchase-money, as if no original warrant had been issued; that, in 1812, the board of property declared the Gray Casper <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>Thiel survey void, because made upon a warrant exhausted by reason of the Vanderslice survey of the same.; that neither Christian Immel, Christian Troxel, Casper Thiel, John Klinger, John Shorno, or James Sillyman ever asserted any claim of title to the surveys made by Gray in their names respectively as. warrantees, or ever paid taxes thereon. To be followed by evidence from the land office that the board of property never granted any authority either to make, or to accept, the Gray surveys; that the land office does not show a list of accepted surveys applicable to those of Gray; there is no express evidence that it ever adopted the Gray surveys except as to the tracts patented in 1806 and 1808; and that it has treated them,-ever since, as void against those of Vanderslice. To be followed by evidence that the Christian Troxel tract was first assessed in 1818, was sold to the county in 1822 for non-payment of taxes, and that in 1827 or 1828 the county entered upon its records that there was no land to satisfy the assessment of the Christian Troxel tract.</p>

But subsequently, upon suggestion by the defendants that they were “ willing the evidence should go upon record, and the legal effect of the testimony be pronounced by the court at the conclusion of the case,” the court allowed the plaintiffs to introduce the evidence as set forth in their offer. The plaintiffs then introduced the testimony of a clerk in the department of the interior to prove, from the record, that the certificate shown by the defendants is not a certificate of accepted surveys. It appeared, however, upon cross-examination, that it was not the practice in the land office, before the year 1800 or 1801, to make a note of acceptance upon the survey itself. I.t further appeared that these two sets of surveys have been kept together, upon the files, a Gray survey inside a Vanderslice survey, or vice versa. The plaintiffs followed this testimony by certified copies of the returns made by Vanderslice, in July 1793, upon the eighteen warrants issued on 1st July 1793, to James Sillyman, as contained in their offer, and a certified connected draft of these eighteen tracts of land, “ situate on the branches of the Catawissa, on the north side of Mahanoy mountain, county of Berks.” Eleven of these surveys bear the endorsement, “ See another return on the same warrant, by William Gray, D. S. of Northumberland county,” and .similar endorsements are upon the others, except the John Witman, Jacob Yeager, William Wit-' man and Mary Witman, which were located and returned by William Wheeler, D. S., in 1837. They then gave in evidence a patent, dated 11th December 1833, for the John Shorno tract, as surveyed by Vanderslice, and a patent dated 19th April 1870, for the Ann Maria Shorno tract as surveyed by Vanderslice. It appeared, however, from the testimony of the patentees of the Ann Maria <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>Shomo tract that they claimed this tract as surveyed by Gray, and lived upon it, and that the patent they obtained from the Commonwealth was not what they wanted, but related to land they never claimed. The plaintiffs then gave in evidence a certified copy of the proceedings of the board of property, dated 13th November 1812, which recites that there was “an irregularity” in the second return (i. <em>e., </em>the Gray return) of the Casper Thiel survey, and directs the secretary of'the land office to issue a warrant to the surveyor-general to accept the said survey, made the 23d October 1793, “ inasmuch as the said Casper Thiel, and those claiming under him, have held the land from that date to the.present time ; and that a patent issue thereon to Jacob Trout, he paying the purchase-money and interest due from the 1st July 1793.” They gave also a certified copy of the order from*the secretary of the land ofiice to Andrew Porter, surveyor-general, directing him to accept the Gray survey of the Casper Thiel tract, this to show that the board of property treated the Gray survey as void, and for the purpose of rebutting the defendants’ general offer of patents as tending to show acceptance of the Gray surveys prior to the date of such patents. They gave further the Gray returns of the surveys made by him upon the warrants to Ann Maria Shomo and John Shomo respectively, with endorsement upon the former : “ This return rejected by the board of property as not lying in the same county called for by the warrant;” and upon the latter: “This return rejected by the board of property, there being another return on the same warrant for lands in the county of Berks.” They then gave in evidence a warrant to John Bitler, dated 9th April 1811, and a survey upon the same, dated 11th May 1811, to John Bitler, for two hundred and forty-three acres twenty-five perches, 'and allowance. The survey calls for John Bitler, in the right of George More, of John Klinger, of Mary Thiel, of George Rose, of Catharine Rose, and of Maria Kelcher. Plaintiffs allege that this tract, called, “the long John Bitler tract,” interferes with the Gray surveys of the Christian Immel and the Maria Kelchner tracts. Several surveyors testified, however, that the interference alleged arises from a local tion of this tract with reference to a line called “ Meyer’s line,” of “ the line of 1806,” which locates the southern boundary of the Gray block of surveys eighty perches north of the lines of older surveys adjoining the Gray block, which are called for in the original returns made by Gray, and in the patents granted to John Meyer. It also appeared that “ the line of 1806” is not an official line, and that “the long John Bitler tract” will not interfere, as alleged, if located by its calls in connection with the official lines as run and marked by Gray. The plaintiffs then gave in evidence, under objection, the court reserving the legal effect of the offer for future discussion, assessments of Union township to show that the Christian Immel tract was not assessed from 1811 until 1841; also, that <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>the Christian Troxel tract was first assessed in 1819, and a sale of the Troxel tract by the treasurer to the commissioners in 1822 for non-payment of taxes, and a sale by them to John Wickersham in 1831, with'a deed dated 23d'March 1831, from the commissioners to Wickersham for the Christian Troxel tract. The deed was acknowledged, but never delivered; this to show that the assessments of 1841, 1842 and 1843 were void, and the sale thereunder by the treasurer to the commissioners- passed no title. They also showed that the Christian Troxel tract was not assessed from 1827 until 1841.</p>

J., charged, inter alia: “You have the evidence in regard to the location of these fourteen Gray surveys. Mr. Hawley, a surveyor, says : I have not a particle of doubt the Gray surveys were located where claimed. The east line' is well marked, extraordinarily so, after this 'lapse of time.’ This is the testimony of Mr. Hawley, a very intelligent witness, produced upon the part of the plaintiffs, and it is the testimony of all the surveyors, with the exception of Stauffer, who did not examine it. There does not appear to be any controversy as to the location of these fourteen Gray surveys. The effect of the confirmatory act of the Commonwealth in granting patents on part of these Gray surveys, extends to the whole block, and is not confined to those only for which the patents were issued: Fritz <em>v. </em>Brandon, 28 P. F. Smith 351. One effect of a patent is to merge <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>all previous proceedings, and to waive, upon the part of the Commonwealth, whatever informalities may have occurred, so that, upon the granting of it, the title of the patentee as against the Commonwealth becomes complete both in equity and in law. They (the plaintiffs) have offered in evidence the same warrants offered by the defendants, with returns upon them made by Henry Vanderslice, in July 1793, about three months before the surveys were made by Gray, with evidence of the return of these surveys into the land office some eight months prior to the time that Gray made his return. Here arises what is, perhaps, the main controversy in this case. Which of these surveys, those made by Gray or those made by Vanderslice, are the valid surveys ? They cover to some extent the same ground. When this question was before the court the last time, we ruled, as a question of law, that the Vanderslice surveys were the valid surveys, for the reasons, that they were the first made and returned into the land office; that tbe rule of law was that, a survey having once been made upon a warrant and returned, the warrant was exhausted, and the second survey upon the same was simply void. We, therefore, instructed the jury squarely, that the Gray surveys were void and that the Vanderslice surveys were valid. The Supreme Court has, just as squarely, decided that we were in error in that instruction, and that the Gray surveys were valid and that the Vanderslice surveys were abandoned. It has been pressed very strongly upon the court what our duty is under the circumstances of this trial. It has been urged that the validity of the Gray and the Vanderslice surveys is a question that should be submitted to the jury upon the facts as they now stand. It is claimed that new facts have been presented, the effect of which should be to change the decision'of the Supreme Court, rendered, it is said, under a misapprehension of the facts as they actually existed. It has been repeatedly ■ said in your hearing, that the chief justice not only misapprehended the facts of the case, but stated, in his opinion, matters which the evidence showed were not fact's at all, and that, therefore, the decision of the Supreme Court should not bind us in this cáse. It strikes us that there has been very little new evidence introduced into this trial upon this particular, question. Stress has been laid upon the fact that, in the paper-book of the defendants presented to the Supreme Court, their reference to the certificate of the land office as to the Gray surveys, contained in it the words ‘accepted surveys.’ It has been argued that the Supreme Court was misled by this wrnrd accepted. The fact is that both the Gray and the Vanderslice certificates are alike in their language. Tbe plaintiffs, however, directed the attention of the Supreme Court to the fact that the word accepted did not appear in the certificate, and also that the surveys made by Vanderslice were first returned, and' that the evidence of their acceptance was <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>precisely that which the defendants offered of the acceptance of the Gray surveys. The patent to Trout, of the Thiel tract, and the proceedings preliminary to granting it, were before the Supreme Court. So also, the fact that two of the Gray surveys were rejected. The John Shomo and Ann Maria Shomo surveys -were rejected, and the reasons for their rejection wire printed in the paper-book of the defendants. The caveat was also before the Supreme Court, and was printed just as it was read here. It is alleged that it was a mistake to assert that the Vanderslice surveys interfered with any of the lands mentioned by the caveator, and that the Supreme Court was misled by the allegations of this caveat. It does, however, appear in evidence that the Vaderslice surveys interfered with older warrants in the names of Martin Rutherford and others, warrants which were located upon the ground prior to the making of the Vanderslice surveys. We do not think that the Supreme Court were misled by the caveat when they disposed of this case on the writ of error taken to the former judgment of this court. Our error was not the taking of this question from the jury, but it consisted in ruling that the Gray surveys were invalid. ‘ This the Supreme Court corrected, by ruling that the Vanderslice, and not the Gray, were the invalid surveys. This is repeated so often, and with such emphasis, throughout the opinion of Chief Justice Agnew, that it is impossible for me to come to the conclusion that I should, in the discharge of my duty, under the evidence as it is now presented, submit to you, as a question of fact, whether the Gray or the Vanderslice surveys were the valid surveys.</p>

The requisites of a tax-sale are: That the land must be unseated at the time of the assessment; that a tax appears to have been, and in fact was, assessed by the proper officer; that it was due for one whole year and remained unpaid. Unseated lands assessed are the debtor for the taxes; it is immaterial in w'hat name they are assessed, if it is the same land that is taxed and sold, and was at the time unseated. The sale in the name of a younger warrantee will pass the title, it not being assessed at all in the name of the first warrantee. Upon this subject, as bearing upon some of the questions introduced, it has been held by the Supreme Court that, ‘ the constructive possession of land, not actually occupied, follows the legal title;’ that is, in contemplation of law, every man is in possession of the land he owns, until ousted by an intruder, and abandonment of title is not presumed from non-entry nor from neglect to pay taxes. ' The law does not limit a man’s title to the <em>possessio pedis. </em>Inchoate rights may be abandoned, but abandonment is scarcely predicable of perfect titles. And though it is an owner’s duty to pay taxes, what if he does not ? The law, instead of presuming his "title abandoned, seizes it <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>and sells it to the highest bidder: Mayor of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Riddle, 1 Casey 263.</p>

It further appears that the commissioners held them for five years, as required by the Act of Assembly, and that, upon the 16th of July 1849, they were sold by the commissioners of the county to John W. Roseberry, Benjamin Nehff and Henry Krebs, who paid their purchase-money and received their deeds upon the 1st of September 1849. A question has been raised as to the validity of this sale. It appears from the evidence, that there was a sale of the Christian Troxel tract, in 1822, to the county, and it is claimed that it could not be assessed for taxes during the time it was the property of the county, only to the extent of the five years limited by the Act of Assembly, during which time the county held the land for redemption. The subsequent assessment, no doubt, was an irregularity, which possibly may be explained as a similar transaction, to some extent, is explained in Groodman'u. Sanger, 4 Norris 42. Russel <em>v. </em>Werntz, 12 Harris 347, is a case where the county taxed land held by itself. If was there held that ‘whilst the title was in the county, it could not be prejudiced by the payment of - taxes other than those for which it had been- sold. If the county taxed lands the title of which was in itself, and parties paid the taxes in ignorance of the fact, they may, perhaps, have an equitable right to reclaim their money; but they cannot invalidate that title in the hands of a bona-fide purchaser from the county.’ It is claimed upon the part of the plaintiffs, that they have a right to recover for that portion of the John Bitler survey which interferes with the Casper Thiel, amounting to about thirty-six acres. They claim for that portion of the Bitler, included within the Thiel survey, that the taxes were paid by Hannah and Elizabeth Bitler, in 1831 and 1832, and that, therefore, the sale to the county in 1834, and afterwards by the county to Taylor and Clayton, conveyed no title to that portion of the land on the Thiel survey included within the lines of the Bitler survey. The rule upon this subject appears to be this: ‘Proof of the actual payment of the tax avoids the sale:’ Hunter <em>v. </em>Cochran, 3 Barr 105; Reading <em>v. </em>Finney, 23 P. F. Smith 472. They, the plaintiffs, claimed that the sale of the Thiel was invalid, because the Act of Assembly was not complied with. In the case of Lee <em>v. </em>Jeddo Coal Co., 3 Norris 74, the Supreme Court held that ‘the recitals in the deeds of county commissioners made in pursuance of a sale of land for taxes, prima facie raise a presumption that the commissioners did their duty and made the sale according to law:’ McCoy <em>v. </em>

Here, in the absence of evidence to overthrow' it, we think the maxim <em>omnia prcesumuntur </em>has proper application. With regard to the assessments, the question has been raised and argued, that the sale of the Troxel tract as unseated, was void because it was upon the seated list. From the books in evidence and the testimony of Mr. Aregood, it would seem that it was upon what was called ‘the mixed list;’ a list which contained both seated and unseated lands. It was assessed upon this list as unseated. We say to you, that if this land was entered on what is called the ‘mixed list,’ if there found assessed as unseated and sold as unseated, the taxes not having been previously paid, it would convey a good title.

What land is embraced in their prsecipe and writ? The land described in the prsecipe is ‘ a tract of land situate in Union_ township, containing two hundred acres or thereabouts, bounded by land surveyed to James Smith, Christian Immel, John Klinger, and others.’ In the survey the call is for the Casper Thiel on the north. In the prsecipe, reference is made to the deed from Elizabeth Bitler to Snyder, which, it is claimed, is also a part of the description. The adjoiners called for by the prsecipe, including the deed, are James Smith, Casper Thiel, Christian Immel, and John Klinger, all older surveys, and all located upon the ground by the .testimony of the surveyors. It is claimed, upon the part of the plaintiffs, that they have a right to run beyond the Immel. The land they claim cuts into the Thiel and runs beyond the line of the Immel some on to the Shomo. It is claimed that the survey upon the ground is the true survey without regard to the calls for adjoiners. The official distance for the east and west line between the Thiel and the Troxel is three hundred and twenty perches, and the distance as given on the Bitler is three hundred and ten. Commencing at the Smith and running three hundred and ten perches towards the Immel will not reach the Immel tract. But plaintiffs claim the right to run three hundred and fifty perches, and thus run upon the Immel and the Shomo tracts and include two hundred and ninety-nine acres. It is argued that, these being the lines upon the ground of the John Bitler survey, they must control the calls for the adjoiners, and that the adjoinei’s cannot control the lines upon the ground.</p>

      <em>“ </em>It is to bo remembered that the James Smith is. an older survey and its place is well established. The Casper Thiel is an old survey, patented in 1813; while the survey of the Bitler was only made in 1829 and calls for the Thiel. The fact that the Thiel was patented in 1813, was .notice to Bitler where the lines of the Thiel survey were -located, and, of course, he would have no right, to run upon any portion of the Thiel in making his survey. The line of 1806, known as <em>‘ </em>the Meyer line,’ was introduced in this , connection. This line, under the testimony of the surveyors makes great changes in the location of many tracts, and interferes with a large body of surveys. It is only a matter of conjecture for what purpose the line was run, but we think it has nothing to do with, and could not change the location of these surveys as originally returned to the land office. The position taken by the plaintiffs in this case, in reference to ‘ the Meyer line’, of 1806, is like that taken by the plaintiffs in Wagner <em>v. </em>Wagner, 18 P. F. Smith 392. Whatever was the purpose in running this line," it is not claimed it was done by any official authority. We instruct you, therefore, that it can have no weight in deciding the present litigation. . But, as bearing directly upon this question of what is included in the plaintiff’s description, we have a decision of the Supreme Court where it is distinctly held that: ‘It is a principle of construction that, where land is described by courses and distances and also by calls for adjoiners, the latter, where there is a discrepance, invariably govern; and it is applicable to conveyance as well as to official surveys: Cox <em>v. </em>Couch, 8 Barr 154. This has been followed in other cases: Petts <em>v. </em>Gaw, 3 Harris 222. If our construction is correct this controversy is narrowed to the interference -of the John Bitler with the Christian Troxel survey. For, following the description contained in the plaintiffs’ praecipe and deed, and beginning at the James Smith and running along the Casper Thiel to the Immel and then, by courses and distances, back to the Smith, would not interfere with the Thiel, the Immel or the John Shomo. We are constrained to say to you that, upon the whole evidence in this case, the defendants have a right to a verdict at your hands. In saying this, we negative the points of the plaintiffs.”</p>

They claimed under the warrants of July 1st 1793, and surveys thereunder made and returned in 1794 by William Gray, deputy surveyor of Northumberland county, in whose district the lands were situated; and then connected themselves with these warrants and surveys by tax titles.</p>

The plaintiffs contended that they were not, for the reason that surveys under the same warrants were previously made and returned by Henry Vanderslice, deputy surveyor of Berks county, within a few weeks after the warrants were issued; that the Gray surveys were made under exhausted warrants, without an order of re-survey and therefore void, and that they were never accepted. It cannot be doubted that the eighteen warrants which were applied for and issued at the same time, and on which the purchase-money appears by the entry to have been paid in a gross sum, were intended to form a block of surveys; and that they <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>were so located is clearly shown by the return of Vanderslice, made July 16th 1793. There was nothing to show that the Vanderslice surveys were ever accepted. It is true, that about nine years ago a patent was issued by the Commonwealth for the Ann Maria Shomo tract, as located by Vanderslice. This, if done understandingly, would be some evidence of the acceptance of his surveys, but it was clearly-shown that the patent V'as issued by mistake and contrary to the purpose and intention of the party in interest. The tract thus patented by mistake was covered by surveys of the Gray location, under which it was patented more than three-quarters of a century ago, and occupied for about the same length of time. It may therefore be said, with substantial accuracy, that there was no evidence of acceptance of the Vanderslice surveys; on the contrary, satisfactory reasons for their nonacceptance were disclosed.</p>
    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[292,1051,1174,1380]],["BL_111.1",111,[127,421,1167,691]]]'>On July 18th 1793, two days after the Vanderslice returns were made to the land office, a caveat was filed on behalf of persons claiming under prior warrants with which there was an alleged interference. While it does not appear that the caveat was ever acted on or any citation issued, it still afforded sufficient- grounds for refusing to accept the Vanderslice returns ; and to this, perhaps, may be added as a further reason, the fact that the surveys were not within his proper district. This latter fact, however, would not have invalidated the title if his returns had been accepted and patents issued in pursuance thereof. Shortly after the caveat was filed, the same warrants found their way into the hands of William Gray, deputy surveyor of Northumberland county, who, in October 1793, located fourteen of them in a single block, partly on the same ground covered by the former survey, but so as to avoid any interference with older rights. These surveys were returned in March of the following year,' and while the records of the land office fail to furnish any direct evidence of Gray’s authority to make the re-survey or of the acceptance of his returns, they do show that nearly all the tracts included in his block of surveys were from time to time patented; from which latter fact the acceptance of his surveys as well as his authority to make them may be inferred. Granting a patent according to a return of survey is virtually an acceptance of the return. Patents were granted to John Meyer in 1806 for the James Sillyman, Susanna Sillyman, Henry Thiel, Mary Thiel and George Rose tracts, reciting deeds poll from the warrantees, dated July 14th 1793; in 1808 patents were issued to the same person for the Catherine Rose and Jacob Kelchner tracts, reciting deeds poll from the warrantees dated July 10th 1793, and in later years patents were issued for other tracts in the same block. When these patents were issued, the fair presumption is that the proper officers of the land department had beforp them satisfactory evidence of the regu<a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>larity of the Gray surveys. This presumption is strengthened by the fact that the Yanderslice surveys -were never recognised either by the Commonwealth or the warrantees as the foundation of title; and after so great a lapse of time, under the leading and undisputed facts of the case, the presumption should be regarded as conclusive that the'Yanderslice surveys were not accepted, and that, the re-surveys made by Gr.ay were authorized and his returns accepted. The’reasons and authorities in support of this presumption are so fully given in the opinion referred to, that nothing more is now required. The learned judge of the Common Pleas adhered strictly to the principles of law therein recognised, and as we think, correctly held that there was not sufficient additional or different testimony introduced at the last trial to justify any other course. As remarked in the outset, the controlling questions are the same as in the former trial, and the facts upon which they must be determined are substantially the same.</p>
