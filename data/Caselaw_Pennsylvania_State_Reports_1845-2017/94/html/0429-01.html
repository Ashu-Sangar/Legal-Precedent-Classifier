The Farmers’ Bank was chartered in 1868, and did business under the provisions of the Free Banking Act of 1861. In 1871 its officers obtained a new charter by a special act of the legislature which conferred other corporate powers. When the act was passed, the bank ceased to do business under the old charter, and began to act under the new charter in the name of the “ Farmers’ Bank, Carlisle.” The stock and assets of the old bank were treated as belonging to the new, and the business continued, with the old officers, without interruption. Renewal notes were taken for portions of notes which were unpaid during the existence of the old bank, and which had been discounted by the old bank at usurious rates, and new notes and renewals were also made by the new bank at usurious rates. In a suit by the new bank against-the endorser of the series of notes and renewals, Held, that the defendant in said suit could not set up the validity of the change made by the corporation, or question its powers in this transaction. •</p>

Under its charter thus granted, it immediately went into operation in the borough of Car-lisle, as a bank of discount and deposit, with a paid up capital stock of $50,000, divided into one thousand shares of the par value of $50 each, and continued to do business as such until 1st May 1871. On the 15th of March 1871, the persons who were then the directors, president and cashier of the “Farmers’ Bank,” obtained from the legislature the passage of a special act (Pamph. L. 366) by which they were created a corporation by the name of the “Farmers’ Bank, Carlisle,” with certain powers and restrictions which differed materially from those contained in the original charter.</p>

The same dividend book continued to be used, the printed heading over each page of this book styled the bank as the “ Farmers’ Bank, of Carlisle,” but' after 1st May 1871, when the dividends were entered in it, the word “ of” was stricken out, leaving the name stand as the “Farmers’ Bank, Carlisle.” The capital stock, as it existed under the old charter, was carried along as the stock of the bank under the new charter, and dividends' were continuously and regularly declared and paid by the bank, and received by the stockholders.

The corporators named in the charter of 1871, cannot complain of what was done, for they recommended it, neither can the stockholders complain for they assented to it. There are no creditors to complain, for all the liabilities of the bank incurred under the old charter have been fully discharged and paid. No person has been hurt or prejudiced by the change, certainly, not this defendant, for the bank’s money was procured on the faith of his endorsements, and full value given therefor, excepting only in the taking and reserving the excess over the legal rate of interest, and for this he can and will now be fully compensated by deducting it from the amount of the notes in suit.

It was the bank which attempted to escape liability by setting up a pretended charter, and acts which were not only without legislative authority, but in the face of positive enactments, which direct how the organization shall be made, and prohibit doing any business until they are complied with. The defendant, as an endorser, had rights which were secured to him by the Act of 1868, and these rights cannot be destroyed by the substitution of one charter for another where the terms of the act under which the charter rights are claimed have not been complied with. ■ The manner in which charters may be surrended, or corporations dissolved, is fixed by statute: Act of April 9th 1856, 1 Purd. Dig. 285, pl. 21; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Slifer, 3 P. F. Smith 71; Brice’s Ultra Yiras 65; Potter on Corporations, sect. 703.

It directs that the capital stock of $100,000 shall be divided into two thousand shares of $50, which shall be paid in such instalments as the said bank shall by its by-laws direct.

Omission to organize in the way prescribed by the charter, does not take away the corporate franchise, and will not support a plea of no corporation: Brouer <em>v. </em>Appleby, 1 Sandf.

When a corporation is created by a general statute, which requires preliminary steps to be taken by the corporators before it possesses legal existence, it must, in order to prove its corporate existence, show that all such preliminary steps have been taken; it is otherwise where the charter is by a special act, which declares it to be a body corporate: Potter on Corporations, sect. 66. So, when a charter creates a corporation <em>in prcesenti, </em>but with a proviso that it shall do certain things, the omission to do those things, though cause for dissolution by courts, cannot be inquired into collaterally. A debtor of the company, when sued, could not set up want of compliance with the proviso, unless there had been a judicial dissolution of it for non-compliance: People <em>v. </em>Manhattan Co., <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wend.%20383" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Wend. 383">9 Wend. 383</a>.

When, however, a charter has actually been granted to certain persons to act as a corporation, and they are actually in the possession and enjoyment of the corporate rights granted, such possession and enjoyment will be held valid against one who has dealt with them in their corporate character: Angell &amp;. Ames on Corp., sect. 80. He cannot be permitted to prove, in a collateral proceeding, that a condition precedent to its full corporate existence has not been complied with. As against him, the charter and a user of rights claimed to have been conferred by it, are sufficient. When there is a de facto corporation, and the state does not interfere, its corporate existence and its ability to contract cannot be questioned in a suit brought upon an evidence of a debt given to it: Commissioners <em>v. </em>Bolles, <a href="/us/4/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="4 U.S. 104" data-case-ids="581224" data-case-paths="/us/4/0104-01">4 Otto 104</a>.
