The latter pleaded <em>non cepit </em>and property, and specially that he did not take the books as alleged. At the trial it appeared that the Bibighaus library, consisting of 198 law books and the book case, were purchased by Jacob Light and Martin Wengert, trading as Light &amp; Wengert, from George F. Meily, who gave them a bill of sale therefor, dated April 22d 1854. Wright had been engaged in the grain business and failed in 1853, his property having been bought in by Wengert, who was his .principal creditor. After his failure he induced Wengert to allow him to act as his agent in carrying on the business at the same place. The books in controversy Light &amp; Wengert alleged were bought at the instance of Wright, who persuaded them to purchase them and loan them to him, representing that if he had the use of them he could study law, and out of the proceeds of his <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>practice be enabled to discharge his indebtedness to them. The books were bought by Wright while acting as the agent of Light &amp; Wengert, and without their consent were removed by him from Jonestown to Pottsville. Wright had involved Light &amp; Wengert in further losses, and being unable to get anything out of him, they sold the library to the plaintiff, giving to him a bill of sale, dated January 7th 1860. The defendant, upon the presentation of this order, refused to deliver the books. The plaintiff offered evidence that while Wright still lived in Jonestown he frequently asserted that the books belonged to Light &amp; Wengert, and shortly before this replevin was brought declared to the sheriff of Schuylkill county and his deputy, who had levied upon the books and book cage as the property of Wright upon an execution against him, that the books and case belonged to Messrs. Light &amp; Wengert, and that they had bought and paid for them.</p>
