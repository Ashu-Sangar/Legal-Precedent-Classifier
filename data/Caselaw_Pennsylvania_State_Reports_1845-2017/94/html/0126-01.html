    <p class="summary" id="b128-12" data-blocks='[["BL_128.12",128,[279,1365,1173,563]]]'>A petition was presented to the court for the appointment of a jury to view and lay out a road in Whitemarsh and Upper Dublin townships, Montgomery county, over lands, inter alia, then of Henry Bissinger, now of Joseph Nash. This was followed by the appointment of jurors and a report in favor of the road. Before this jury, Henry Bissinger, as landowner, released his claim to damages. Joseph Nash then held a purchase-money mortgage against said premises for over $10,000, on which he was about to commence proceedings to collect. Nash claimed damages before the jury, and the counsel for the petitioners objected that he had no standing. The jury refused to assess him any damages because the owner had ‘released. To this report of the jury exceptions were filed by Nash.</p>

This mortgage, it was also admitted, is still due and unpaid. Mr. Nash appeared before the viewers, and claimed that damages should be assessed to him, which claim was ignored and disallow'ed by the jury. It also appears by the record that Bissinger executed a release of all damages he might <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>sustain as landowner by reason of the laying out and opening of the road. Under these circumstances, the only inquiry is whether Mr. Nash can be heard as a party to.this record, either as an exceptant or an appellant.</p>

In dismissing the second exception filed by Joseph Nash, viz., “ The said Henry Bissinger had no right to release the damages, as your exceptant holds a mortgage on said property for more than all said land would sell for.” 2. In holding that Nash, being a mortgagee of said land, was not an owner within the meaning of the road law. 3. In denying the right of Nash to appeal from the report of said jury and to have a jury trial. 4. In directing that the exceptions filed by Nash and his appeal should be dismissed, and in directing that an opening order should issue.</p>

That in said case, Ludlow, P. J., reaffirmed the principle laid down by Strong, J., in Workman <em>v. </em>Mifflin, 6 Casey 362: “The owner is a trustee for the lien holders, and the courts will protect his rights.” That in the case at bar, Nash was the mortgagee, his land was taken from him against his protest, and because the mortgagor, Bissinger, had released the damages. That under the authority of the above case, if Bissinger was our trustee, we think the court should have protected us by preventing the mortgagor from releasing.
