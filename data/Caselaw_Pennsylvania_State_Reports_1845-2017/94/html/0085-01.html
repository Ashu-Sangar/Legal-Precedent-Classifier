L. 1878, p. 196, repealed the 116th, 117th, 119th and 112th sections of the Crimes Act of 1860, and the 86th section of the Act of 1861 of the Free Banking Act; and consequently even if the court below had jurisdiction of the particular offence charged, the prisoner was not liable to prosecution, and his conviction and sentence were erroneous. And growing out of this second proposition is the question whether the 36th section of the Free Banking Act of 1861, Pamph. L. 1861, p. 515, is not a special law[ and applies only to offences committed by -officers of banks created under that act. This case is ruled by the recent decision in Commonwealth ex rel.

Commonwenlth ex rel. William Torrey, decided at the last term, was relied upon to sustain this position. Torrv was indicted as cashier of a national bank with embezzling the funds of the bank, and he was discharged upon <em>habeas corpus </em>for .the reason that the offence was not indictable at common law, and our statutes defining and punishing the offence do not apply to national banks. Here the indictment charges an offence which was a crime at common law. In Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Beamish, 31 P. F. Smith 339, it was d.ecided that the fraudulent alteration of a book, known as a tax duplicate, was forgery at common law. It is plain under this authority the plaintiff in error could have been indicted for forgery. The indictment here is laid under the statute, and does not charge the offence of forgery in the technical manner required by the strict rules of the common law, but, as in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Beamish, is good under our Criminal Procedure Act. That the Act of Assembly does not call it forgery makes no difference. It is the same offence.</p>
