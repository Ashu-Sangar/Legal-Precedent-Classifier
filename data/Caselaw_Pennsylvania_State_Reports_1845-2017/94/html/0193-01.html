On the 22d of August 1878, the governor commissioned respondent as commissioner of said county. At the general election, on the first Tuesday of November in 1878 and 1879 the relator was elected and re-elected to said office: Held, that the time for filling the ofiices of county commissioners had not arrived at either of said elections, and the relator was not duly elected, and that the proper time for electing was in 1881, being the same year when the other counties of the state were to elect the same officei's.</p>

It makes what were before mere statutory offices constitutional ones. It puts upon the offices of commissioner and auditor the character to which they are entitled under the lawS and usages of the Commonwealth, and the importance which really attaches to them, as they affect both the citizen and the state. Prior to this the commissioners were changed partially, one member retiring each year. Now the whole are changed at the end of three years. Prior to this the dominant party controlled the whole board; now a minority representation is provided for. Casual <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>vacancies are now filled by the Court of Common Pleas by the appointment of an elector of the proper county who shall have voted for the commissioner whose place is filled. It is evident in order to preserve this minority representation that this appointment must he to the end of the whole triennial period for which the commissioners, as a board, were elected, and not to the next election ; nor, if within three months, to the second succeeding general election, as provided in sect. 8, art. 4. That section, therefore, cannot give us any light upon this subject as regards this question, as it could in regard to other offices which by law may be filled by the governor. It is clear, therefore, that in each county the term of county commissioner is a fixed term of three years, and that while under sect. 2 other county officers may begin a term within a period that would have belonged to their predecessors if they had continued in office, it is not so with county commissioners and county auditors. A vacancy in other elective offices may be filled by an election taking place over three months after the vacancy exists, or at farthest the second election after, but not so with county commissioners. We have then this fact within sects. 2 and 7 of art. 14, of the Constitution, about which there can be no dispute, that a term of county commissioners once commenced in a county, they are to be elected at each successive period of three years thereafter.</p>

On this question it seems to us hangs the merit of this controversy. If we err here, our error is' vital. We have no light to guide us but the common rules of interpretation governing constitutional questions. The debates of the convention are referred to. These are often deceptive, for while sometimes they may guide, the Constitution was the article of the people, and how they understood it is what courts of law look at. We think that construction is to be adopted which accepts the natural and necessary result produced by the language used. This no more than the rule that ‘ every word employed in .the Constitution is to he expounded in its plain, obvious and common-sense meaning:’ Dwar. on Stat. and Const., Now let us apply this principle to this section. ‘ Three county commissioners and county auditors shall' be elected in each county where such officers are chosen, in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five,'and every third year thereafter.’ The first meaning that would be attached to this clause by the people, members of the convention, or any one who reads it would be gathered from the result produced by its operation. What would be that operation ? Most clearly that in all counties throughout the state where county commissioners are chosen, the elections would be in the same year, viz., 1875, and every third year thereafter; <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>in other Words, the election of county commissioners would be_ uniform as to time throughout the state. Any different interpretation than this would place this county of Lackawanna in a different category from the other counties in the state, and that against the plain and obvious meaning of this section, which relates especially to county commissioners. That there' are reasons why this election should be uniform and why the year 1875 was selected, will be obvious on a moment’s reflection. The year 1875 occurs immediately before the year of the triennial assessment, which, since 1846, has become a fixed fact in our tax system, so that the commissioners and auditors are now in office during the existence of the assessments over which they have control and with which they have to do. Again, the county commissions are officers with whom the state has an immediate business connection, and it is a matter of convenience for the state officials to know when their terms expire and who are elected, through a uniform system. An examination of the New Constitution, and of the debates in the convention, at once shows that throughout the instrument an effort has been made to produce uniformity in all possible matters throughout the state. In the schedule ■ the year 1875 is again made emphatic as the one in which these triennial elections were to begin throughout the state by the provision in sect. 28, that the previous terms of all county commissioners shall expire on the first Monday of January 1876, thereby depriving officers of a portion of their terms against the general spirit of the instrument, when it could have easily preserved the terms of those already elected to the expiration of the term of the youngest in office. This uniformity is in no way essentially connected with the system of limited voting and minority representation introduced in the seventh section, because, as will be seen in this present case, it can now begin with this year in Lackawanna county if we hold that these commissioners were properly elected at the last election, and yet this uniformity, as we have shown, is a necessary result of the language used.</p>

This being so, is there anything in the Constitution to restrain or control this meaning? We fail to discover it. It is argued that under section 8, art. 4, the election shall be held at the second succeeding general election. It is a question whether under the Constitution the office of county commissioners is an office which the governor has power to fill. Evans <em>v. </em>Walsh does not decide that question, as it was not raised in a case where vacancies are directly provided for in the Constitution. Vacancies in the office of county commissioners are by the Constitution filled <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>by the court. But it is clear that the Act of 17th April 1878 does give power to the governor to fill this vacancy at the erection of the new county. That power, however, provides that the appointees shall “ continue in office until the next general election and-until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified.” It was held in Evans <em>v. </em>Walsh by Judge Woodward, that “ next general election ” was qualified by the three months clause of sect. 8, art. 4 of the Constitution, or in other words, that next general election meant the next legal general election. We have seen that this clause and principle must necessarily bend to sect. 7, art. 14, in filling a vacancy in the office of county commissioners in order to preserve the minority representative principle. We therefore think that the “next general election” as it relates to county commissioners must be qualified by sect. 7, art. 14, instead of the 8th section of article 4.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[278,1062,1167,389]]]'>“ This construction does no violence to any clause, but gives force to all. In truth, it is 'not a forced construction, but perfectly in harmony with the language to interpret sect. 8, art. 4, by saying that the second succeeding general election would in the case of county commissioners and auditors (triplicate officers) be complied with exactly at the second triennial period when the first was within three months of a vacancy. .It is urged that we thereby continue in office county commissioners for two years without an election by the people. It is true, but so the law provides.</p>

Again, it is no more than often occurs. In this very office of county commissioner a vacancy occurring a few days after an incumbent enters upon his duties would be filled by the court for nearly three years without an election by the people; and, under the decision of Broom <em>v. </em>Hanley, where a person elected dies before entering upon the duties of his office, many officers are continued merely by the clause in the law, or their commissions, that provides they shall hold till their successors are duly elected and qualified. In the case of People <em>v. </em>Whitman, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Cal.%2044" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Cal. 44">10 Cal. 44</a>, it was held that this clause in a commission was as much a part of a term as the term itself of the office. The same principle is recognised in York County <em>v. </em>Small, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 315" data-case-ids="1852635" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0315-01">1 W. &amp; S. 315</a>. If these principles of construction are correct, then the time for filling the offices of county commissioners had not arrived in November 1879, and this relator was not duly elected, and the proper time for electing is in 1881, being the same year when other counties of the Commonwealth elect the same officers.</p>

The answer <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>to that position is that the Constitution must be construed together, and that effect given to it which meets and harmonizes all its requirements. A principle is prominent in its provisions, and the one upon which Evans <em>v. </em>Walsh turned, that the people shall have at least three months’ notice of a vacancy to be filled before any election can take place. This is a wholesome provision emphasized by our Supreme Court, and effect was first given to it in an Act of Assembly in the election of judges against the want of the provision in the Constitution of 1838. We hold, therefore, that an election could not take place in 1878, and believe this was settled in the case of Evans <em>v. </em>Walsh. It could have taken place if the county had been organized over three months before an election.</p>

This is true, but the case is in no way analogous. That article (of the schedule of 1838, sect. 10) provided that they should be “ elected in such manner as may be prescribed by law,” not at a certain year, and every three years thereafter. The Act of 1839, Pamph. L. 559, passed in pursuance of this, states at the outset that these officers shall be elected at the next general election, and whenever it becomes necessary for an election, and then provides, in filling vacancies (sect. 4), that they shall be filled by election at the next general election after the vacancy, for three years.</p>

To do so, it was necessary that the terms of auditors and commissioners in office at the time of the adoption of the Constitution should all ■ expire at some definite time, and to accomplish this was the object of sect. 28 of the schedule, fixing the 'first Monday of January 1876 as that time. Any other time might have been selected as well, but this happened to have been the particular time adopted. The system of minoi’ity representation was the object aimed at, and to which the matter of particular dates was entirely subordinate and in itself of no importance. Said section was, by the very language of the section itself, designed to be limited, so far as dates are concerned, to the counties then in existence. Certainly, it could not have been intended by the framers of the Constitution that an election for county commissioners should be held in the county of Lackawanna in the year 1875, for the county then had no existence, and if not in 1875, then not in 1878 or in 1881. This section prescribes a mode in which county commissioners shall be elected, and whenever they are elected they must.be elected in the manner provided, because the system itself was designed for new counties, as well as for those in existence at the adoption of the Constitution. The office of the provision to “hold until his successor is duly elected and qualified” is simply to bridge over a chasm caused by some occurrence unforeseen and out of the usual order of events In this case there has been no such occurrence.</p>

On the 5th of November 1878, and on the 4th of November 1879, is the relator’s answer, at both of which elections he claims to have been elected. But the next general election after the 22d of August 1878, at which a county commissioner can be elected under the Constitution, will be in 1881. The next general election after the appointment of the respondent was, it is true, on the 5th of November 1878, but this must be qualified by the Constitution. In the election of county surveyor in Lackawanna county in 1878, this court held that <em>“ </em>the next general election” in the section now under consideration did not mean absolutely the next general election, but the next general election at which an election for county surveyor could be held under the Constitution and laws: Walsh <em>v. </em>Com. ex rel. Evans, 8 Norris 419.</p>

    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[177,1016,1170,561]]]'>Though the 5th of November 1878 was strictly the day of the next general election after the 22d of August 1878, this court held that. under the laws and the 8th section of the 4th article of the Constitution it was not the next general election, but that the 4th day of November 1879 was the day of the next general election for the election of county surveyor. By a parity of reasoning, the 5th day of November 1878 was strictly the day of the next general election after the 22d day of August 1878, yet under the 7th section of the 14th article of the Constitution it was not the next general election, but the general election in the year 1881 will be the next general election for the election of county commissioners. By this interpretation, and by this alone, the law and the Constitution are in harmony.</p>
