Dunlap did not appear, and the case was dismissed by the alderman. At the trial of the present case, before Livingston, P.

He also called the alderman, who testified: “ Mr. Dunlap came to my office in presence of Mr. Curtis, and Mr. Curtis said he had seen Dunlap’s <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>gauntlets in possession of Mr. Bernar; my recollection is that Curtis said they were Dunlap’s gauntlets; I then recommended the complaint to be made.

There was want of probable cause shown sufficient to send the case to the jury, since the plaintiff in the criminal prosecution “had been discharged by the examining magistrate,” and the burden of showing affirmatively that there was probable cause rested upon the defendant. 2. There was want of probable cause shown sufficient to send the case to the jury, when the plaintiff proved good character, and that he lived in the same neighborhood where defendant resided, and frequently met defendant, and knew him by sight. 3. Want of probable cause having been shown sufficiently, it was unnecessary to prove malice, that being a question for the jury. 4.

Smith 419, that where the plaintiff below had been discharged by the examining magistrate, the burden of showing, affirmatively, that there was probable cause rested upon the defendant. It is said in 2 Greenl. Ev. 455: “ The discharge of the plaintiff by the examining magistrate is prima facie evidence of the want of probable cause sufficient to throw upon the defendant the burden of proving the contrary.” Substantially the same view was taken in Secor <em>v. </em>Babcock, <a href="/johns/2/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Johns. 203" data-case-ids="6772818" data-case-paths="/johns/2/0203-01">2 Johns. 203</a>, and Stone <em>v. </em>Crocker, <a href="/mass/41/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="24 Pick. 81" data-case-ids="2069295" data-case-paths="/mass/41/0081-01">24 Pick. 81</a>.

As the plaintiff below in this case showed that the complaint for larceny against him was dismissed by the examining magistrate, and that he possessed a good character at the time complaint was made, this was sufficient evidence of want of probable cause to either put the defendant below on his defence or send the case to the jury.</p>

A complete absence of any malice against the defendant was apparent, in that the parties were strangers to each other. Dunlap had shown that probable cause, or a reasonable ground for belief of guilt existed in the mind of the prosecutor, because he had been reliably informed that the stolen goods were in the possession of the suspected party; and he had further shown that which must give the prosecutor complete absolution from all liability, viz., that after he had heard all the facts, and they were stated to the alderman, that official advised the bringing of the criminal proceedings.</p>

If, however, the plaintiff’s own testimony shows the existence of probable cause, it lifts that burden from the defendant. Such was the case here. The fact is unquestioned that the property of the defendant was stolen. The plaintiff proved by the magistrate, before whom the complaint was made, that the defendant was at his office with Mr. Curtis, that <em>“ </em>Curtis said he had seen Dunlap’s gauntlets in possession of"Mr. Bernar; my recollection is that Curtis said they were Dunlap’s gauntlets; I then recommended the complaint to be made.” It is unnecessary now to decide whether the advice of the magistrate shall have the same protective power as the advice of counsel learned in the law. The other fact proved is sufficient-protection. The express and distinct statement of Curtis, made to both prosecutor and magistrate, gave <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>probable cause. Nothing is shown proving that the statement was not honestly made by Curtis, and in entire good faith believed by the defendant. So believing, the defendant made the complaint. This evidence was uncontrad'icted, and fully justified the learned judge in ordering a judgment of nonsuit.</p>
