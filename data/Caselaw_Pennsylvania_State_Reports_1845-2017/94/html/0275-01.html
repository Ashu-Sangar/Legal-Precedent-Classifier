Laing, and thus committed a fraud in fact, that then you must find for the defendant. Before you can find that there was such fraud in fact perpetrated by William H. Laing and John Paret, you must be satisfied that when they entered into the arrangement, the purpose and intention of both of them was to defraud.] A letter from John Paret dated August 14th 1879, is referred to as bearing upon the question of the character of the contract. (Letter read to the jury.) If the letters satisfy you that the purpose and intention of <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>John Paret &amp; Co., and William H. Laing was to sell the goods to William II. Laing, that it ivas to be put in such form that whenever a creditor should levy upon the goods that then they were to be the property of John Paret &amp; Co., but if no creditor came and interfered with them, that then they were to be the property of William H. Laing; if you can gather from this letter such a state of affairs, then you have a right to use it for what it may be worth. If, however, this letter is consistent with the testimony of John Paret, that he refused to make a contract of sale with William II. Laing, but preferred to make a contract by way of bailment by merely consigning the goods to William II. Laing for the purpose of sale, they, the plaintiffs, retaining the title to the property during the time and subject to their order, then the letter may have little bearing on the question of fraud. [There is no evidence of actual fraud in this case], and that John Paret and William H. Laing entered into an arrangement for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding the creditors of William H. Laing. Even William H. Laing, the sole witness for the defendant and the party to the contract, does not testify to any fraud, but according to his testimony it was an out and out sale. It is also contended by the plaintiffs that if the goods were transferred by William II. Laing to Frederick E. Bacon, one of the plaintiffs, on the 12th of December last,'and possession taken of them by him before the execution came-into the hands of the sheriff, that then even if you should find that the arrangement between John Paret and William II.

It is not just to the court to separate the phrase from its context: Reeves <em>v. </em>Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Westera Railroad, 6 Casey 460. McCullough <em>v. </em>Porter, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 177" data-case-ids="1856514" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0177-01">4 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 177</a>, is the case at bar, with this material difference in our favor, that there the bailee was admittedly insolvent; but here the only evidence is that Laing was without debts and owned property besides. In McCullough <em>v. </em>Porter, <em><a href="/watts-serg/4/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 177" data-case-ids="1856514" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0177-01">supra,</a> </em>the groceries were consigned to be sold at not less than invoice prices, and the agreement being in writing was construed by the court. Whether the agreement was merely colorable was left to the jury as it was below in our case. The question of fraud in fact has properly, no relevancy here. This is only material, where a vendor being insolvent conveys or makes some kind of transfer apparently for valuable consideration, with delivery of possession with the intent to hinder, defeat or defraud creditors. But to avoid a pon tract made on valuable and ample consideration both parties must intend to share in the forbidden fraud: Towar <em>v. </em>Barrington, Bright. R. 260, citing Maginiac <em>v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Pet.%20361" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Pet. 361">7 Peters 361</a>. If a conveyance be not fraudulent when made it shall not be so ever afterwards: Beck <em>v. </em>Parker, <em>15 </em>P. F. Smith 264; United States <em>v. </em>Mertz, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20206" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Watts 206">2 Watts 206</a>. There was no error, therefore, even assuming that the court gave a binding direction to the jury against actual fraud, because in this issue it could not have availed Hannah M. Laing, a subsequent creditor. The testimony of Bacon was not controverted by any evidence in the cause, and is conclusive that before the writ he had actual possession of the clothing with the assent of Laing, and was preparing the merchandise for re-shipment to New York, and, therefore, we say no title passed by the subsequent levy.</p>

    <p id="b281-7" data-blocks='[["BL_281.10",281,[209,1885,1164,511]]]'>Prom the testimony of Paret the jury could have found an agreement to consign goods to Laing for sale, the invoice prices to be paid weekly or oftener if sales warranted, and all above said prices to be retained by the consignee for his own use, with right in the consignors to reclaim their unsold goods at any time. Such an agreement is a bailment, as was the contract in McCullough <em>v. </em>Porter, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 177" data-case-ids="1856514" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0177-01">4 W. &amp; S. 177</a>, and the agent or factor had no interest in the goods subject to levy and sale. If Laing’s testimony was true the goods were sold absolutely, and the vendors had no right to their return. The court quite fully and fairly instructed the jury in case of their finding a bailment, or “ an out and out sale ;” and of those instructions there is no complaint.</p>
    <p id="b281-8" data-blocks='[["BL_281.11",281,[252,2399,1120,43]],["BL_282.1",282,[278,411,1166,1199]]]'>It is alleged by the plaintiff in error that the apparent contract <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>of bailment was a mere device to cover up a sale so as to enable .the defendants to have a secret lien on them 'for the purchase-money, and that the court erred in the portion of the charge which relates to this view of the case. Although the assignment does not set out all the court said on this point, yet it truly gives the gist of the instruction — the omitted part being the reference to testimony. It may be noted that the court spoke of the alleged device as made to defraud Laing’s creditors, and, after reading and commenting on Paret’s letter, said, “ There is no evidence of actual fraud in this case, and that John Paret and William H. Laing entered into an arrangement for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding the creditors of William H. Laing.” This may have been intended in a sense literally true, but if so, it did not meet the case; for Laing was not in debt, the arrangement was not to cheat creditors he then had; it was to prevent any future creditor taking the goods, because of the title and lien of the vendors. “ If the vendor and vendee agree that the possession shall pass to the vendee, but the property remain in the vendor until the purchase-money is paid, such agreement, as respects creditors and the sheriff, is fraudulent. By transferring the- possession to the vendee under such a contract, a false credit is given to the vendee, and therefore in respect of third persons, as he is the apparent so he is to be considered the real owner:” Per Rogers, J., Rose <em>v. </em>Story, 1 Barr 190. Whatever the form of the agreement, if its purpose was to cover up a sale and preserve a lien in the vendors for the price of the goods, it was void as respects creditors, whether the credit was given before or after the delivery of the goods. A consignment for such object is no better than any other device.</p>
    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[277,1610,1168,815]],["BL_283.1",283,[215,410,1178,650]]]'>Laing assigned a mortgage and conveyed a lot as collateral security for goods to be delivered. Iiis attorney, Bartine, wrote to Paret that Laing had requested him to draw a paper giving Paret a claim on all goods furnished in excess of $3000, and asking his wishes concerning the paper. On the same day, August 14th 1879, Paret replied, “While I do not anticipate Mr. Laing’s becoming in any way involved, yet in view of the proposed business arrangements, it is necessary for us to provide for all possible contingencies ; and, for Mr. L.’s protection as well as our own, I think it desirable to so arrange the matter that his stock could not possibly be subject to any attachment or judgment. I do not know that this could legally be accomplished by a bill of Sale, unless a new one be given for every purchase. But I have suggested to Mr. Laing that the object may more easily be attained by our ‘ consigning’ the goods to him and so marking our invoices and books. By this means we would retain the title, and in case of any difficulty the goods would be ours and not subject to any other indebtedness of Mr. L.

Paret &amp; Co.’s letter of October 15th 1879 shows a refusal to take back goods. Laing did business in his own name and also had goods bought of others. The oral statements of Paret and Laing conflict. If the contract were proved by the letters alone the court would declare their meaning, but they are to .be considered with the other testimony, and the whole is for the jury. .The jury were correctly instructed, in case they found a real consignment — also if they found an absolute sale. But we think the testimony was ample to warrant a finding that there was a sale of the goods, which was covered by a sham consignment, and that in respect to such fact, if found by the jury, they should have been instructed that the arrangement was void as against a creditor of Laing.</p>
