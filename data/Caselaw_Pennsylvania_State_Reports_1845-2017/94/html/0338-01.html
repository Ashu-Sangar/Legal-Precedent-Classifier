While there can be no doubt that .this is a parol agreement, which cannot, therefore, affect subsequent judgment creditors, does it not affect Hearing’s right to claim this balance ? If he had made no agreement in regard to paying this money or taking the land subject to it, if the transaction was only such as the records, articles of agreement and deed show, he would undoubtedly be entitled to it. But does not this evidence materially affect his right? It undoubtedly gives John Rudy’s executor a right of action against.him, and, in the auditor’s opinion, gives him a right to interpose here and claim this balance of the money made out of the land specifically devoted by Hearing to the payment of the debt; it is an equitable lien good between the parties. If the deed had contained a clause subjecting the land to the payment of this sum, then Hearing and all others would be precluded from participating in the proceeds of the sale until it was paid; Hearing, having by contemporaneous parol agreement for sufficient consideration, as he only paid the balance, agreed to pay it, and having made the land, so far as he was concerned, subject to the debt, and, therefore, the particular fund oiit of which it was to be paid, is he not precluded from participating in the fund until it is paid? Is he not estopped from claiming any of the proceeds of this land until all the debts to which he made it liable are paid ?

The judgment which he held was at one time a lien on the land sold by Kauffman to Hearing, but he had revived it after the sale to Hearing against Kauffman alone, and did not include Hearing, the purchaser and terre-tenant; by this proceeding the judgment became a lien on the remaining land owned by Kauffman only, and the land sold to Hearing was entirely relieved therefrom.</p>

Hearing after-wards stated to Rudy, or his executor, that he had promised Mr. Kauffman to pay, and he would pay, the Rudy judgments, but this did not and could not revive the lien or continue the old lien, nor did it create a new lien, nor did it make Rudy’s executor a lien-creditor, so as to enable or entitle him to participate in the funds for distribution. These judgments at the time of the sale to Hearing were a lien on all the real estate of Kauffman situate in Lancaster county, including that sold to Hearing.' But at the time of the sale of Hearing’s real estate by the sheriff' the judgment held by Rudy’s executor was a lien on Kauffman’s real estate only, and no lien or encumbrance on the property sold by the sheriff. The executor was not even a general creditor (viewed in <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>a legal point) of Hearing, whose property was sold.

The court below seems to think that the verbal agreement is obnoxious to the Statute of Frauds, because Hearing had promised to pay Kauffman’s debt.

Whether the $800 judgment had lost its lien as against Hearing is immaterial, because by the contract between the parties, Kauffman and Hearing, agreed to by Rudy, the holder of the bond, that judgment was considered as a charge .on the land. Landis’s judgment is a lien only on Hearing’s interest in the land, and this interest can only be made available by selling out Hearing. If Landis is willing to become the purchaser of this interest, as sheriff’s vendee on his own judgment, he may try the value of his title by bringing ejectment against Rudy, as the sheriff’s vendee on his execution^against Kauffman.</p>

L. 777. That is precisely what the court below did here. The appellant, however, is not satisfied with the decree, hence this appeal. The difficulty which the appellant has to meet is that the lien of his testator’s judgment has expired. It was revived against the original defendant without joining the terre-tenant. After the lien was lost by this omission, Hearing, the terre-tenant, confessed a judgment in favor of Landis. The property was sold on a judgment against Kauffman, Hearing’s vendor, and it was contended by appellant that because the real estate was sold as the property of Kauffman'and not of Hearing, the proceeds must go to Kauffman’s lien-creditors; that is to say, to the appellant’s judgment, the lien whereof had expired. We need not discuss this proposition. That there is nothing in it is settled by a host of authorities. I will only refer to Ficke’s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 447.</p>

The most that can be said is, that Hearing may have made himself liable to an action on the part of the holder of the judgment.

The appellant seems to forget that a mere contract creditor has not even a right to be heard upon a question of distribution, nor can he take a writ of error. This is settled law: Smith <em>v. </em>Reiff, 8 Harris 364. The promise to pay the judgment was at most an agreement to indemnify the vendor; it was not a promise to pay out of the land, nor did the promise run with the land; it created no estate upon condition which would revert to the vendor upon breach of condition.
