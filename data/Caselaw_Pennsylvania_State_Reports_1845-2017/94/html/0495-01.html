The Act of April 3d 1872 provided that tavern licenses in Allegheny county should be issued by the treasurer of said county. Certain fees were named in the act, and a subsequent section provided that “ one-fourth of all such sums received by the treasurer as aforementioned” should be paid, to the state, and the other three-fourths to the use of the county. By the Act of April 12th 1875, it was provided “ that licenses for sales of liquors, when not otherwise provided for by special law, may be granted by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the proper county.” This act also fixed the fees, which were all made payable to the Commonwealth, and the rates were less than those contained in the Act of 1872. The Act of 1875 repealed no act specifically, except the Act of March 27th 1872, which was known as the “ Local Option Law.” During the years 1875 and 1876, the treasurer of Allegheny county issued the tavern licenses as under the Act of 1872, but collected the fees at the rates fixed by the Act of 1875. In the settlement of his accounts, the accounting officers of the Commonwealth charged him with all the fees received during these years. On an appeal therefrom, <em>Held, </em>that the Act of April 3d 1872 was not in any respect repealed by the Act of 1875. <em>Held, further, </em>that the fees having been collected in pursuance of the rates fixed by the Act of 1875, the provisions of the Act of 1872 that three-fourths of the fees should go to the county of Allegheny, did not apply, and that they were all payable to the Commonwealth.</p>

After the most careful examination, I am clearly of the opinion that the Act of 1875 does not, in any particular, alter or change that of 1872. There is no clause o.r provision in it which has any bearing on the earlier statute. The Act of 1872 was intended as a full and perfect provision as to most of the state taxes in Allegheny county, the subjects of taxation, and the rate of assessment, and, where the object was omitted, it would have to be taxed and rated, for state purposes, under the general laws. It is contended that, under the provisos in the third section of the Act of 1875, the tax on inns and taverns was changed in that county. There is nothing in the provisos that even hints such a change. On the contrary, the whole of the Act of 1875 leaves in full force all special statutes. We may take it as a legal axiom that statute laws are not to be repealed by implication. To have that effect, there must be a strong repugnancy between them: The King <em>v. </em>Justices of Middlesex, 6 M. &amp; S. 279. There must be an irreconcilable inconsistency: Bank <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 10 Barr 448. A general law will seldom repeal a special one : Dyer <em>v. </em>Covington Twp., 4 Casey 186. A general statute, without-negative words, will not repeal a previous one which is particular, though there be some inconsistency between them: Brown <em>v. </em>Commissioners, 9 Harris 37. Later statutes, which are general, do not repeal an earlier one which is particular: Bounty Accounts, 20 P. F. Smith 96; which cites very many of the English cases. Implied repeals are not favored: Erie <em>v. </em>Bootz, 22 Id. 199. And there must be so strong an inconsistency that they cannot stand together: <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>Egypt Street, <a href="/grant/2/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Grant 455" data-case-ids="227684" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0455-01">2 Grant 455</a>. The law never favors repeals by implication: Shinn <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 <a href="/grant/2/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Grant 455" data-case-ids="227684" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0455-01">Id.</a> 205 ; Bowen <em>v. </em>Lease, 5 Hill (N. Y.) 221. Such is the language of all the cases and text writers. We would say that these rules were universal, but for two of our own decisions under the tax laws of the state, where the principle was disregarded: Iron City Bank <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh, <a href="/wright/1/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Wright 340" data-case-ids="626169" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0346-01">1 Wright 340</a>. This bank was, by the terms of its charter, exempted from taxation for a certain period ; yet a general law was held to-embrace it, which taxed the Pittsburgh banks. The other is <em>the </em>case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Fayette County Railroad, 5 P. F. Smith 452, which had a special exemption until the earnings would pay the' stockholders six per cent, on their investment; yet, as the corporation was created subject to the Act of 1849, it was held to be embraced in a general law taxing railroad companies on their dividends. No one doubts the power of the legislature to impose the tax, notwithstanding the exemption clause ; but did it do it by a general law? We would say that, on general principles, the special exemption was not revoked by implication under a general tax law of railroads. It required some special enactment, pointing to the particular road. We are clearly of the opinion that no part or portion of 'the special act relating to the taxation of inns and taverns, in the county of Allegheny, is altered or revoked by the Act of 1875. There is no allusion to the Act of 1872, and no inconsistency between the two laws. The error in the present case arises from the county authorities imposing the tax under the Act of 1875, instead of that of 1872. Had they adhered to every portion of that law, they could have successfully claimed to have the money appropriated under the seventh section of the act, which gives one-fourth of the sums received by the treasurer for license to the use of the state, to meet the demands on the state treasury, and three-fourths thereof to the county of Allegheny, to aid in completing the workhouse. By the course pursued, the county of Allegheny wishes to tax under one law, and claim three-fourths of the money raised under another. This we consider inadmissible.</p>

How much, they do not know, and the same is not in proof by either party. If that were known with reasonable certainty, the court could adjust the difficulty with approximate accuracy. Possibly it might have been approached by giving in evidence the sums raised from licenses in 1873 and 1874, but there was no attempt to make the proof, each party relying on the principles of law, and construction of the different statutes for which they contended. The court is obliged to decide the case on the <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>evidence before it. The seventh section of the Act of 1872 we do not consider is repealed, but stands in full force; but the sums received for tavern licenses were either under the Act of 1875, or the general laws of the state, therefore, do not come within either the words or spirit of the act, which says, “ the one-four.th of such sums received by the treasurer, as aforementioned, for license, to be for the use of the state,” &amp;c. All of the previous sections had fixed the high rates of taxation, as before stated. No part of the money now in controversy was so received, therefore cannot be claimed for Allegheny county; but, being collected from the citizens for tavern licenses, must be distributed and appropriated as in other cases under the general laws. Allegheny county can again collect and -receive her three-fourths of the license money for inns and taverns, by making i'ts future assessments and collections under the Act of 1872, unless that law has been repealed.</p>

That court could not, by injunction, prevent the state treasurer from acting with the auditor-general in settling and collecting the money decided by them to be due to the Commonwealth; nor could it even enjoin the treasurer of Allegheny county from paying over money which he had collected for the state. If such a course could lawfully be pursued, the finances of the Commonwealth would be .thrown into strange confusion. On the same principle, the treasurer of every county in the state could be prevented by the courts from paying any money into the state treasury collected under a law which they choose to consider unjust or unconstitutional. It was intended by the framers of our laws, that all questions affecting the revenue, or claims by or against the Commonwealth, should be first heard by the accounting department under the Act of March 30th 1811, and if the party claimant or defendant against the state was dissatisfied, an appeal was given under the restrictions therein provided.- That appeal was to be decided at the seat of government where the public offices were kept, and the state officers could give the business their attention without neglecting their other public duties. They would thus have all of the reports to the departments, papers, books and public documents at one place, where they could be used on the trial without inconvenience or loss of time. It is sufficient for us that such is the settled law, and we consider the bill in equity in the Common Pleas of Allegheny county <em>coram non judice. </em>That court had no jurisdiction in the case, and its pending injunction is a nullity, affords no protection to the county treasurer, and has no binding effect whatever on the state treasurer.</p>

If the Act of 1875 is to be construed as a general act on the subject of granting licenses, introducing a new system, and repealing special acts by implication, then it should have effect in all its parts ; and as the money collected under it is in every other instance paid to the state, the licenses from Allegheny should be thus paid.</p>

We think one of two positions must; be assumed, either the Act of 1875 supplied the Act of 1872 in all its provisions, save that relating to the authority to grant, which was specifically excepted, or it did not effect it in any way. In either case the money in controversy belongs to the state.</p>

The seventh section thereof appropriates, to the use of the state, one-fourth of the license fees by the act authorized, and the balance to the use of the county to be used, after payment of expenses, in building and maintaining a workhouse. The section <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>referred to is dependent for its force and efficacy upon the preceding sections; this is obvious from its language which is as follows : “ The one-fourth of all such sums received by the treasurer, <em>as </em>aforementioned, for license, to be for the use of the state, .* * * and the other three-fourths for the use of said county.” It follows if, as the defendant below contends, the preceding sections are repealed by the Act of 1875, so also must be the seventh section, because the very source from which the county is to get its appropriation is thus cut off. As under this theory the “ sums aforesaid” could have no existence, clearly the county could get nothing. If then we concede the defendant’s proposition, that is, that the Act of 1872 has been repealed by the Act of 1875, his ground for resisting the claim of the Commonwealth is swept from under him. It is true it is contended that the Act of 1875 repealed that of 1872 only so far as classification and the rates of assessment are concerned, leaving the seventh section of the latter-named act still in force. This, however, is an attempt to engraft, by an unwarranted implication, part of a general act upon one that is purely local, and this anomalous patchwork has for its only object the giving to the county of Allegheny three-fourths of the license fees raised under the Act of 1875. This cannot be; if this county is not so entitled under the Act of 1872, it is not entitled at all, for all such fees raised under the Act of 1875 belong to the state. That act contains in itself a uniform system designed to raise revenue for the use of the Commonwealth, and not for any local purposes whatever, and in it there is not so much as a hint towards the Allegheny act. The claims of Allegheny cpunty for a portion of the funds in the hands of the defendant must, therefore, be regarded as groundless. As these funds, confessedly, were collected under the Act of 1875, they belong to the state, and to the state they must go. As to the remaining and incidental question, we have only to say that neither directly nor by implication does the Act of 1875 repeal that of 1872, and we cannot see how, in view of the multitudinous decisions of this court, directly bearing upon the doctrine here involved, any one could come to a different conclusion. To discuss a point so obvious would be to no purpose, especially in view of what has been so well said upon the subject by the court below.</p>
