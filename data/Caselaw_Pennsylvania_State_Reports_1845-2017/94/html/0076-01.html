She and her husband jointly executed a promissory note, and for a loan obtained thereon deposited the certificate of stock as collateral security for the payment. The stock was delivered at the time the note was given and the money paid. It was accompanied by a written authority to sell, without reference or notice to the pledgors, on non-payment of the note. The lender advanced the money in the presence of both husband and wife, without knowledge of what disposition was to be made of it, and in consideration of the transfer and delivery to him of the stock as collateral security. The money was not paid for necessaries, nor for the improvement of the wife’s separate estate. She filed a bill to restrain the sale of the collateral, and to compel its return to her: <em>Held, </em>that the contract was executed, and. that the pledgee might retain the stock to answer the purpose for which, in good faith, it was received.</p>

But this instrument contains much more than a promise to pay money. It is her written authority to the defendant, or the holder thereof, to sell or transfer at public or private sale her twenty shares of stock, and it is accompanied with the actual delivery of the certificate of stock itself. The property in question is’ personalty, and the method of its transfer is not prescribed by the Act of 1848. <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>In Hinney <em>v. </em>Phillips, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20382" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Wright 382">14 Wright 382</a>, Justice Agnbw said, ‘before the passage of the Act of 1848, securing the separate estate of married women, it was well settled that a wife might dispose of such estate (personally) by gift or loan. * * * Since the passage of that act, her power <em>over </em>her own estate is not less, in this respect, than it was" before.’ The provision that her estate shall' not he sold, conveyed, mortgaged or encumbered by her husband without her written consent, given in the mode provided by the act, is not a restriction upon her own power of disposing of her money or other property capable of transfer by delivery, but was intended to protect her <em>from </em>his unauthorized acts.. Ruling of like character is found in Haffey <em>v. </em>Carey, 23 P. F. Smith 431, and Bond <em>v. </em>Bunting, 28 Id. 210, in the latter of which, her assignment of a portion of a life insurance policy upon the life of her husband, for the benefit of his children by a former marriage, without transfer of the possession of the policy to the transferees, without consideration and without acknowledgment, was held good as against her after the death of her husband, he having joined in the transfer or assignment thereof. There is no allegation of fraud or coercion in obtaining her signature to the writing in question. It is true 'she did not acknowledge this instrument ‘separate and apart from her husband’ though he joined her in its execution. But that a married woman may assign or transfer property like that in question, without an acknowledgment, was decided in Bond <em>v. </em>Bunting, <em>supra, </em>and other cases there cited. In addition to these authorities, we find recent legislation upon this subject. By the Acts of April 1st 1874, Pamph. L. 49, and May 14th 1874, Pamph. L. 158, additional powers seem to have been conferred upon her. And for the purpose of selling and transferring much of her personal property she is enabled to act as though she were unmarried. The certificate of stock was delivered to the defendant at the time of the delivery of the writing and the receipt of the money. The property in question was capable of no other delivery. The writing contains the power to transfer, the money remains unpaid, and the transaction assumes the character of an executed contract, no act of hers being required to its completion. Under the ruling in Fryer <em>v. </em>Rishell, 3 Norris 521, we think her right to equitable relief is, to say the least, doubtful, and to doubt the legal right of an applicant to an injunction is to refuse it.”</p>

This was not an executed.contract on the part of Mrs. Dando, but was merely placing her property as security for her husband’s debt. It was done in such a manner and under such circumstances as in the law would be presumed to be done by her under the duress of her husband. The note, being void as to her promise to pay the money, was void as to the subsequent clauses pledging her property for its payment, and authorizing its sale if the note were not paid.</p>

The case was heard on bill and answer. The grounds on which relief was asked are that she was a married woman, that the stock was her separate property, and that she and her husband deposited the certificate of stock with the appellee as collateral security for the payment of money; but the money for which the samé was pledged was not used by her for necessaries, nor for the improvement of her real estate. The bill contains no averment of fraud, deception or undue influence in procuring the certificate. It further appears, both by bill and answer, that it was delivered at the time the loan of money was made; that a note to secure the payment thereof, signed by her and her husband, was then executed and delivered by them to the appellee. After language usually contained in a promissory note, it proceeds to declare: “ Along with the foregoing obligation, we have delivered twenty shares of the stock of the First National Bank of Miners-ville as collateral security for the payment of the same on the day it becomes due, which collateral we hereby authorize and empower the holder of this promissory note, provided the same be not paid at maturity, <em>to- </em>sell or transfer at public or private sale, without further reference or notice to us, and to apply the proceeds in payment thereof, together with interest and charges incurred thereon.” In his answer the appellee avers that both she and her husband were pi’esent when he advanced the money, but “as to whether the Said sum of money was received by and for the sole use of the said Margaret, or for the sole and separate use of the said Stephen Dando, or for their joint úse, this defendant is not informed and has no knowledge, but that the said sum was paid to them at’ the time for and in consideration of the said shares of stock, being so as aforesaid-transferred and delivered as the security for the repayment of said sum of money,” and that said note had become due, and was unpaid and held and owned by him.</p>
