The defendants set up a title commencing with one John Decker about 1836.

But it was .offered in connection with evidence that John Decker held the land in dispute under the contract. This was sufficient to entitle the contract to go to the jury. If Decker actually held the land under this contract, it was competent evidence; its effect was for the jury and they'might infer a mistake in the warrantee name used therein. The objection that it should have been offered in chief was not well taken. The plaintiff showed title derived through Eleazer Carey. The' defendants set u'p title by possession, commencing with John Decker. To rebut this the plaintiff proposed to show that Decker’s possession was not adverse to plaintiff’s title, but on the contrary that his possession of the land in dispute was obtained by virtue of this contract with Carey, and that subsequently, Carey brought ejectment thereon against Decker and recovered, and issued a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem; </em>that to avoid being turned out, Decker leased the land in dispute, and on the 24th of August 1872, executed a writing under seal, intended to cover this land, and agreeing as tenant of Carey, to deliver up the possession thereof on the first of April ensuing. This evidence was strictly rebuttal.</p>
