We have found that the company sued is not technically a mutual life insurance company, hut is no , more than 4 a mutual aid association,’ of which we have hundreds in Pennsylvania, generally on a smaller scale than the defendant, but of the same general character. We have beneficial associations all over the manufacturing or mining portions of the state, generally incorporated, and long in existence. One, at least, in our vicinity starting with a thousand members, each agreeing to pay one dollar on the death of a member towards relieving his fajnily, kindred or legatees. No one thought of their being insurance companies, or coming under the jurisdiction of our insurance commissioner. It is obvious that the same is the case in the state of <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>Ohio. They are there created by different laws, passed within a few days of each other, yet entirely different in their provisions and structure. That state, like our own, has an insurance commissioner, with laws similar to ours, yet their Supreme Court has decided that companies incorporated, as the one under consideration, for ‘ mutual protection’ is not an insurance company. True, that would not be binding in our state if the company came within our laws, yet, in our opinion, it does not.</p>

The company considers itself merely the agent to collect and receive the money from living-members for the use of the deceased. In the State of Ohio <em>v. </em>The Mutual Protective Society, the Supreme Court of that state decided, in <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Ohio%2019" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="26 Ohio 19">26 Ohio Rep. 19</a>, that a company precisely like this was not a mutual insurance company.

The insurance commissioner claims the power to make a decree ex parte, which he calls a settlement, against both the company and the individual that they shall pay the amount of the penalty imposed by law for transacting business in this state without- his license; this without any previous notice or claim. We do not believe that the legislature ever <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>so intended. It is so claimed because it is said that the auditor general has such power under the Act of 1811. On carefully reading that law it might well be doubted whether it was so intended in regard to anything but the settlement of taxes and the failure to make reports. The discretionary power is clearly given to that department to so settle accounts for taxes, when from the smallness of the claim or other causes it is deemed expedient, from which the practice has grown up so to do in all cases, and it is now clearly settled that the right exists, and that the settlement is conclusive unless appealed from within thirty days after notice. But we are not at present aware of any case where this has been applied to the recovery of a bare naked penalty. On reading the act we find great pains taken to enable the auditor general to compel the attendance of parties, production of books and papers, &amp;c., and although power to impose penalties is conferred in some cases, yet they contemplate notice.</p>

Yet the ground on which companies and officers are bound to ex parte settlements without notice and held liable, as decided in several cases, is, that they take their charters and commissions with notice that the power is so conferred; yet 'that can scarcely apply to those created by the laws of other states or to private individuals. It may be well questioned whether, under the Constitution of this state, such power can be conferred. It is not proceeding by due course of law. We cannot help doubting whether the legislature ever intended to authorize the recovery of these large penalties without notice, hearing or trial, and in the present case we think that notice was expressly required.

In this we concur. There was no occasion for mention in the title of companies to which the act was not intended to apply, but lest the term “insurance companies’-’ should be construed to embrace aid associations, the fifty-fourth section was inserted for the express purpose of manifesting the legislative intention to exclude them entirely from the operation of the insurance laws.</p>

It is a corporation created by the law's of the state of Ohio. Although it possesses some of the features of an insurance company, yet it is there held not to be a mutual insurance company: State of Ohio <em>v. </em>Mutual Protective Society, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Ohio%2019" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="26 Ohio 19">26 Ohio Rep. 19</a>. It is substantially a beneficial or mutual aid association. It has no fixed capital. It is not bound to pay any fixed sum on the death of a member, but so much only as may volun<a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>tarily be paid by the surviving members. It cannot be enforced by law. Each person is required to pay a fee of ten dollars on his admission as a member: but “ no assessments can be made for carrying on the business of the association.” The effort is to make it liable under the provisions of the Act of 4th April 187 3, yet it is clearly excepted from the operation of that act by the Act of 1st May 1876, Pamph. L. 58. The fifty-fourth section of the latter act declares that “ this act and the act to which this is a supplement, shall not apply to the beneficial associations that provide aid for the family or heirs of a deceased member, whether issuing policies containing a guaranteed sum of insurance or not, nor to associations issuing policies not containing a guaranteed sum of insurance.” The defendant is clearly within this exception. It is held not to be an insurance company in the state where it is created, and even if we were to think otherwise here, yet it is not that kind of a .company so as to subject it to the penalty prescribed by the Act of 1873.</p>
