J., it appeared that James E. and Thomas Smith, who were brothers, entered into a partnership on the 2d of January 1876, which partnership was dissolved at the end of one year, when it was agreed that James E. Smith should keep all the property and should pay Thomas $1102, but that on the 27th of April 1877, they made another settlement of their affairs when it was agreed that instead of the $1102 in cash due him, he should take a quantity of lumber which was specified <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>in a bill of sale given in evidence, stating where the lumber was piled.

Smith 352, which the court read at length, and, inter alia, added: “We think there is sufficient in the case to require the consideration of the jury, and that it is not for the court to dispose of the question. It seems to us to be rather a mixed question of law and fact. * * * This case must be considered with a reasonable view of the circumstances which surround it. Where there is no evidence that it was necessary to remove the lumber to a market, and no positive evidence .that it -was a lumber-yard where piled — a jury should take into consideration the evidence that was given upon the subject; that is, 'whether in the natural order of business, considering the place where the lumber was piled, in whose possession or upon whose land it was, whether it was expected to be sold by purchasers coming and buying it there, or whether the natural course of business would be an immediate removal. All these matters are to be taken into consideration by the jury in determining whether the fact of leaving it there at the time was evidence of fraud or otherwise.”</p>

A mere bill of sale is not sufficient: Haynes <em>v. </em>Hunsicker, 2 Casey 58; Long <em>v. </em>Knapp, 4 P. F. Smith 514. The jury can pass upon a question of actual fraud with but little direction; but to pass on the question of legal fraud they need some instruction from the court. The opinions of the Supreme Court are not intended to instruct juries, but courts and the bar. And we submit that what was read from McKibbin <em>v. </em>Martin, with the accompanying remarks, in view of the facts of this case, was calculated to mislead the jury-</p>
