This part of their . case they rest upon the technical plea that by bringing ejectment we concede that they are in possession. Our writ was issued November 15th 1878. When we rescinded the contract with the Kemble Company it was expressly declared that this was done in order to enable us to institute proceedings at law to try our rights and settle the title. We fail to see how the fact that our election, on the 15th day of November 1878, to consider ourselves out, and our adversaries in possession, in order to bring ejectment could possibly be any evidence that our adversaries had been in possession since 1856. It is hardly necessary to argue that the paper of Mench to Tate and Schell, dated February 8th 1856, was merely executory. One of its clauses provided for the making of a deed at a future time named therein. The same time was fixed for payment of the balance of the hand money.

    <p id="b406-7" data-blocks='[["BL_406.8",406,[280,629,1167,863]]]'>Ejectment in' Pennsylvania is an equitable action : Peebles <em>v. </em>Reading, 8 S. &amp; R. 484. When brought to enforce the execution of an agreement to convey, it is a substitute for a bill in equity. When a party calls upon a court of equity to enforce specific performance he must show that he has himself been ready, prompt and desirous of performing on his part. If he has been guilty of gross laches and unreasonable delay, if he has slept on his rights, and by conduct, long persisted in, conveyed the idea that he had abandoned them, he cannot, after there has been a material change of circumstances affecting' the rights, interests and obligations of the parties, move a chancellor to decree specific performance: Parrish <em>v. </em>Koons, 1 Pars. 79; Patterson <em>v. </em>Martz, <a href="/watts/8/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Watts 374" data-case-ids="1848458" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0374-01">8 Watts 374</a>; Callen <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 5 Casey 247; DuBois <em>v. </em>Baum, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20537" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 Wright 537">10 Wright 537</a>; Miller <em>v. </em>Henlan, 1 P. F. Smith 265; Oadwalader’s Appeal, 7 Id. 158. It is true the rule is not held so strictly against one who is in possession defending. It is, however, generally by reason of his equities. When they are so weak as to present no substantial grounds for protection they must yield to the general rule. If possession be taken, and improvements be made, and expenditures be incurred, they will create a substantial equity.</p>
    <p id="b406-8" data-blocks='[["BL_406.9",406,[280,1491,1171,818]]]'>The agreement under which the plaintiffs claim was executed in Eebruary 1856. It was for a mineral right, in consideration of $150, to be paid therefor. One-fourth of the purchase-money was to be paid by the first of May following, when the deed was to be executed, and the residue in three annual instalments thereafter. Twenty dollars, part of the first instalment, were paid at the execution of the agreement, and nothing more was ever paid. There was evidence indicating a willingness on the part of the vendor to convey on payment according to the contract; but no subsequent payment was made nor deed demanded. Neither the vendee nor those claiming under him took, any visible possession of the premises, they made no expenditure on them, they took no ore from them. After a lapse of nearly fifteen years, the defendants in error elected to consider the plaintiffs in error in the constructive possession, and brought this action of ejectment. In the meantime the lands had become of very great value, and the plaintiffs in error sought to revive equities which they had suffered to sleep for so many years. It was too late. The time to assert them had passed.</p>
