He employed in August 1878, and thereafter in the same year, various mechanics and material-men to furnish him with lumber, machinery, &amp;c., for the erection of the breaker. About the 1st of January 1879, he was in default in the <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>payment of wages to his miners and laborers for the months of November and December 1878, as well as the amounts due on the mechanics’ liens. In the same month Malley confessed this judgment to Stichler, as trustee for the laborers and miners. On this judgment an execution issued, and the lease and fixtures were sold and the proceeds paid into court and referred to an auditor, John A. Sullivan, Esq., for distribution. Before him the mechanics' lien-creditors appeared, as well as the laborers and miners; the former contending that they were entitled to the fund in preference to the latter. The auditor sustained this contention in his opinion, inter alia, saying:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b85-6" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[131,921,1174,603]]]'>“ The auditor from the evidence adduced before him, and after a careful consideration of the Mechanics’ Lien Law of 1836 and its supplements, and the law of 1872 and its supplement of 1874, giving a preference to the miners and laborers employed-around the mines, and after a full examination of all the authorities submitted, is of the opinion that the wages of miners and laborers as represented by judgment to No. 164, March Term 1879, should be postponed until after the mechanics’ liens are satisfied. Had the miners and laborers given the proper notice to the sheriff before the sale in accordance with sect. 2, of the Act of 9th April 1872, it could not avail anything, inasmuch as the liens of the mechanics had attached to the leasehold estate and improvements from the commencement of the building, and therefore could not be prejudiced by subsequent liens or judgments.”</p>

    <p id="Aio" data-blocks='[["BL_85.7",85,[128,1695,1172,419]]]'>The Act of 1859, Pamph. L. 318, gave miners and laborers a preference over all other claims. The Act of April 9th 1872, 2 Purd. Dig. 1464, confirmed the preference which had been given by previous laws. It is true that under the 4th section of the Act of 1872, no lien by mortgage or judgment shall be effected by this preference: but this question cannot arise here, as the mechanics had acquired no such lien. They were not recorded liens, and therefore not notice to any one of their existence or extent. The judgment and execution were sufficient notice under the Act of 1872.</p>

    <p id="b86-7" data-blocks='[["BL_86.10",86,[333,1387,1170,1030]]]'>It does not appear that any notice in writing of the claims of the appellants, and of the amount thereof, was given to the sheriff at any time before the sale of the property levied on, as is required by the second section of the Act of 9th April 1872. The auditor practically finds that no such notice was given, and there is nothing on the record to show that he was in error in that finding. The duty of proving that there ivas such notice rests upon the appellants, as it is a statutory pre-requisite to the enforcement of their claims. The notice contained in the amicable action upon which the judgment was entered, is no notice to the officer executing <em>the </em>writ. That paper Avould be lodged in the prothonotary’s office, where it would remain, and there Avould be neither certainty nor probability of its being seen by the sheriff. There is no proof that in point of fact he ever did see it. The appellants have therefore failed to establish the validity of their claims as liens upon the fund for wages of labor due them, under the act. As a mere judgment their claim is subsequent to the mechanics’ liens, to Avhich the fund was distributed, and the levy and sale by execution under that judgment does not help the claim as against those liens. The objection to the latter that they are filed against the leasehold as well as the improvements, we can not determine because there is no evidence on the record upon that subject. We can not say, therefore, that they are not entitled to the money which has been awarded to them by the auditor.</p>
    <p id="b86-8" data-blocks='[["BL_86.11",86,[509,2418,996,87]]]'>Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
