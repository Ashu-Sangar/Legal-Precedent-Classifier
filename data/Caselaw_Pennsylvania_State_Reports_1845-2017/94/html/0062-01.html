Among the exceptions of the Avard was ohe to an item of credit for $825 claimed by Wheaton for the hoard of his Avard for two hundred and sixty weeks. The account was referred to an auditor, A. W. Bertholf, Esq., from whose report it appeared that the appellant was a niece of Wheaton’s wife, and went to live with him in August 1864, when she was about eight years of age; that in the fall of said year her mother and her father, who was a soldier .in the army, both died, and Wheaton was appointed her guardian; that she lived with her guardian until 1871, resided in his family, worked for him, and was boarded, clothed and schooled by him the same as his oato children ; that Wheaton never applied nor obtained an order of court for an allowance for his ward; that she was legally eligible to attend the soldiers’ orphan school without expense for maintenance and tuition during the time she resided Avith her guardian, <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>and that he never sent her nor made application for her admission; that he frequently told his ward that he had taken her as one of his own children ; that he had often said to his neighbors that he had taken her as his ' own child and would treat her as such, and that he did not want any one else to school her; that the expenses of said guardian in' maintaining his ward in excess of what she earned was $231, but that said guardian had never made any charge for maintenance in his books.</p>

This was sufficient to rebut the presumption that the guardian had a right to charge for maintenance. We admit no mere relationship but that of parent and child would rebut such presumption. But any relationship of consanguinity or affinity is evidence and tends to rebut it: Smith <em>v. </em>Milligan, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20108" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Wright 108">7 Wright 108</a>; Duffy et al. <em>v. </em>Duffy, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20403" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Wright 403">8 Wright 403</a>; Lantz <em>v. </em>Frey and Wife, 2 Harris 202; Defrance <em>v. </em>Austin, 9 Barr 309; Douglas’s Appeal, 1 Norris 169. The other circumstances, and the declaration of the guardian show conclusively that he stood <em>in loco parentis. </em>A guardian has no right to use the principal fund of his ward without the sanction of the court.</p>

She was the niece of his wife, and was entitled to a reasonable sum for her maintenance. This case differs materially from those cited by appellant, -where a closer relationship existed.</p>

All this is consistent with the allegation, abundantly sustained by the evidence, that the guardian had placed himself in <em>loco parentis </em>to his ward. We have the further fact found by the master, that the orphan was eligible to admission to the school for soldiers’ orphans at Harford, where she could have been schooled and maintained without expense. Her guardian was under no legal duty to place her there, but it is a circumstance to be considered when he attempts to charge her with the cost of her board and maintenance during the years that she was a member of his family, and if the evidence is to be believed, doing his chores, milking his cows and feeding his pigs.</p>
    <p id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[285,1059,1170,561]]]'>The learned auditor rejected the claim of th.e guardian for the support and maintenance of his ward. In doing so he was clearly right. While relationship, either by .consanguinity or affinity, except in the case of parent and child, does not of itself rebut the presumption which the law raises, that a promise to pay is intended when personal services are rendered, yet as was said in Smith <em>v. </em>Milligan, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20107" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Wright 107">7 Wright 107</a>, it tends to rebut such presumption, and if accompanied by other evidence is sufficient. In Douglas’s Appeal, 1 Norris 169, the decision is directly to the point, that when a step-father takes his step-child to live with him as one of his family, he is not entitled to be repaid for expenditures made for her during her minority. Duffy <em>v. </em>Duffy, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20399" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Wright 399">8 Wright 399</a>, is equally in point. See also Ruckman’s Appeal, 11 P. F.
