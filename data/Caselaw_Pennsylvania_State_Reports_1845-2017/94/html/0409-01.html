The bank was in the habit of receiving deposits of bonds for safe keeping for the convenience of its depositors and others, but without any compensation. The cashier of the bank solicited the plaintiff to deposit his bonds in the bank, and he took from the cashier a receipt which stipulated that the bonds should be at the owner’s risk. The cashier had no authority to solicit deposits, or make any representations as to their safe keeping, nor was it shown that the hank authorities had any knowledge of this particular deposit. In a suit for the bonds which were lost or stolen, <em>Reid, </em>that parol evidence of the declarations of the cashier, made when soliciting the deposit, that the bank would as securely keep the plaintiff’s bonds as it would its own, and that they were safe, except in case of fire or burglary, was not sufficient to change the effect of the written receipt so as to affect the bank.</p>

The bank was in the habit of detaching the coupons and collecting the interest for depositors of these bonds. It sent these coupons to city banks, and the proceeds were there placed to the credit of the bank, and upon the fund thus accumulated it would draw drafts and charge a small commission therefor. The interest paid by the city -banks was inconsiderable, and the amount realized therefrom and the commissions on drafts did not compensate for the trouble of forwarding the coupons and paying out the interest. <em>Reid, </em>that these facts did not constitute the bank a bailee for hire.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b411-7" data-blocks='[["BL_411.6",411,[165,1335,1167,234]]]'>3. The bonds thus deposited were placed in a fire-proof safe where the bank kept its ¡own valuable securities, and no one but the cashier and the authorities of the bank had access thereto. The cashier was a man who was highly respected by the community, and had the entire confidence of the directors. <em>Reid, </em>that there was no evidence of such negligence on the part of the bank as to make it liable for .a loss through the dishonesty of the cashier.</p>

The bonds thus received were placed in tin boxes, and were kept in a burglar-proof safe inside of a larger safe, and the latter was placed in the bank vault. The money of the bank was kept in the same burglar-proof safe. It-was usually locked, and no one had access thereto hut the cashier or authorities of the bank. It was the habit of the bank to pay the interest directly to the depositors of the various bonds. The cashier cut off the coupons, and as they became due they would <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>be sent to New York and Philadelphia, to several banks in said cities, and the fund realized from the sale of the coupons was placed to the credit of the defendant bank, which fund the latter used by drawing drafts thereon, and charging the draw’ees a small commission therefor. It was of some advantage to have such a fund to draw on for the accommodation of its customers, but the balances thus kept in the cities were not large, and very little interest was received thereon- The indirect profit thus derived from the fund did not compensate the bank for the trouble and risk it incurred in forwarding the coupons for collection, and distributing the proceeds among the bond depositors. By the charter of the bank the directors had the power to manage the affairs of the bank and appoint its cashier. From 1865 to 1876, one Hassler was cashier. He was well known and regarded by the community as an honest and upright ’man.</p>

In answer to the inquiry of Hassler as to whether he had any '7-30’s, Comp said that he had, and -at Hassler’s request showed them to him. Hassler said he would exchange the bonds for him, and went to the safe of the bank and brought out 5-20 bonds of a larger denotnination, two &gt;of $1000 and two of $100 each. Comp said he wanted bonds of the same denomination as the 7-30’s, to wit, four $500 and two $100, .as he might want to use them. Hassler then returned to the safe and brought out bonds of the denomination requested (some of those received the day before from Washington), and put them in an envelope and handed them across the counter to Comp, who started to leave the bank.

But the day before Mr. Hassler had received them, the same bonds, as appears from the records of the Treasury Department,' procured in the lot sent for in nine separate orders of and for private parties, men and women, whose records you have heard read. Were they the property of the bank? Were they the property of Mr. Hassler, the cashier ? It is argued that his solicitude and importunity in having Mr. Comp leave the bonds in the bank, is some evidence of a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of Mr. Hassler in dealing with Mr. Comp in the transaction; that Mr. Hassler had not the right to offer and to appear to pass them to Mr. Comp, if they were the special property of some of the private customers of the bank. The argument of the defendant further is, that the four $500 bonds may have been restored to the • parties, rightfully owning them, and that Mr. Hassler appropriated to himself the 7-30 notes which the plaintiff passed to him. And that the. subsequent acts and conduct of Mr. Hassler in sending the plaintiff the semi-annual returns of the coupons' and gold premium after the four bonds had passed back into the treasury of the United States, and were redeemed as far back as the 20th of October 1870, are convincing evidenc'e of the fraud practised by him on Mr. Comp as well as upon <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>the bank, and that Smith, the teller, was cognizant of and participated in this guilty conduct. * * *</p>

You need not proceed to make the next inquiry in the case if the first is determined by you against the plaintiff. It is a question of fact, and the testimony would seem to be strong in support of the defendant’s position upon this stage of the case, but the inquiry is to be answered by you from the evidence, and you must not be controlled by any opinion I have expressed or may express upon the facts.] * * * [To conclude, if you. find from the evidence that the transaction of the 15th of February 1868, was a fraud and trick on the part of Hassler, that he had not then the lawful control of the four missing bonds; but that his act was a sham and deception, your verdict will be for the defendant.”]</p>

Whether- kept in paper envelope or small tin-box, in either case, the cashier might readily have had access to them. He was of good repute, and no negligence can be imputed to the directors for retaining him in his position. Having full confidence in his integrity they trusted him with the property of the bank. They had no knowledge of any misconduct on his part. They were not bound to examine packages left on deposit without reward, to see if the contents remained. The bank was a bailee without hire.
