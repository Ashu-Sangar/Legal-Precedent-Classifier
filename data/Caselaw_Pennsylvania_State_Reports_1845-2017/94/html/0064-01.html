We propose to submit to you as a question of fact whether it was given as security for advances to be made. When, if you find that it was a national bank (and we <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>shall have to take the party itself as it stands upon the record, and put itself into this court, claiming to be such), and if you further find that this judgment was given as security for money to be advanced or loaned in the future to J. S. Little, then the judgment would be void as against the sureties,' and there would be no recovery in this case in favor of the plaintiff in the judgment. If, however, it was given part for debt accrued and due from Little to the bank, and in part for loans to be advanced to him afterwards, then you will ascertain how much was due from Little to the bank at the time the judgment-note was given, to wit: the 2d of December 1872, because that part which was - actually due from Little to the bank at that time was a proper subject-matter to be secured by a mortgage or judgment-note, under the laws of the United States authorizing the organization and management of national banks, under the law which is particularly known as the National Bank Law. The law makes a difference between debts accrued and debts to be created, or loans to be effected afterwards. That distinction is attempted to be made here as between a mortgage and a judgment. A judgment, it is said, might have accrued and not been entered up. But Ave will leave to you as a question of fact, under all the evidence, whether it was in contemplation of the parties at the time to give that judgment for money already loaned and for money to be loaned, or for the security that the judgment would afford the bank by reason of the lien it Avould have upon the real estate. If that Avas the ground or basis of the contract, and the foundation of that transaction, then it was taking security upon real estate for loans to be made afterwards; that is, if you find the fact to be that Little did not owe them the actual amount of $4000: and the law does not permit the taking of security upon real estate by a national bank as regards advanees to be made subsequently. If you arrive at the conclusion that this note Avas given in part for money due and in part for money to be loaned afterwards, it will be necessary for you to determine the amount that Avas actually due to the bank when that note Avas given, and take that part and compute the interest on it up to the time these various payments were made, deduct the payments from the-amount of the principal Avith interest added, and ascertain Avhether there is any balance due, and if so, how much to the plaintiff in the judgment.” * * * (Fourth and fifth assignments.)</p>

If this was error, we fail to see any reason why the bank should complain. The judgment was confessed by virtue of a warrant of attorney on a note payable to “ W. W. Winton, president, or bearer,” and he stands as plaintiff with the words, “ President of the Second National Bank of Scranton” appended to his name. If they mean nothing, he alone is the plaintiff in interest, and they may be treated as surplusage. Putting them on the record did not impose the burden of proving what they meant upon the defendants. In absence of evidence or concession of a corporation, the judgment was Winton’s, and inquiry respecting his authority to release its lien on real estate, or of the right of a national bank to take a judgment to secure future advances, would be impertinent. A glance at the case as presented, show's that, in fact, it was tried on the theory that the note was given for money of the bank of which Winton was president, and, therefore, the assignments will be considered as if the bank has a right to be heard in their support, notwithstanding its point that there is no evidence of its incorporation.</p>

An execution was issued in 1876, and on defendant’s application, the writ was stayed and judgment opened. The trial was in April 1879. During all that time 'the directors of the bank knew, or ought to have known, that the judgment appeared in favor of Winton, and not the bank, and no move was made to put it in the bank’s name. In 1874 Winton gave a release of lien to enable the principal debtor to sell and convey a part of his land. Winton negotiated the loan and did all business respecting it. Why did the directors suffer the judgment to stand in his name, if they had not given him authority to take it ? If no such authority was given, what was the long acquiescence but a ratification ? Though the appended words be sufficient notice of the claim of the bank, it would be commonly understood that it was put in Winton’s name for the very purpose that he could control it as his own. The bank had a legal existence, and was capable of acting, suing and receipting in its own name. If it chose to put the judgment in name of another, it ought to be bound by his acts with others in dealing with it. There was no conspiracy to defraud the bank between Winton and the purchaser of the land, and if by the agent’s mistaken judgment any mast suffer, the loss should fall on the one that gave him power to act. It may be true, as alleged, that the release does not purport to be the release of the bank ; but it purports to be the release of the party to whom the note was payable and who held the judgment. We are not convinced that error was committed in the rulings and instructions set <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>forth in the second, sixth, seventh, eighth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth assignments.</p>

Little stood as if they had just been taken and offered in evidence, no notice having been given, as provided by the rule of court, of the filing. When offered, the plaintiff objected “on the ground that there is no proper certificate; it does not recite that they were reduced to writing by the justice, nor that they were subscribed in his presence by the parties.” Here he is confined to the objection taken in the court below. The depositions were taken in obedience to a rule of court, in presence'of the parties, the witnesses cross-examined, and we do not think the certificate fatally defective. In such case, it is presumed that the depositions were properly reduced to writing and subscribed by the witnesses in presence of the justice until the contrary is shown. No objection was made that H. P. Little had not signed his deposition. The third assignment is not sustained.</p>

The answer indicates that the fact was submitted. Mere forbearance, however prejudicial to the surety, will not discharge him. This rule applies where a creditor suffers a judgment to lose its lien for want of revival against the principal debtor, and thereby subsequent creditors are enabled to take the land: United States <em>v. </em>Simpson, <a href="/pen-w/3/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 437" data-case-ids="1827576" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0437-01">3 P. &amp; W. 437</a>.

That case has settled that real estate security taken by a national bank for present or future advances is valid, and all conflicting decisions in the state courts must give way. It is there said, “ Our attention has been called to but a single point which requires consideration, and that is whether the deed of trust can be enforced for the benefit of the bank.” After noting that the Supreme Court of Missouri held the deed of trust to be the same thing as a mortgage, and that the loan was made on real estate security, it is held, “ These things render it proper to consider the case in that aspect, and conceding them to be as claimed, the consequences insisted on by no means necessarily follow. The statute does not declare such security void ; it is silent upon the subject. If Congress so meant it would have been easy to say so, and it is hardly to be believed that this would not have been done instead of leaving the question to be settled by the uncertain result of litigation and judicial decision. * * * The impending danger of a judgment of ouster and dissolution was, we think, the check, and none other, contemplated by Congress. That has been always the punishment <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>prescribed for the wanton violation of a charter, and it may be made to follow whenever the proper public authority shall see fit to invoke its application. A private person cannot, directly or indirectly usurp this function of the government.” Justice Miller dissented, on the ground that the Act of Congress forbade national banks to take real estate security for money loaned at the time of the transaction, and that such security is void in the hands of the bank.</p>
