The lien filed is for lumber and other materials furnished by plaintiffs, in and about the erection of a building, in and upon the wife’s real estate. The lien itself seems to possess all the qualities and formalities required in the case of married women. But just here the affidavit of defence, put in by both husband and wife, says, 4 that they have a defence in the above suit, in that the said Rebecca Henderson never contracted for the articles specified in the bill of particu<a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>lars filed — and alleged by plaintiffs to have been furnished by them — and the said James B. Henderson and Rebecca Henderson further say, that the charges, or some of them, are in excess of what the plaintiffs agreed with the said James B. Henderson to furnish for to him.’ We are forced to think that said plea is sufficient to prevent judgment and send the case before a jury. It raises a distinct question of fact, and in the Act of 11th of April 1848, securing to married women the control of their separate property, the proviso of sect. 8 says: ‘ That judgment shall not be rendered against the wife in such joint action,’ — that is, against husband and wife jointly — ‘unless-it shall have been proved that the debt sued for in such action was contracted by the wife,’ &amp;c. It seems that the debt must be contracted by the wife herself, or in her name, by any person authorized so to do. The statute secures to the wife that plea and exempts her estate from liability until proven. We can find no exception in the books other than suits on mortgages, and none as to mechanics’ liens. We are of opinion, therefore, that the affidavit of defence is sufficient to prevent judgment, and the rule must be discharged.”</p>

    <p id="b317-9" data-blocks='[["BL_317.10",317,[220,1022,1172,990]]]'>It is essential to the validity of a mechanic’s lien against the separate estate of a married woman that the claim should set forth, among other things, that the work was done and the materials were furnished with her authority and consent; in other words, that she, or some one authorized by her, contracted therefor. Her property is not subject to a lien for work done or materials furnished under a contract with her husband, unless it is made by her authority; nor can he, by any act of his, encumber her real estate without her consent, even for the purpose of making necessary repairs. All the facts necessary to create a lien against her separate estate must be distinctly averred in the claim : Dearie et ux. <em>v. </em>Martin, 28 P. F. Smith 55; Lloyd <em>v. </em>Hibbs, 31 Id. 306; Schrifer <em>v. </em>Saum et al., Id. 385. The claim in this case appears to have been carefully drawn, and contains all the averments necessary to constitute a valid lien. After setting forth, in due form, the nature of the claim, the kind and amount of materials furnished, work done, &amp;c., it is averred that “ the said work was done and the said materials were furnished with the knowledge and consent, and at the request and with the authority, of said Rebecca Henderson, wife of the said James B. Henderson, for the purpose of, and were actually used in, repairing her separate real estate, and were useful and necessary for the enjoyment of her separate real estate, and the debt was contracted by the said Rebecca Henderson.”</p>

When suit is properly brought against a married woman on a claim for which, upon its face, she or her separate estate is prima facie liable, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment, for non-compliance with the rules of court, as though she were a <em>feme sole. </em>As to appearance, rules to plead, affidavits of defence, &amp;c., she' has the same rights, and is subject to the same <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>duties and penalties, as others who defend in their own right and not in a representative capacity.</p>
    <p id="b318-6" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[211,508,1176,902]]]'>In the joint affidavit filed by Mr. and Mrs. Henderson it is averred that they have a defence “ in that the said Rebecca Henderson never contracted for the articles specified in the bill of particulars filed, and alleged by the plaintiffs to have been furnished by them,” and further “that the charges, or some of them, are in excess of what the plaintiffs agreed with the said James B. Henderson to furnish them for to him — all of which they verily expect to prove.” Thus, the material averment in the claim, that the debt was contracted by Mrs. Henderson, is not only traversed by the defendants, but this positive denial is followed by averments the substance of which is that the plaintiffs agreed with the husband to furnish to him the articles mentioned in the bill of particulars, and that some of their charges are in excess of what they agreed to furnish them for. The affidavit of defence is not fairly susceptible of any other meaning; and, assuming as we must, for the present purpose, that these allegations are true, they constitute a good defence to the plaintiffs’ claim, and necessarily send the case to a jury, whose province it will he to determine the disputed questions of fact. If the plaintiffs fail to show that the work and materials were contracted for by Mrs. Henderson, or by some one having authority from her to do so, they cannot recover.</p>
