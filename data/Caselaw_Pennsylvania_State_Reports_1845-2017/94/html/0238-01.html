L. of 1863, 652, George H. Rowland and others were incorporated under the name of the Lackawaxen Bridge Company •for the purpose of constructing a bridge across the Lackawaxen river in Pike county. The bridge was completed in 1863. In the winter of 1864, an act was passed authorizing the bridge company to sell the bridge to Pike county, and the county commissioners to purchase it and issue county bonds therefor. The act, provided, however, that before said sale could be made, the assent in writing of a majority in number of the stockholders should be given. From the testimony on behalf of plaintiff it appeared that a majority of the stockholders signed the assent to the sale, and that the approval of the court was then obtained. Rowland then had some bonds printed, and went to the commissioners to have them executed, but then ascertained that two of the commissioners, Drake and Geyer, were opposed to the purchase. Shortly thereafter, at the general election, on the 5th of November, new commissioners opposed to the purchase of the bridge were elected. It appeared that on the day of the election, Drake, who wms defeated at the election for re-election, met Rowland and told him that he had a notion to go in for buying the bridge. On the 4th of November Geyer, Drake and Rosecrans, the then old commissioners, were in regular session, and during its session Geyer asked when the next meeting would be held, and was told on the 9th, but that they would adjourn over to the 5th to finish business. Geyer then left before the close of the meeting. Rosecrans and Drake met on the 5th and Rowland went before them, and the two commissioners determined to purchase the bridge. The meeting adjourned until the evening to enable the counsel of the commissioners to prepare the necessary papers, when, the bonds were executed and issued. On the part of the defendant it was shown that A. Hanners, one of the assenting stockholders, claimed to be a stockholder by reason of the following facts: His father had recently died owning some of the stock. He took out letters of administration on his father’s estate, filed an inventory and appraisement of the personal property, including this stock, and in the evening of the same day agreed with his mother and three sisters (two of whom were minors without guardians) to take all the personal property at its appraised value. <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>The stock was never transferred to him on the books of the company, and at the time of signing this assent, and of the subsequent action of the commissioners based upon it, he had filed no account as administrator nor in any public manner charged himself with the stock.

The voice of the inhabitants is not directly heard in the levying of taxes, making of contracts or expenditure of money — their power is only felt at the election of commissioners.

Absent members, equally with those who are present, are bound by whatever is lawfully done at a regular or stated meeting or any regular adjourned meeting. If the meeting be a special one, the general rule is that notice is necessary, and must be personally served, if practicable, upon every member entitled to be present, so that each one may be afforded an opportunity to participate and vote. Such notice is essential to the power of the <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>board to do any deliberative act which shall bind the corporation. If all have notice, two shall form the board, and their acts bind the absent as if it were a stated or adjourned meeting. Notice may be dispensed with by the presence and consent of all; and if one has quit the municipality, and has no family or house within its limits, notice to him is unnecessary: Dillon on Mun. Oorp., sects. 200, 201, 223, 224. All authorities seem to agree as to the general rule, unless there is a modification in the charter or statute. It applies alike to public and private corporations. Our statute, which declares that a majority shall form a board when duly convened in pursuance of notice or adjournment, is an enactment of the well-settled rule without adding to or taking from.</p>

No proof was adduced that two acted Avithout consent of the other; and, in the absence of evidence, it is presumed the.officers did their duty: Downing <em>v. </em>Rugar, <a href="/wend/21/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="21 Wend. 178" data-case-ids="2151950" data-case-paths="/wend/21/0178-01">21 Wend. 178</a>.</p>

To say they have convened in pursuance of notice is nonsense, unless Ave speak of notice to the two by a person Avho desires business of interest to himself to be done in the other’s absence. Such meeting savors of conspiracy. A designing man could observe the superiority of an able and upright commissioner over his weaker fellows, and take care to convene the two Aveaker ones for consummation of his purpose, if notice to all is not essential. Superior numbers often yield to superior weight, and sometimes the corrupt quail in presence of an <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>honest man. Just in proportion as a clandestine meeting of two commissioners for transaction of business would be dangerous, is it to the interest of the inhabitants of the county that all three should have notice and opportunity to be present at every special meeting of the board. The opinions, reasoning, perhaps protest, of the one may advantage the county. He may prevent hasty and inconsiderate action. Had Greyer been present on the evening the bonds were signed, he might have discussed the matter with Rosecrans till Drake’s pendulous mind had swung the other way, and thereby saved the county from the Rowland contract. Be this as it may, Greyer ought to have had opportunity to consult, advise, and, if need be, protest. The defendant’s first point should have been affirmed. It is scarcely necessary to remai'k that no question is raised in this record respecting the validity of bonds or securities, appearing on their face to have been properly issued by the county commissioners, which have passed into the hands of strangers to the original transaction who are innocent holders for value.</p>

Sect. 8, art. 9, of the Constitution is as follows“ The debt of any county, city, borough, township, school district, or other municipality or incorporated district, except as herein provided, shall never exceed seven per centum upon the assessed value of the taxable property therein, nor shall any such municipality or district incur any new debt, or increase its indebtedness to an amount exceeding two per centum upon such assessed valuation of property, without the assent of the electors thereof at a public election in such manner as shall be provided by law; but any city, the debt of which now exceeds seven per centum of such assessed valuation, may- be authorized by law to increase the same three per centum, in the aggregate at any one time, upon such valuation.” In the constitutional convention the three divisions of this section were discussed, and the second was explained thus : “ The second division of the amendment provides that no new debt, or any increase of existing debt exceeding two per cent., shall ever be authorized by any municipality without the express assent of the electors of the municipality by a public vote.” This seems to have been the understanding of the convention : 6 Debates 143. The clause was doubtless so understood by the people at its adoption. In Wheeler <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 27 P. F. Smith 338, a case soon after the’ adoption, where it was necessary to give a construction of the third clause of the section, relating to cities, it was remarked of the preceding : “ The municipal authorities may increase the debt from time to time until two per centum has been added, provided the original debt, with the increase, does not exceed seven per centum. After the two per centum has been added, there can be no further <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>increase without the vote of the people.” Neither the debates, nor supposed views of the people, nor the dictum of this court, nor all combined, can set aside the plain meaning of a constitutional provision ; but if the sense of a clause be doubtful, the contemporaneous understanding is material. In strictness, -the words may mean as contended by defendant, but the context seems to make it clear that the true sense of the clause is a prohibition of a new debt, or increase of existing debt, exceeding two per centum of the assessed valuation, without a public vote. Where the debt is less than seven per centum, it was not intended that public officers of municipalities should be deprived of power to make immediate improvements and repairs of public property, which might become necessary, provided they keep within the limit of two per centum of the valuation.</p>
