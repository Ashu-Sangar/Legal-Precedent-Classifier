It is the intention of the testator expressed in the will that is to govern ;^and this is to be judged of exclusively by the words of the instrument, as applied to the subject-matter and surrounding circumstances. Parol evidence to show what were the actual testamentary intentions, such as his declarations of what he had done or meant to do, is inadmissible ; but it is competent to determine which of several persons or things was intended under an equivocal description. In construing the autograph will of an illiterate man, the meaning of technical language may be disregarded, but no word which has a clear and definite object may be struck out. Technical words and phrases, although prima facie to be taken in their true sense, will not be construed so as to defeat any obvious general intention of the testator, since wills are often prepared by persons wholly unacquainted with the precise technical force of legal words and formulas. In seeking for the expressed intention of the testator, his words are to receive that construction and interpretation, which a long series of decisions has attached to them, unless it is very certain they were used in a different sense. These oft-repeated rules are recalled by the question now presented.</p>

Hence, the presumption that the testator employed them in their legal sense, will not be so easily overcome as if the will bore on its face evidence that it was drawn by an ignorant man. Here is no exhibition of such illiteracy as calls for a departure from the actual meaning of its words to a real or supposed popular sense, but rather such skill as induces belief that its words, which have been judicially defined, were understandingly employed.</p>

In unmistakable phrase, he turned the debt into a gift to be valued at the date of the note. The word advancement occurs nowhere else in the will, nor is there anything to show it was not used in,its legal sense. The advancement is directed to be valued and appraised at its full amount, as assets for distribution, and to be deducted from her share. Of what date shall it be valued ? Giving every word its proper meaning, at'the date of the gift. Its full amount is the face of the note without interest. To l&lt; be valued and appraised ” has no significance as showing inclusion or exclusion of interest; for even if the note were a debt, mere appraisement means its amount either with or without interest, according to the contract. A debt on interest by contract or overdue, converted into an advancement and directed to be appraised as part of the assets, is taken without interest unless otherwise expressed.
