On July 27th 1872, White entered judgment on the note given for this loan. After their property had been sold by the sheriff, White assigned to Morss one-half of the judgment entered, under a stipulation that White’s part of the judgment was to be paid out of the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale, and if anything remained it was to apply on that part of the judgment assigned to Morss. Under the auditor’s report, Morss received $105.57, and at another time about $101. The rest of the judgment, $1250.20, remained <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>'unpaid.

When these notes were bought the firm was greatly involved, and they were sold without the knowledge of Decker, who had purchased Halstead’s interest in the firm.

J., inter alia, said: “ Hartley claims he purchased of Halstead, about December 2d 1872, notes and judgments owned by Decker &amp; Halstead, amounting to $2050, and paid him therefor $753, of which $35.21 was a debt held against them, and the rest was in notes he held against Halstead alone, except $225, which he .paid on a note one Stewart had against Halstead. He swears that he considered many of these notes almost or entirely worthless, but that the purchase was made with the knowledge and express consent of Decker. This Decker denies <em>in toto, </em>except as to the Gifford note, as you-will recollect his evidence in regard to that in connection with Mrs. Gifford’s evidence. The plaintiff claims to recover the amount yet unpaid on his judgment against Decker &amp; Hal-stead, $1250.20,. if the jury find the notes in the possession of Hartley are of that value. If not of so great value, then to recover an amount equal to their value. He bases his right to recover on the ground that the transfer of the notes assigned to Hartley was fraudulently made, the fraudulent purpose being to pay the individual debts held against Halstead out of the firm property, and to prevent the same from being applied to firm debts. If the jury find the transfer was fraudulent, and was made for the purpose stated, and Hartley, colluding with Halstead, or with Decker &amp; Halstead, obtained the notes, &amp;c., knowing they were the property of the firm, it was void, and the plaintiff may recover whatever they were worth. This for the reason Hartley acquired no title as against the creditors of Decker &amp; Halstead. 'They may follow and seize them in' his hands as firm property. Or, if the jury find that Hartley obtained the notes and judgments from Halstead in payment of the debts against Halstead, without the knowledge or consent of Decker, knowing -them to be firm property, the plaintiff may recover their value. This for the <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>reason that by the action of Halstead the firm were not deprived of their title to this property, and could maintain suit therefor; this being the fact, the creditors of Decker Halstead could reach and hold them upon attachment-execution.</p>

For all the notes and judgments which Hartley received from Halstead he paid Halstead $493.53 by delivering to him his notes and accounts he held against Halstead individually, and also paid a note of about $225, which one Stewart held against Halstead. He also applied payment of a debt he had against Decker &amp; Halstead of $35.21, making a total of $753.74.
