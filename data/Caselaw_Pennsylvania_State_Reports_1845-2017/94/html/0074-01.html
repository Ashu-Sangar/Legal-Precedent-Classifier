This alias subpoena was also returned <em>non est inventus </em>by the sheriff, and publication was made for four weeks in July 1869,' notifying the respondent to appear at September Term 1869. On the 7th of June 1869, the court appointed an examiner to take depositions ex parte libellant and report the same to the court to September Term 1869.

When these petitions were presented and the rule prayed for, the counsel for the respondent claimed that the decree of divorce was void for want of jurisdiction; that it was not justified by the depositions ex parte libellant, she not having proved that she was a citizen of Pennsylvania or had resided therein for one year previous to filing her libel.</p>
