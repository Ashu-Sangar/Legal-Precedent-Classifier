Hamer from the decree of the court distributing the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale of the real estate of Tobias Bickel. Before the auditor, John H. Weiss, Esq., the fund arising from the sale was claimed by the holders of two judgments, one' in favor of the Lykens Valley Bank for $9000, on bond and warrant entered March 12th 1873, and one in favor of Ilarner, the appellant, for $3000, on bond and warrant entered August 80th 1875. The auditor found that the judgment of the bank was given to secure existing and proposed discounts. On May 1st 1875, the <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>Lykens Valley Bank was succeeded by the First National Bank of Millersburg, and the unpaid notes of the former bank were transferred to the national bank, and at maturity these notes were replaced by others and the old notes surrendered.</p>

After several conferences, it was arranged between the board of directors of the national bank and Bickel that the latter should give a new bond to the national bank in the sum of $9000, and should be credited on his indebtedness with seventeen shares of the capital stock of the said national bank at the price he paid for it, viz., $115 per share.</p>

Term 1875. Bickel was previously indebted to Harner in the sum o-f $560, for which the latter held the former’s note. Bickel desired to borrow more money from Harner, but the latter declined the loan of any further sum, because of the judgment which the Lykens Valley Bank held against him. Bickel there told him that this judgment would be satisfied. On the day of the date of the judgment, Harner gave Bickel his note in the sum of $2240, which, with the sum of $560 already due from Bickel to him, made up the sum of $3000, the amount of the judgment. He agreed to advance the balance of the money as soon as the bank judgment should be satisfied. He advanced no money to Bickel until he ascertained from the prothonotary that the judgment of the Lykens Valley Bank was satisfied, and, finally, did advance and pay the amount of his note $2240, with interest, when he learned satisfaction was entered. Harner made no inquiry of the bank as to whether the judgment would be satisfied, nor by what authority it was satisfied. He-knew it was not satisfied when he took, nor when he entered of record his own judgment. He did not see (for he made no search), that the First National Bank had entered their judgment against Bickel, and he said that if he had noticed this judgment, he would not have given any money, unless he had previously asked the officers of the bank. He did not acquaint the officers of the national bank at any time with the fact that he had not given any money to Bickel at the time he obtained the judgment against him. He said that his judgment was the first, and, therefore, began to advance the money to Bickel.</p>

D. Harner or other creditors whose claims can be shown to intervene between the time of entering satisfaction and the application to have the judgment satisfied, and the decision neither to prejudice nor benefit his or their claims, and with leave to the plaintiff to issue execution. Thus the judgment given by Bickel to the First Lykens Valley Bank for $9000 on the 22d of August 1871, and kept in their safe until March 12th 1873, and then entered of record, was satisfied September 30th 1875.

It was the least possible hardship to require of him the exercise of ordinary diligence, both as to search and inquiry, before he made advances, in order to be protected against an unauthorized satisfaction. In order, therefore, to enable Harner to claim any superior right, it was incumbent upon him to ascertain by what authority the judgment of the Lykens Valley Bank was satisfied, and failing in this, he has no standing as a prior claimant upon the fund. Equity will not permit a claim to be predicated upon laches.”</p>

This was requiring him to do an impossible thing, because there was not a scintilla of evidence to show that Harner knew, or had even had an intimation, that the national bank claimed any interest in the judgment until long after he had loaned money to Bickel. He obtained the prothonotary’s statement that the judgment was satisfied. He looked at the docket and saw for himself that the judgment was satisfied. The record showed that the judgment was in favor of a partnership. The authority for the entry of satisfaction was the original certificate of the judgment, with direction to satisfy endorsed thereon, and signed by Brubaker, one of the partners. Harner knew that ,one partner had authority to satisfy the partnership judgment, and that the signature of Brubaker, the partner, was genuine.

Thus, when he took and entered his judgment and gave his. note, August 30th 1879, the lien of the first $9000 judgment of the bank was in full force, standing untampered with upon the record. Again, when he advanced the money on this judgment, October 11th 1875, and thereafter, the lien of the second $9000 judgment held by the bank was in full force, and patent upon the record. Hence, when he took the judgment and gave his note, he had full notice of a prior lien; and when he actually paid the money he had the same.</p>

This being so, he could not gain priority over it, by virtue of the fact that it was afterwards, without the knowledge or consent of the appellee, marked satisfied on the record. This would be, not to commit a fraud himself, but to take advantage of the fraud of another.</p>

Hence, if his lien is to date from the time the advances were actually made, they were made subject to the lien of this second judgment, and then the principle also referred to in Taylor <em>v. </em>Cornelius, 10 P.

Smith 196, as settled by Ter Hoven <em>v. </em>Kerns, 2 Barr 96, and Bank of Montgomery County’s Appeal, 12 Casey 170, will apply, that where a lien is taken to secure future advances, but the lien creditor is under no contract to make the advances, the lien dates from the actual advance of the money.</p>

Prima facie, therefore, he, as agent of this association, had full power either to assign or satisfy this judgment: Dubois’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20231" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Wright 231">2 Wright 231</a>. Harner’s judgment, in amount $3000, was entered on the 30th of August 1875, and <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>had been executed in September 1874. The consideration, therefor, was an account owing by Bickel to Harner, amounting to $560, and Harner’s note for $2250, payable as. soon as payment might be required after the Lykens Valley Bank judgment should be satisfied, but not before. This note, as appears from the audit- or’s report, was fully paid, according to the agreement of the parties, though not until after the 11th of September 1875, the date of the entry of the appellee’s judgment. This latter circumstance, however, is of no account, since Harner’s note and previous account were sufficient consideration for his judgment: Moroney’s Appeal, 12 Harris 872. Now, as soon as the judgment of the Lykens Valley Bank was satisfied that of Harner stood first, and the appellee, finding the lien of its judgment thus outranked, made application to have the satisfaction, just spoken of, taken off, on the ground that that judgment belonged to it as the successor - to the rights and obligations of the former Lykens Valley organization. To this proceeding Harner could not lawfully object; that was a matter for the parties themselves; they, without the court’s interposition, could have taken off this satisfaction, but whether taken off by themselves or by the court, the status of Bickel’s judgment was not affected thereby. As to him, the satisfaction remained, and it should so have been treated by the court below. The auditor, singularly enough, fell into the error of supposing it to be Harner’s duty to make inquiry of the Eirst National Bank, the appellee, as to its claims to the old judgment, but as that bank had, in fact, no assignment of that judgment marked on the'record,it was certainly not Harner’s duty to make inquiries about secret equities of which he had no knowledge. There was the satisfaction regularly marked upon the docket, and so marked by the authority of one who, prima facie, had full power so to do. This was all Harner was required to look to; it was not his business to inquire about rights and equities to which he was not a party and of which he had no knowledge: Springfield Building and Loan Association’s Appeal, MS. If the appellee desired to give notice' of its rights, and put the old judgment beyond the power of the partners of the original association, it should have taken an assignment and put that assignment on the docket. The duty rested -with it to see to its own judgment, that it was properly presented on the record, and failing in this, it must bear the consequences of its own neglect; it cannot cast them upon one who is in no default: Ridgway, Budd &amp; Co.’s Appeal, 3 Harris 177. It is clear, therefore, that Harner’s right to the money, now in the court below for distribution, is superior to that of the appellee, and that the decree of the court below was erroneous.</p>
    <p id="b496-6" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[443,2301,994,170]]]'>The decree of the court below is now reversed and vacated, at the costs of appellee, and a re-distribution is ordered according to the principles stated in the above opinion.</p>
