It was sent to the latter with the price marked upon it, \u201c one hundred dollars, if satisfactory.\u201d It was not satisfactory, and was returned to the plaintiff. The plaintiff then sent the defendant No. 2 of the series, and, on Oct. 1, 1889, defendant wrote to plaintiff, that \u201c the primers are good, but I do not care to pay the price you name. Your first offer is $100 for the series; your favor of the 27th names $200; I am afraid, by the time the series are finished, the price would be up in the thousands.\u201d We need not refer at length to the correspondence between the parties.

    "head_matter": "Powers, Appellant, v. Curtis.\nContract \u2014 Evidence.\nDefendant wrote to plaintiff stating that he would like to have him prepare some advertising leaflets. Plaintiff prepared a leaflet and sent it to defendant with the price marked upon it \u201c one hundred dollars, if satisfactory.\u201d It was not satisfactory and was returned to plaintiff, who then sent the second leaflet of the series with a letter in which he said: \u201cI put down in my book $200 against you, but I\u2019ll wipe it all out if I cant suit you.\u201d Defendant then replied, \u201c the primers are good, but I do not care to pay the price you name, your first offer is $100 for' the series; your favor of the 27th names $200; I am afraid by the time the series are finished the price would be up in the thousands.\u201d Held, that the evidence did not disclose a contract, or the consent of two minds to a proposition.\nArgued Jan. 18, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 67, Jan. T., 1892, by plaintiff, J. E. Powers, from judgment of nonsuit in favor of defendant, Cyrus H. K. Curtis, by C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1889, No. 110.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterreti, Green, Williams, McCollum:, Mitchell and Heydrick, JJ.\nAssumpsit for work and labor done.\nAt the trial before Reed, J., it appeared that the defendant wrote to the plaintiff requesting him to prepare a series of leaflets or primers as an advertisement of the Ladies Home Journal of which the defendant was proprietor. Plaintiff prepared a leaflet and sent it to defendant with the price marked upon it, \u201c one hundred dollars, if satisfactory.\u201d Defendant was not satisfied with it and returned it to the plaintiff, who then sent the second leaflet of the series with a letter in which he said: \u201c I put down in my book $200 against you, but I\u2019ll wipe it all out if I can\u2019t suit you.\u201d Defendant then sent the following letter:\n\u201c The primers are good, but I do not care to pay the price you name. Your first offer is for one hundred dollars for the series ; your favor of the 27th names two hundred dollars : I am afraid that by the time that the series are finished the price would be up in the thousands. In thinking this matter over I have felt that I would not care to pay even a hundred dollars. I do not think it really necessary to go to that expense. In the first place I am having as much advertising come to me as I can possibly accommodate, which is of course well enough for the present; furthermore, what there is to tell, I believe I can do myself, as I shall be relieved hereafter of a great deal of work in other departments.\u201d\nThe defendant having refused to pay plaintiff for services in preparing these two leaflets, suit was brought.\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.\nError assigned was the refusal to take off nonsuit.\nEoraee L. Qheyney., N. BuBois Miller and Biddle $ Ward with him, for appellant,\ncited Singerly v. Thayer, 108 Pa. 291; Krum v. Mersher, 116 Pa. 17; Seeley v. Welles, 120 Pa. 69 ; Furniture Co. v. Warsaw School District, 130 Pa. 76 ; Howard v. Smedley, 140 Pa. 81.\nJ. Martin Rommel, James M. West with him, for appellee,\ncited Howard v. Smedley, 140 Pa. 81.\nFebruary 1, 1892."
