        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Sterrett,\nOne of the points made by the defendants, in their affidavit of defence, is, that plaintiff\u2019s statement, under the act of May 25, 1887, is signed by \u201c H. W. Bland, attorney for plaintiffs,\u201d and was filed of record \u201c on September 17, 1891, at about 12 o\u2019clock, m., or thereafter; \u201d that said H. W. Bland is the same person who, on September 16, 1891, was duly appointed and commissioned as judge of the orphans\u2019 court of Berks county, and afterwards, \u201c on said September 17,1891, at the hour of 11 o\u2019clock, A. M., or earlier,\u201d was duly sworn into said office. The affidavit then, argumentatively, concludes thus :\n\u201c Defendants, therefore, aver that plaintiffs\u2019 statement, etc., bo, as aforesaid, filed is - not in accordance with the act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271, and is not signed by said plaintiffs or their attorney, as is required by said act, and that, therefore, they, the said defendants are not required to further reply thereto by affidavit.\u201d\nIt cannot be doubted that, up to the time that Mr. Bland took the oath of office, and thus assumed the duties thereof, he was as fully competent as any other attorney at law to prepare plaintiffs\u2019 statement, and sign the same as their attorney. The fact that he was duly appointed and commissioned the day before did not disqualify him from acting as attorney for plaintiffs or any one else. His right \u201c to practice as an attorney and counselor at law \u201d did not cease until he actually assumed the judicial office by taking the prescribed oath. It is not averred in the affidavit of defence that he either prepared or signed the statement afterwards; nor are its averments even susceptible of any such inference. Signing the statement was the official act. If the defendants meant to say that Mr. Bland did that, after his authority to act as attorney ceased, it would have been an easy matter to have averred the fact in unequivocal language ; but they have not done so. It matters little when the statement was filed, whether before or after Mr. Bland assumed the judicial office.\nWe cannot assent to the learned judge\u2019s suggestion, that the word \u201c attorney,\u201d as employed in the act, means \u201c attorney in fact \u201d as well as \u201c attorney at law.\u201d We have no doubt it was intended to be understood in the latter sense only. While it is not improbable that the draftsmen of the act may have had a vague idea of making the practice of the law easy, by abolishing time-honored distinctions, etc., it is scarcely possible that he intended to open wide the door of the profession, so that every layman might enter and participate in the preparation of pleadings.\nThe conclusion reached by the court below was that the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 statement was unsuccessfully assailed; and in that we agree. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Kelly v. Herb et al. Appellants.\nPleading \u2014 Signing of statement by attorney \u2014 Act of May 25, 1887.\nUnder the act of May 25, 1887, a statement, signed by an attorney at law on the day he was sworn in as judge of the orphans\u2019 court and on the day after he was appointed and commissioned, is valid, although the statement was not filed until after the attorney took the oath of office as judge. In such a case the signing of the statement, not the filing, was the official act.\nIt seems that the word \u201c attorney,\u201d as used in the act of May 25, 1887, means attorney at law and not attorney in fact.\nArgued Feb. 3, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 312, Jan. T., 1892, by defendants, Herb & Greenhoff, from judgment of C. P. Berks Co., Oct.
