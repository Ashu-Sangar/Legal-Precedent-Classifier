        "text": "Per Curiam,\nFor reasons given in its opinion filed October 20, 1890, the court below was clearly right in setting aside the levy on defendant\u2019s real estate, and all subsequent proceedings thereunder.\nBefore plaintiff\u2019s execution was issued, the lien of their judgment, as to purchasers and subsequent judgment creditors, had expired; and no judgment of revival was obtained on their scire facias until October 20, 1890. In the meantime, viz., July 30, 1890, Jeremiah Miller obtained judgment against defendant, and, of course, his lien antedated that of the plaintiffs on their scire facias to revive etc.\nThe act of May 19,1887, P. L. 132, provides that, from and after its passage, \u201c execution may issue upon any judgment of record in any of the courts of this commonwealth, notwithstanding such judgment may have lost its lien upon real estate, without a previous writ of scire facias to revive the same: Pro-; vided, however, that such execution shall be confined or restricted to the personal property only of the debtor, and that such execution shall not issue after the lapse of twenty years from the maturity of the judgment.\u201d\nThe order complained of did not interfere with any lien the plaintiffs may have had on the defendant\u2019s personal property by virtue of their execution. It was only the levy and proceedings had thereunder, so far as the same relates to the real estate of defendant, that was vacated and set aside by the order.\nThe specifications are not sustained.\nThe order of the court is affirmed, with costs to be paid by appellants.",

    "head_matter": "Miller, Appellant, v. Miller. (1)\nExecution \u2014 Judgment\u2014Bevival\u2014Act of May 19, 1887.\nUnder the act of May 19, 1887, P. L. 182, real estate cannot be taken in execution under a judgment more than five years old prior to a revival of such judgment. The issuing of a sei. fa. on the same day as the fi. fa. will not answer the requirements of the act.\nArgued March 3, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 302, Jan. T., 1892, by Wm. Miller et al., administrators of Mahlon Miller, from an order of C. P. Berks Co., Aug. T., 1890, No. 15, setting aside fi. fa. so far as same related to real estate.\nBefore Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nProm the record it appeared that on May 12,1885, judgment was entered in favor of Mahlon Miller against Robert Miller on \u00e1 judgment note containing a release of all errors and a waiver of \u201c inquisition and extension before any levy on real estate.\u201d On July 2,1890, a sei. fa. to reverse the judgment was issued, and on the same day a fi. fa. was issued. On Aug. 13, 1890, defendant obtained a rule to set aside the levy and pro? ceedings under the fi. fa., so far as they related to real estate. On July 30,1890, Jeremiah Miller obtained.a judgment against defendant. On Oct. 20, 1890, judgment was obtained on the sci. fa. On Oct. 20, 1890, Endlich, J., filed the following opinion:\n\u201c Judgment was entered on May 12, 1885, against the defendant, to No. 9, May term, 1885, J. D., and on July 2, 1890, execution was issued thereon to No. 15, August term, 1890, E. D., under which on August 9, 1890, defendant\u2019s real estate was condemned. On August 13, 1890, defendants obtained a rule upon plaintiffs to show cause why the fi. fa-., levy and proceedings had thereunder, so far as the same related to his real estate, should not be vacated and set aside. It is admitted that between the date of the entry of the .judgment and that of issuing of the fi. fa. no proceedings were, instituted to revive or continue the lien of the judgment, and no sci. fa. issued to show cause why execution' should not issue, but that at the time of the issuing of the execution a sei., fa. was also issued for both these purposes.\n\u201c The act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 761, provides, in section 1, that execution of anj^ judgment may be had at any time within a year and a day from the first day of the term at which it was rendered, or, in case of a stay of execution, from the expiration of such stay: 1 Purd. Dig., p. 739, pi. 1. The second section declares that after the expiration of the period aforesaid, no execution shall be issued upon any judgment unless the defendant, etc., shall first be warned by writ of sci. fa. to show cause why execution shall not issue such judgment: Ibid., pi. 3.\n\u201c The act of April 16,1845, section 4, P. L. 538, Purd. Dig., supra, pi. 2, however, provides that it shall not be deemed error to issue any writ of execution on..a judgment which has not been revived within a year and a day, if the same have been revived within five years. And the act of May 19,1887, P. L. 132, authorizes the issuing of executions upon any judgment of record without a previous writ of sci. fa. to revive, provided: (1) That such execution be restrained to the personal property of the debtor. (2) That it be issued within twentjr years from the maturity of the judgment, and (3) that a sci. fa. to revive be issued simultaneously with it, the showing of a legal defence upon which shall authorize the court to stay execution, etc.\n\u201c It follows that from the mere reading of the plain language of these statutes that the plaintiffs execution cannot be good so far as it attempts to touch his realty. It is not disputed that as between the judgment debtor and creditor the lien of the judgment continues, notwithstanding the lapse of more than five years from entry without revival. Brown\u2019s Appeal, 91 Pa. 485. But in such cases the. law inhibits the enforcement of that lien by execution upon the debtor\u2019s real estate until he shall \u2018 first \u2019 have had a day in court to show cause why execution should not issue. That the issuing of a sci. fa. simultaneously with that of execution will not answer this requirement, is too clear to warrant discussion: See Marx v. Goldsmith, 14 W. N. C. 173; Harmony B. Assn. v. Berger, Id., 499. That and why the same requirement does not apply to attachment execution was shown in an opinion of the president judge in Corney v. Goodman, C. P. Berks Co., No. 13, November term, 1888, E. D.\n\u201c The rule to show cause is made absolute.\u201d\nMrrors assigned were (1) in making absolute the rule; (2)- in setting aside the inquisition ; and (B) in not discharging the rule.\nJ). M. Schroeder for appellants.\nBy the fi. fa. levy of July 2, 1890, after separation of the five years\u2019 statutory lien, the appellants acquired a \u201c distinct and independent lien by execution,\u201d which had priority to the judgment of Jeremiah Miller: Stauffer v. Commissioners, 1 Watts, 300; Packer\u2019s Ap., 6 Pa. 277; Brown\u2019s Ap., 91 Pa. 487; Lewis v. Morgan, 11 S. & R. 236; McCahan v. Elliott, 103 Pa. 635; Riland v. Eckert, 23 Pa. 215 ; Stephen\u2019s Ap., 38 Pa. 15.\nThe sci. fa. and fi. fa. may be issued at the same time: Brewster\u2019s Practice, 196.\nMiller, defendant, waived her rights under any execution: Dunlop v. Speer, 3 Binn. 169; White v. Crawford, 84 Pa. 436; Overton v. Tozer, 7 Watts, 331; Hope v. Everhart, 70 Pa. 231.\nStephen M. Meredith and Louis Richards, for appellee, were not heard.\nMarch 21, 1892."
