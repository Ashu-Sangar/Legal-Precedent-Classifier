It was provided: \u201c Should a judgment be recovered in said action the said Quigley covenants to pay the same.\u201d On the same day that the agreement between McCown and Quigley was executed, Muldoon executed an agreement by which he covenanted \u201cthat the amount which may be due to McCown by Quigley under the foregoing agreement will be paid by him to the extent of $2,500.\u201d McCown recovered judgment against Quigley, who appealed the case to the Supreme Court. On January 25, 1892, the judgment was affirmed. Prior to this date McCown recovered a judgment against Muldoon for $2,500. Muldoon appealed, claiming that he was not liable until the judgment against Quigley was disposed of in the Supreme Court. On January 26, 1892, Muldoon\u2019s appeal was called for argument.

J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Heydriok, JJ.\nAssumpsit on a contract under seal. From the plaintiff\u2019s statement it appeared that a dispute having arisen between plaintiffs and their partner James J. Quigley, as to firm goods taken by Quigley and not accounted for, an agreement in writing and under seal was entered into on October 13, 1890, by which it was agreed that a suit should be brought by the plaintiffs against Quigley to determine the value of the goods taken. The agreement provided as follows: \u201c.Should a judgment be recovered in said action the said James J. Quigley covenants to pay the same subject to a credit however as hereinafter set out. Frank C. McCown and John A. McCown agree to allow the said James J. Quigley (being the agreed value of his interest in the said firm) the sum of Two Thousand Dollars which said sum shall go in reduction of any judgment obtained in the above mentioned suit.\u201d\nOn the same day the defendant executed the following contract :\n\u201c I John Muldoon covenant that the amount which may be due to Frank C. McCown and John A. McCown by James J.

After the judgment in the common pleas was rendered, demand was made on Muldoon for payment of $2,500, and on his refusal to pay it this suit was brought. Muldoon in his .affidavit of defence averred that the plaintiffs had no right to bring any action against him pending Quigley\u2019s appeal to the Supreme Court.\nThe court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nError assigned was the order of the court.\nFrancis E. Garrett, E. Cooper Shapley and William Gorman with him, for appellant.\nR. C. McMurtrie, for appellee, was not heard.\nJanuary 26, 1892,"
