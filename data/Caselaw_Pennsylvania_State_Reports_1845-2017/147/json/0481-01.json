        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Sterrett,\nArt. ix, \u00a7 1, of the constitution, declares, \u201c All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects, .... but the general assembly may, by general laws, exempt from taxation public property used for public purposes, actual places of religious worship,\u201d etc. Pursuant to this authority, the act of May 14, 1874, exempts from taxation \u201c All churches, meeting-houses and other regular places of stated worship,\u201d with the necessary grounds thereto annexed. The fact that a building has been erected, or is in course of erection, for the purpose of religious worship, does not, without more, bring the property within the exemption. It must be a regular- place of stated worship, or, in the language of the organic law, \u201c an actual place of religious worship : \u201d Mullen v. Commissioners of Erie County, 85 Pa. 288. As was said in that case, it is clear, \u201cfrom both the constitution and the law,\u201d that \u201c it is the use, not the building, which defines the exemption.\u201d It follows, therefore, that on April 23, 1890, when the \u201c Church of the Messiah \u201d ceased to be used as a place of religious worship, its exemption from taxation, ipso facto, ceased, and the property forthwith became subject to taxation as fully as though it had never been exempted. This appears to have been conceded by the trustees of the church.\nFor the year 1890, as it had been before, the property was listed, valued and returned by the proper assessors, but they noted it as \u201c exempt,\u201d because at the time it was assessed and returned it was in actual use as a regular place of stated worship. For the same reason the tax was not then extended and placed on the list of taxes to be collected by the receiver; but, when the board of revision was advised that the use which entitled the property to exemption had ceased, it was considered subject to taxation, and added-to-the receiver\u2019s list, charged with a just proportion of taxes, corresponding to the unexpired fraction of the current year. On May 2, 1890, the trustees of the church were duly notified that their property had been listed \u201c as taxable, at a valuation of $33,000.\u201d\nIf the trustees considered themselves aggrieved by the official action of-the board, their only remedy was by appeal from its decision ; but no complaint was made, no appeal was taken, and the decision became final and conclusive, not only as to the owners, but also as to those claiming under them by subsequent conveyance. The duty of taxing-officers is quasi judicial; and it is well settled that, when the general power to assess, exists, the remedy for illegal taxation is by appeal; if none be given, neither the common pleas nor this court can reverse the judgment of the taxing officers. On the other hand, if a specific remedy is provided, it must be pursued: Hughes v. Kline, 30 Pa. 227; Clinton School District\u2019s Ap., 56 Pa. 315; Stewart v. Maple, 70 Pa. 222; Van Nort\u2019s Ap., 121 Pa. 118.\nIt is contended that the action of the board of revision was illegal. We do not think so. On the contrary, we are of opinion that what was done was within the scope of the general powers delegated to the board. Its duty is to see that every parcel of real estate is assessed, and, when not legally exempt from taxation, charged with its due proportion of the public burdens. The board knew the property had ceased to be exempt in April, 1890 ; and it was rightly added to the list then in the hands of the receiver.\nAnother sufficient answer to appellant\u2019s contention is, that he has no equity on which to ground the relief prayed for, or any other form of relief. He acquired title to the property after it ceased to be exempt, and after it was charged with taxes imposed by the board of revision, from whose official act, whether right or wrong, no appeal was taken. More than that, in accordance with the custom, which, by common consent, has acquired the force of law in this city and county, he took title subject to the payment of taxes proportionate to the unexpired fraction of the current year. There is' no evidence tending to show that his purchase was not within the general rule. What equity therefore has he to acquire and enjoy property, for nearly two thirds of the year, without contributing in the shape of taxes his just share of the public burdens? The effect of relieving him would be to increase the burdens of other taxpayers, contrary to the principle that underlies our system of taxation, viz.: that every one shall contribute his just proportion of the public expenses.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by appellant.",

If no appeal is taken, the decision becomes final and conclusive, not only as to the owners, but also as to those claiming under'them by subsequent conveyance'.\nArgued Jan. 18, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 126, July T., 1891, by plaintiff, Clarence B. Moore, from decree of C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1890, No. 105, dismissing bill in equity against John Taylor, receiver of taxes.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams,-McCollum, Mitchell and HeyDRICK, JJ.\nBill in equity to prevent the levying and collection of taxes.\nThe bill averred that the Church of the Messiah, a Universalist Church, became seized in 1854 of premises 1317 and 1319 Locust street, Philadelphia. That a church was erected on said property and services held therein until April 23,1890, when the structure was abandoned as a church.\nThat for the year 1890 the property was not returned for taxation by the assessors, it being occupied as a church, and was thereby exempt under the act of May 14,1874, sec. 1. That on May 2,1890, without authority of law or return by the assessors of the district, the board of revision of taxes added said property as taxable at a valuation, for 1890, of $33,000, returned the same to the receiver of taxes with instructions to collect the said tax, and sent to the trustees of the church the following letter:\n\u201c Philadelphia, May 2, 1890.\n\u201c Gentlemen :\u2014\n\u201c The property N. E. cor. Juniper and Locust streets, Eighth Ward, has this day been added as taxable, at a valuation, for 1890, of $33,000. The bill can be procured in the Department of the Register of Taxes.\n\u201c Yery Respectfully,\n\u201c W. H. Loughlin, Clerk.\u201d\nThat on said daj' the receiver of taxes added said property to his list, and-rendered a bill to the said church for taxes for the year 1890, against property 1317 and 1319 Locust street, 75 feet by 100 feet, valuation $33,000, city tax, $610.50. That on June 5, 1890, said church conveyed said property with the church edifice thereon to plaintiff. That by said assessment plaintiff's property would be liable to levy and sale, and he would be subject to great and irremediable loss.\nThe bill prayed: \u2014 (1) An injunction restraining defendants from levying and coll\u00e9cting said tax upon said property; (2) a decree that said property was not liable to a tax for the year 1890; (3) general relief.\nThe answer admitted in the main averments of the bill, but denied that the property was not returned for the year 1890, or in prior years by the assessors. That it was returned along with all other property in that district, but as it was occupied as a church the assessors marked it on the books \u201c exempt.\u201d The return of the assessors fixed a valuation on the said property for each year. Being marked \u201c exempt \u201d it was not placed'on the books of the receiver of taxes when these books were made up for 1890.\nThe case having been heard on bill and answer, the court entered a decree dismissing the bill.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nC.
