        "text": "Pee Curiam,\nThe matters referred to in the first three specifications were properly admitted in evidence. Their discussion is unnecessary.\nThe only other specification is, that the learned judge erred in instructing the jury to find a verdict for the defendant. The action below was a scire facias sur municipal claim for paving Centre street, in the 22d ward of the city of Philadelphia. The said street, from Main street to the end of defendant\u2019s property, is laid down on the authorized city plans as a street thirty feet wide. The ordinance of Oct. 12, 1885, under the provisions of which the said paving was alleged to have been done, provided that the said Centre street should be first dedicated or properly opened. This is the precise language of the ordinance. It does not appear that the said street, from Main street to the end of the defendant\u2019s property, lias ever been opened. The ordinance of May 8, 1855, provides, \u201cthat hereafter no street shall be accepted for public use of a less width than thirty feet.\u201d We do not understand this ordinance to have been repealed. Centre street, where it touches defendant\u2019s property, is of a less width than thirty feet, and does not appear to have been accepted for public use by the city of Philadelphia. .The city ordinance only authorized the paving of the street after it should have been dedicated or properly opened. These prerequisites not having been complied with, we are unable to see any authority for paving it at the expense of the abutting property owners. As there does not appear to have been any disputed questions of fact in the case, we are of opinion that the learned judge below was right in directing a verdict for the defendant.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Ball.\nPaving \u2014 Dedication of streets \u2014 Ordinance.\nWhere a city ordinance provides that \u201cno street shall be accepted for public use of a less width than thirty feet,\u201d and a subsequent ordinance authorizes the paving of a certain street, provided that it shall \u201c be first dedicated or properly opened,\u201d and it appears that the street in question, though of a width of thirty feet on the city plan, is opened of a less width and has not been accepted for public use, the city cannot recover for paving the street.\nArgued Jan. 6, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 301, Jan. T., 1891, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Dec. T., 1886, No. 94, M. L. D., on verdict for defendant.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Stebbett, Gbeen, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Heydbick, JJ.\nScire facias sur municipal claim by the city of Philadelphia to the use of David McMahon against Susanna T. Ball.\nAt the trial before Bbeg-y, J., the facts appeared as follows: Defendant\u2019s property, against which lien was filed, abuts on Centre street. This street has been used by the public for thirty or forty years ; it is of unequal width opposite defendant\u2019s property, being from eighteen to twenty-one feet wide.\nOn May 3,1855, councils passed an ordinance declaring that they would not accept the dedication of any street of less width than thirty feet.\nIn the same year, a plan of the locality was confirmed by the court of quarter sessions, upon which this street appears of the width of thirty feet.\nIii October, 1885, an ordinance was passed, directing the paving of Centre street: \u201c Provided said street shall be first dedicated or properly opened.\u201d\nThe street has never been opened to conform to the lines of the confirmed plan of the city, viz., to make it throughout a thirty-foot street.\nDefendant offered in evidence city plan showing Centre street from Main street to Evans street. Objected to, objection overruled, exception. [1]\nDefendant offered in evidence ordinance of May 3, 1855. Objected to, objection overruled, exception. [2]\nDefendant offered in evidence deed of defendant\u2019s property dated March 31, 1866. Objected to, objection overruled, exception. [3]\nThe court instructed the jury to find for the defendant. Verdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1-3) the rulings on the evidence; (4) the charge of the court; and (5) the entry of judgment on the verdict.\nS. Davis Page, E. P. Allinson, Boies Penrose, and II. W. Page with him, for appellant. \u2014\nThe use of the ground by the public as a highway for forty years, was a dedication within the meaning of the proviso in the ordinance of 1885, and establishes the fact that the sti'eet had been dedicated by the owners and accepted by the public: Com. v. Cole, 26 Pa. 187; Mercer v. R. R. Co., 36 Pa. 99; P. F. W. & C. R. Co. v. Dunn, 56 Pa. 280.\nThe street having been accepted by the public user of forty years, its unequal width was no bar to the city\u2019s duty to pave it: Darlington v. Com., 41 Pa. 63.\nThe city would have been liable for injuries arising from want of repair to the street so used by the public.\nB. O. MoMurtie and Lewis D. Vail, for appellees, were not heard.\nJanuary 25, 1892."
