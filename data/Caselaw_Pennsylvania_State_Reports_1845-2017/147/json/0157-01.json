    "head_matter": "Foster, Appellant, v. Carson and Wife.\nJudgment \u2014 Opening of \u2014 Scire facias sur mortgage.\nThe Supreme Court will not review an order of the common pleas opening a judgment entered in default of an affidavit of defence, where the defendant avers in her petition that she was prevented by illness from appearing; that she never received notice of the assignment of the mortgage to the plaintiff, that she had paid nearly the whole of the amount of the mortgage to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and that only a small balance remained for which she tendered judgment.\nArgued Nov. 10, 1891.\nAppeal, No. 269, Oct. T., 1891, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., Dec. T., 1890, No. 853, opening a judgment entered in default of an affidavit of defence.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams and Mitchell, JJ.\nOn December 17, 1890, William Foster entered judgment against Robert J. Carson and Agnes J. Carson, his wife, on a scire facias sur mortgage in default of an affidavit of defence.\nOn December 20,1890, Agnes J. Carson presented a petition for a rule to open the judgment averring that she was sixty-three years of age and in poor health, and had deferred filing her affidavit of defence until the weather would permit h'er to go out with safety to her health, and that she was ignorant of the necessity of filing an affidavit of defence at once. In an affidavit of defence filed with the petition and made part of it, the petitioner further averred that the mortgage in suit for $1,500 had been given by her to Mary Speelman, who had assigned it to A. C. Jerrett; that she had paid Jerrett $1,800, leaving a balance due of $200 on account of the principal, that \u25a0she had no notice of the assignment from Jerrett to the plaintiff. The petitioner tendered judgment for the $200 due on account \u2022of the principal and also for the interest due.\nThe court granted the rule which it subsequently made absolute. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned, was the order of the court making the rule absolute.\nW. K. Jennings, with him W. S. Thomas, for appellant.\nL. L. Davis, for appellees.\nJanuary 4, 1892."
