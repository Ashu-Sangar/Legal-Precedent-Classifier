The plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim avers that his subscription to the stock of the Phila. & Sea Shore Ry. Co. was made upon the faith of the letter of the defendant to the plaintiff, dated Sept. 4, 1889. In this letter the defendant said: \u201c In consideration of your subscription of $5,000 to the stock of the proposed Phila. & Sea Shore Ry. Co., I agree that it is understood that the said road shall be completed to Cape May by Oct. 1, 1890, and, in default thereof, I agree that the money paid by you on said subscription shall be returned to you by the said company, or, in default thereof, I shall do it myself, at that time.\u201d\nThis was a contract of suretyship, based upon a sufficient consideration. It sometimes happens that the promoters of railways, and other enterprises, induce their friends to take stock therein, by holding out inducements like the foregoing, or others of a similar character. In such instances the consideration for the promise is the subscription by the promisee to stock which he did not want, in an enterprise in which he felt no particular interest. It is only just that a person who induces others to subscribe for stock under such circumstances should be held to his contract.\nJudgment affirmed.",

J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, Mc-Collum and Mitchell, JJ.\nAssumpsit by William C. Allison against Edward R. Wood. The plaintiff\u2019s statement set forth the contract quoted in the Supreme Court. The defendant filed an affidavit of defence in which he averred that the contract in writing, was a contract of guaranty and not of suretyship ; and that as the plaintiff had made no demand upon the railroad company, and had not shown that the company was in default, the defendant was not liable. The affidavit further averred that the contract was without consideration, \u201c and is and was nudum pactum.\u201d The court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.
