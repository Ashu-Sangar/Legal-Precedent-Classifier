The proceeding was one of those miserable shifts to which we were driven for want of the powers of a court of chancery. The statute (of June 16, 1836) on which the present proceeding is founded, directs that a suggestion of fraud be tried in a collateral issue to which the parties may be fabulous; but it seems to be forgotten that, as the whole is a chancery proceeding, the names <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>of the actual parties ought to appear as complainants and. defendants.’ For none but the parties to the issue take any benefit from the result, as was decided in Tomb’s Ap., <a href="/pa/9/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="960609" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0061-01">9 Pa. 61</a>, on the same judgment, and other cases hereinafter referred to; nor can the defendant avail himself of the result of an issue between his creditors: Ferree v.

It is not to be commended for simplicity; for it has all the hitches and entanglements of confusion, insomuch that judgments unimpeachable by the parties to them, have been opened on the allegation of collusion at the instance of creditors, and never closed against the defendants, who were entitled to no relief whatever.’ For, said he, in Donaldson v.

A careful reading of that case will show that what was decided is, that an allegation that a judgment is fraudulent and without bona fide consideration, and was confessed and is being used for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>other creditors, is a sufficient averment of material facts in dispute, and that it is not necessary to state in the affidavit the means by which the want of consideration is to be proved. That is to say, the applicant is not bound to give his evidence in his affidavit. It will be noticed also that it does not appear that the allegations of the petitioner for the issue were denied, but it does appear that the creditor whose judgment was disputed was not willing to contend in the Supreme Court, and hence the court had nothing to do but to grant the issue as of course.</p>

Ritter, 26 W. N. 188, to enable the court to determine whether an issue shall be granted; for it seems illogical to say that the court shall determine or adjudge a matter, and yet that it must grant an issue on the averments of the applicant, without regard to the denial of the other party, and in disregard of the evidence, and the test whether a verdict, if rendered in favor of the applicant, would be allowed to stand. If that is the meaning of the act the legislature has not been happy in the choice of words to express it. That it is not I will show by reference to the foundation of those cases in which it was decided that an issue is a matter of right on filing a written request. They were based on the act of April 14, 1827, sec. 2, 9 Smith’s Laws, 438, which provided that in the distribution of the moneys arising from sheriff’s sales, when the facts are disputed, the court, at the request in writing of any party in interest, shall direct an issue to try the same. This was substantially re-enacted by the act of 1836, before cited. But this positive right was modified by the act of 1846, before cited, which requires the applicant for an issue to set forth in his affidavit the nature and character of the facts in dispute, upon which the court shall determine (that is, decide or adjudge) Whether the issue shall be granted. It was upon these acts of 1827 and 1836 that the decisions favoring an absolute right to an issue were rendered, most of them prior to 1846, and some since, the latter entirely overlooking the change in the law made by the act of 1846.

Respect for the great and learned men who have said this forbids me from deciding it otherwise; but I may be permitted to say that it seems to be a statutory rather than a constitutional right, for it did not exist prior to the act of 1827. Chief Justice Gibson called an issue a chancery proceeding in Shulze’s Appeal, before cited. If there had been a court of equity in this state before 1836, when equity powers were conferred upon the courts, the right to relief would have been secured by bill in that court; aiid a verdict on an issue, if granted, would not have been binding on the chancellor, who might have decreed contrary to the finding thereon; he could have disregarded the verdict, as his conscience would not be bound by it: Johns v.

On this the plaintiff in the attacked judgment may file an affidavit denying the averments; but if he will not, the court should grant the issue as a matter of course. If the plaintiff files a denial, depositions should be taken, and on them the court will determine whether the issue shall be granted, subject to an appeal, if the issue be refused, as provided by the act of 1846. If a denial is filed and the applicant will not take depositions, the issue should be refused on the analogy of a bill and answer in equity, where the answer, if responsive, overcomes the bill, unless it is supported by evidence.

Both the defendants admit that the plaintiff was to receive legal interest, and one of them admits that a partnership was not mentioned, that is, formed, when the money was lent; but that is was to commence at the end of the year, or after a year’s trial.
