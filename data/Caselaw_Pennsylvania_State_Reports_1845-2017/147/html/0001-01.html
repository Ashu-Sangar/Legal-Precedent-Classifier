Why we could run a street down through the middle of that ravine, and lay off building lots on either side of the ravine; from the ravine down, we could lay off a street. There is a road or street from the ravine down to the ferry landing now. We could run a street off at about right angles to that road, down through the middle of it, and lay off building lots. ... Q. In laying out a road for this lower part of this property, what would you connect it with ? A. With this road. (Shows.) Q. You run it underneath the highway bridge ? A. Yes, sir; plenty of room. Q. And connect it with that? A. Yes, sir. Q. There would be no way of getting on to that highway bridge on this <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>property, without crossing the railroad on high ground to get on to the far edge of the bridge?

About one hundred feet beyond the railroad, you mean? A. No, sir; from the property.”</p>
