It is true that a plain violation of a restriction, the terms of which were not open to question, has been restrained even where no injury to the complainant was apparent, and where the parties could perhaps have been left to their common law remedy, but the Supreme Court, in indicating the rights of owners of restrictions, as questioned by the late Chief Justice Read, has never gone so far as to sustain the issuing of a mandatory injunction in the case of a covenant doubtful in its meaning, and in favor of a complainant who had proved no injury arising from the breach thereof, and who had been so backward in the assertion of his claim as to have well misled the possessor of the servient property.</p>

The case is not so clear as to justify a mandatory injunction. It is, at least, doubtful, whether the building itself is a violation of the restriction. The improvements complained of consist of a boat house, club house, and building alleged to be used as a carpenter shop. The latter, however, appears to have been used as a carpenter shop merely for repairing the boats belonging to the club, and, occasionally, the construction of a new one. The club house in question is certainly not a dwelling-house, but it is not clear that it does not come within the alternative phrase, a “ genteel cottage.”</p>
