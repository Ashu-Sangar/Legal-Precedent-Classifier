Brecht for the purpose of paying the rent, but that the latter had denied ownership of the premises. The defendant alleged in his paper-book that the copy of lease filed was not verified by affidavit, and the suggestion of breach of condition filed was defective. The court discharged the rule. Defendant appealed.</p>
