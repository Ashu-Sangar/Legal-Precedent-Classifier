In other words, the only warranty ever given to the plaintiff by any of the defendants was to the effect that he should be permitted to have the horse promptly examined by a veterinary to be chosen by him, that he should be obliged to pay if such veterinary should pronounce the horse sound, and that he should not be obliged to pay, but that the sale should be off if such veterinary so selected should pronounce the horse to be unsound. I deny that any warranty was ever given, or that any representations were ever made to the effect that the horse was sound, and that if after payment for him he should be found to be unsound, the money paid should be refunded. I aver that there was no right under the warranty given and the bargain made on the part of the purchaser to demand any further examination after the horse had once been pronounced sound.</p>
