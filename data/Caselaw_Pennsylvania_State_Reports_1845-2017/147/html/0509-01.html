J., it appeared that prior to August, 1887, there had been a series of robberies from the freight cars of the defendant at its yards in Philadelphia. Two detectives of the city police force discovered certain property in a pawn shop which they believed to have been stolen from the company. They reported their discovery to the officers of the company, and the goods were identified as a portion of the stolen property. Several arrests were made, and one of the arrested persons, an employee of the company, made a confession implicating the plaintiff, who was also an employee. An investigation was made, and the result of it was laid before the district attorney, who advised that the company had probable cause upon which it could proceed. An affidavit was made by a special police officer of the company in which George Mattson was mentioned as having stolen various articles from the defendant’s cars. Upon this affidavit a warrant was issued, and the plaintiff was arrested. At the hearing before the magistrate Madison was discharged.</p>

The discharge raised a presumption of want of probable cause, and from want of probable cause the jury were at liberty to infer malice. But <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>plaintiff had not yet shown any connection of the defendant with his arrest, and, to make out his case in that respect, he called Howell, and, in showing the authority of the defendant for the prosecution, this witness also showed the circumstances, which were, a series of robberies of the defendant’s cars in West Philadelphia for something over a year, the investigation first started bjr the police authorities of the city, reported by them to the defendant, by it referred to the witness as its proper officer, and by him put in the charge of one of his subordinates Cupón whose affidavit the arrest was subsequently made), with instructions to consult the defendant’s counsel, and to act with the city authorities, the police and the district attorney. The arrest was not of-a stranger, totally disconnected with the circumstances, but of an employee of the railroad, who had, during part of the time, been engaged upon the branch, and in the business where the robberies were taking place.</p>
    <p id="b535-3" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[132,1218,1168,962]]]'>This was the case as it stood at the close of the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff, and, as already said, the discharge raised a presumption of want of probable cause from which, if it stood unexplained, the jury would be at liberty to infer malice. Although only an inference from a presumption, it is ordinarily enough to carry the case to the jury, and put on the defendant the burden of showing probable cause, or disproving malice. But it was not alone and unexplained. The circumstances clearly showed absence of malice. The crime was of very high magnitude, a series of systematic and organized robberies, involving not only great loss of property, but suspicion and injury to the character of every employee on that branch of the railroad. The investigation was begun by the police and was prosecuted under their direction. The public purpose of discovery of criminals and vindication of justice is apparent on the face of the whole proceeding. As was said in Emerson v. Cochran, <a href="/citations/?q=111%20Pa.%20622" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="111 Pa. 622">111 Pa. 622</a>, “ a jury ought not to be permitted to infer malice from the mere want of probable cause, when, by other circumstances, it is disproved.”</p>
