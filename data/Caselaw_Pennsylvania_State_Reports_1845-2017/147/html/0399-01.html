Defendant paid the first call, but refused to pay any of the subsequent calls. The defendant averred that the directors were authorized at the first general meeting of the stockholders to make a call for the first installment of 25 per cent of the par value of the capital stock, and that the remaining 75 per cent of the par value of the stock should be called by the board of directors in such installments, and at such times, as might be necessary for the purposes of the business, and not merely at the discretion of the board of directors as set forth in plaintiff’s statement. “ The business of the company has not been a success, and is not now being pushed by the officers of the company, and practically no business is being done. The company is solvent and has sufficient assets to meet all liabilities, and the defendant avers that the said assessments called as set forth in the plaintiff’s statement, are not necessary for the purposes of the business, as the resolution passed by the stockholders provided that they should be, and were therefore called without authority on the part of the directors, and the company has no need for the money to be provided by the said assessments, except for the purpose of paying useless and exorbitant salaries to certain officers of the corporation, and the defendant avers that the said assessments were made, and are now being attempted to be collected simply for that purpose and for no other.</p>

The suit was brought by the corporation plaintiff, to recover certain assessments of stock of the defendant, which had been called by the board of directors. The plaintiff was incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, on Dec. 13, 1888, for the purpose of manufacturing, selling and leasing electric clocks, etc. .The defendant subscribed for 300 shares of stock, paid 25 per centum on first call, but has not paid the remaining 75 per centum. The defendant avers, in his affidavit of defence, that he never received any notice whatever of the assessments, until he received notice from an attorney that'suit was about to be brought therefor. He further avers, that notice of said assessments was not published in public newspapers, as is required by the statutes of the state of New Jersey. He did not annex tó his affidavit a copy of the statutes referred to. Hence, we have only his opinion as to what those statutes required. The provision for notice of <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>a call for assessments may be merely directory, or may be mandatory. We have no means of knowing, as we do not take judicial notice of the statutes of other states, and, especially, do we not construe them without having the statutes before us. Aside from this, the defendant was a director of the corporation during a portion of the period in which the assessments were called. As to such assessments as were called while he was a director, he must be presumed to have knowledge. The affidavit fails to aver how many, and which assessments, were called when he was not a member of the board. There are other averments in the affidavit, which we do not think it necessary to discuss. On • the whole, we think it was not sufficient to prevent judgment.</p>
