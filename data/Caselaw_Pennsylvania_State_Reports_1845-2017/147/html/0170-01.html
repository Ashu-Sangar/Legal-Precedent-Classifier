That issue has been directly raised, and it is the only issue in the case, and while I say the decision of the public authorities upon that question is not' final and conclusive upon the defendants, the evidence of the public officers, who are called upon by the law to deal <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>with, it and to decide upon it, is entitled to all the weight which, in your opinion, it may intrinsically deserve. The city of Philadelphia is responsible for the condition of its highways ; if accidents happen by reason of their being out of repair the city is responsible. The city gives the owner of the property an opportunity to do these repairs himself. If he does not do it, it is the bounden duty of the city to do it; if the city neglects to do it, it is responsible to anybody who is injured in damages for not doing it. So that in every point of view the claim of the city, if these pavements were out of repair, to be indemnified for the work it has done in making the necessary repairs, stands on the firmest foundations. They merely ask for indemnity for the expense of doing that which it was the defendants’ duty to do, and for the not doing of which they would have been responsible if any damage had been suffered in consequence of the pavement being out of repair.] [2]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-3" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[155,1261,1172,857]]]'>[The question in the case is, what was the condition of these footwalks before the city notified the defendants to repair them, before the city undertook to do it themselves. . It has been said that the condition of the pavement must amount to a public nuisance. Any street which is out of repair may be said, in a certain sense, to be a nuisance, that is, it is an inconvenience, an injury, and a damage to the public. But it is not necessary for you to be of opinion that the defendants would have been indictable for maintaining a nuisance, nor are you to try this case as if the defendants were in a criminal court being tried upon an indictment for maintaining a nuisance. That is not the present attitude of the case at all; what you are trying is a mere civil action, in which the city claims that it shall be reimbursed for necessary work done upon the sidewalks, in which the defendants are alleged to have neglected their duty, in consequence of which the city was obliged to perform the work itself.</p>

That is the criterion. Were they good, safe, and sufficient? Were they so good, sufficient, and safe that the work or repairing was <em>a totally unnecessary </em>work, <em>a work of supererogation ? </em>If the old pavements were in a bad condition and were unsafe <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>and required repairing, of course it is not only tbe right, but, as I have said a little while ago, it is the imperative duty of the city authorities to do the work, if the defendants neglected to do it themselves.] [1]</p>

These three witnesses are, respectively, Mr. Birmingham, who was the superintendent of the defendants ; Mr. Marshall, who was one of their managers,-and Mr. Craig, who seems to have been a private citizen, standing indifferent between the parties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-5" data-blocks='[["BL_196.5",196,[258,1106,1166,703]]]'>On the other hand, the city has called no less than fourteen witnesses, the drift of all of whose testimony is that the old pavements were bad, that they were insufficient; several of the witnesses have said that they were positively dangerous. Many of these witnesses are public officials, who considered it their duty to examine into the matter. Their testimony is entitled to due weight at your hands. If you consider only the number of the witnesses alone, and if you assume all the witnesses to be equally disinterested and impartial, you have fourteen witnesses testifying that this pavement was a bad pavement and in bad repair, against the three who have testified that in their opinion it was not. It is hardly necessary to say and impress upon you in a case like that, that it is your duty to decide the case according to the weight of the evidence.”] [8]</p>
