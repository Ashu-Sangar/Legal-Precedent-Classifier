The rights thus conferred being statutory will prevail over all claims not established with absolute clearness; and in construing a will under which title is asserted by a stranger or person not claiming by immediate descent, all doubts will be resolved in favor of the heir or next of kin — it being a maxim that the heir will not be disinherited except by express words or by necessary implication. And hence where a testator directs that in a certain event after the expiration of a particular interest the estate shall go to his heirs or next of kin, or to the persons who would take under the intestate laws, etc., he is to be understood as meaning the persons who would have so taken at the time of his death and not at the time appointed for their taking, unless the will affords clear and unequivocal evidence to the contrary. The fact that the person to whom the prior estate is given, though his death is to precede the ultimate limitation, is himself an heir, does not change the result or show such unequivocal intention that he was not also to take as heir upon the happening of the contingency; nor is the word “ then ” as introductory of the limitation to be understood as an adverb of time, or as indicating anything else than the event in which the heirs, etc., are to take: Cable v.

In Williams on Executors, supra, it is said, ‘ This construction ought to prevail whether the will speaks of the testator’s own next of kin or the next of kin of some other person, unless the context demonstrates that such a construction would counteract the apparent intention of the testator. Where, indeed, the tenant for life is himself one of the next of kin, it was- at one time thought that the rule was inapplicable, and that the next of kin living at the death of the tenant for life must have been intended. But the law is now settled by a long series of cases, that if there is nothing in the context of the will or the circumstances of the case, to control the natural meaning of the testator’s words, his next of kin living at his death will be entitled, and that if the tenant for life happens to be one of such next of kin, or to be solely such next of kin, he is not on that account to be ex-<a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>eluded. But where the context demonstrates that the person or persons to take under the description of next of kin is a person or persons to be ascertained at a future period, or that it is the testator’s intention to exclude the tenant for life from the description of next of kin, the expression must necessarily be understood as meaning the testator’s next of kin living at the time of the tenant for life.’ But to lead to this result there must, as Mr. Williams states, be ‘ demonstration.’</p>
