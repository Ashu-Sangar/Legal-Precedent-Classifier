      <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>On Jan. 29, 1891, the Fidelity Insurance Trust and Safe Deposit Co. appealed from the decision of the register of wills refusing to issue to them letters testamentary on the estate of Jane Nelson, deceased. From the petition it appeared that on April 6, 1885, Jane Nelson executed a will leaving the residue of her estate after payment of debts to her brother William Nelson for life with remainder to Evan O. Kane, Harriet Amelia Kane, Elisha Kent Kane and Thomas Leifer Kane. Of this will she appointed as executor the Fidelity Insurance Trust and Safe Deposit Co. In 1890 Wilbour Nelson died, bequeathing his sister Jane his entire estate, amounting to $18,000. On June 25, 1890, Jane Nelson executed a second will by which in accordance with her brother’s request she bequeathed all the estate derived from him to certain relatives named. This will contained inter alia the following clauses :</p>

Nelson, and Robert James, they to have share and share alike.</p>
