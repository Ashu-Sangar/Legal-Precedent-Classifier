    <p class="summary" id="b278-12" data-blocks='[["BL_278.14",278,[249,1207,1177,443]]]'>“ This case is brought on a claim by Mr. Burgess to recover $9,000, the balance of a sum of $10,000, which he says was to be paid to him out of the first sales of the stock of a certain corporation to be organized for the purposes of selling his patent steam generator; also, on a claim for salary. The claim for salary was released by him in writing, and the only question, therefore, remaining is about the $9,000 which he is suing for, being the amount he claims out of the proceeds of sale of stock.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b278-13" data-blocks='[["BL_278.15",278,[249,1668,1175,349]]]'>“It appears that the company did sell $10,684 worth of stock, and applied the larger part of that amount, $6,250, towards the obtaining of a charter. They also gave $1,000 of that amount to Mr. Burgess through Mr. Deming, and the balance to Mr. Deming and to other parties, sums for expenses, which is not explained here, but which it is presumed were legitimate expenses.</p>

They were entirely out. Mr. Sherman says that, at his request, these gentlemen did go out, and, therefore, there can be no verdict against Delaplaine, Dundore and Eckert;] [2] and [this being an action on a contract, the verdict must be against all the defendants or none.] [3]</p>

This company, it seems, did not succeed. Now, for the purpose of making a success of it by reorganizing it, there was some 30,000 shares put into the hands of a trustee to sell for the purpose of paying this very money. They were never sold, however, and nothing was ever realized from the sale of them ;] [4] and [there is another paper shown in evidence here — an undated paper — which authorized the payment of §8,000 of the proceeds of stock for the purpose of organizing the company;] [5] but what was done by Mr. Sutphen seems to have been done by him regularly, by common consent, properly and honestly.</p>
