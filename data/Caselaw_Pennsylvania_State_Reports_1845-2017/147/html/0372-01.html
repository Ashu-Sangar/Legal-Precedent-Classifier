    <p class="summary" id="b398-8" data-blocks='[["BL_398.8",398,[273,902,1172,503]]]'>“ It comes down to a question of the view which you will take of what took place at the meeting where Mr. Davis and Mr. Arnold, the plaintiffs, and Mr. Blabon, the defendant, had a talk of what should be done for the year 1889. The first thing you want to ascertain is whether there was what the law calls a meeting of mind; in other words, in the ordinary history of a contract a certain amount of negotiation takes place, and when that is over and men come to an agreement, their minds meet on a single point; one says, “you will do so and so,” and the other, says, “ I will do so and so,” and the contract is closed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b398-9" data-blocks='[["BL_398.9",398,[270,1413,1171,952]]]'>“ Of course, a discussion of this kind may be canceled and end in nothing, if either party fails to agree upon that precise point, or it may end, as it is intended to end, upon the two people making a final agreement, each one perhaps waiving something he had asked for and end in a compromise and come down to a point. That may take a long time or it may be done in a short time, but a discussion undoubtedly took place on that day, and according to the testimony of the plaintiffs, it ended in nothing; they never came to any agreement. According to the testimony of the defendants, there was a plain, precise agreement for the year 1889. That is to say, according to the defendants’ contention, he was to have the entire output of the plaintiff’s place during the year 1889 at $25 a ton, put free on board the cars at Lancaster, the defendants to pay the freight from Lancaster to Philadelphia, or so much of that output as he might need in his business. He was to take until the latter part of the month, or the last of the month, or the end of the month, to let the plaintiffs know what the needs of his business would be.</p>

This is not in writing, and I am not interpreting a writing. I am merely explaining to you the use of those words. If your view of the English language is different, my instruction does not bind you as to the construction of that phrase. It seems to me that the natural construction of that language would be that the defendant had the entire month in which to let the plaintiffs know what his demands were to be. Of course, they could not exceed the output of the plaintiffs’ <em>place; </em>of course, he could not ask for more than there was, but he could take so much of it as he might need at that price.</p>

The plaintiffs said they had an offer of $30 a ton, $5 better than $25, and therefore wanted the defendant to come up to those terms, which the defendant would not do. The defendant, on the other hand, contended that that offer as stated to him by the plaintiffs was for $30 per ton not free on board, but $30 a ton delivered at the purchaser’s place, and that the freight would about make up the difference, provided the defendant agreed to pay the freight on his goods, which he had not been in the habit of doing before.</p>
