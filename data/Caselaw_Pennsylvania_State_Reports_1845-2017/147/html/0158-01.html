Nichols, to recover $139, the price paid by defendant for a horse. At the trial it appeared that the contract warranted the horse to be sound and kind, and gave the plaintiff the privilege of returning the horse within two days if it was not as warranted. The plaintiff used the horse in his business of selling cakes and <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>crackers for one day, driving from Philadelphia to Darly and back, stopping at various places. The plaintiff testified- that the horse shied at steam. The horse was delivered to the plaintiff on July 11, 1889. He returned it to the defendant on July 12, and on July 14, it died of founder. The defendant claimed that the horse was sound when delivered to the plaintiff, and that when it was returned it was unsound.</p>

      <em>“ </em>On his way back the plaintiff stopped at Dr. Bridge’s house and had the doctor examine the horse. The doctor says the horse then had no indications of unsoundness. This was at one o’clock. But the doctor says the horse shied in his yard, and it took ten minutes to get him started. Later on the same day the horse was taken back to Mr. Nichols’ stable, and Mr. Nichols says, in an unsound condition; he says the horse was perfectly sound when it left his stable, but when it was returned it was sick and foundered.</p>
