That it was not a spendthrift trust is almost as evident. No set form of words, it is true, is required to create a trust of that character, yet the intent to create must be not merely discernible, but, as the trust is an anomaly in the law, must be unmistakable: Girard Insur. Co. v. Chambers, <a href="/pa/46/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="46 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="420649" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0485-01">46 Pa. 485</a>. Can it be said that an unmistakable intent to declare such a trust is found in this will? There is hot a word about creditors nor about debts; and not a hint that the beneficiary was <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>lacking in prudence or was addicted to extravagance. The sole thought of the testator was to secure his wife from the ■solicitations of her collateral relatives; and the conditions which to this end he imposed upon the trustee were simply impossible. It was impossible for the trustee to prevent those relatives from entering the house of the cestui que trust if the latter encouraged their visits; and it was impossible to prevent them from borrowing or begging from the cestui que trust the income after it had come into her hands. Whether, however, they were or were not impossible, we cannot add to these conditions another which is illegal in estates of inheritance, and looked upon with disfavor in others, because it is in restraint ■of alienation. Our first duty is to carry out the intent of the testator. We defeat that intention if we allow the non anticipatory clause to stand, for the reason that we thereby convert’ a trust which the testator aimed against certain relatives, into ■a trust which he did not contemplate, against creditors. The maxims of interpretation are too well settled, to permit such a remodeling of the will of a testator. If a donor intends to ■create a trust, but fails for lack of right words, the court may not construe his disposition into a gift, although the words were adequate: Milroy v. Lord, 4 De Gr., F. &amp; J. 264. So we cannot transmute an invalid trust against relations into a ■good trust against creditors, when it is clear that the testator intended the first and did not intend the second.</p>

An anticipatory payment of income is a payment which is made before the income is due. It is not alleged that the payments to the exceptant during the two years covered by the will contest were made before the income had accrued; the objection is that they were made before it had been reduced into possession by the trustee. The fact is overlooked that the trustee was the legal owner of the estate and of its income, saddled, of ■course, with an obligation to pay to the cestui que trust; if he paid in full as the income fell due, but before he had himself collected it, the only effect would be that when the money <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>come into his custody it came to him relieved of the obligation.

It is clearly shown, in the opinion, that the trust could not be a valid separate use trust, because the cestui que trust, who was the wife of the testator, became discovert at the moment of her husband’s death. Nor could the trust be sustained as a spendthrift trust, for lack of words to create it, or facts to sustain it. There is no provision against creditors, nor any prohibition as to incurring debts. There is a prohibition against the payment of any part of the income to the wife’s collateral relations, and against their entering the testator’s residence, but that is all, and such words, and such a purpose, are not sufficient to create a spendthrift trust. The clause against anticipation remains, but, as the learned judge of the court below well put it, there was no anticipation, in the strict meaning of the word. When the payments were made there was no income. The right to any income was in dispute, and was not determined till the adjustment of the will contest in November, 1882. In the meantime, the trustee had paid to the cestui que trust sums of money which, being added to other income payments, exceeded, in the whole, the income received, by the sum of $3,055.40, and this the trustee claimed as against his liability for income received, with interest. The claim of interest was properly rejected, but the principal of the payments was allowed out of income for which the trustee was liable to account. The cestui que trust had actually received the payments made in perfect good faith by the trustee, and she was as much in fault, in violating the clause against anticipation, - as the trustee was in making the payments. . She has, there<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>fore, no equity to be heard against her own wrongdoing, and we regard her as estopped from saying she had no right to receive the monejr on account of the clause against anticipation. The income, when received, was hers absolutely. She could pay debts with it, or give it away, or do anything she pleased with it. It would be strange, indeed, if she, having received it from the trustee in advance of the time when she could have compelled its payment, because it was not yet received by him, could be permitted to say she had no right to receive it, under the will, at the time when she did receive it, and thus assert her own wrong, not to prevent, but to perpetrate, a gross injustice. We will not permit it. Stambaugh’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=185%20Pa.%20585" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="185 Pa. 585">185 Pa. 585</a>, so much relied upon by the appellant, was a contest over the diversion of a part of the corpus of the trust, which, of course, could not be done with or without the consent of the cestui que trust. But that is not the question here. As we understand the case, the question is, has the cestui que trust received from the trustee the whole amount of the income which she was entitled to receive under her husband’s will ? That she has received it, in point of fact, cannot be disputed, under the findings of the court below. Can she be permitted to say, in a court of justice, that she did not receive the whole of it, because at the time she did receive a part of it her trustee, who paid it to her, had not himself received it? We think not, and we agree with the learned court below in so holding. The English cases cited for the appellant are not upon the same, or similar facts as the present, and do not raise the same question.</p>
