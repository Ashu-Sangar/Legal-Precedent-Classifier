The defendant refused to account for overdue ice bills which he had been unable to collect from customers. The book-keeper settled the account and charged the defendant with these bills. <em>Held, </em>that as the dispute was in regard to the construction of the contract itself, the settlement of such dispute was not committed to the book-keeper. Under the contract the defendant was not liable to the ice company for the amount of the unpaid bills.</p>

The defendant claimed that he had not made return of said amount for the reason that he had been unable to collect the same from the purchasers. The plaintiff claimed that either the defendant had collected said money and failed to pay it over to the company, or that in any event by the terms of said contract the defendant was personally responsible for ice sold and not paid for by the purchaser. The books of the company also showed that the plaintiff had retained of the wages of the defendant, under the provisions of the said contract, the sum of forty-three dollars and seven cents and the company claimed the right to retain said amount as liquidation in part of said eighty-nine dollars and seventy-six cents.</p>

    <p id="b274-9" data-blocks='[["BL_274.10",274,[248,1470,1178,603]]]'>We think that, upon the facts in the case stated, judgment was properly entered for the defendant. It was contended, however, that the settlement made by Stilwell, the book-keeper’ of the plaintiff company, and who was made the referee by the terms of the contract between the parties, to decide any dispute as to the moneys due to the plaintiff company, was binding and conclusive upon the defendant. This would be so as to any dispute about accounts, the amount of ice delivered to the defendant, or the amount of money returned by him. But the dispute here is in regard to the construction of the contract itself, and the settlement of such a dispute was not committed to the book-keeper.</p>
    <p id="b274-10" data-blocks='[["BL_274.11",274,[248,2081,1167,94]]]'>We are of opinion that the court below properly construed the contract, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>
