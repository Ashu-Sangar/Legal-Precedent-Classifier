The validity of a trust depends not upon the character of the duties of the trustees, but upon whether the purpose to be accomplished by it is one which the law recognizes as proper: Rife v. Guyer, <a href="/pa/59/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="59 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="426935" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0393-01">59 Pa. 393</a>, and in the case supposed, the daughter being entitled to the entire beneficial ownership, viz.: to an equitable life estate under a will, and the reversion, legal and equitable under the intestate laws, the continuance of the legal estate in the trustees would be simply to withhold from her the power to alien property in which no one but herself had any interest whatever. See Gray on Perp., section 120; Barford v. Street, 16 Yesey, 135.</p>

The question of perpetuity is to be decided as of the date of the testator’s death, and, since it cannot await actual <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>resulte, must be determined by possibilities. Limitations are void unless they necessarily vest, if at all, within a life or lives in being, whqn the estate passes from the settlor, and twenty-one years, etc., afterwards. Some of the daughter’s children might not be born at the death of the testator, and may not reach the age of twenty-five until more than twenty-one years after their mother’s death <em>f </em>and even if she had been past the age of child-bearing when, the testator died, the legal possibility of issue would make the limitation void: Jee v.

It is true that the fourth codicil provides that ‘ in case ’ of the death of the daughter, to whom a life estate is given ‘ leaving a child or children surviving her under the age of twenty-five years, the trustees shall pay to such child or children the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars a year, each, until they respectively arrive at the age of twenty-five years,’ and the ‘ estate shall remain in the hands of the trustees, without division, until after all said children arrive at said age: ’ but the annuities thus given are vested and immediately payable at the death of the daughter, no matter when the children were born, and so far as they are concerned, the rule is no more violated than it would be had the gift been for life or an absolute interest: Gray on Perp., sections 205, 239, 322, etc.</p>

It is well settled that a testamentary gift is not reduced by a subsequent codicil, unless there is an absolute repugnancy. It is a canon of construction that a clear gift cannot be cut down by a subsequent will or codicil, unless they show an equally clear intention: ” Williams on Executors, 221; Wetter’s Appeal, 20 Weekly Notes, 499; Reichard’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/116/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="116 Pa. 232" data-case-ids="554383" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0232-01">116 Pa. 232</a>.</p>

      <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>The fact that the fourth- codicil would lead to a perpetuity if construed as contended for by the daughter, would be, in itself, a strong reason for supposing that it was not intended to be construed in that way, if the meaning were doubtful; but there is not the slightest indication of an intention on the part of the testator to change the time at which the vesting of the residuary estate is to take place though he does change the time for making distribution. If, therefore, the postponement of possession should, for any reason, be invalid, the residuary legatees alone could raise the question: City of Philadelphia v. Girard, <a href="/pa/45/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="45 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="9502081" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0009-01">45 Pa. 9</a>, and it is very certain that the daughter cannot. The effect of the invalidity would be simply to accelerate the right of possession. 1 Jarman on Wills, 252: Gray on Perp., section 251.</p>

It could not go to the residuary legatees, for their rights do not begin, nor, indeed, are they themselves ascertained, until the death of the tenants for life ; it could not be held in the meantime, for accumulation, directly or indirectly, is forbidden by the act of assembly except during an existing minority and for the benefit of the minor. Necessarily, therefore, not having been disposed of by the testator, it passed under the intestate laws.
