    <p class="summary" id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.5",217,[145,558,1174,911]]]'>The award to the widow of a sum which was required to' make good her share of the void accumulations was exactly in line with the decision in Grim’s Appeal, 13 Out. 391. Whether her title was by way of subrogation or by some other mode of substitution, is a question merely of words, the fact was that moneys, of which one half belonged to her under the intestate laws, were paid over on the settlement of the first account, exclusively to the next of kin, and after awards to her of the balances found by subsequent accountings there still remained, to be reimbursed to her, a deficiency of $20,671.41. The final account which is now before us, shows a balance of accrued income of $2,744.31, which, applied to the deficit, reduces it to $17,927.10; and the question passed upon by the auditing judge was whether the residuary legatees, who in the capacity of next of kin had received that amount in excess of their interests, should refund it out of their shares in the principal. He decreed that they should, and his reasoning on the point is simply conclusive.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b217-7" data-blocks='[["BL_217.6",217,[144,1478,1176,959]],["BL_218.1",218,[264,404,1176,1209]]]'>Upon the incidental question whether the award should carry interest, the conclusions of the auditing judge seem to be sus-' tained by the authorities in Pennsylvania. They have adopted as a uniform rule, the proposition that where reclamation is ordered of moneys which have been paid under a mutual mistake of the parties, interest is due only from the date at which the demand for restitution is made. Thus, in Yandegrift’s Ap., <a href="/pa/80/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="80 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1042383" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0116-01">80 Pa. 116</a>, a legacy had been charged upon land and the devisee tendered the amount of the legacy, which was declined, pending a contest over the will which had been instituted by the legatee. Afterwards the legatee presented her petition asking for payment; and interest was refused by the court from the time of tender until the date of filing of the petition. In Brown v. Campbell, 1 S. &amp; R. 176, the defendant had mistakenly appropriated through his agents, certain moneys, which were subsequently discovered to belong to the plaintiff, to his own use. Tilghman, C. J., said: “ The rule is to allow interest where the defendant has retained the money of the plaintiff unlawfully and against his consent. Until the defend<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>ant was informed that the plaintiff’s money was applied to his use, he was in no default, and therefore ought not to pay interest. But being informed, he became a wrongdoer in withholding payment, and therefore is subject to damages to the •amount of the interest.” So, in King v. Diehl, 9 S. &amp; R. 409, a payment having been made, under the mistaken belief by "both payer and payee that a legatee took an absolute, and not ;a defeasible interest, the same judge remarked: “ The plaintiffs could not be blamed for receiving what they thought was their right and what the defendants were willing to pay; until the defendants explained the mistake and demanded repayment, it cannot be said that the plaintiffs unjustly withheld ■their money and should therefore be subject to interest.” iBank v. Commonwealth, 10 Pa. 45B, followed to the same «ffect, and in Railway Company v. City, Thompson, J., summed up the decisions as follows: “ The rule seems therefore to be this, that when a mutual mistake occurs between the payer and receiver of a sum of money, by which the whole has not been paid, or too much has been received, interest is not recoverable on the sum so withheld or received, unless it has' been unjustly withheld or unjustly received. . . . After demand, if it be refused, and it turns out that there was money due which ought to have been paid, it will bear interest from demand.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[265,1629,1165,449]]]'>The present case is stronger than those which have been cited, because it presents a mistake which was shared by the court as well as the party. Promptly upon the assertion bjr the widow, of her rights, the fund for distribution was paid over to her in partial reimbursement, and this was followed by an award to her of the balance shown by a subsequent account. There is no room for a suggestion of fraud or even of laches, anywhere in the transaction, and therefore nothing by which the case can be made an exception to the rule.</p>
