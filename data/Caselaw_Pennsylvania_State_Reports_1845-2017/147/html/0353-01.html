He contends that, under the act of April 18,1857, P. L. 240, and § 17 of the act of April 1, 1868, P. L. 569, the city should have given <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>him notice to do this work, and should not have included it in the contract for paving and curbing the avenue. These questions have been disposed of in Donley’s Appeal and Whitney’s Appeal, decided herewith.</p>

At the same time the contract under which the work was done is some evidence of the cost of the improvements, and may be considered by the viewers when they come to make the assessment.</p>
