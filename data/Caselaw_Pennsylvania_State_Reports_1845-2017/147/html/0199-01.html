    <p id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[253,670,1164,602]]]'>The defendant carries on the business of cleaning privy wells, and contracted to clean this well for the owners. All the work was done by his servants on July 1, 1885. He rendered his bill therefor and was paid. It appears that his servants, or workmen, in cleaning the well, had removed some of the boards, which had formed its roof, and, when they had finished their work, had neglected to replace them. The boards, thus removed, were left to lie upon the roof, and, some thirteen months thereafter, one of them fell down and injured the little child, as before stated. This action was brought by the plaintiff, by her mother, as her next friend, against the defendant, to recover damages for the said injury.</p>
    <p id="b226-6" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[244,1280,1171,957]]]'>It needs but a statement of the case to show that this claim cannot be sustained. Whether the defendant properly performed his contract or not, his work had been accepted by his employer, and the defendant owed no duty to any one who should afterwards use the well. The plaintiff’s father was the tenant of the property, and the fact that the boards were lying loosely upon the roof, was known to him, and was a matter of daily observation. The landlord, unless under a covenant to repair, was not bound to replace the boards. The plaintiff’s parents, being the tenants and occupiers of the premises, were bound to remove or secure the boards, if they regarded them as dangerous, or require it to be done by the landlord, or the defendant, or whoever was under a duty to do so. If the defendant had failed to fully perform his contract, he would be' responsible to the party with whom he contracted for the breach. But he owed no duty to a stranger for such non-performance, much less to one who was injured by such an accident, more than a year after the work was done. This is so obvious, that it does not require elaboration.</p>
