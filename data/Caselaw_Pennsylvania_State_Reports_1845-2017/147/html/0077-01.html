There are sufficient words used; a definite subject and ascertained subjects: Cruwys v. Colman, 9 Ves. 322 ; and it is not inconsistent with public policy: Earp’s Ap., <a href="/pa/75/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="75 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="1036783" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0119-01">75 Pa. 119</a> ; Wilkinson v.

    <p class="summary" id="b103-11" data-blocks='[["BL_103.10",103,[164,1832,1174,453]]]'>The dominant intent apparent on the face of the will is to create a trust for the “ use and benefit ” of all testator’s children in the residuary estate, during their lives, with discretionary power in the trustees to “ give or withhold ” from any such “ children ” a share in the corpus, and' thus end the trust sooner. The operative word used in cheating, must obviously be the chief guide in ascertaining the purpose and scope of the trust, and give color to the interpretation of the following provision relating to it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b103-12" data-blocks='[["BL_103.11",103,[165,2293,1170,143]],["BL_104.1",104,[273,392,1173,454]]]'>These words are: “ I bequeath to my executors all the balance of my estate, real, personal and mixed, to have and to hold the same in trust for the use and benefit of my children, <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>viz., Harriet Watson, James, Julia and Frances.” As “children ” are the only objects mentioned here, the presumption is that the trust was raised for their “ use and benefit ” alone, and that its duration was intended to be limited by their lives. The following portion of the paragraph relating to the trust, gave the trustees discretionary power to end the trust in respect of any of such “ children ” and vest in them a share in the corpus in the meantime; but it did not change or modify it in any other respect.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[275,854,1171,1155]]]'>It was suggested at the argument that this construction leaves out of consideration the clause “ making them all equal at twenty-one years of age,” which follows that creating the trust. But it does not. That clause is at best ambiguous. If the paragraph relating to the trust had ended here, this clause would have been more difficult of construction than when read in connection with the following clauses. What in that case would have been the scope and duration of the trust ? As Mrs. Watson had passed her twenty-first year when the will was made, and James Marshall, Jr., when it became operative by the death of his father, would the trust have been active as to them? Why should the name of Mrs. Watson have been inserted at all amongst the cestuis que trust, if the trust was not intended to be operative as to her ? If active as to her, what was its intended duration? “ Making them all equal at twenty-one years of age,” does not necessarily mean that the trust shall end when the youngest child, shall attain twenty-one years of age. It cannot be made to mean this without the insertion of additional words; but does the context require this ? It is a settled principle of construction that words can be supplied only in cases where it is necessary to give effect to the most unquestionable purpose of the testator: Varner’s Ap., <a href="/pa/87/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="87 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="1057832" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0422-01">87 Pa. 422</a>.</p>

Bead in connection with the forpgoing and following clauses, it may be made to harmonize without inserting additional words by treating it as relating to the equalization of income, or the exercise of the discretionary power which was vested in the trustees to “ give or withhold” shares in the corpus of the trust to or from the cestuis que trust. In no other ways can it be made consistent or harmonious with them. If inconsistent, it must yield to <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>the clauses expressing the testator’s general and final intent to create a trust for “ children” during life, with discretionary power in the trustees to end it sooner and vest a share in the corpus in any of such “children.” As these “children” are still living, and the trustees have not seen fit to exercise their discretionary power to end the trust, it follows that the trust continues. The decision in Marshall’s Est., <a href="/pa/138/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="138 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="11251516" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0260-01">138 Pa. 260</a>, arising out of this same will, leads to the same conclusion; for if, as was there held, the power of sale vested in these trustees be still in existence, the power “ to give or. withhold” the corpus of the trust is still in existence. The trustees were invested with the power of sale for the express “ purpose of carrying out” the trust or to withhold.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b105-5" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[183,1084,1182,648]]]'>2. Leaving out of view the clause “ making them all equal at twenty-one years of age,” there is nothing to show that testator intended to discriminate as between the children, in respect of the income of his residuary estate. As already suggested, that clause is ambiguous; but there is nothing in it absolutely inconsistent with the theory of equality as between all of the children. “ Making them all equal at twenty-one years of age” may, and probably did mean that income accumulated during minority should be paid over at majority. It could not have been legally accumulated beyond that period; ‘ and that construction must be adopted which makes the will operate, if possible, in accordance with the civil as well as natural law.</p>

    <p id="b107-8" data-blocks='[["BL_107.10",107,[123,1111,1177,135]]]'>These appeals involve the construction of the fourth paragraph of the will of James Marshall, deceased. Said paragraph is as follows:</p>
    <p id="b107-9" data-blocks='[["BL_107.11",107,[123,1266,1178,804]]]'>“ I bequeath to my executors all the balance of iny estate, real, personal and mixed, to have and to hold the same in trust for the use and benefit of my children, viz., Harriet Watson, James, Julia, and Anna Frances, making them all equal at twenty-one years of age, share and share alike; and should any of them die without lawful issue, their interests shall be equalty distributed to the survivors, or the heirs of my deceased children, by investing it for their benefit, or paying to them the proceeds; as I wish them, thq executors, to be invested with full power to give or withhold, as they think best for the interest of any or all of my children; and, for the purpose of carrying out this my purpose, I hereby authorize my executors to purchase and sell real estate, at public or private sale, as they deem for the best interests of my children, and to hold it' in trust for them, or give it to them, as^hey regard their best interest.”</p>
    <p id="b107-10" data-blocks='[["BL_107.12",107,[126,2087,1176,355]],["BL_108.1",108,[252,393,1172,455]]]'>The appellant, George I. Whitney, is the assignee of the interest of James Marshall, Jr., in the estate of his father, James Marshall. The said James Marshall, Jr., was one of the executors and trustees named in the will, and was for some years the active executor. The result was a devastavit, by which the estate lost heavily and the interest of the said executor therein was wholly or for the greater part absorbed. Hav<a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>ing become insolvent, be made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to the .appellant Whitney. The point which the latter makes is that, under the will of James Marshall, deceased, “ each of his children took a vested interest in fee in the lands of the decedent.” See third assignment of error in Whitney’s Appeal. The result of this contention, if sustained by the court, would be that a portion of the real estate would go to pay the creditors of the defaulting executor and trustee, notwithstanding his <em>devastavit.</em>

    <p id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.4",108,[251,854,1177,659]]]'>We will dispose of this question first. Its solution depends upon the fact whether, under the will, there was a conversion of the real estate. Upon this point we are not in doubt. It was held in Hunt’s Ap., 105-Pa. 128, and in other cases there cited, that a conversion of real estate will be implied when there has been a blending of the real and personal estate' so as to show that the testator intended to create a common fund out of both real and personal estate, and to bequeath the fund as money. That there is such a blending of the real and personal estate in the will of James Marshall, and that he intended the whole to be distributed as money, is so obvious that we may well be spared a further discussion of this branch of the case. We are of opinion there was a conversion.</p>
    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[249,1522,1175,912]],["BL_109.1",109,[151,410,1174,554]]]'>Other questions arise upon the face of this clause of the will. That it creates an active trust is apparent. How long does this trust continue? This is the second, and the only remaining question of importance in the case. The appellants contend that the trust determined on the arrival of the youngest child of James Marshall at twenty-one years of age. The learned judge of the orphans’ court held otherwise, and in this we think he was right. While the clause of the will is by no means clear and is very inartificially drawn, we find nothing in it to limit the trust to rthe majority of the youngest child. The controlling thought in the will is to create a trust for all his children of the residuary estate during their respective lives, with the power on the part of the executors to end the trust as to one or more of them, and for this purpose they are authorized “ to hold it in trust for them, or give it to them, as they regard their best interest.” Nor does the direction that the children are all to be made “ equal at twenty-one years of age, share and share alike,” imply that the trust is to end at <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>that time. This expression may well apply to the income, if the corpus remains in trust, without doing violence to any other portion of the will. As the children are all living, and the trustees have not exercised their discretionary powers and ended the trust, we are compelled to hold that it still continues. The same clause in this will was before this court in Marshall’s Est., <a href="/pa/138/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="138 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="11251516" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0260-01">138 Pa. 260</a>, and it was held that the power of sale was discretionary, and without limitation as to the times within which such sales should be made. It follows that, if the power of sale is still in existence, the power to “ give or withhold ” the corpus of the estate is also in existence.</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[154,972,1170,145]]]'>What has been said covers the assignments of error in each case. It follows that the fund for distribution should be held by the trustees under the trusts in the will.</p>
    <p id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[154,1127,1169,93]]]'>The decree is affirmed, and each appeal dismissed at the costs of the respective appellants. C.</p>
