I take it to be a very clear proposition that one who has agreed to become a member of a corporation and has enjoyed the benefits and privileges of membership, cannot, when called upon to perform the obligations of his contract, set up as a defence that the corporation was not legally organized: 2 Morawetz, Priv. Corp., 743. The fraud that was offered to be shown was a fraud upon the commonwealth. But it is argued that it constitutes at the same time a fraud upon every person subsequently entering the corporation, because he has the right to assume that the statutory prerequisites in order to legal incorporation have been complied with; that he must be presumed to have entered upon the strength of that assumption, the falsity of which in itself is presumptively a fraud upon him, vitiating his contract of membership. That it can only, be presumptively a fraud upon him is clear from the fact that it may be rebutted by evidence of knowledge by the member of the true state of facts: Morrison, Receiver, v. Dorsey, <a href="/md/48/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="48 Md. 461" data-case-ids="1820674" data-case-paths="/md/48/0461-01">48 Md. 461</a>. Apart from the objection that defendant’s argument would thus require us to countenance a presumption of fact raised upon another mere presumption as its basis, which is not permissible, Douglass v.

There can be no substantial distinction between a collateral impeachment of the existence <em>de jure </em>of a corporation on the ground of fraud in the procurement of its charter, and the attempt to avoid the obligation of a contract made with the corporation on the ground of such fraud. If the one cannot be done, and of that there is no doubt, the other cannot be done. It is true that in Lycoming F. Ins. Co. v. Woodworth, <a href="/pa/83/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="83 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1050820" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0223-01">83 Pa. 223</a>, a feigned issue to try the question of fraud in procuring the insured to enter into his contract, the company submitted the following points:</p>

Ins. Co. v. Humble, <a href="/pa/100/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="100 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="498466" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0495-01">100 Pa. 495</a>; 1 Moraw., P.

Hence during the negotiation the relation of the applicant for membership to the mutual company is the same as that of one negotiating to become a member of a stock corporation to it: <a href="/pa/89/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="89 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="1063253" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0464-01">Ibid.</a> There is, therefore, an analogy between the acquisition of membership in a mutual com<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>pany and a subscription of shares in a stock company. Such a subscription is not only an undertaking to the company, but with all other subscribers: Graff v. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/31/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="31 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="985085" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0498-01">31 Pa. 498</a>; Miller v. R. R. Co., 87 Id. 95. It is a trilateral undertaking and even if fraudulent as between two of the parties, it is to be enforced for the benefit of the third: Graff v. R. R. R. Co., supra, p. 498. The third parties may be shareholders: Ibid.; Miller v. R. R. Co., supra; Minor v. Bank, 1 Pet. (U. S.) 66, per Stoky, J.; or creditors: Turner v. Ins. Co., <a href="/ga/65/0649-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="65 Ga. 649" data-case-ids="52209" data-case-paths="/ga/65/0649-01">65 Ga. 649</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=38%20Am.%20Rep.%20801" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="38 Am. Rep. 801">38 Am. Rep. 801</a>; Taylor on Private Corp., § 744, or both. The receiver is not the mere representative of the corporation, but the custodian of the interests of all the parties who may establish rights in the cause: Booth v. Clark, 17 How. (U. S.) 331, per Wayne, J. As against him, therefore, no defence can be made which could not be made as against any of the interests which he represents. Hence, ‘ when the receiver of an insolvent corporation sues to recover the amount unpaid on a subscription, it is then too late to plead that the subscription was induced by fraudulent misrepresentation: ’ Taylor on Pri. Corp. § 523. That plea, as was said by Chelmsford, L. C., in Oakes v. Turquand, L. R. 2 H. L. 325, 344, would have availed in a case between the subscriber and the company, in which the latter had sued him for calls on his subscription; but, the contract being not void, but only voidable, that plea could not be set up as against the liquidator or receiver: Ibid., p. 352. The decision in this ease does not, perhaps, as clearly as our own, recognize the trilateral character of the contract of membership. But it gives another reason, which is at least cumulative to it and leads to the same result. It is that, no matter if there was fraud in the statements made by the prospectus or circular upon the faith of which the relation of membership was assumed, the person who was thus misled into assuming it had, during the continuance of his membership, opportunity of investigating the affairs of the company of which he was bound to avail himself, and his voluntary ignorance upon the subject, until the company broke up, precluded him from then raising the objection: Ibid., p. 356. I prefer this reason to that based upon the analogy pointed out by Cairns, L. C., in Tennent v. Glasgow Bank, L. R. 4 Ap. Cas. 615, 621, between the liabilities in this respect of stockholders <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>and partners both fraudulently led into a joint enterprise, because this illustration can scarcely be extended . beyond the rights of creditors and is based upon the supposition of fraud on the part of one partner inducing the other to join him. But, as was said by Jessel, M. R., in re Hull and County Bank, Burgess’ Case, L. R. 15 Ch. Div. 507, 512, so here the other members are as innocent of this fraud as the defendant. There is no pretence for saying that they authorized a committal of it; on the contrary, they themselves were defrauded in like manner; and, therefore, they acquired rights as innocent parties which would be defeated by a rescission of defendant’s contracts. In other words, the voluntary ignorance of the defendant as to the true condition of the company’s financial standing and his failure to withdraw in séason constituted negligence on his part as against others becoming members and insuring after him; and all authorities agree that the right to avoid the contract of membership induced by fraud is barred by laches: 1 Moraw., P. C., § 108; Taylor, P. C., §§ 524-6; Garrett v. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/78/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="78 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1040420" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0465-01">78 Pa. 465</a>.</p>

      <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>“ ‘ The main question is whether the plaintiff can maintain an action of deceit for alleged misstatements contained in the certificate. In the opinion of a majority of the court, this question should have been decided adversely to the plaintiff. The execution by the defendants of the certificate to enable the corporation to file it under St. 1884, c. 330, § 3, was too remote from any design to influence the action of the plaintiff to make it the foundation of an action of deceit. To sustain such an action, misrepresentations must either have been made to the plaintiff individually, or as one of the public, or as one of a class to whom in fact they are addressed, or have been intended to influence his conduct in the particular of which he complains. This certificate was not communicated by the defendants or the corporation to the public or the plaintiff. It was filed with a state official for the definite purpose of complying with a requirement imposed as a condition precedent to the right of the corporation to act in Massachusetts. Its design was not to procure credit among merchants, but to secure the right to transact business in the state. ... If such an action lies, it might have been brought in many instances upon representations made in returns required of domestic corporations, and yet there is no instance of such an action in our reports. . . . Nor is there any English case which goes to the length necessary to sustain the plaintiff’s action. ... In these cases the representations were clearly addressed to the plaintiffs, among others of the public or of a class, and were plainly intended and calculated to influence their action in the specific matter in which they claim to have been injured. So, too, in the American cases relied on to support the action. ... In the case at bar the certificate wTas made and filed.for the definite purpose, not of influencing the public, but of obtaining from the state a specific right, which did not affect the validity of its contracts, but merely relieved its agents in Massachusetts of a penalty. It was not addressed to or intended for the public, and was known to the plaintiff only from the search of his attorney. It could not have been intended or designed by. the defendants that the plaintiff should ascertain its contents and be induced by them to take the notes. It is not such a representation made by one to another with intent to deceivé as will sustain the action.
