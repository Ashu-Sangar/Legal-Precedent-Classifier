The southern line of the location upon which the street was laid ■out passed through the house occupied by the plaintiffs, and the opening of the street would involve the cutting away of about nine feet thereof. Proceedings for the assessment of damages were had before the board of viewers appointed under said act. The plaintiffs testified that they never received personal notice of these proceedings. The report of the viewers .set out that they had given to lot owners the notices required by the statute, but the plaintiffs’ names were not mentioned in the report. In October or November, 1889, notice was given by the proper officers of the city to Mellon Brothel's that they must move the house off the street. It was admitted that the plaintiffs knew, at least as early as November, that the city was likely to require the moving of the building, and had one or more interviews with James R. Mellon on that subject. Testimony for the defendants tended to show that, in consideration of a reduction of the rent from twentj^-two dollars to <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>fifteen dollars per month, the plaintiffs agreed to take the risk of any loss, in consequence of being compelled to vacate when the city would require compliance with its notice.

That order was given in conformity with the law as it then was. An ordinance for the opening of Kirkwood street, from Highland Avenue to Collins Avenue, had been regularly ordained and enacted by the city councils. •Viewers to assess damages and benefits had been regularly appointed, and had met and performed their duties, and made due report thereof according to law. After all this was done, the opening of the street was proceeded with until all obstructions were removed except the building in question. Preliminary notices had been given for the removal of the building, or a part of it, but the final and peremptory notice was not given <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>until early in January, 1890. The matter of the opening and the probable removal of at least a part of the building had been known and talked of for several months before, and the plaintiffs had been in communication with the defendant Mellon in regard to it as early as October or November preceding. When the final order came in January for the removal of the building, it was an order which emanated from the proper officer, and it either had to be obeyed, or the city authorities would execute it at the expense of the owner. If he had refused to obey it and the proper officer of the city had removed the building, undoubtedly the city would be liable for the consequences to any person injured, if the law under which the act was done was a void law. But it is just as undoubted that the officer who obeyed his orders in removing the building would not have been liable for his acts of obedience to his orders.</p>

All the proceedings of the city for the opening of streets and assessment of damages and benefits, under the acts of 1887 and 1889, had at least color of authority under the language of those acts. If the real legal authority did not exist, because those acts were unconstitutional, the city would be responsible for the damages sustained by their proceedings.

Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/29/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="29 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="982793" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0129-01">29 Pa. 129</a>, we held that even the acts of a president judge, whose right to his office was questioned, could not be impugned in any collateral proceeding. We said; <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>“He is a judge <em>defacto, </em>and as against all parties but the commonwealth he is a judge <em>de jure </em>also.” In the case of Campbell v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/96/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="96 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="494665" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0344-01">96 Pa. 344</a>, we enforced the same doctrine, saying, in relation to the challenged title of two associate judges: “Under due form of law, they hold their offices by' title regular -on its face. They aré performing the duties thereby imposed on them, and enjoying the profits and emoluments thereof. Thus they are judges <em>de facto, </em>and as against all parties but the commonwealth they are judges <em>de jure. </em>Having at least a colorable title to these offices, their right thereto cannot be questioned in any other form than by quo warranto at the suit of the commonwealth.” In both of the foregoing cases, we refused to permit the validity of the acts done by the judges to be called in question in any collateral proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b42-4" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[265,1183,1166,1006]]]'>It is no doubt true that unconstitutional laws cannot confer either contract rights, or property rights, upon any persons, natural or artificial, and the validity of such laws may be directly questioned by any persons adversely interested. But that doctrine is not in conflict with the question which arises in this case. Here, the question is as to the immunity from personal liability of a citizen who acts as the mere representative of a municipal officer, in the performance of a duty which, apparently and by color of law, rested upon him as a citizen, and which would necessarily be performed by the municipal officer without any personal liability, if the citizen refused to obey the law and the mandate of the officer. If, in such circumstances, the municipal officer would be exempt from individual liability for executing the orders of the city, we know of no reason why the citizen should be subject to such liability, he being a person interested, and apparently subject to the duty of obeying the mandatory order of the authorities. No hardship results to the persons injured, as they have their recourse to the city, and it would be a severe hardship to hold the citizen liable for merely obeying the law as it is written.</p>
