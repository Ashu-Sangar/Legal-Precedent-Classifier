It cannot be cultivated; has not been, at least, and the probabilities are, it cannot be. However, that is for the jury. But, whatever the value of that property is, taking it as the company did take it, the plaintiff should have damages for. That has been put down and is uncontroverted on the other side, at the rate of fifty cents a rod. It is a very small figure, but if that is all it is worth, the plaintiff is entitled to <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>no more so far as that is concerned; and that is all the damage I can see is done, except the apprehension of the land sliding, being cut by this pipe line and thus causing slips.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[136,558,1173,1309]]]'>There is no evidence that there have been any slips. There was one slip, but it is very evident, according to the testimony, it was not occasioned by the cutting of the hill-side; and the fact is, so far as the ground above the pipe line is concerned, that the pipe line being put there, passing out at each end like a twelve inch iron chain or cable run through the ground, would rather have a tendency, it strikes me, to support the hill-side, and it would operate as a barrier to that extent. Of course, the tendency to slip might be increased if water should get in and soften the ground; the hill would naturally slide away. Whatever effect this may have on the value of the balance of the land, so far as it would indicate or cause a tendency to slip, is to be considered by the jury. If you consider it worth while to think that the danger involves or affects the market value of the ground, to that extent you have a right and ought to give damages. It is for you to consider, however, whether there is any evidence tending to justify any such conclusion. If there has been none yet, this ground, every year it stands there, will become more and more solid. It has been a peculiarty soft year; and if there has not been any slip up to this time, there may not ever be, and yet there may be. That is a matter not of law, but a matter for the consideration of the jury. Whatever bearing it may have on the value of the property is to be considered, and if the jury think it affects the value of the property, they ought to allow damages to that extent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[139,1886,1170,551]],["BL_158.1",158,[269,402,1173,1117]]]'>[Now, we come to the great point in controversy in this case ; and that is, the effect the pipe line has on the coal, because that is where the damage is. There is no damage done to this coal particularly, except where it crops out, wherever the line cuts through the crop of the coal. If that would be of any value at all to the extent that it is cut in, three or four feet, I presume the out-croppage three or four feet deep along the edge would not amount to very much. For that the plaintiff ought to have damages. But, when you get farther in, where the pipe line itself would not interfere with the working of this coal, another matter is presented; and there we take <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>the broad ground that, except where the pipe line itself actually takes, or substantially interferes with the taking of this coal, no damage has been done at all to the plaintiff. This pipe line being built there, does not affect his right to mine the coal. He has a right to go and take it out whenever he pleases ; and, as I apprehend, he is not bound to do more than give the other party notice that he is going to remove the support, and if they choose to support it, they can do it, and any damage incidental or consequent to the possibility of this pipe line exploding, or the possibility that it may break down hereafter, or any other consequence separate from the direct prevention from taking this coal, by putting it in such shape it cannot be taken out with the pipe line there, is no standard of damage in this case. The coal is there just as it was before, and the right of the plaintiff to take it out, I apprehend, remains unprejudiced, unaffected. Consequently, if in this case we pay him for the use of his coal or for his coal, we are simply paying him for something the defendant can never use and take away, and which the plaintiff can take away when he pleases. In other words, it is making the defendant pay for property belonging to the plaintiff, which, the plaintiff to-morrow can go and dig out.]</p>

[It could not affect the use of the coal. The coal is there, and can be dug out to-day, just as well as if the pipe line were never put there, except where it crops out; therefore, any damage, or evidence tending to show damage arising to the plaintiff from that cause, cannot be considered in this case, and the jury should disregard it, if there is any before them. I have tried to exclude it, but a great deal has gotten in, as always will in cases of this kind, and the jury can only disregard it when they come to consider the case.] . . .</p>

Co. v. Balthasar, <a href="/pa/119/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="119 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="558115" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0472-01">119 Pa. 472</a>. This is to be ascertained, not by a calculation of the quantity of the coal, but by the effect of the appropriation on the tract as a whole. The railroad company, as was said by Lowrxe, C. J., ‘ gets no title to the coal further than it is needed to support the surface; ’ but they did acquire, beyond, all question, the right to such support, without which the right to the surface would have possessed but little value. It was, so to speak, appurtenant to the surface, and was acquired with it.”</p>

The land and all that is contained therein belongs to the plaintiff. The coal mine, opened ten or twelve years ago, appears to have been worked more or less ever since. The mining has progressed in the direction of the strip appro<a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>priated by defendant, until, at one or two points, it is quite near tlie right of way. If plaintiff can show that the servitude imposed on her land does or will, for any of the reasons suggested in the offer, so interfere with the successful mining and taking out the coal underlying the pipe line, or beyond it, that the market value of the land, as a whole, has been materially depreciated, there is no good reason why she should not be permitted to do so. In circumstances such as are alleged to exist in this case it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a jury to arrive at a just conclusion as to the amount of damages that should be awarded, unless they are aided by evidence such as appears to be contemplated by the offer in question. As was said in Penn Coal Co. v. Gas Co., supra.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[257,1137,1165,500]]]'>“ The character of the structure to be put upon the surface, the use to which it is devoted, the depth below the surface at which the vein of coal is found, and the regularity of the geological formation, are circumstances to be taken into account in determining the amount of support needed. . . . Support is acquired, as matter of law, by an entry under the right of eminent domain, and is a proper subject for compensation, not by estimating the value of the coal in place that may be needed for support, but by the effect of the appropriation on the price or value of the underlying estate.”</p>
    <p id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[258,1645,1162,143]]]'>In that case, the land was owned by one person, and the coal by another; but that severance in title cannot affect the principle.</p>
    <p id="b162-7" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[258,1797,1162,702]],["BL_163.1",163,[141,407,1175,661]]]'>On the argument here, it was claimed by defendant company that it can even now release all claim to plaintiff’s coal as a means of subjacent support for its pipe line, and accept the risk of subsidence, etc., which may result from the removal of that support; and, on its application, permission was given to file such release. Conceding, for the purpose of argument, that the company has the power to release the right of support which, as locum tenens of the commonwealth, it acquired under the right of eminent domain, and take upon itself the risk of subsidence with all its consequences, what effect has the release on the question of damages? As against its releasee, the company would doubtless be estopped by its release from claiming any damage resulting to it from the removal of the coal; but that would be no compensation to her for the risk <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>she would encounter from subsidence, breaking of the pipe line, flooding the mine with gas, etc., in case she undertook to mine out the coal. It would be giving a novel effect to the company’s release, to hold that it eliminates from the case the element of risk and consequent damage, not only to the company itself, but also to the mine owner, arising from the removal of such support. The constitution recognizes no such mode of making “just compensation for property taken, injured, or destroyed ” in the exercise of the right of eminent domain. While the defendant may release its claim to what is properly its own to dispose of, it cannot, by release or otherwise, barter away the rights of others. Neither corporations nor individuals can release that which does not belong to them.</p>
    <p id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[146,1074,1173,289]]]'>It is unnecessary, at present, to further consider the effect of the release in question. It was not in the case while it was pending in the court below. It was hot even tendered until long after the record was brought into this court. If it becomes a factor in the next trial, its effect can then be fully considered.</p>
    <p id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[150,1382,1178,965]]]'>In one of the points submitted by plaintiff, the learned judge was requested to charge “ that the easement of the defendant company, obtained under the right of eminent domain, carries with it the right of support for its lines ; and the owner of the land has no right to remove coal or other minerals under said lines, to their injury or detriment.” In another point, he was requested to charge “ that the right of the plaintiff to use the ground appropriated by defendant company, which, in this case, is a strip ten feet in width, and 710 feet in length, is subordinate to the superior rights of the Jefferson Gas Co.; and this superior right to use the ground so appropriated, extends to all the minerals underlying said line, including the coal, the removal of which would endanger the safety of the pipes of defendant company.” As will be seen by reference to the authorities already cited, these propositions are both correct, and should have been affirmed. In the opening sentence of his charge the learned judge says : “ Answering these points is a good deal like .... shooting on the wing.” This may account for these stray shots.</p>
    <p id="b163-7" data-blocks='[["BL_163.6",163,[163,2356,1162,84]]]'>The last specification of error is not according to rule, and is therefore dismissed without further comment.</p>
