The substance of what Mr. Johnson told Doyle was that the holders of the mortgage did not want to buy, and that he felt sure that the holders would be very willing to do this. O’Byrne was told by Doyle that Green would take the title as trustee, and O’Byrne, in Doyle’s presence, told Simpson that Green would take the title as trustee. Simpson seemed satisfied, as he was assured by Doyle that all that Green would have to do with the property would be to hold and manage it, and when it cleared itself it would go to Mrs. Simpson and children.</p>

The attorney for the mortgagee sent his assistant to the sale with instructions to bid the property up to the amount of the- principal, interest, .taxes and costs, and that if any one else bid more, then to let the property go. No one else did bid more, and the property was bought in by the mortgagee on June 2, 1879. After the sale, Doyle told Mr. Johnson that he would be willing to take the property and to pay all that was necessary to be paid down to the pi’incipal of the mortgage, and that he would take the title in the name of John 1. Green. Doyle said that he had not the money himself, that the estate was indebted to him, and that he would have to protect himself by buying the property and doing the best he could do with it. Mr. Jarvis Mason, the trust officer of the trust company, the holders of the mortgage, took the deed of the property from the sheriff, and on or about June 19th, 1879, Doyle paid to the mortgagee the sum of $8,331.24, being the amount of interest, taxes, expenses and costs above the principal of the mortgage. And Mr. Mason, representing the trust company, then conveyed the property to John I. Green, who gave a purchase-money bond and mortgage to the company for $40,000, and Green held the title only for Doyle and gave him a declaration of trust, dated June 19, 1879, to that effect, which has not been recorded. After the sheriff’s sale, Doyle called on Owens for advice as to what course to take to establish the fact that Green was new trustee, having no interest as owner in the property. Mr. Owens advised a declaration of trust to be executed by Mr. Green. <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>Doyle then consulted Mr. O’Byrne, who directed such a declaration to be drawn. Mr. Owens prepared such an instrument in favor of Mr. Simpson and wife, the paper was given to Mr. Doyle, and counsel advised him to .see Mr. Green and have it executed.

Doyle did not make any effort to borrow money on mortgage, which he might have done, or to sell some of the remaining real estate and apply the proceeds to save- the Museum property.

So far as respondents were concerned-this averment of the bill put them upon notice that the validity of Doyle’s acquisition of this title while he was trustee would be questioned, and, of course, that the burden of proof would be upon them to sustain a purchase which, if valid at all, could only be so under some exception to the rule that a trustee shall not have an advantage to himself to the detriment of the trust estate.</p>
    <p id="b541-7" data-blocks='[["BL_541.10",541,[108,1679,1174,759]],["BL_542.1",542,[280,399,1172,1757]]]'>Whether the situation which led to the sheriff’s sale was of the trustee’s own making, or whether he could have prevented the sale, are questions of some difficulty, upon which the auditor of the first account and the master in the present suit differed. It is not necessary for us to consider which is right, nor how far the first finding may be conclusive upon the second. Conceding both points to be decided in appellant’s favor, and that, up to the point of the sale, Doyle, as trustee, was within the exception recognized in Fisk v. Sarber, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 18" data-case-ids="480095" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0018-01">6 W. &amp; S. 18</a>, there still remain the circumstances of the sale itself, and Dojde’s subsequent conduct in regard to the title. Though there was no express agreement-to purchase for the trust, there is evidence satisfactory to the master and the court below that Simpson believed such was to be the case, and that the conduct of Doyle aided in producing that belief. The master finds ex<a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>pressly that Simpson was told by O’Byrne in Doyle’s presence that Green would take the title as trustee, that a declaration of.,trust by Green in favor of Simpson’s wife and family was prepared by counsel, and Simpson supposed it was executed, that the declaration of trust for Doyle was not put on record, that Simpson did not know of it until it was produced before the examiner in this suit, and that the first adverse act of Doyle to put Simpson upon notice and inquiry was the failure to include the rents of the property in the account filed in 1885. But aside from,- -and in addition to all this, the undisputed fact is that Doyle did not communicate to his cestui que trust the terms upon which the property could be regained after the sale. While it is clear that no agreement was made by the counsel for the mortgagee, it is equally clear that he expressed a belief as to his client’s willingness to make certain terms which proved to be correct, and was subsequently carried out by his client. This option, prospect, opportunity, whatever it may be called, however far short of an agreement, was still an advantage to which the cestui que trust was entitled. It practiealty gave the party who knew of it a chance to become the purchaser on a credit of forty thousand dollars to be left in mortgage on the property, and on a cash outlay of only eight or nine thousand, while outside bidders were, so far as they knew, required to purchase for cash in full. Of this chance Doyle took advantage. It may be that even with knowledge of it Simpson could not have profited -by it. But, according to the master’s report, there was still some other trust property which might possibly have been sold or mortgaged for enough to save this, or in other ways he might have raised the money necessary. Whether he could or not is unimportant, he was entitled to an opportunity to try. The withholding of such opportunity was a failure of his full duty as trustee, that, irrespective of intent and of any actual fraud, prevented Doyle from acquiring the title for himself as against his cestui que trust.</p>
