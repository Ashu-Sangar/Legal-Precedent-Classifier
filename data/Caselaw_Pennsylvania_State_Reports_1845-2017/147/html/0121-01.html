At the testator’s death, the son had seven children; two others were born afterward and before distribution: Held that the gift being immediate to the children as a class, only those in existence at the testator’s death could participate. As a discretionary power of sale, vested in the trustees, was to be exercised in a reasonable time, the ordinary delay in actual distribution would not operate to let in after-born children.</p>
