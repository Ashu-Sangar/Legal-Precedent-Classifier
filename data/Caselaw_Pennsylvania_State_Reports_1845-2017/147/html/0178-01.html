I was asked, as to her, to instruct you that, as a matter of law, the leaving of a horse unhitched in a public street of the city, and especially such a street as we all know Federal street, Allegheny, to be, is in law negligence. I do not feel so sure of the proposition as to so instruct you, and I have therefore refused that point. It seems to me, however, that it is, in its very nature, of such a character of neglect of duty that it would justify you in finding that it was an act of negligence, unless by clear evidence on the other side the fact that it was not negligence was shown, and I therefore leave it to you to decide as a matter of fact, instead of ruling it as a matter of law. [I wish to read what has been said by some authorities, in reference to <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>this matter, which shows the rule in better language probably than I could put it, and what should govern.</p>

If its size and speed are such as to make it dangerous, under such circumstances the owner* is bound to use ordinary care to keep it from straying, and if he neglects to use that he will be liable for all injuries committed by it while straying which he ought, in prudence, to have foreseen as likely to occur. For this reason the owner of a. horse is liable for damages done by it in running away if he has not used due diligence to prevent its escape, and this even if the immediate cause of the horse running away was the wrongful act of a stranger.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[284,1115,1190,756]]]'>And again : ‘ The owner is nowhere held liable for injuries inflicted by a domestic animal, such as a horse, while running away from him upon the highway, if the animal was traveling under his charge in a proper manner and he used ordinary care to prevent such escape; but if a horse of ever so peaceful a disposition is left by the owner upon the highway unattended and unfastened, the jury may hold him liable for injuries com-' mitted by it in running away, or otherwise acting according to its well-known nature, even though provoked thereto by a stranger. Thus, one who leaves a horse loose and unattended in a city street is responsible for injuries done by the horse running away, although that might not have happened but for the malicious act of a stranger in frightening it and although, after the horse began to run, its owner did his best to stop him.’] [1]</p>

Now that, as said in these cases, is without regard to the disposition of the horse, because accidents will happen to the best natured horse in the world that may cause him to run away and do damage.</p>

    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.8",206,[273,517,1167,540]]]'>The defendant drove to the express office on Federal street, in the city of Allegheny, in March, 1890. Turning up to the curbstone in front of the office he alighted from his buggy and went directly inside, leaving his horse unhitched and unattended in the street. Before his return the horse became frightened, dashed along the street at a rapid pace, and ran over Mrs. Henry, who was at the time in the act of crossing the street. She alleges that she was seriously injured. This action was brought to recover damages, resulting from the wounds and bruises received at the time of the accident, and resulted in a verdict in her favor.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.9",206,[269,1073,1170,1012]]]'>The appellant complains that the verdict was rendered under the influence of erroneous instructions, which he has assigned for error. The first of these alleges, that “ the court erred in charging that the act of the defendant was not negligence per se, and then reading authorities to show that it was.” If the learned judge charged more favorably to the defendant than the authorities justified, he certainly ought not to complain of that. But on examination we do not find the charge fairly open to the criticism made upon it. What the judge did say was, that he was not disposed to say, as matter of law, that the act of the defendant, in leaving his.horse unhitched in the street, was negligence ; but that it was evidence, prima facie, of negligence, and put the burden of proof upon the defendant. If there were circumstances which excused or justified his conduct, it was for him to show them. If none such were shown, the fact, unexplained, that he had left his horse, unattended and untied, in a public street of a city, was enough to justify a verdict against him. The authorities read support this view of the effect of the defendant’s act, and this is the rule that the learned judge characterized as the rule of common sense.</p>
    <p id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.10",206,[268,2091,1167,348]],["BL_207.1",207,[122,384,1168,655]]]'>The second assignment complains, that the characterization, by the learned judge, of the rule which he gave to the jury as the rule of common sense, was equivalent to an instruction that a verdict for the defendant would be against common sense. This is clearly a non sequitur. The law is said to be the perfection of human reason, and to embody the common sense of the people. Every rule of law is, presumably, a common <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>sense rule. Whether the jury adopt that view of the rules laid down for their guidance or not, they are bound by them. The court declares the law. The jury finds the facts. What the defendant did, under what circumstances he did it, and whether these circumstances relieved him from the charge-of negligence, were the questions of fact on which the jury were to pass. If they found that no circumstance were shown that could excuse the defendant’s act, then, under the rule of law which the court gave them, their duty was to find for the plaintiff, and it could do no possible harm that the learned judge, in laying down this rule for their guidance, also commended the wisdom of the rule. Wise or unwise, they are bound by it.</p>
    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[121,1048,1169,1265]]]'>The third assignment is taken out of a sentence which, read together, is unobjectionable. That part of the sentence, which appears in the assignment, is as follows: However peaceable he may have known it to be, here was a horse whose disposition he, in the nature of things, could not fully know.” This is treated as in effect an instruction to the jury that, however well the defendant knew his horse, he did not know his horse well; an absurd and contradictory statement. What the judge really said was this : “ And, even if it were justifiable to leave his own horse, however well he may have known it, however peaceable he may have known him to be, here was a horse, whose disposition he, in the nature of things, could not know.” The judge was contrasting the measure of care necessary to be exercised when using a horse, which one might know to be peaceable and safe, with that which should be exercised when using a horse with whose peculiarities he was not familiar. The defendant had -owned the horse he was driving, on the day of the accident, but a short time, and had driven it but little. If he would have been justified in leaving it, as he did, if he had owned and driven it for a long time, and knew it to be safe and gentle, was he not bound to a higher measure of care in driving this horse, which he had so recently bought, and of which he knew so little ? This was the thought to which the attention of the jury was being drawn when the sentence was uttered which has been dismembered in this assignment.</p>

It may be open to some verbal criticism, but it stated the plaintiff’s measure of damages with substantial accuracy. The jury was told, that the husband was entitled to recover, the moneys he had expended, or become liable to pay, for the medical care and attendance upon his wife during her illness, and for the loss of her services while unable to attend to her domestic duties. The jury was not misled by the verbiage employed by the learned judge, for their verdict was for $225, a sum fully justified by the evidence.</p>
