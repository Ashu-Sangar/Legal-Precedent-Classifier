And unless it was the intention of the testator that the executors should act as testamentary guardians for her during her minority, their possession of the premises is unlawful. While the question is not free from doubt, this seems to have been his intention.</p>

But his direction as to that is, that it is to be deposited in bank at interest, and she is not to receive it until she reaches her <em>majority; </em>his intention being’ that it should accumulate until that period. And if the executors were to hold it, their duties would be those of a guardian or trustee. If the above conclusions are correct, the appointment of the petitioner as guardian of the estate of the minor was inadvertently made.</p>

    <p id="b112-11" data-blocks='[["BL_112.13",112,[249,1417,1167,641]]]'>The court below was entirely right in dismissing the appellant’s petition. Conceding that the minor, Gertie Beilstein, has at least a life-estate in the “ Old Seaton House, situated No. 34 Diamond Square, Pittsburgh,” it by no means follows that she is entitled to the present possession ofeit. The will of George P. Beilstein, under which she claims, creates a trust for her until she becomes of age. In the meantime, she is to be paid twenty-five dollars per month. The corpus of the residuary estate, including the house in question, is to remain in the possession of the trustee until the time for its payment or distribution arrives. It matters not whether we call the executors trustees, or testamentary guardians; the result is the same.</p>
