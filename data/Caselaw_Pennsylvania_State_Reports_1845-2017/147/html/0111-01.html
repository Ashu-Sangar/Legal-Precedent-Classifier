    <p class="summary" id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[268,952,1170,400]]]'>In the summer of 1876, Hugh Lee and James L. Marshall were carrying on a coal business in the firm name of Lee &amp; Marshall. They owned an undivided one half interest in a coal field of about eleven hundred acres in Washington county, Pa., the legal title being held in the name of Hugh Lee. The other half interest was owned by James M. Bailey. The field as a whole was encumbered by liens for unpaid purchase money amounting to about thirty thousand dollars.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[268,1361,1170,347]]]'>Lee &amp; Marshall were largely indebted at the time to a number of banks in Pittsburgh, one being the Allegheny N. Bank. Being unable to pay their indebtedness, they were granted an extension of two years ; and, under an arrangement to secure the banks, they executed a mortgage to Thomas Fawcett, as trustee, upon their one half interest in said coal, subject to the payment- of their one half of the purchase money liens.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.7",136,[270,1716,1169,502]]]'>Before the extension had expired, the creditors, including the Allegheny N. Bank, by papers executed by Lee &amp; Marshall and themselves, agreed to accept from Lee &amp; Marshall a conveyance of “ all their right, title, interest and claim ” in said coal lands, “ in full liquidation and payment of all and singular the claims held by said creditors against the said Lee &amp; Marshall.” It thus resulted, as was claimed, that the bank creditors, including the plaintiff, became the owners in fee of the equitable title to the coal field, subject to the purchase money encumbrances. The coal was then undeveloped.</p>

Bailey, Thomas Fawcett and Samuel S. Brown acquired another coal field lying in whole or in part in West Virginia, but contiguous to the one above mentioned. This field, called the lower <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>field, contained about twelve hundred acres, and reached to a river front on the Ohio opposite Steubenville. The parties, then all came together, in an effort to realize by putting both coal fields into one, as was claimed. Frequent conferences were held, the plaintiff bank being represented at many of them by its president Mr. Cook, or by its cashier Mr. Mc-Candless.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b137-3" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[164,756,1173,764]]]'>The first proposition considered was to form a corporation, and that the banks and the other owners interested should convey to the corporation both coal fields, and receive in payment for their interests in the tract capital stock in the corporation. This scheme was abandoned, one reason being, as was alleged, that the banks, being national banks, doubted their power to put their property into a corporation and receive capital stock for it. Finally, it was agreed that a limited partnership association should be formed, under the Act of June 2, 1874, P. L. 271, by Bailey, Fawcett, Brown, Lee and Marshall; that the entire capital stock thereof should be paid by the conveyance to the association of all the titles to both coal fields, and that mortgage bonds should afterwards be issued, which to the extent of their claims should be received by the banks, and secured by a transfer of capital stock.</p>

In the meantime, however, the conveyances provided for had been made, the prior liens discharged, bonds issued and secured by first mortgage, and the original trust mortgage to Thomas Fawcett, to secure the banks on their claims against Lee &amp; Marshall, satisfied. Upon a portion of the mortgage bonds received by the plaintiff bank this suit was brought.

    <p class="summary" id="Ae-" data-blocks='[["BL_138.5",138,[263,596,1172,1723]]]'>u The defence is this: That the bank had a security securing the debt of Lee &amp; Marshall; that they had it, is undisputed. That it was proposed by the bank, when there was talk about forming a partnership, — for Lee &amp; Marshall, who had gotten into trouble, could not go any further, owed these debts — that Mr. McCandless, cashier, or, the president of the bank at that time, proposed in conversation that they should get some more land, form a corporation, and go into business; that the bank had an interest in this land; that they would go in with the defendants ; and, after talking it over they concluded, the parties concluded, Mr. McCandless or Mr. Cook, some of them, that it would not do to go into a corporation on account of taxes, and they would not go in; that is the defendants’ allegation. That, then, the limited partnership, this partnership, was talked of and proposed, I think they said, by Mr. McCandless or Mr. Cook, some of them; that that was talked over and they appeared willing, the defendants allege, to go into it, understood all about it; and then having considered the matter, said as a national bank could not go into that kind of business, they could go on with a limited partnership, form a limited partnership, and there would not be any personal liability; that they should give this general mortgage to secure these bonds, and that the bank would take the bonds for their debt, and the money that they were to advance to pay off these liens. That is the theory of the defendants. They have offered testimony sustaining it. Some of the witnesses, I think Mr. Bailey, says it was fairly understood all the way through by the officers of the bank; that, was what was to be done; and if that is believed, if the weight of evidence, the burden being on the defendant, is that there was such an agreement to take these bonds in this way for their security, that would estop the bank from setting up a personal liability; that is, it would be an agreement that they take these bonds secured by this mortgage, and would not look to the defendants individually.

This question of fact ■was fairly submitted to the jury, and they have found in favor of the defendants.
