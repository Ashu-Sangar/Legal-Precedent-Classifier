He had also a retail shop, which he conducted on his own account. He bought from the firm the commodities which he sold at his shop, and they were charged to him on the books of the firm. The plaintiffs introduced testimony which tended to show that during two years and a half the defendant also took large quantities of the same kind of goods, and sent them to his shop, but never accounted for them to the firm. When Quigley was charged by a detective with these appropriations, he admitted having taken about $1,200. An employee of the firm testified that Quigley had taken certain goods which were specifically identified, and that their value amounted to $109. The driver of the firm testified that <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>in 1888 he became suspicious of Quigley, that he was improperly dealing with partnership goods, and that for his own protection he thereafter kept a memorandum of all goods given to him by Quigley which were not charged in the regular method of <em>business; </em>that he made this memorandum upon pieces of paper, that he did it repeatedly and at various places without regularity.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[270,811,1172,908]]]'>“ The defence consists of an argument that there is not sufficient here to charge the defendant with more than the $1,200 which he admitted, and the $109 particularly and in detail identified. It is argued to you that that is all you can charge him <em>with; </em>for the other goods testified to by the driver you can render no verdict for, because you have no data; you have no safe or reasonably sure rule by which to estimate their value. Well, gentlemen of the jury, it is true that all judgments of courts and verdicts of juries should be founded upon appropriate and accurate testimony, and should not represent mere guess-work. It should have as a support testimony, either documentary or oral, upon which to find a verdict; but while that is true there is no inflexible rule as to the amount of testimony needed in all cases to establish certain facts, and it is also the rule that in some cases probability has greater weight than in others, and that probability will have greater weight against the wrongdoer, when by his own act he has prevented the production of definite, distinct and exact evidence. .</p>

Well, gentlemen, if it be a simple guess, it is of no avail, and [1 charge you that if the men who made up this list had nothing but the mere statement that a package of goods was taken away, and they simply guessed that the package contained suspenders, or shirts, or drawers, that that would be so vague that you ought not to found your verdict upon it; but the testimony is that they have estimated the value of the packages not accounted for, by the value of such packages and similar packages and bulks as were recorded, accounted for and paid for at that time.] £6]</p>

So, with all the estimates made on this <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>paper, you will say in view of the whole testimony whether it is reasonable to assume that the packages which he did not account for contained the same kind of goods as the packages which he did account for.] [7]</p>

You need not be guided by his estimate, but may take it for what it is worth, and for the utmost that he names against him, and you may add to it such other values as from the whole case you find should be done.] [8] The plaintiffs claim some seven thousand odd dollars.</p>
