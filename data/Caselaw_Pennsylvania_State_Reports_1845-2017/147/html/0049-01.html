    <p class="summary" id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[159,803,1168,644]]]'>The first question in this case is, What arrangement was made at the time the property is said to have been sold ? It was sold, according to the testimony of the plaintiffs, and they stand, so far as the legal rights are concerned, just as if they had been entire strangers to the previous transaction. They had sold the lumber to H. Bauer &amp; Brother. They became apparently — actually, as it turned out — embarrassed, and judgment was entered against them. The plaintiffs had taken a note for this property. Now they had a right to go to Bauer &amp; Brother and buy this property back; that is to say, give back the note and take possession of the property; just as they had a right to go there and buy it for cash, if they had so chosen. . . .</p>

If that was the transaction, it was one that the law does not recognize in a case of this kind. It would be absolutely void as against execution creditors. ... But if you take the other view, the question arises whether or not there was a sufficient delivery in law to vest the title to this property as against creditors.</p>

Over seventy-five <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>years since, the Supreme Court of this state in passing upon questions of this kind said, and it is now well settled, that a change of location of the property is not in all cases essentially necessary. Due regard must be had to the character of the property, the nature of the transaction, the position of the parties and intended use of the property. If the purchase be in good faith and for a valuable consideration, — as this was, if it was purchased at all, as claimed by the plaintiffs, — -followed by acts intended to transfer the possession as well as the title, and the vendee assumed such control of the property as to reasonably indicate the change of ownership, the delivery of possession, as a matter of law, cannot be declared insufficient.</p>

Of course we could very readily say that the mere marking might be done in such a way as to be an absurdity. To take a lead pencil and make a mark so that a man probably couldn’t see it without a spyglass, would not indicate anything to anybody, even if he was going to purchase it. [But, if it was made sufficiently large to be visible to anybody examining the lumber for the purpose of buying it, and to indicate that it belonged to somebody else than the owner of the yard, that would be sufficient.] [2] Whether the marking was done with sufficient distinctness is a matter of fact for the jury, not a matter of law for the court.</p>

In pursuance of this arrangement, Bauer &amp; Brother executed and delivered to the plaintiffs the following paper: “ The within bill of lumber is now piled in our yard, and mill, and we hereby return the same to E.
