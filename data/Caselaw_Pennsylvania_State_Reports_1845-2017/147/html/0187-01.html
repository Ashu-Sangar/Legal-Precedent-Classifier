    <p class="syllabus" id="b211-6" data-blocks='[["BL_211.5",211,[149,611,1173,549]]]'>By a contract in writing the defendants James and Charles McGuire agreed to consign all lumber which they manufactured, or that they purchased in the south, to the plaintiffs, who-were constituted the sole agents for that purpose. The defendants agreed to ship, and»the plaintiffs agreed to sell, at least 50,000 feet per week, and this agreement was to continue as long as the defendants trading as the--Lumber Company or under any other name should make, work, or manufacture lumber in the Southern states. In the first part of the agreement the defendants were described as trading as the Tar River Lumber Co. In the other parts before the words “Lumber Company,” there was a blank. In an action for a breach of this contract, it was proper to admit evidence that the defendants organized the Southern Lumber Company, and under its name manufactured lumber and shipped it to other parties from the South.</p>

McGuire and James McGuire. At the trial the following facts appeared. On March 3, 1888, an agreement in writing was entered into between the plaintiffs and defendants by which the plaintiffs were made the full agents for the sale of “ all lumber made, worked, or manufactured by the defendants in the Southern states.” The defendants were to manufacture shingles and lumber as directed by the plaintiffs, and to sell them to no other parties.</p>

The plaintiffs, on their part, agreed to sell on an average fifty thousand feet a week of lumber. They were to receive for the sales of lumber ten per cent, and for the sales of shingles one half of the difference between the gross sum received and the estimated cost of production, which was to be fixed by agreement between the parties. This agreement was to continue as long as James and Charles Maguire or their successors, as James and Charles <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>Maguire, trading' as the-Lumber Company, or under any other name, should make, work or manufacture lumber in the Southern states.</p>

In August of the same year they obtained a charter for the Southern Lumber Company, and in April of the following year, April, 1889, the land previously purchased was conveyed to the Southern Land Company, and that company was then organized. All the stock of the company except three shares was taken by James and Charles Maguire.</p>

We find nothing to criticise in the rulings of the learned judge below, either upon questions of evidence or the answers to points. Whether the Southern Lumber Co. was organized by the defendants in order to evade a compliance with their contract with the plaintiffs of March 3, 1883, was the pivotal fact in tbe case. It was not pretended that the appellants ever complied with this contract, or had attempted to do so. The evidence submitted upon this question fully justified the verdict.</p>
