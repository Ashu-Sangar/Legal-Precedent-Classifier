    <p class="summary" id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[175,511,1167,340]]]'>“ The covenant of the testator bound his heirs and devisees, who could have been compelled to extinguish the ground rent reserved by his deed of October 16, 1875, and the money paid to them in the proceeding to enforce performance of the contract would, unquestionably, have thereafter been transmissible as money, even though some of the owners may have been minors or lunatics.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b345-6" data-blocks='[["BL_345.5",345,[176,870,1167,644]]]'>“ It is a maxim of the law that whatever a person under disability may be compelled to do, he, or his representative, may, with like effect, do voluntarily (Co. Litt., 35, a; 171, a; 171, b; 172, <em>a) ; </em>hence, in the present case, as the conversion of the ground rent, regarding it as real estate belonging in part to one <em>non compos </em>mentis, did not take place under any act of assembly which, so far as such person was concerned, preserved to the proceeds the character of the original estate, his share, no less than the shares of the other owners, became personalty, and at his death passed to his next of kin without distinction of blood. The effect is precisely as if the sale had taken place under a judgment for the debt, or upon the contract of the testator.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b345-7" data-blocks='[["BL_345.6",345,[178,1534,1166,758]]]'>“ It is true that there was a petition by his trustee for leave to join in the deed of extinguishment, and it is argued that the act of 1853 expressly provides that sales made under it of the estate of a lunatic shall not affect the question of future descent ; but manifestly the petition could not have been under that act, since it prohibits action by the court unless notice has been given to all persons having a present or prospective interest. There was no notice either to the cestui que trust or to his committee; and the decree must be regarded simply as an approval of the voluntary joinder of the trustee in the conveyance, thus saving the cestui que trust from the expense and trouble of a bill for specific performance. If the cestui que trust was insane, no title would pass under the act of 1853 without notice to a committee ; if he was not insane, his share of the proceeds was, of course, personal estate.</p>
