Can it be said that the power to convey a fee-simple to Henry, under the circumstances, clearly indicates an intent to qualify a fee ? It does not seem so to me. In the grant he is forbidden nothing; and it would be, I think, a forced construction to hold that this mention of Henry’s name in connection with the devise, was anything more in effect than to indicate in making a sale, that his son Henry should be preferred. If a sale should be made, aud there is no question that a fee could be conveyed to Henry, where is there indicated any restraint put upon the use of the proceeds of the sale ? And that certainly ought to appear, if it was intended by the will that John was to take merely a life-estate in the lands thus sold.</p>

If John had the power to sell to any one, as I have indicated, then there has been no failure to sell by John, or, his death without issue living the only contingencies upon which John’s issue, or Henry and his heirs, can by any possibility take under the terms of this will, the portion devised to John. John has made a sale to James R. Bell of an estate in fee-simple, and we think he has the power so to do under the terms of his father’s will.”</p>
