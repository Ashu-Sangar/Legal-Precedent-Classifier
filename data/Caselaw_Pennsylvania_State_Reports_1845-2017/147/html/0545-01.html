On Aug. 13, 1890, defendant obtained a rule to set aside the levy and pro? ceedings under the fi. fa., so far as they related to real estate. On July 30,1890, Jeremiah Miller obtained.a judgment against defendant. On Oct. 20, 1890, judgment was obtained on the sci. fa. On Oct. 20, 1890, Endlich, J., filed the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b569-9" data-blocks='[["BL_569.13",569,[106,1726,1170,708]]]'>“ Judgment was entered on May 12, 1885, against the defendant, to No. 9, May term, 1885, J. D., and on July 2, 1890, execution was issued thereon to No. 15, August term, 1890, E. D., under which on August 9, 1890, defendant’s real estate was condemned. On August 13, 1890, defendants obtained a rule upon plaintiffs to show cause why the fi. fa-., levy and proceedings had thereunder, so far as the same related to his real estate, should not be vacated and set aside. It is admitted that between the date of the entry of the .judgment and that of issuing of the fi. fa. no proceedings were, instituted to revive or continue the lien of the judgment, and no sci. fa. issued to show cause why execution' should not issue, but that at the time of the issuing of the execution a sei., fa. was also issued for both these purposes.</p>

      <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>“ The act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 761, provides, in section 1, that execution of anj^ judgment may be had at any time within a year and a day from the first day of the term at which it was rendered, or, in case of a stay of execution, from the expiration of such stay: 1 Purd. Dig., p. 739, pi. 1. The second section declares that after the expiration of the period aforesaid, no execution shall be issued upon any judgment unless the defendant, etc., shall first be warned by writ of sci. fa. to show cause why execution shall not issue such judgment: Ibid., pi. 3.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[271,907,1168,655]]]'>“ The act of April 16,1845, section 4, P. L. 538, Purd. Dig., supra, pi. 2, however, provides that it shall not be deemed error to issue any writ of execution on..a judgment which has not been revived within a year and a day, if the same have been revived within five years. And the act of May 19,1887, P. L. 132, authorizes the issuing of executions upon any judgment of record without a previous writ of sci. fa. to revive, provided: (1) That such execution be restrained to the personal property of the debtor. (2) That it be issued within twentjr years from the maturity of the judgment, and (3) that a sci. fa. to revive be issued simultaneously with it, the showing of a legal defence upon which shall authorize the court to stay execution, etc.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b570-6" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[274,1571,1165,854]]]'>“ It follows that from the mere reading of the plain language of these statutes that the plaintiffs execution cannot be good so far as it attempts to touch his realty. It is not disputed that as between the judgment debtor and creditor the lien of the judgment continues, notwithstanding the lapse of more than five years from entry without revival. Brown’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/91/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="91 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="488769" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0485-01">91 Pa. 485</a>. But in such cases the. law inhibits the enforcement of that lien by execution upon the debtor’s real estate until he shall ‘ first ’ have had a day in court to show cause why execution should not issue. That the issuing of a sci. fa. simultaneously with that of execution will not answer this requirement, is too clear to warrant discussion: See Marx v. Goldsmith, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20W.N.C.%20173" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 W.N.C. 173">14 W. N. C. 173</a>; Harmony B. Assn. v. Berger, Id., 499. That and why the same requirement does not apply to attachment execution was shown in an opinion of the president judge in Corney v. Goodman, C. P. Berks Co., No. 13, November term, 1888, E. D.</p>
