The other assignor and the assignee both testified in full contradiction thereof. In such case, it was not error to refuse to submit the question of fraud to the jury.</p>

It was claimed that this assignment was fraudulent as to Dickson’s creditors; and, as evidence thereof, Dickson testified that he received nothing for his interest in the mortgages, save perhaps a release from the payment of a claim for $125 held by Mr. Burgwin for attorney’s fees, and that Mr. Burgwin promised, upon the collection of the mortgages, to pay over the surplus, if any, after payment of his claim, to Dickson’s wife. Both Mr. Burg-win, the assignee, and Burchfield the other assignor of the mortgages, testified that these allegations were untrue and that the assignment was <em>Iona fide </em>in payment of a valid claim held by Mr. Burgwin against himself and Dickson for professional services rendered during the course of ten years, no part of which had been paid ; that the mortgages were held at the time of the assignment by a third person, as collateral security for an unascertained balance on another large mortgage; and that, to get control of the mortgages under the assignment, Mr. Burg-win had paid a large sum as a balance due to the prior assignee.</p>
