In the opinion of the auditing judge there is but little room for argument. The testator died intestate, as of the date of his death, and his heirs or next of kin, according to the intestate law, will, by force of the statute, take his undisposed of estate.

But as already shown he has expressed no intention whatever as to the ultimate dis<a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>position of his estate. He evidently did not contemplate his daughter would survive all his other beneficiaries, or if she did that she would die without issue. As he did not provide for these contingencies, which he might have done, the law then gives his undisposed-of estate to the one whom it presumes testator would have indicated as the natural object of his bounty.</p>
