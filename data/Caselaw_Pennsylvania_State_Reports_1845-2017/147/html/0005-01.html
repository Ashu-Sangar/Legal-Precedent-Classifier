There is a question of fact for the jury. It is claimed by the plaintiffs that they were not there, and were not in contemplation. It is claimed by the defendants that they were. The evidence does not show clearly. There was some work done on this land, but when this was done we do not know. The only positive evidence about it as to time, is that some time before that, the contractor for the bridge and stonework along there had hauled stone for the building of a culvert, and those stone, it is said, are lying there to this day. Why these insufficient pipes were put in nobody explains, except that the contractor, Mr. McPherson, says that stone of the proper quality were a little hard to get, were a little scarce along there. If these culverts, or these drain pipes, were put in at that point by the exercise of a discretion of the proper officers <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>that they were sufficient, then the plaintiffs would have to abide by that decision. We have no evidence, I have said, as to how they came to be put there, in place of the stone culvert that appears to have been at one time intended. . . .</p>

We do not agree with that at all. And not only could they not have done that, and dammed up water there, but on application the court would have found some way to prohibit them from doing such an act. It would be a gross wrong both to the private property owner and a wrong to the public.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[154,1044,1164,1009]]]'>The plaintiffs do not rest on that alone. It seems there was not a large amount of trouble the first three or four years. The witnesses say there were dry seasons; latterly we have had wet seasons. But it is alleged by the plaintiffs that some years after the construction of this road, the defendant companies allowed the box drains across their road in this vicinity, above somewhere, to be clogged up so that they did not carry the water that came down through ravines, or depressions, and have made a drain that carries the water down near this property, perhaps on to a portion of it making a pond, and on and into this ravine, thus increasing the flow of water at this place without any adequate increase of the capacity of the sewers. That will be for you to say, but there is no evidence that I recall to the contrary, that these drains are insufficient to carry off the accumulated water. Now, that, I do not think, is in contemplation of the release of the right of way. When they throw an amount of water into a place different from what it was when they constructed the road, and had in contemplation when they built it, they ought to make some increased provision for the carrying off of that water.....</p>
