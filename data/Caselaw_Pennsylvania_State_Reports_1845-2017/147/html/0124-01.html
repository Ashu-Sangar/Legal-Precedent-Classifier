There is no apparent reason why the money should not have begn deposited in Martin Qu alters’ name, if it was his, nor why the Sehenley lease should not have been made to him, if purchased with his money. He acted for his wife in obtaining the last renewal, signed her name to the lease, had full knowledge that it was made to her and made no objections.

She did not testify as to the amounts given, nor how often, and does not fix definitely the time; but the inference from her testimony is that it is more than twenty years since it occurred. Taking this evidence in connection with the fact that a place was purchased with his knowledge, in her own name, and that the bank account also stood in her name since the 17th day of August, 1872, it is' certainly not sufficent to rebut the presumption of a gift to the wife.</p>

There seems, however, to be a marked distinction between the two cases. In McDermott’s Appeal it appeared that the husband was illiterate, while the wife was not; that the moneys deposited were realized from a business carried on by him, and that at the time he went into business he had real estate valued at $2,000, which he sold. In this case, both husband and wife were illiterate, and he does not appear to have ever had any property or money, except his wages as a laborer, whilst his wife had money prior to her marriage to him.</p>

O’Day, residing in Ireland, she owned the leasehold of a tract of land, kept horses and cows, and sold milk; that she sold the leasehold before she left Ireland, and there and here, before her marriage to Qualters in 1860 and subsequently, loaned small amounts of money. She, also, prior to her marriage, kept a small store, and her children by a former marriage earned money selling papers. The account in the Dollar Savings Bank stood in her name since it was opened in August, 1872 ; and whilst there is no direct evidence that her husband <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>knew the deposits were made in her name, it is highly probable he did.</p>

If the mere posses-sion by the wife of money admitted to have been originally the husband’s is slight evidence, surely these facts are much stronger evidence that the deposits belonged to the decedent’s separate estate, or that the money deposited was a gift from her husband, and would cast the burden of proof upon her husband to show (1) that it was his money, (2) that it was not a gift.</p>

It is evident that his employment was somewhat irregular, and it is probable that the money he gave his wife would not be more than sufficient to keep his family. James Adley, a witness called by the claimant who frequently worked with him, admitted that they could not make a very good living. The inference from Mrs. Whalen’s testimony, is that her step-mother kept the money received from the claimant, about the house, and there is no evidence that she ever deposited it; and, as the testimony offered by him in regard to giving money to his wife relates to a period anterior to the opening of the bank account, its tendency is not to show that it is embraced hr the deposits, bii fc that it was used to purchase the Schenley leasehold. ,</p>

With it, and six hundrbi dollars borrowed by her personally, she purchased a Schenley leasehold having the houses erected thereon. The lease was given as security for the loan and she repaid it. Her husband was a party to the negotiations, and without doubt had full knowledge that the assignment of the lease was made to her; and subsequently, on the first dajr of April, 1886, when his wife by reason of sickness could not go to the Schenley office to have the lease renewed, he went and had it renewed in her name. Mrs. Qualters collected the rents and paid the taxes.</p>

The fact that he permitted her to use the money to purchase the leasehold and take the title in her name, would be very satisfactory evidence of such relinquishment.</p>

The bank account was not opened until the next year after the purchase of the lease, and it was claimed upon the argument by Quakers’ counsel, that the rents realized from it comprised the deposits. It is very probable this is the fact; and if it be, as the leasehold was the property of Mrs. Quakers, it would follow that the rents and deposits were also. The only direct evidence as to the source of the money deposited, is that of Mrs. Bullister, to the effect that Mrs. Quakers told her it was money she and the children earned after they grew up. Mrs. Bullister also said some rents of the houses went into the bank. Yery little weight is to be attached to loose declarations of this kind. But, even if the deposits were made up in part of the earnings of Mrs. Quakers and her children, the fact that her husband did not claim them, but allowed her to deposit them in her own name, would be sufficient evidence that he relinquished his right to them.</p>
