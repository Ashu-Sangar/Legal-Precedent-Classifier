The court then allowed plaintiffs $500 without prejudice to his rights against the executors personally for the balance. The defendants averred in their affidavit of defence that the plaintiff had rendered them no service ; that he had him employed as counsel for the estate, and had been paid for his services on such employment, that the defendants had never promised to pay him anything, and that his services to the estate were worthless: <em>Held, </em>that there was no error in refusing judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</p>
