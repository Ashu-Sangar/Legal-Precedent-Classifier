Goldbeck and Henry L. Goldbeck. In order to secure the indorsers, Charles F. Goldbeck confessed a judgment to them for $50,000, which was entered of record in court of common pleas No. 3, in September Term, 1877, and was a lien upon a brewery owned by him, wherein he conducted business, and where he had a large amount of personal property. Upon the brewery were mortgage liens to the amount of about $60,000, prior to that of the judgment. John H. and Henry L. Goldbeck marked this judgment to the use of the bank as collateral security for its claim upon the promissory notes. The bank issued execution upon the judgment and sold the personal property, realizing from it $10,562.33. The real estate was then levied upon and sold by the sheriff, and was purchased by the bank for $1,000. It was sold by the bank about December, 1884, for $90,000. The bank also received from the Goldbecks thirty-one shares of its own stock on October 2, 1878, valued in a settlement made between them at $1,798.</p>

There was evidence that a firm of Eble &amp; Herter had agreed before the sheriff’s sale to buy from the bank a portion of the real estate for the sum, over and above the mortgage upon it," of $27,000; and from the minutes of the board of directors of the bank of December 13, 1878, it appeared that a resolution was passed authorizing the president ‘ to buy the brewery property,’ and ‘ to bid for the same enough to cover the several mortgages, amounting to $60,000, and the balance of the indebtedness due to the bank by the said Charles E. Goldbeck,’ etc. John H. Goldbeck testified that the real estate was worth at the time about $90,000, and it would seem from this resolution that the valuation put upon it by the bank was not far from the same figure. There is consequently nothing improbable in the alleged terms of the agreement, and it certainly was to the interest of the Goldbecks to see that the property was not sacrificed for the comparatively small sum of $1,000, and of the bank to get the title with as little expense as possible. There is sufficient and direct testimony as to the existence of the agreement, and it would seem, therefore, that this finding of fact by the master ought not to be disturbed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b293-7" data-blocks='[["BL_293.8",293,[174,2025,1168,399]],["BL_294.1",294,[250,378,1171,1315]]]'>“ It is contended on behalf of the bank, that the agreement to allow a credit in any event of $27,000, if made, not being in writing, was within the statute of frauds; that the president of the bank had no authority to make it, and that it was without consideration. The master has found that this arrangement was collateral to, and in fact a part of, the original agreement for the transfer of the judgment. When it was made does not appear definitely in the testimony, but John H. <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>Goldbeck says, page 50, that it was after the judgment had been transferred and before the sale by the sheriff. If the finding of the master that it was a part of the original agreement be correct, and we are inclined, upon an examination of all of the evidence, to conclude that it was a part of a plan for the utilization of the judgment for the benefit of all of the parties, they then being upon terms of entire friendship and good will, the subject-master of the agreement was not real estate, but a judgment which was in effect sold for a valuable consideration. Neither John H. nor Henry L. Goldbeck had any interest in the real estate. What they had was a judgment, which was, it is true, a lien upon the real estate, and for the use of it by the bank they were to receive a credit upon account of their indebtedness of $27,000. If this interpretation of the transaction be correct, the statute of frauds has no application, and the question of want of consideration, which only arises if it were a later and independent contract, disappears. Whether the resolution of the directors, instructing the president of the bank to bid the property up to an amount sufficient to cover the mortgages and the indebtedness, gave him authority to make the agreement or not, the acceptance of the judgment, its use for the purpose of selling the personal and real property, the purchase of the realty and its subsequent sale, amounted to the ratification of the terms upon which the judgment was obtained and used. It is now too late to raise the question of the authority of the officers of the bank.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b294-4" data-blocks='[["BL_294.4",294,[246,1701,1164,705]],["BL_295.1",295,[148,388,1167,1016]]]'>“ At the time of the purchase by the bank of the brewery, among the mortgages making up the sum of $60,000 was one for $14,000, which had been given in 1877 by Charles F. Goldbeck to Henry L. Goldbeck, and had been assigned by the latter to his father-in-law, Jacob Schoening, as a collateral security for certain indebtedness due by him. Henry L. Goldbeck procured the satisfaction of this mortgage, and Schoening and the bank entered into a written agreement for the purpose, October 6,1882, which set forth, inter alia, that the bank should release Henry L. Goldbeck ‘ from all his indebtedness to the said bank, provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as releasing John H. Goldbeck or Charles F. Goldbeck, who are also parties to said notes.’ At the same time John H. and Charles F. Goldbeck gave a written statement to the bank that they <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>had received notice of and assented to the release of Henry L. Goldbeck, and agreed that it ‘ shall not in any manner be construed to operate as a discharge of our, or either of our, liability upon said promissory notes, but on the contrary, our responsibility shall remain unaffected because of the existence of said release and agreement.’ The master allowed this payment of $14,000 with interest, as a credit to all of the defendants, and, in so finding, we think he was entirely right. An actual payment, such as this was in substance, made by one of the debtors, must enure to the benefit of all of them, or otherwise the same debt might be recovered as many times as there were debtors. The purpose of the agreement of October 6, 1882, was to preserve the liability of the other two debtors ; it was not to determine the amount of that liability. It was to enable the bank to recover against them any balance which may have remained due. To hold that it was meant to require that the remaining debtors should pay a second time what had already been paid by one of them, would be to construe words, of a different and entirely sensible purport, in such a way as to do manifest injustice.</p>
