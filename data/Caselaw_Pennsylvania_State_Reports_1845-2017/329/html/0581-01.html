    <p id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[143,670,1162,1017]]]'>Certificates of participating interests in the pool were sold by the Trust Company to the investing public. A certificate so issued contained on its face an acknowledgment by the Trust Company that it had received from the person to whom the certificate was issued, a specified sum of money to be held together with other moneys received upon similar certificates, “as a mortgage trust fund, separate and apart from the assets of the Company, in trust for the holders of the said certificates.” Interest at the rate of 4%% per annum was to be paid to the certificate holder upon the principal amount invested. The Company covenanted in the certificate that the payments to the holders were to be made “without any deductions for taxes, expenses or losses incurred in the management of the fund, the Company hereby guaranteeing payment of principal and interest-in full, excepting, however, any U. S. Income Tax which may be imposed upon the income of the holder of this certificate.”</p>

The court below on January 21, 1933, appointed a substituted trustee of the mortgage pool, to succeed the Secretary of Banking. The mortgages in the pool were liquidated by the Trustee for less than their face amount.</p>
    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[274,831,1150,530]]]'>When the trustee filed his first and second accounts, the Secretary of Banking as Receiver for the Trust Company, claimed to be entitled to a pro rata share with certificate holders in the proceeds for distribution. A sum representing such amount was set aside pending the final determination of the rights of the parties. Upon the filing of the present third and final account, the Receiver claims $1,817.99 of the balance for distribution, as well as the sum of $4,714.49, representing the pro rata share withheld in the prior accountings.</p>
    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[272,1373,1150,313]]]'>The court below disallowed the claim of the Receiver and ordered the Trustee to make distribution to the certificate holders in full payment of principal and interest. The decree directed the Trustee to pay any sum then remaining to the Receiver. It is from this decree that the Receiver has taken the present appeal.</p>

While it may be conceded that the certificate does not expressly stipulate that holders shall be preferred in the liquidation of the mortgage pool, it is manifest, however, that the parties did not contemplate that the Trust Company would compete with certificate holders in the distribution of the fund. That no pro rata distribution was intended ap<a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>pears from the fact that at the time the pool was created and the certificates issued, the assets constituting the pool, principally mortgages, were definitely segregated and held as a separate trust apart from the general assets of the Trust Company, completely identified and earmarked for the sole purpose of paying the participation certificates. A further indication that the interest of the Trust Company in the pool was subordinate to that of the certificate holders is evidenced by the undertaking of the Trust Company to make all payments due upon the certificates <em>without deduction of expenses or losses incurred in the management of the </em>pool, together with its express guarantee of payment in full of principal and interest. No doubt it was this covenant of full payment backed by the entire resources of the Trust Company, both within and without the pool, that constituted the principal inducement to the prospective investor in these cértificates. In return for the obligation so assumed, the Trust Company received the differential in the interest rate of the mortgage pool over the participation certificate.</p>
    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[132,1479,1153,316]]]'>We cannot agree with the contention of the Eeceiver that the investment of general funds of the Trust Company in the mortgage pool, and the investment of the certificate holders therein are essentially similar. In our opinion there is a fundamental difference in the legal status of the claims of the parties.</p>

While the facts of the two cases are different, the basic principle upon which the case mentioned was decided applies to the present claim. There it was said (p. 359) : “While we agree that the general rule governing the equitable distribution of insufficient collateral is that all creditors whose claims are on a parity share in the proceeds of such collateral pro rata, that principle is without force when the claims are not upon a parity: <em>Barkley’s Es </em>

The fund was created for the benefit of the certificate holders as a trust fund, and to hold in the face of the guarantee that the Receiver of the Trust Company may share in the proceeds of the mortgage pool on an equal basis with the certificate holders would produce an inequitable result which was not within the apparent intention of the parties.</p>
