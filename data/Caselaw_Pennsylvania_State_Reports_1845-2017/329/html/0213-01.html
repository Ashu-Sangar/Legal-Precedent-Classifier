These teachers having been denied contracts under the Tenure Act, instituted mandamus proceedings to compel the school boards to execute the new contracts as provided in Section 2. The courts below held that as the school boards were given no discretion in the execution of these contracts, mandamus was unquestionably the proper proceeding to compel the school directors to perform their statutory duty.

School Dist. of Phila</em>delphia, <a href="/pa/328/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="328 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1179655" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0225-01">328 Pa. 225</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="195 A. 90">195 A. 90</a>. The Constitution of Pennsylvania, by Article X, Section 1, not only recognizes that the cause of education is one of the distinct obligations of the State, but makes of it an indispensable governmental function. The .power of the State over education thus falls into that class of powers which are made fundamental to our government. In the ab<a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>stract it is not an absolute essential to government as taxation, law enforcement and preservation of the peace are essential, but by the express provision of the Constitution it ranks with them as an element necessary for the sustenance and preservation of our modern State. Education is to-day regarded as one of the bulwarks of democratic government. Democracy depends for its very existence upon the enlightened intelligence of its citizens and electors. When the people directed through the Constitution that the General Assembly should “provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public schools,” it was a positive mandate that no legislature could ignore. The power over education is an attribute of government that cannot be legislatively extinguished. It cannot be bargained away or fettered. Its benefits to a free government cannot be placed on the auction block or impeded by laws which will ultimately weaken, if not destroy, the underlying constitutional purpose. To permit such legislative incursion would relegate our State back to the days when education was scarce and was secured only through private sources, as a privilege of the rich.</p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[310,1541,1150,859]],["BL_257.1",257,[151,342,1154,861]]]'>In considering laws relating to the public school system, courts will not inquire into the reason, wisdom or expediency of the legislative policy with regard to education, but whether the legislation has a reasonable relation to the purpose expressed in Article X, Section 1, and whether the fruits or effects of such legislation impinge the Article by circumscribing it, or abridging its exercise by future legislatures within the field of “a thorough and efficient system of public schools.” So implanted is this section of the Constitution in the life of the people as to make it impossible for a legislature to set up an educational policy which future legislatures cannot change. The very essence of this section is to enable successive legislatures to adopt a changing program to keep abreast of educational advances. The people have directed that the cause <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>lie education cannot be fettered, but must evolute or retrograde with succeeding generations as the times prescribe. Therefore all matters, whether they be contracts bearing upon education, or legislative determinations of school policy or the scope of educational activity, everything directly related to the maintenance of a “thorough and efficient system of public schools,” must at all times be subject to future legislative control. One legislature cannot bind the hands of a subsequent one; otherwise we will not have a thorough and efficient system of public schools. What greater or more potent influence operates upon the execution of Article X, Section 1, or stands within a more direct line of its exercise than legislation concerning the school teachers, their qualifications, term and compensation? Legislatures must at all times be free to act with respect to these.</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[152,1213,1160,1129]],["BL_258.1",258,[265,339,1146,96]]]'>Therefore, while the legislature has set up in the new Act a tenure system for teachers and has provided for their qualifications, compensation and contracts, all of these provisions, and the contracts themselves, have written into them by implication from the Constitution a distinct understanding that subsequent legislation may change, modify or abolish the existing features of the school system of the teachers’ contracts. This determination flows from the fact that if the Constitution is to be operative at all times, we cannot restrict it so. that it becomes stagnant, and expose it to future ruin by so doing. For these reasons, appellants’ objection that the Teachers’ Tenure Act abridges the power of future legislatures falls, because a subsequent legislature may abolish this Act, in toto, if it deems it necessary to do so under Article X, Section 1. And such future action can, for the same reason, be taken without producing an impairment of the obligations of the contracts for which the new Act provides because the Constitution only permits such contracts to be made subject to the right of change or regulation by future legislatures. <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>This rule also applies to contracts entered into under the prior School Code.</p>

It is subject to delimitation of its operation by subsequent statutory changes. When a state enters into contracts with private individuals for the performance of services as independent contractors, or for the loan of funds incidental to the carrying out of a governmental function, these contracts are protected against impairment by subsequent legislation. Thus city bondholders can object to the impairment of their contracts by the municipality or the legislature : <em>Western Saving Fund Society v.

These, to a degree, partake of the nature of business or proprietary contracts. For example, municipal governments, acting in their governmental capacity, provide police and firemen to protect the safety and property of their citizens. The employment of these men is in the direct exercise of the governmental function and the employees are within the immediate path of its operation. In performing their services they represent the government and exercise a portion of its powers. But when a municipality contracts for the erection of a fire house or police station, the contractor is doing something which is merely auxiliary to the exercise of a governmental function. He neither represents the municipality, nor exercises municipal power. The contract which the municipality makes with the building contractor cannot be abrogated either by the municipality or the legislature. The policemen and firemen, on the other hand, are not in a position to object to a change of their status by subsequent enactments. All rights which such employees may possess flow from the governmental power, here Article X, Section 1, and are taken subject to its future exercise.</p>

The teachers named by the Act to receive new contracts are those who were at the time of its enactment “now employed.” The Act also prevents the termination of contracts then “in effect” except in accordance with its provisions. It does not compel the school board to restore to employment any teacher whose contract had been terminated prior to its adoption. Appellees were not in that position.

This would entitle the board to have the services of its teachers during the entire year, regardless of the term that the schools were in session, and such services would be without any compensation for the months that the schools are not in session. This conclusion is contrary to the system of compensation established for schoolteachers from the origin of the public schools. Schoolteachers were always paid a stated sum for the services performed during the school term or school year, which was, in every case, less than twelve months, though in <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>some cases the salary was paid monthly during the calendar year. During the summer the teachers, though under contract to teach in the fall, were entitled to be paid for any other work they did or to additional compensation for any service they performed during this time. The proposed action of the Philadelphia Board of Education would deny this right and in effect reduce the salaries of its teachers by depriving them of the extra pay for services performed beyond the school term, or the right to earn it elsewhere. This invites future legislation to pay all teachers for those months that they are employed without additional compensation. It is not only inconsistent with the scheme or plan heretofore adopted by the legislature for compensation, but is contrary to Section 3 of the Tenure Act which protects teachers from a reduction in salary. Had such a change been intended the number of months of employment would not have been left blank in the contract, but instead the words “one year” or “twelve months” would have been used. Moreover the contract clearly indicates that it refers to the school term, and that the number of months was left blank by the legislature to give the contract sufficient flexibility to be adapted to the use of school districts whose school terms may differ from the standard term. Each school board can thus fill in the number of months which constitute its regular school session. When the legislature states that the provisions of the contract cannot be waived and shall continue in force and effect from year to year, it has reference to the specific terms of the contract as printed in the statute; the uncertain part of it, to wit, the school term, may be changed when necessary each succeeding year to conform to the educational policy. The term cannot, of course, be less than the number of days prescribed by law, except in case of emergency. If the school district increases the length of the regular school term, it would be proper to so provide in the contracts of the teachers. But, the school board cannot insert in the blank pro<a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>vided a period of months longer than the regular session without providing for compensation.</p>

The situation, though unusual, is not difficult. It is of no moment to appellee that another teacher was appointed. Her contract was not only in effect when the Act was passed, but she was still working. She was included within its provisions.

On June 19, 1936, he was notified by the school board that he had one year within which to find a new position or elect to stay at the end of that period as an ordinary teacher. He received, on March 9,1937, a second notice from the board which reiterated he would not be retained as principal the following year, and gave him until March 26, 1937, to accept their offer of a teaching contract. On March 25th, one day before the expiration of this period of election, appellee applied to the school board for the teaching contract. The board did not meet to pass upon his application until after the passage of the Teachers’ Tenure. Act, and he received no notification of appointment as teacher for the ensuing year until April 13, 1937. This notice concluded: “Formal acceptance of this , election will be made by your signing the contract . . . within the next ten days.” No contract was ever executed and appellee has notified the school board of his refusal to do so, demanding that they comply with the provisions of the Tenure Act by tendering him a new contract as principal. Appellants contend that his application for a contract as teacher constituted a waiver on his part of any rights under the principal’s contract. <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>At the time that the Tenure Act was passed, appellee was employed as a principal.

The last notice sent by the board to appellee was clearly an offer of a new contract requiring his acceptance in the manner indicated. It. was never accepted by appellee, and consequently has no effect on the earlier contract. The mere appointment of appellee by the school board was not sufficient to create a contract for the ensuing year. See <em>In re Hawkins, </em>supra.</p>

While the duties of a supervising principal are in many respects similar to those of a district superintendent, who has been held to be a public officer, the School Code makes a clear distinction between these two positions. Section 1214 of Article I, of the Act of 1911, provides that the board of school directors shall “employ” a supervising principal, whereas it is provided by Section 1133 of Article XI, that the school directors shall “elect” a district superintendent. The new Act recognizes the supervising principal as a member of the class of “professional employees.” However, it appears from the record that appellee was employed by the school board under a written contract as “teacher,” at the time of the passage of the Act. The fact that additional duties had been assigned to him does not alter his status under that contract for the purpose of determining his right to a new contract under the Teachers’ Tenure Act.</p>

In that case Mr. Justice Roberts held that school teachers had no contractual rights to recover a pension created by an Illinois statute (the Miller Act). The opinion stresses the fact that the legislature did not contemplate the making of a contract, either oral or written, and intended the pension as a gratuity. The fund from which the pension was to be paid was contributed entirely by the State from taxation and not assisted by contribution from the salaries of the teachers. The court said that regardless of the fact that the fund from which the payments were to be made was denominated a retirement fund, and the payments were referred to as annuities, this feature made it purely a pension to which the teacher had no contractual or vested rights. Care must be taken to distinguish this case from <em>Retirement Board v. McGovern, </em><a href="/pa/316/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="316 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1158999" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0161-01">316 Pa. 161</a>, where we held that retirement pay was not a pension where an employee pays into the fund by deductions from his salary and the government supplies the balance. There, the legislative engagement to make retirement payments was a contract that could not be impaired by subsequent laws. A contributor to a retirement fund has a fixed contractual status and vested rights that cannot be destroyed. The <em>Dodge </em>case expressly does not apply to retirement pay made up partially from the contributions of employees.</p>
