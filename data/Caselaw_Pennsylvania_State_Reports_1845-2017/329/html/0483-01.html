He gave his property, appraised at $1,-333,730.96, to collaterals and charities, leaving nothing to his daughter. She filed a caveat alleging (1) undue influence, (2) lack of testamentary capacity, (3) that her father had'agreed to leave all his property to her. The Pennsylvania Company for Insurances, etc., named as executor and trustee, was appointed administrator <em>pendente lite. </em>Hearings were had by the Register of Wills, July 23, 1936 and October 14, 1936. On December 29, 1936, while the proceeding before the Register was pending, this petition<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> was filed, by the administrator <em>pendente lite </em>and others, asking the court to approve a proposed settlement. Notice of hearing on the petition was given to two persons who claimed under assignments made by Mrs. Van Meter, during her father’s lifetime, of part of what she hoped to receive from his estate after his death; one of these assignees was Angela B. Klein, the other, Joseph L. Rosenberg, now the appellant. During the proceedings below, the Klein claim was settled for $2,000 and so drops out of the discussion.</p>

      <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>In her father’s lifetime, Mrs. Yan Meter had filed a bill against him for a decree (a) that he had orally agreed to leave to her his entire estate; (b) that any testamentary writing theretofore made by him, leaving his property to others, be declared void; ■ (c) that he be restrained from making a will in violation of the alleged contract; and (d) that a guardian be appointed to prevent dissipation of his property. On preliminary objections the bill was certified to the law side of the court: <em>Van Meter v.

He based his objection on four separate assignments made by Mrs. Yan Meter under which he <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>claimed one-tenth of decedent’s estate. While the money consideration named in the assignments is one dollar, it is agreed that he paid to her at various times various sums amounting in all to $2,000. Two assignments were dated March 13, 1936, and the other two, June 10, 1936. Their execution Avas admitted but, when they were offered in evidence, counsel for petitioners objected on the ground that the only matter before the court Avas whether the proposed settlement should be approved and that the appellant’s claims were irrevelant to that inquiry. The court, at that time, sustained the objection and stated, in substance, that the assignments could be presented for consideration at the audit of the fiduciary’s account. When that ruling was made, counsel for appellant said: “But here is my difficulty: if this agreement of settlement is allowed, it has a spendthrift trast clause in it. If the agreement is consummated I am afraid that my assignments will be divested.” The learned judge replied: “The agreement reserves your rights. [See paragraph 4 of the decree.] It says it cannot be affected.” The court then made a decree<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> of approval without prejudice to appellant’s <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>right to submit his claim “at the proper time for adjudication in due course.”</p>

Thereafter, on January 26, 1987, the administrator <em>pendente lite </em>filed its first and final account, which was followed by notice that it would come on for audit on March 1, 1937. The next thing shown in the record is that on June 23, 1937, and July 12, 1937, the parties appeared in open court for the consideration of “Exceptions to the Decree of Compromise.” Testimony was presented on behalf of appellant’s claim on the assignments which, though excluded at the hearing in December, were now received in evidence over petitioners’ objection, together with evidence of the transactions culminating in the assignments. The learned court then filed an opinion which shows the scope of the issues presented and adjudicated in the decree appealed from. As showing precisely what appellant then claimed, the learned judge quotes from the brief submitted to him on behalf of appellant, as follows: “Counsel consider it pertinent to state that it is not the purpose of this exceptant to object to or attempt <em>in any manner </em>to upset that provision of the settlement agreement by which Mrs. Yan <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>Meter is given a life interest in 30% of the residue of her father’s estate, and the whole purpose of counsel for Joseph L. Rosenberg in this present proceeding is to sustain his claim to one-tenth of the 30% of income which will pass to Mrs. Van Meter under the terms of the compromise, and to prevent the operation of the spendthrift trust clause in relation to that particular part of the income.”</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[276,773,1149,1184]]]'>The court then concluded that Rosenberg should receive from or on Mrs. Van Meter’s account the $2,000 which he had paid to her, together with interest and counsel fees; that if he would accept $5,500 in satisfaction of such aggregate, or if he declined to accept it and the amount were paid into court in satisfaction of the claim, the exceptions to the decree theretofore made would be dismissed and the settlement would be approved. Rosenberg declined to accept it; the money was paid into court, whereupon he, and a number of other parties, excepted. These exceptions were disposed of on August 13, 1937, in a supplemental decree, the last paragraph of which is in these terms: “If the Exceptant Joseph L. Rosenberg desires to appeal from this decree, and will stipulate that the appeal to be pressed will be limited to that portion of the agreement only which deals with the ‘spendthrift trust clause’ respecting the payment to Mary Van Meter of the sums provided therein, then the appeal will be made a supersedeas upon the Appellant filing a bond with approved security in the sum of $1,000.” Such a bond was filed and this appeal followed, we assume, on the condition specified.</p>

The validity of the contention must be tested by es<a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>tablished equitable principles to be considered in the course of this opinion.</p>

When section 40 is invoked, much must be left to judicial discretion; the record must, of course, sustain the decree. The judge is not bound by what the parties may have agreed to; he must exercise his independent judgment on the whole case (compare <em>Stoffel’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/295/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="295 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1115138" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0248-01">295 Pa. 248</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%2070" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="145 A. 70">145 A. 70</a>) and the decree is subject to review on appeal.</p>

The settlement proposed in the petition was made for that purpose. In appellant’s efforts to show that there was abuse of discretion in approving the settlement, he suggests that Mrs. Yan Meter acted unlawfully or in breach of her contract with him, when she dismissed the two equity suits, withdrew the caveat and became a party to the compromise agreement containing the spendthrift trust provision. Mrs. Yan Meter had the right, with the court’s approval<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> evidenced by the decree, to discontinue the proceedings instituted by her: <em>Gordon, Secretary of Banking, v. Hartford Sterling Co., </em><a href="/pa/319/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="319 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1162343" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0174-01">319 Pa. 174</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20A.%20734" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="179 A. 734">179 A. 734</a>.

Of course we do not hold that when probate of an instrument, otherwise entitled to probate as a will, is objected to on the ground that its provisions are in conflict with an alleged agreement to make a different disposition of property, probate may be refused on that ground; the law is otherwise: compare <em>Carson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/241/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="241 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="976092" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0117-01">241 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%20311" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="88 A. 311">88 A. 311</a>; <em>Galli’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/250/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="250 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="1016946" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0120-01">250 Pa. 120</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.%20422" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="95 A. 422">95 A. 422</a>; <em>Baum’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/260/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="260 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1040330" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0033-01">260 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.%20614" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="103 A. 614">103 A. 614</a>; <em>Hickman’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/308/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="308 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1140289" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0230-01">308 Pa. 230</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20168" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="162 A. 168">162 A. 168</a>. The record shows no evidence of any foundation for the caveat; the presumption is that her action in withdrawing it was right. The Avill, disposing of testator’s entire estate, was made more than five years before the assignments; the codicil Avas made shortly afterward but merely provided that by his will testator intended not to blend “my real estate with my personal estate.”</p>

She had only an expectancy or hope that on his death she might receive some interest or estate. As she was disinherited, there appeared to be nothing which the assignee could then have asked a chancellor to order Mrs. Van Meter to transfer to him. The alleged contract that he would leave his property to her was oral; the property consisted of both personal and real estate; the consideration was not divisible; the statute of frauds was a bar to an action on the contract: <em>Morrish v.

What the assignor has he may dispose of. What he has not, although he may hope or expect to acquire it, he can make no title to because he has no title himself. But such sales and assignments have been sustained in courts of equity whenever good conscience seemed to require it, and not otherwise: <em>East Lewisburg Lumber and Manufacturing Company v. Marsh et al., </em><a href="/pa/91/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="91 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="488041" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0096-01">91 Pa. 96</a>; <em>Patterson v.

If the consideration for such an assignment is a fair and honest one, the assignment will be treated as an agreement to transfer when the assignee’s title accrues, and it will be held to take effect as an assignment when the expectant interest vests in the assignor. The second question affords the only real ground for controversy in this case. Was the assignment to Julia Ann Kuhns good in equity?
