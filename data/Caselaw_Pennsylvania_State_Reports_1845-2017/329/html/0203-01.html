Following our conclusions in <em>Burke v. </em>Hollinger, <a href="/pa/296/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="296 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="1116676" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0510-01">296 Pa. 510</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=146%20A.%20115" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="146 A. 115">146 A. 115</a>, as to the three classes of residential districts to be considered in determining whether the erection of a public garage should be enjoined, the chancellor found that were it not for the presence of a hardware store, a fire house and a post office, it could be definitely said that the immediate district would come within the rule as to residential districts of the second class, and that it cannot be denied the district falls within the third class, wherein some of the buildings have assumed a commercial nature. Considering the effect of the erection of the garage upon plaintiff and her property, he declared that it would be a nuisance, stating that it was to be built upon the line between plaintiff’s and defendant’s properties and within a few feet of plaintiff’s residence, that the washing and lubricating departments, to be operated at night, were to be placed closest to plaintiff’s house and that there can be no question that the erection of the garage would interfere with the peaceable, quiet enjoyment of her home and would do her special <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>damage, entitling her to maintain this proceeding: <em>Edmunds v.

The chancellor properly relied for his determination upon what we said in reference to .similar districts in <em>Burke v. Hollinger, </em>at page 523: “courts will be careful to note that in small cities and boroughs, business and residence closely interlock, and, in determining the residential character of a locality, of which that considered in <em>Tyson v. Coder, </em><a href="/pa-super/83/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="83 Pa. Super. 116" data-case-ids="661176" data-case-paths="/pa-super/83/0116-01">83 Pa. Super.
