It appears the child tripped over a pile of books placed on the steps by other pupils during recess. Appellants contended that permitting the chil<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>dren to place books on tbe fire escape as a daily babit and to use it for play, constituted a nuisance which tbe school district negligently permitted to exist.</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[261,508,1152,413]]]'>Tbe court below properly concluded that tbe condition described by appellants’ witnesses did not constitute a nuisance. At most, tbe agents and servants of tbe school district were negligent in permitting tbe pupils to do tbe things related, and it is well settled that a school district is not liable for tbe ordinary negligence of its employees: <em>Carlo v.
