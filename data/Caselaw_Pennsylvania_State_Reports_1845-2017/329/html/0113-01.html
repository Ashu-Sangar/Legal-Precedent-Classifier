    <p id="b147-7" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[153,576,1155,1838]]]'>Defendants are respectively a wharfage company and three railroads. The railroads are common carriers engaged in the transportation of freight and passengers in interstate commerce, and likewise in the operation and maintenance of pier and wharf facilities on the Delaware River in the City of Philadelphia. The Reading Company and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company own and operate their own wharves. The Baltimore and Ohio leases its wharf from the City of Philadelphia, but operates it in exactly the same manner as the two other railroads. The fourth defendant, Philadelphia Piers, Inc., leases its wharf from the United States Government, but operates it in a similar manner. Its wharf is served by certain lines of the defendant railway companies. Over all the wharves and piers of defendants pass import and export freight between ocean-going vessels on the one hand, which dock at the piers, and railroad cars and other forms of land transportation, which deliver or receive the merchandise at the wharves. The merchandise is consigned by water carrier to and from foreign countries, as well as in interstate commerce. Where freight is delivered to or transported from the piers by rail, compensation for use of the railroad defendants’ wharves is included in the tariffs charged by the railroad companies. In the case of Philadelphia Piers, Inc., where a railroad serves the incoming or outgoing freight, this defendant receives compensation for the use of its pier from the railroad concerned, which is absorbed by that railroad in its carriage charges to the consignor. Where the freight is delivered to or received from other carriers or forms of land transportation, defendants, up to the inception of these proceedings, received no compensation for the use of their piers.</p>

      <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>A short time prior to 1937, defendants gave notice that, beginning February 1, 1937, a top wharfage charge of 50 cents per ton would be levied on freight moving across their piers to or from ocean-going vessels shipped in foreign commerce, where such freight was not delivered to or transported from the piers by rail carrier. Top wharfage is a charge levied upon the owners of merchandise for the privilege of using the pier or wharf, in transferring the freight to and from vessels docking there, or of having their goods lie upon the dock in the course of loading and unloading operations.</p>

But if rail transportation was not involved, defendants announced their intention after February 1, 1937, of charging 50 cents per ton for the use of their piers. Presumably this charge is reasonable, not being in excess of the value of the service furnished.</p>

On January 26, 1937, a hearing was held before the Director of Wharves, Docks and Ferries of the City of Philadelphia, pursuant to authority alleged to have been conferred by section 14 of the Act of June 8, 1907, P. L. 488. A further hearing was held on February 1, 1937, at the conclusion of which the director rendered a decision against the railroad defendants denying the right to impose the announced wharfage charges. On March 9, 1937, the Public Service Commission, after previously suspending the tariffs, decided that it did not have jurisdiction over wharfage charges for the use of piers and wharves in Philadelphia, and discontinued the proceeding before it to sustain tariffs filed by defendants. Defendants then filed in the court below a bill for an injunction to restrain the Director of Wharves, Docks and Ferries from interfering in any manner with their levying the charges in question. The <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>prayer of the bill was granted, and a preliminary injunction against the director was awarded, the ground of the lower court’s decision being that neither the United States Maritime Commission nor the Director of Wharves, Docks and Ferries of the City of Philadelphia has any rate-making jurisdiction to regulate or control the charges sought to be imposed by defendants, and that such jurisdiction resides solely in the Public Utility Commission of the Commonwealth, and since the latter had not acted in the matter, such wharfage charges were not forbidden. From this decision the director has appealed to this court, in the case of <em>Philadelphia Piers, Inc., v.

The ground of the complaint is that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, having succeeded to the authority and jurisdiction of the former Public Service Commission, on May 10, 1937, revoked the order of the Public Service Commission and directed that the proceeding in respect of the tariffs in question be listed for reargument on the question of its jurisdiction to regulate the rates thereof; and that pending such determination by the Public Utility Commission defendants have no right to collect the wharfage charges, not having filed tariffs with the Public Utility Commission, as required by law. This court on petition by defendants brought up the record in this matter from the lower court, and instituted it herein as an original proceeding. The plaintiff filed herein an amended bill of complaint, stating the same grounds, and to this defendants filed preliminary objections.</p>

This question is whether, in view of the fact that defendants seek to impose the wharfage charges only upon goods moving in foreign commerce over their piers, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any municipality or administrative agency thereof has any jurisdiction to regulate the same or to interfere in any manner in the levying of such charges by defendants. Defendants’ contention is that, foreign commerce alone being involved, regulation of wharfage charges is solely within the power and jurisdiction of the Federal government and its administrative agencies duly established to that end. It is said, first, that the subject of the regulation of wharfage charges, being national in scope and effect, comprises a sphere in which state law has no power to operate, irrespective of whether regulatory legislation has been enacted by Congress; and, secondly, it is maintained that even if the subject matter is one in which state regulatory law may legitimately operate in the absence of controlling federal legislation, Congress has entered the field and undertaken to regulate the matters in question, and that this has been done either by the Federal Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and its amendments, or by the Shipping Act of 1916, as amended.</p>

The contention is made that in more recent times the subject has become one of national importance, because of the complex network of transportation facilities now covering the entire country, each part having a necessary interrelation with every other part. It is argued that the Interstate Commerce Commission is now and for many <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>years has been engaged in the process of determining and fixing rates for interstate carriage of freight between inland points and ports of delivery, and that, since wharfage rates have an effect on the flow of interstate commerce, the fixing of them has ceased to be a matter merely of snch local interest and significance as to justify state regulation.</p>
    <p id="b151-3" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[146,716,1154,752]]]'>There is no evidence before us of the extent to which the imposition of wharfage charges has become a matter of preeminently national concern, or of the nature and degree of its effect upon interstate and foreign commerce. In its absence it cannot be taken for granted that wharfage charges have entered the category of exclusively federal questions regardless of whether or not Congress has taken action in respect to them. All the earlier decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States indicate that the regulation of wharfage and dockage rates and the determination of what are and what are not reasonable charges is a subject of local concern subject to state regulatory power in the absence of applicable Federal legislation.</p>

S. 577</a>, 582, the court had before it the question of the validity of an ordinance of the City of New Orleans imposing a duty on any vessel landing at that port on the basis of its tonnage. The court struck down the tax as a violation of the constitutional prohibition against a state’s levying a duty of tonnage without the consent of Congress, but in doing so it said at page 582: “In saying this we do not understand that this principle interposes any hindrance to the recovery from any vessel landing at a wharf or pier owned by an individual or by a municipal or other corporation, a just compensation for the use of such property. It is a doctrine too well settled, and a practice too common and too essential to the interests of commerce and navigation to admit of a doubt, that for the use of such structures, erected by <em>individual </em>enterprise, and recognized everywhere as private prop<a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>erty, a reasonable compensation can be exacted. And it may be safely admitted also that it is within the power of the State to regulate this compensation, so as to prevent extortion, a power which is often very properly delegated to the local municipal authority.”</p>

If it be a regulation of commerce under the power conferred on Congress by the Constitution, that body has signally failed to provide any such regulation. It belongs also, manifestly, to that class of rules which, like pilotage and some others, can be most wisely exercised by local authorities, and in regard to which no general rules applicable alike to all ports and landing-places, can be properly made.

S. 691</a>, the court, defining wharfage as compensation which the owner of a wharf demands for the use thereof, declared at pages 700-702, 704: “We have said that the .reasonableness of wharfage must be determined by the local law until some paramount law has been prescribed. By this we mean, that until the local law is displaced or overruled by paramount legislation adopted by Congress, the courts have no other guide, no other law to administer on the subject than the local or State law. . . . Now wharves, levees, and landing-places are essential to commerce by water, no less than a navigable channel and a clear river. But they are attached to the land; they are private property, real estate; and they are primarily, at least, subject to the local State laws. Congress has never yet interposed to supervise their administration; it has hitherto left this exclusively to the States. There is little doubt, however, that Congress, if it saw fit, in case of prevailing abuses in the management of wharf property, — abuses materially interfering with the prosecution of commerce, — might interpose and make regulations to prevent such abuses. When it shall have done so, it will be time enough for the courts to carry its regulations into effect by judicial proceedings properly instituted. But until Congress has acted, the courts of the United States cannot assume control over the subject as a matter of Federal cognizance. It is Congress, and not the Judicial Department, to which the Constitution has given the power <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States. The courts can never take the initiative on this subject. There are cases, it is true, which are so national in their character, and in which it is so essential that a general or national rule should exist, that any interference by the State legislatures therewith is justly deemed to be an invasion of the power and authority of the general government; and in such cases the courts will interpose to prevent or redress the commission of acts done or attempted to be done under the authority of such unconstitutional laws. In such cases, the nonaction or silence of Congress will be deemed to be an indication of its will that no exaction or restraint shall be imposed. Such is the import of the various passenger cases in which this Court has pronounced unconstitutional any tax, duty, or other exaction imposed by the States upon emigrants landing in the country. Such is also the import of those cases in which it has been held that State laws imposing discriminating burdens upon the persons or products of other States are unconstitutional; it being deemed the intent of Congress that interstate commerce shall be free, where it has not itself imposed any restrictions thereon.” See also <em>Ouachita Packet Co. v.

It extends to those matters of a local nature as to which it is impossible to derive from the constitutional grant an intention that they should go uncontrolled pending Federal intervention.

The fourth defendant, Philadelphia Piers, Inc., operates its wharf, as averred in the bill of complaint, in the business, inter alia, of “transferring import and export freight between ocean-going vessels and railroad cars . . . for transportation to and from foreign countries,” and likewise freight not served by rail to and from the pier.

It is with the system that the law must deal, not with its elements. . . .

In 1905 the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Hudson County, New Jersey, adopted two ordinances, one fixing the rate for foot passengers ferried from New Jersey to New York and the other for a round trip commencing on the New Jersey shore, which rates were applicable to the ferries in question. The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, engaged as a lessee in operating the lines of the West Shore Railroad and its railroad ferries, commenced this proceeding to prevent the enforcement of the rates fixed by the ordinances. The contention was that the ordinances were an unwarranted interference with the interstate business of the company and that the enforcement of the ordinances would constitute a direct burden on interstate commerce, which could not be done consistently with the Constitution. The Supreme Court of New Jersey maintained the contentions of the railroad company. The Court of Errors and Appeals reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court. The case reached the Supreme Court, of the United States. Chief Justice White, speaking for the Supreme Court, said: “The plaintiff in error insists, not following the exact order of its argument, a, that the assailed ordinances are repugnant to the commerce clause because Congress has legislated concerning railroad ferries and thereby manifested its purpose that there should be no longer room for the exertion of state power on the subject ; and, 6, that if this is not so it is now necessary to pass on the question reserved in the <em>St. Clair Case </em>[<a href="/us/192/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="192 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="360348" data-case-paths="/us/192/0454-01">192 </a><a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a><a href="/us/192/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="192 U.S. 454" data-case-ids="360348" data-case-paths="/us/192/0454-01">U.

S. 204</a>] affirmatively established that interstate ferriage like that here in question is so absolutely within the power of Congress as to exclude even in case of the inaction of Congress the presumption of a license for the exercise of state power.” On the other hand, it was contended that “ ‘The decision of the <em>Gloucester Ferry Case, </em><a href="/us/114/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="114 U.S. 196" data-case-ids="11293416" data-case-paths="/us/114/0196-01">114 U. S. 196</a>, decided in 1885, established Federal jurisdiction to legislate concerning ferriage over boundary streams, but did not turn what had been an exclusive state jurisdiction into an exclusive Federal jurisdiction. State laws on this subject are still valid until superseded by a Federal statute.’ ... ‘In the absence of Federal legislation the States have all the power that they have been accustomed to exercise.’ . . . It is insisted that the court below rightly upheld the assailed ordinances because there has been no action by Congress exerting its authority over the subject with which the ordinances deal and therefore no room for the contention that it was not within the power of the State to enact them.” The Supreme Court then said: “We are called upon only . . . to determine the single and simple question whether there has been such action by Congress as to destroy the presumption as to the existence in the State of vicarious and revocable authority over the subject. We say simple question because its decision is, we think, free from difficulty, in view of the express provision of the first section of the Act to Regulate Commerce (Act of February 4, 1887, c. 104, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20Stat.%20379" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="24 Stat. 379">24 Stat. 379</a>), subjecting railroads as therein defined to the authority of Congress, and expressly declaring that ‘the term railroad as used in this act shall include all bridges and ferries used or operated in connection with any railroad, and also all the road in use by any corporation operating a railroad, whether owned or operated under a contract, agreement or lease. . . . ’ The inclusion of railroad ferries within the text is so certain and so direct as to require nothing but a consideration of the text itself. Indeed, this <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>inevitable conclusion is not disputed in the argument for the defendant in error, but it is insisted that as the text only embraces railroad ferries and the ordinances were expressly decided by the court below only to apply to persons other than railroad passengers, therefore the action by Congress does not extend to the subject embraced by the ordinances. But as all the business of the ferries between the two States was interstate commerce within the power of Congress to control and subject in any event to regulation by the State as long only as no action was taken by Congress, the result of the action by Congress leaves the subject, that is, the interstate commerce carried on by means of the ferries, free from control by the State. We think the argument by which it is sought to limit the operation of the act of Congress to certain elements only of the interstate commerce embraced in the business of ferriage from State to State is wanting in merit. In the absence of an express exclusion of some of the elements of interstate commerce entering into the ferriage, the assertion of power on the part of Congress must be treated as being coterminous with the authority over the subject as to which the purpose of Congress to take control was manifested. Indeed, this conclusion is inevitable since the assumption of a purpose on the part of Congress to divide its authority over the elements of interstate commerce intermingled in the movement of the regulated interstate ferriage would be to render the national authority inefficacious by the confusion and conflict which would result. The conception of the operation at one and the same time of both the power of Congress and the power of the States over a matter of interstate commerce is inconceivable, since the exertion of the greater power necessarily takes possession of the field, and leaves nothing upon which the lesser power may operate.”</p>

The sections of the Interstate Commerce Act, already cited in this opinion, mention “instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage” as <em>expressly </em>as they do the word “ferries,” and, as we have already pointed out, a wharf or dock is palpably an “instrumentality and facility of shipment or carriage.” The power of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the act quoted to regulate wharfage fees is as undeniable as its power to regulate ferriage. The evil to be avoided, according to the opinion expressed by Chief Justice White in the case just quoted from, was the rendering of “the national authority inefficacious by the confusion and conflict which would result” from leaving <em>both </em>the Federal and State governments in “possession of the field.” Therefore the Supreme Court declared in effect that in the field defined either in specific or general terms in the Interstate Commerce Act, only one sovereign could exercise its will, that sovereign being the United States.</p>

S. 370</a>, the facts were that the railway company, in operating a train on its road in the State of Washington, permitted some of the train crew to remain on duty more than sixteen consecutive hours, this being apparently contrary to the prohibition of the act of Congress known as the “Hours of Service” law. The train was moving from one point to another in the State of Washington and was carrying merchandise which had originated at points outside of the State and was in transit through the State to a foreign destination. This train was held to be an interstate train, despite the fact that it may also have been carrying some local freight. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice White, held: “In view of the unity and indivisibility of the service of the train crew and the paramount character of the authority of Congress to regulate commerce, the Act of Congress was exclusively controlling: <em>Southern Railway Co. v. United States, </em><a href="/us/222/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="222 U.S. 20" data-case-ids="3660259" data-case-paths="/us/222/0020-01">222 U. S. 20</a>. But while thus governed by the act of Congress the prohibitions of that act were not operative. This follows by reason of the provisions of section 5 to the following effect: ‘That this Act shall take effect and be in force one year after its passage.’ ” It was not in effect at the time that some of the crew were permitted to work as above stated. About a month before the occurrences giving rise to that case, a law in the State of Washington regulating the hours of service of railway employees became effective. The provisions of that act greatly resembled those of the act of Congress referred to. The Attorney General of the State commenced a proceeding to recover penalties for the violation of the state law. The railroad denied any liability for the penalties imposed by the state law. The denial was based upon the assertion that the train was an interstate train, and was not subject to the control of the State because within the exclusive authority of Congress, manifested by the enactment of Congress on that <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>subject. The trial court granted a motion for judgment upon the pleadings and awarded one thousand dollars penalty and the Supreme Court of the State of Washington affirmed it. An appeal to the United States Supreme Court followed. The prosecution based its case on the ground that Congress had not acted on the subject, and therefore the state regulation should be applied. Chief Justice White said further: “Thus [the State] conceding the paramount power of Congress, the operative force of the state law was solely maintained over the interstate commerce in question because of the provision óf the act of Congress providing that it should not take effect until one year after its passage. . . . We are of the opinion that this view is not compatible with the paramount authority of Congress over interstate commerce. . . . The right of a state to apply its police power for the purpose of regulating interstate commerce, in a case like this, exists only from the silence of Congress on the subject, and ceases when Congress acts on the subject or manifests its purpose to call into play its exclusive power. ... As the enactment by Congress of the law in question was an assertion of its power, by the fact alone of such manifestation that subject was at once removed from the sphere of the operation of the authority of the State. . . . If it be that it [the postponement of the operation of the law] was contemplated that the subject dealt with should be controlled during the year by state laws, the postponement of the prohibitions of the act could accomplish no possible purpose. ... In the second place, the obvious suggestion is that the purpose of Congress in giving time was to enable the necessary adjustments to be made by the railroads to meet the new conditions created by the act, a purpose which would of course be frustrated by giving to the provision as to postponement a significance which would destroy the very reason which caused it to be enacted.”</p>

Justice Butler pointed out that “No Act of Congress or order of the commission prescribed a form of bill of lading for this shipment [i. e., the shipment in question]. . . . But that does not sustain their contention that Congress has not evinced an intention to regulate bills of lading for transportation such as is here involved. Section 1(6) extends to all carriers and to all transportation subject to the Act; it prescribes a general rule applicable to all regulations and practices affecting the form or substance of bills of lading in order that they may be just and reasonable. And the commission is empowered and directed to enforce the rule. The general regulation of the ‘issuance, form, and substance’ of bills of lading is broad enough to cover contractual provisions, like the one involved in this case, exempting railroads from liability for loss of <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>shippers’ property by fire.

Ed. 417</a>, which covers the whole matter thus: ‘It is a doctrine too well settled, and a practice too common and too essential to the interests of commerce and navigation to admit of a doubt, that for the use of such structures [wharves], erected by individual enterprise, and recognized everywhere as private property, a reasonable compensation can be exacted. And it may be safely admitted also that it is within the power of the state to regulate this compensation, so as to prevent extortion, a power which is often very properly delegated to the local municipal authority.’ ” Judge Hough then says: “From these authorities [meaning apparently the two cases he cited], which might be multiplied, we hold these private wharf-owning libellants hold a species of franchise from the State of New York, by which alone they possess the right to charge wharfage, that the maintenance of a wharf whether used for the storage of goods or for mooring purposes or both is in New York as elsewhere an occupation, in Hale’s still modern phrase ‘affected with a public interest,’ and therefore subject to rate regulation by that public.” What the Circuit Court said which lends support to plaintiff’s contention in the instant case that wharfage fees are a matter exclusively of state regulation was not said <em>on the issue now before us </em>and it was seemingly based on dictum in the <em>Cannon v. New Orleans Case </em>(supra), which the Circuit Court’s opinion “especially” referred to. In the <em>New Orleans Case </em>it was held that an ordinance of the City of New Orleans, which demanded of all steamboats which shall moor or land in any part of the port of New Orleans a sum measured by the tonnage of the vessel, was a tonnage tax within the meaning of the Federal Constitution and was therefore void. Justice Miller of the United States Supreme Court was very careful to state that the <em>only </em>question that would be considered was whether or not the challenged charge was a violation of the constitutional provision <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>which “forbids the States to levy <em>any duty of tonnage </em>without the consent of Congress [italics supplied].” He expressly declared that the Court would <em>not </em>consider any provision of the Constitution which grants to Congress the right to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Therefore, so far as the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second District, above cited, rests upon <em>Cannon v. New Orleans, </em>it is not authority for the proposition that a wharfage charge made in respect to goods involved in interstate commerce, under the authority of a state is not an interference with the power of the Federal government to regulate commerce. In <em>Murphy v. Montgomery </em><a href="/ala/11/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="11 Ala. 586" data-case-ids="11256875" data-case-paths="/ala/11/0586-01">(supra),</a> which was the other supporting case cited in the Circuit Court’s opinion, the Supreme Court of Alabama said: “The true question is whether the wharf and steamboat company, or the city authorities of Montgomery, are entitled to the wharfage or toll paid for unlading at the wharf, since January 1, 1845 [when the possessory right of the company ceased].” It is clear that the issue raised on the record now before us was not raised on the record before the highest court of Alabama in the case cited.</p>

C.” Case (supra), Judge Hough said: “The questions arising in the case as stated are primarily of New York law; for, subject to the paramount right of navigation, the national Constitution and laws have left the laws and usages relating to lands bordering on tidewater and to land below high-water mark to the supervision and regulation of the several states.” In support of that statement Judge Hough cites <em>Shively v. Bowlby, </em><a href="/us/152/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="152 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="3575173" data-case-paths="/us/152/0001-01">152 U. S. 1</a>. That case held nothing inconsistent with defendants’ position in the instant case. Its holding applicable to this case was (p. 47) that “the ownership of and dominion and sovereignty over lands covered by tidewaters, or navigable lakes, within the limits of the several States, belong to the respective States within which they are found, with the consequent right to use or dispose of any portion thereof, when that can be done without <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>substantial impairment of the interest of the public in such waters, and subject to the paramount right of Congress to control their navigation <em>so far as may be necessary for the regulation of commerce: </em><a href="/us/146/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="146 U.S. 387" data-case-ids="3564406" data-case-paths="/us/146/0387-01">146 U.

C.” Case, it is earnestly contended by the defendants that the regulation of wharfage on land “bordering on tidewater” (to quote Judge Hough’s phrase) is a matter in which the State of Pennsylvania must yield its “dominion and sovereignty” to the paramount right of the United States “so far as may be necessary for the regulation of commerce.” It is clear that the “M. L. C.” Case lends no support to the position taken by plaintiff in the case now before us.</p>

The court said in that case: “We are satisfied that the trial judge was right in holding that the attempted regulation [of wharfage] here complained of would be a direct burden upon interstate commerce, and cannot be sustained under the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, by which such cases are governed. ... If the federal interstate commerce regulations do not apply to respondent as a wharfinger, the shipping board legislation does. The field is therefore entirely occupied by federal legislation and regulations. In such case it is well settled that the state is deprived of any authority to regulate such utilities.”</p>

These have always been regarded as instruments of local convenience which, for the proper protection of the public, are subject to local regulation.” The court clearly stated: “We dismiss from consideration those ferries which are operated in connection with railroads, and cases, if any, where the ferriage is part of a longer and continuous transportation.” In the case of <em>Mayor of Vidalia v.
