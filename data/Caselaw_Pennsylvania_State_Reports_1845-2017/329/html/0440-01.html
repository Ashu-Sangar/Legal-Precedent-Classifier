They are proceedings begun by citations issued by the State Board of Undertakers, to the various individuals and corporations named as respondents, to show cause why their licenses and registrations as undertakers should not be suspended or revoked for alleged violations of the provisions of the Act of June 10, 1931, P. L. 485, as <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>amended, regulating the business or profession of undertaking in the Commonwealth.</p>

In that year the Legislature (by the Act of June 7, 1895, P. L. 167) created the State Board of Undertakers. This Act provided that persons or corporations engaged in the business must register and be licensed by the Board. The Act of June 10, 1931, repealed all prior Acts relating to undertaking in the Commonwealth, and established a comprehensive system of licensure, registration and regulation. The provisions of this Act still remain in force and effect, excepting, however, that' several of its Sections have been supplemented and amended by subsequent legislation.</p>

The violation specifically charged against these respondents is defined in Paragraph (g) of Section 8 of the Act, as follows: “Loaning, borrowing or using a license of another, or of knowingly, aiding or abetting in any way the granting of improper licenses.”</p>

The respondents were notified of the hearings fixed by the Board upon the violations charged, and were present in person or were represented by counsel. After hearing testimony upon the charges, the Board filed a formal opinion in each case, with detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which it was found that each respondent had been guilty of acts prohibited by the regulatory statute. Thereupon orders were entered revoking the licenses of the individual respondents, and the licenses and registration of the corporations. Appeals were taken from the orders of revocation to the <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, in the manner authorized by Section 10 of the Act of 1931, as amended by the Act of 1935<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which provides that “Any applicant or licensee whose license has been refused, suspended or revoked by the Board shall, within thirty days, have the right of appeal to the court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County where the matter shall be heard by the Court without a jury. <em>The action of said Court shall be final. </em>[Italics supplied.] The case shall be heard upon the record certified to the Court by the Board.

At the time of the hearing before the Board he was the president and a director of Molnick’s Funeral Parlor, Inc., which offices he has held since the incorporation of the company on June 19,1935. Associated with Mr. Frankenfield in the management of the company is a certain Louis Molnick, who is not a licensed undertaker, but is registered as a student apprentice. Since its incorporation Molnick’s Funeral Parlor, Inc., has been engaged in the undertaking business at 1329 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, and all the necessary burial permits were obtained for it by Mr. Frankenfield in his name.</p>
    <p id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.7",476,[300,1560,1149,587]]]'>On August 22, 1935, the company filed an application for a corporate license with the Board.

It was charged that he had loaned his license to the corporation, thereby enabling it to engage in the undertaking business unlawfully; that as an officer of that company he had allowed it to practice undertaking without the corporation being properly licensed according to law. After a hearing at which the respondent was represented by counsel, although not personally present, the Board found him guilty of the charges and entered an order revoking his license.

He contends that he is innocent of the acts charged because the issuance of articles of incorporation to Molnick’s Funeral Parlor, Inc., with its corporate purpose described as “furnishing funeral supplies and service to the public,” without more, empowered it to engage in the undertaking business. Manifestly this contention is without merit. The approval of articles of incorporation by the Secretary of the Commonwealth merely confers corporate life. It does not authorize a corporation to engage in a business for which a license is required from a department, board or commission of the Commonwealth, merely because the intention to engage in such business is recited among the corporate purposes. This is true even though the Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, requires the Department of State to refer the articles of incorporation to such department, board or commission for approval, where the corporate purpose stated is for a business in which a corporation may not engage without the approval of or a license from such state authority. Corporate existence must necessarily precede an application for a corporate license, otherwise there would be no entity applying for the license. That this corporation was so aware is demonstrated by <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>its application to the Board for an undertaker’s license on August 22, 1935, after its certificate of incorporation had been received from the Secretary of the Commonwealth.</p>

A hearing was held upon this application on March 21, 1935, but no action was taken thereon by the Board because of notice received on the same day that the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County had issued an injunction restraining the Board from licensing or registering corporations. The injunction still remained operative when the Act of June 21, 1935, P. L. 398, was passed, prohibiting future corporations not <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>already licensed and registered from, conducting the business of undertaking in the Commonwealth. The injunction theretofore entered by the court below was made permanent and the corporation was denied a license and registration by the Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b483-3" data-blocks='[["BL_483.4",483,[151,610,1149,431]]]'>On December 19, 1935, the Board cited both respondents to show cause why their licenses should not be revoked, because they had loaned them to the Peter H. Markmann Funeral Home, Inc., a corporation not properly licensed, in violation of the provisions of Section 8(g) of the Act of June 10, 1931, P. L. 485, as amended, and because the respondents had permitted this corporation to practice undertaking.</p>
    <p id="b483-4" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[151,1053,1149,365]]]'>After a hearing the Board entered an order revoking the license in each case. The respondents appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, which affirmed the order of the Board. From the decree so entered the respondent Sullivan appealed to this Court. No appeal was taken on behalf of the respondent Hollahan.</p>
    <p id="b483-5" data-blocks='[["BL_483.6",483,[146,1441,1152,750]]]'>Respondent contends that the evidence does not support the action of the Board, and the court abused its discretion because he could not have been guilty of loaning his license, of which he stands convicted, when at all times he retained possession and control of it. The action of the Board is evidently placed upon a broader conception of the term “loaning a license,” as the expression is used in the statute, than the respondent attributes to it. He also contends that his license should not have been revoked merely because he was an officer of the corporation, when as a matter of fact he did not actively engage in the undertaking business of that company, or participate in its operations to any extent whatsoever.</p>
