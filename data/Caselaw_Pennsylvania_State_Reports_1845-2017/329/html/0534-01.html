On July 7, 1937, for default in payment of principal, interest and taxes for the years 1935 and 1936, judgment for $10,512 was entered. August 19, 1937, appellants applied for a writ of levari facias directed to the sheriff to proceed with execution on the judgment. The respondent, prothono<a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>tary of the court below, declined to issue the writ on the ground of “the failure of your Petitioners to file a statement in Court releasing the obligors from personal liability or to have the fair market value of the mortgaged premises fixed by the Court upon Petition filed as required by the Act” in question. Appellant then applied for a writ of mandamus requiring respondent to perform his duty. The mortgagor, Bichard S. Cross, intervened as a party respondent. The mandamus was refused and this appeal followed.</p>

The appellees deny these contentions.

The act applies to the entire state and is therefore not a local law; it applies to mortgage debts existing when it was passed or thereafter created.</p>

In <em>Ayars’s </em>Appeal, <a href="/pa/122/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="122 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1948405" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0266-01">122 Pa. 266</a>, at page 281, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.%20356" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="16 A. 356">16 A. 356</a>, we said: “Some of the cases above cited have been quoted at considerable length for the purpose of showing that this court never intended to sanction classification as a pretext for special or local legislation. On the contrary, the underlying principle of all the cases is that classification, with the view of legislating for either class separately, is essentially unconstitutional, unless a necessity therefor exists, — a necessity springing from manifest peculiarities, clearly distinguishing those of one class from each of the other classes, and imperatively demanding legislation for each class, separately, that would be useless and detrimental to the others. Laws enacted in pursuance of such classification and for such purposes, are, properly speaking, neither local nor special. They are general laws, because they apply alike to all that are similarly situated as to their peculiar necessities. All legislation is necessarily based on a classification of its subjects, and when such classification is fairly made, laws enacted in conformity thereto cannot be properly characterized as either local or special. A law prescribing the mode of incorporating all railroad companies is special, in the narrow sense that it is confined in its operations to one kind of corporations only; and, by the same test, a law providing a single system for organization and government of boroughs in the state, would be a local law; but every one conversant with the meaning of those words, when used in that connection, would unhesitatingly pronounce such statutes general laws. But, as was said in <em>Scowden’s Appeal </em>[<a href="/pa/96/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="96 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="494621" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0422-01">96 Pa. 422</a>], supra, ‘classification which is grounded on no necessity and has for its sole object an evasion of the constitution’ is quite a different thing.</p>

The agreement to repay may be shown in various ways; it may be (1) oral, or (2) by simple promissory note, or (3) by such note containing a warrant to confess judgment, or (4) by promissory note or notes secured by the deposit of collateral with specific power to sell for default, or (5) the security may be land in the form of a mortgage without an accompanying written obligation <em>(Tonkin v. Baum, </em><a href="/pa/114/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="114 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="550002" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0414-01">114 Pa. 414</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20A.%20185" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 A. 185">7 A. 185</a>), or (6) of a mortgage with a bond and warrant to confess judgment. The transaction may take other forms. If the borrower defaults and proceedings to collect become necessary, the lender must obtain judgment unless by the contract he has power to sell the collateral, or the mortgage trustee is authorized to sell in case of default as in <em>Bruckman Lumber Co. v. Pittsburgh Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/307/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="307 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1138194" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0561-01">307 Pa. 561</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20204" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="162 A. 204">162 A. 204</a>.

    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[283,503,1153,1499]]]'>The absence of substantial basis for selecting the special class proposed in the statute, will appear even more clearly, we think, if the typical cases of two borrowers be considered, each having property of the same kind and amount, each in default in repaying a loan of —say $1,000 — one creditor being secured by bond and mortgage, and the other by a bond without a mortgage or by a judgment note which, if under seal, is a bond. Judgment is entered in each case by means of the warrant to do so. Execution is necessary. Each defendant had land of the same value, in one case, mortgaged; in the other, not. What substantial basis can there be for discriminating ■ between the two and allowing the judgment note creditor to resort to the usual method of collecting his debt and enforcing his judgment by immediate execution, and to change that method and deprive the other, or mortgage creditor, of precisely the same right the other lender had and, in addition, subject him to possibly two years’ delay, together with a loss of interest and taxes, as provided by the challenged Act? There is nothing to justify the discrimination; to say that one creditor has a mortgage and the other has not, is not sufficient; such a difference is not a “necessity springing from manifest peculiarities, clearly distinguishing those of one class from each of the other classes, and imperatively demanding legislation for each class, separately, that would be useless and detrimental to the others.”</p>

Section 11 provides: “The provisions of this act shall not apply to the foreclosure of any mortgage held by any Federal Land Bank or the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation, if, at the time of said foreclosure, the United States of America owns a majority of the capital stock of such bank or corporation.” In the brief of the appellee section 11 is referred to in these words: “Not being affected by section 11 the appellant therefore cannot attack the constitutionality of the act now before this court” citing <em>Com. ex rel. v.

We shall refer to some of them. It has been held that a statute authorizing a prothonotary or a sheriff to sue before a justice of the peace for fees that had accrued during his term of office was the arbitrary creation of a special class; we said: “It is a special Act, in that it is designed for a particular purpose, and is applicable only to particular persons, and to them only for a limited period. In the special and restricted range of its operation, it undertakes, among other things, to regulate the practice before justices of the peace; it changes the method of collecting certain specified debts due and owing to particular persons during a certain period only; it extends the powers and duties of justices of the peace and constables ; it changes the rules of evidence in the particular cases to which alone it applies.

Allison, </em><a href="/pa/220/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="220 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1005913" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0382-01">220 Pa. 382</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.%20855" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="69 A. 855">69 A. 855</a>, is important; section 28 of the Mechanics’ Lien Act of 1901, P. L. 431, gave subcontractors and materialmen the right of attachment execution against the owner, or other party indebted to the contractor, for labor or materials furnished. It was held that, as such a method of collecting a debt was not available prior to the Act of 1901, the Act provided a new method and that, <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>as it was available only to a special class of creditors, tbe change was prohibited by the section of the constitution under consideration. The court referred to the fact that “the system of allowing recoveries by a certain class of creditors by means of a mechanic’s lien had become the fixed policy of our law long before there was any constitutional barrier against special legislation”; and it was said that, since the system had been adopted long before the constitution of 1874, a fair construction of the constitution led “to the conclusion that the intention of its framers was not to prohibit legislation relating to old methods for the collection of debts or the enforcing of judgments recognized and in general use at the time of its adoption, but to prevent the enactment of local and special laws providing new methods or changing old ones and applicable only to particular localities or to special classes. The language of the constitution is that no local or special law shall be passed ‘providing or changing methods for the collecting of debts or the enforcing of judgments.’ This can only mean that the local or special legislation prohibited is such as provides new methods, not then in existence, or changes old methods, then existing, for these purposes. The mechanics’ lien laws proper do not fall within this prohibition because they do not provide a new method for the collection of a debt or the enforcing of a judgment. The procedure under these statutes is an old method. It is a proceeding in rem, well understood and of general application at the time of the adoption of the constitution. These laws were founded upon the theory that those who furnished labor and materials in the construction of a building should have the right to file a lien against it, that is, against the structure itself into which their labor and materials entered, in preference to other general creditors, who had not directly contributed to the construction of that particular building. In such a proceeding the building could be taken even if the owner <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>had not contracted the debt. The act of 1901 provided a new remedy, a departure from the settled policy of the law relating to this subject, and gave the right to pursue the owner or other person indebted in a personal action, that is, by attachment. This new method would seem to be foreign to the whole system of mechanics’ lien laws, and heretofore was no part of it. It is in the nature of an action in personam, while the old method was a proceeding in rem. Mechanics’ lien laws proper, intended only to give the right of lien against the building itself and the ground upon which it was erected, as a security for the debt, do not contemplate anything in the nature of a personal action.” (385-6)</p>

At page 387, Elkin, J., said: “There are no manifest peculiarities in the class of creditors mentioned in sec. 28 to create a necessity which imperatively demands legislation for that particular class. As an illustration of the preference given to the special class of creditors to which sec. 28 applies, let us assume that appellant company furnished 100 barrels of cement to the defendant, which were used in the building constructed by the garnishee as contractor, and that a rival cement company furnished the same amount of cement to the defendant, intended to be used in the construction of the building, but in fact not so used, and which remained the personal property of the defendant at the time of the institution of this proceeding. In such a case the appellant company, under the provisions of sec. 28, could become a preferred creditor by attaching the fund due from the owner or contractor, while the rival cement company could only be a general creditor of the debtor, in this instance a subcontractor. In personal actions of <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>this character there is no imperative necessity which would justify the singling out of a special class of creditors from the general creditors of a debtor. The liens of mechanics and material men against the building into which their labor and materials entered are protected by the settled policy of our law for more than a century, but there is no necessity, imperative or otherwise, for extending the system so as to prefer this class of creditors in personal actions.”</p>

When difference in conditions exists to an extent that certain political subdivisions would be oppressed by general laws required for the welfare or convenience of certain other subdivisions, classification may be resorted to to provide proper legislation for each.

At this point, perhaps, particular reference may be made to the relation of appellants to the transaction which resulted in the debt and judgment in their favor, and to the manner in which the provisions of the Act would bear upon their general fiduciary responsibility. The appellants are trustees. Trustees are limited by law in their investments unless given enlarged powers by deed or will. First mortgages on real estate are among the investments permitted. If the Act were valid a trustee could not enforce his contract without assuming the responsibility of releasing and discharging (in the words of the first section) “the obligors and guarantors and any other parties liable, <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>directly or indirectly, on the mortgage debt and the owners of the property affected thereby from all personal liability on the mortgage debt, interest, costs, taxes, and municipal claims,” or of taking the risk of having the court prevent-execution for a period that may extend as long as two years; during that period (and it is a possibility which the trustee would have to consider) no income would be received for his cestui que trust, and, which would be still worse, the mortgaged property might meanwhile be sold for delinquent taxes. If the trustee sought to take possession for default, his right might be resisted and a long time elapse before an ejectment could be concluded. The trustee’s conduct in either event might, and doubtless would, subject him to a defense of his conduct in proceedings at the audit of his account. The effect of the proposed classification would make it impracticable for trustees to invest in mortgages of real estate. These considerations are mentioned as important in determining whether there is any “necessity springing from manifest peculiarities, clearly distinguishing those of one class [i. e., persons holding mortgages as security] from the other class [creditors loaning on the security of bonds or judgment notes] and imperatively demanding legislation for each class, separately, that would be useless and detrimental to the other.”</p>

The petition, under oath, must aver the fair market value of the property, with the names and addresses of all parties directly or indirectly liable for the mortgage debt (section 2). Parties not named as defendants or served with the petition “shall be deemed to be discharged from all personal liability to the petitioner on the mortgage debt, interest, and costs” (section 4). After at least ten days’ notice (by actual service or by publication in the manner set forth in section 4), a hearing is provided for. Plaintiff may then file a release of all defendants from personal liability to the extent of the fair market value of the property as alleged in the petition; if the defendant agrees, or if plaintiff will release at a higher figure acceptable by the defendant, the court is directed (section 6) to order the sale to proceed. If plaintiff fails to release, section 6 provides that testimony may be presented; the court, aided by appraisers appointed by it, shall then determine the fair market value, and allow execution. If, at the sheriff’s sale the property does not bring the value fixed, section 7 requires that the sale be postponed for a period not exceeding six months, and if at the postponed sale the property still does not bring the value fixed by the court, the sale shall again be postponed for a like period (section 8). If at the second postponed sale no bid at least equal to the value fixed by the court is received, section 9 provides that “the court may order said sale confirmed to the highest bidder, or may postpone the sale in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as the previous postponements, for such further periods not exceeding in aggregate of one year, as the court shall deem equitable and just.” Section 11 exempts from the operation of the act mortgages owned by certain corporations, the stock of which is owned by the Federal Government.</p>
