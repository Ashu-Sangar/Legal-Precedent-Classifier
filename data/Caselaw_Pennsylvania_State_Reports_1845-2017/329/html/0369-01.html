The three bonds given by the plaintiff sureties aggregated $38,000.

The plaintiffs also aver that pursuant to the demand of the School District they paid to it the principal of each bond, a total of $38,000. They then aver that the School District has been paid the sum of $38,000 plus the dividends received by the receiver, $18,452.24, and that the two $10,000 mortgages received as collateral should be treated as payment, un<a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>der tlie bankruptcy rule for distribution of insolvent estates (see <em>United Security Trust Co.

They ask for an accounting from the School District and to be subrogated to its right against the receiver. For determining whether, on the theory of their bill, they are entitled to the relief asked, the Receiver must be in court to justify, the dividends paid, to protect the rights of creditors generally, and in and to the two $10,000 mortgages held by the School District as collateral; if there were no other objections to the proceeding, it would be defective for want of parties. But there is a more serious defect.</p>

Section 709 is in these terms: “Power of Court to Make and Enforce Orders. — The court in which the certificate of possession is filed shall sit as a court of equity. It shall have the power, upon petition of the secretary, to make and enforce any appropriate order to enable him, with the utmost dispatch, to discharge his duties in connection with the business and property of any institution of which he has taken possession, as receiver, pursuant to the provisions of this act.</p>
