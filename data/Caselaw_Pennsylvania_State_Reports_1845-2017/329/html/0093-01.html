The latter, while mowing a lawn at about 2 p. m. on June 7, 1934, was run down by a “truck-tractor” to which was attached a “semi-trailer,” i. e., a trailer-chassis (hereinafter referred to as the trailer), which truck, apparently being out of control and running at an excessive rate of speed, left the north side of the pavement and hurtled onto the lawn where Fuller was working, instantly killing him. This lawn was located near the village of Harborcreek, Erie County. The trailer which was attached to the truck was the property of codefendant, the Fruehauf <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>Trailer Company (hereinafter referred to as the trailer company), a Michigan corporation engaged in the manufacture of trailers, which entered into a contract with Palazzolo, the owner of the truck, for him to tow the trailer from its plant in Detroit to a customer in Buffalo, New York. The consideration was $40. DeWall, the driver of the truck, was an employee of Palazzolo. He went to the delivery yard of the trailer company and secured the “Heavy Duty Fruehauf Semi-trailer” for transportation on its own wheels, but <em>not </em>under its own power, to its destination. This trailer had affixed to its rear a license tag of the trailer company. The truck-tractor with certain accessories, weighed about 4,200 pounds and the trailer weighed about 3,000 pounds.</p>
    <p id="b128-4" data-blocks='[["BL_128.4",128,[301,1107,1152,792]]]'>According to undisputed testimony, the accident occurred when the left front wheel of the truck-tractor “locked” as the driver swung to the left to pass an automobile which had stopped on the highway in front of him. This “locking” of the wheel was, according to testimony, due to grease which had gotten in between the brake lining and the drum, this fact being additional evidence of want of care on the part of the owner of the <em>truck-tractor </em>and his employees. The truck went over 250 feet before it could be stopped and within that space it rolled a rock two feet or more in diameter over thirty feet, and then struck the deceased. Witnesses testified that the speed of the truck was from forty to forty-five miles an hour. The driver said he was operating it from 35 to 37 miles an hour.</p>

All defendants filed motions for new trial and for judgment n. o. v. After argument the court in banc overruled the motions and ordered judgment entered on the verdict. Thereafter the court in banc heard a reargument on the motions and again discharged them. These appeals followed.</p>

This assignment will be discussed in connection with the sixth and twelfth assignments. The sixth is based upon the refusal of the court below to affirm defendant’s sixth point as follows: “The laws of Pennsylvania do not require that brakes on semi-trailers be connected with those on the truck-tractor and failure of the defendants in this case so to connect the brakes of the semi-trailer with those <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>of the truck-tractor cannot be considered as negligence on their part, unless you find that a reasonable and prudent man under these circumstances would have so connected these brakes.” The twelfth assignment is based upon the overruling of defendants’ motion for a new trial.</p>

L. 1056). But this point was refused without reading and its refusal therefore does not constitute grounds for a new trial since the subject matter of the point was fully covered elsewhere in the general charge.

    <p id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.5",130,[290,1262,1151,961]]]'>The applicable portion of the court’s charge is as follows: “You would have to find that there was negligence in the operation of this truck which was the proximate cause of the injury sustained, before you could find a verdict against the defendants, or any of them. Even though it were required by law, as it seems to be in Pennsylvania, that they shall be equipped with brakes and that the brakes shall be in use, nevertheless you would have to find, if an accident occurred, that that or some other negligence on the part of the defendant was the proximate cause of the injury, even though it were in violation of a statute. And the same would apply to the speed, although it might be in excess of a speed regulation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, nevertheless you would have to find that the speed or some other failure in the operation of the vehicle was the proximate cause of the injury, before you could find a verdict against the defendant.”</p>

However, we think that this erroneous statement did not rise to the degree of “reversible error,” because the trial judge made it clear to the jury that any verdict found against any of the defendants would have to be predicated on an affirmative finding of negligence and not on a violation of a statute. The fifth, sixth and twelfth assignments are therefore overruled.</p>

Paragraph 9 of the statement of claim reads as follows : “That the said Merle Fuller at the time of his death left surviving him his wife, the plaintiff, Helen Fuller, with whom he lived as her husband, together with two minor children.” No rule for a more specific statement of claim was asked for. The Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, 12 PS secs. 1602, 1603, provides: “Section 1. . . .

It is frequently impossible to prove by direct evidence the actual amount in money contributed by a husband for the benefit qf his wife and family. Several witnesses on part of plaintiff testified as to the age of the deceased, the expectancy of his life, his occupation, the wages he was receiving at and before the time of accident, the condition of his health, his habits of life as to industry, and that deceased was living with and keeping his wife and children. This testimony, in our opinion, is sufficient to support substantial damages.” In the case at bar the victim had a life expectancy of 31.07 years and, according to his wife’s testimony, he was “in perfect health.” These assignments of error are overruled.</p>

The questions asked him on cross-examination were answered without objection. This court said in <em>McDyer v. Eastern Penna.

As to this the garage mechanic testified as follows: “The front end of the truck, the steering mechanism and brakes and everything that had to do with the steering of it was in very bad shape. . . . From the looks of it, they were being used long after they should have been replaced.” He also testified that the brake lining was soaked with grease. The truck-tractor had been in use a long time as its mileage indicated 83,000. There was also proof of the truck being driven at an excessive rate of speed and that it was traveling at least 40 or 45 miles an hour. It traveled over 200 feet after it left the road before it came to a stop. Another witness testified that the trailer just before it left the road “was bobbing up and down and swaying back and forth.” The Vehicle Code of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, which was in effect on the date of this accident, provides in section 1002 that the class (based <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>on weight) to which the truck-tractor involved in this accident belongs, shall not exceed a speed limit of 35 miles an hour. Not only did the offending vehicle exceed this limit but there was other evidence that justified the jury in finding that under all the circumstances the truck was proceeding at an unlawful rate of speed. It would be negligence to operate along the highway at any speed a vehicle of the weight of this truck, with the mechanical equipment in such a dangerous state of disrepair as was here revealed. The truck driver testified that just before the accident he was “going along the road around 35 miles an hour.” He said: “I noticed a car in front of me . . . and all of a sudden he stopped quick without no sign of any kind and I put on my brakes to swing around him and the brakes locked and I just went over into the farmer’s lawn.” He added that he tried to release the brakes but was unable to do so.</p>

Plaintiff’s statement does not differentiate between the defendants in its charge of negligence. It avers that “each and all defendants were negligent” in the particulars already herein referred to. No distinctive act of negligence is charged against the trailer company. It is treated in the pleadings as if it had exactly the same relation to the cause of the accident as Palazzolo, the carrier, had. When we examine the evidence we find that the sole causes of the accident were (1) the <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>locking of the left front wheel of the truck, due to a mechanical defect arising from neglect in maintenance, and (2) excessive speed. It was not shown that the Fruehauf Trailer Company had any responsibility whatsoever for the condition of the greasy drum and brake lining, for the locking of the left front wheel or for Palazzolo’s driving. It is, of course, elementary that in an action for damages arising from a tort, no recovery can be had until the tort is properly pleaded and adequately proved against the alleged tort-feasor.</p>

The word “motor” as used in “motor vehicle” means “that which imparts motion, a prime mover,” as “a steam engine, a windmill, etc., any automotive vehicle” (Webster’s New International Dictionary). An automotive vehicle is a <em>self-propelling </em>vehicle, as its etymology indicates. The statutory definitions are in accord with the foregoing. In the Act of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, Article I, section 102, a “Truck-Tractor” is defined as follows: “Every motor vehicle designed and used primarily for drawing other vehicles . . a “Trailer” is defined as follows: “Every vehicle without motive power, de<a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>signed to carry property or passengers wholly on its own structure, and to be drawn by a motor vehicle”; a “Tractor” is defined as “Every vehicle which is self-propelled, equipped with metal-wired wheels or crawlers, operated or propelled by any form of engine, motor, or mechanical power; . . . ”</p>

Likewise, when an inert “automobile” or “trailer” is being towed by an “automotive vehicle,” as in the case at bar, it is only so much freight even though it does run on its own wheels. In that case, a license tag on the inert vehicle merely announces the registration of that piece of freight. It raises no presumption that the driver of the motor vehicle which is “towing” or carrying the “freight” is an employee of the <em>owner of the freight, </em>i. e., the towed vehicle, and is subject to his control. No such presumption arises for such a presumption would, except in rare cases, be contrary to the facts of human experience. If a man’s car breaks down on the highway and he engages a towing company to “tow” his car to a repair shop, the towing company is ordinarily an independent contractor, and its employees are not the employees of the man who is having his car towed.</p>

The negligence of the Fruehauf Trailer Company — and of the other two defendants — had to be pleaded and proved. It was not pleaded that the trailer company engaged an incompetent independent contractor and if such an allegation had been made the record would be barren of supporting proof. Plaintiff’s theory of her cause of action was that the license tag on the trailer raised a presumption that De Wall, the driver of the “motor vehicle” which supplied the motive power, was <em>presumably </em>the employee also of the owner of the chassis, which latter was merely so much inert matter for the motor vehicle to tow. This theory is entirely untenable. No such presumption arises from a license tag when that tag is attached to a vehicle which at the time it was involved in an accident was involved <em>primarily </em>as mere inert matter or freight and not as a motor vehicle. The fact that a certain mass of matter has the <em>form </em>of a motor vehicle does not make it a motor vehicle which gives rise to the presumption of ownership at the time it was involved in a collision or other accident <em>unless at the time the alleged cause of action arose it was functioning </em>as a motor vehicle, being propelled either by its own poAver or by force of gravity. If it was being pulled either on its <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>own wheels or on a truck or other contrivance, by a motor vehicle which was self-propelled or even propelled by force of gravity, <em>it </em>cannot be treated as a motor vehicle giving rise to the presumption referred to.

Furthermore, if these brakes should have been connected with the tractor", <em>that </em>duty was obviously the duty of the <em>carrier, </em>and not the duty of the <em>consignor. </em>When the latter contracted to have its trailer transported by an independent contractor, presumably competent and whose competence for the job assigned him, the Fruehauf Company had certainly no reason to question, its duty in respect to the transportation of that trailer was discharged.</p>

The relation of Palazzolo to the Fruehauf Trailer Company was unmistakably that of an independent contractor.

W. 991</a>, the City of Port Arthur brought suit against the Petroleum Company for damages to the city’s bridge across a ship canal in that city. The defendant, the owner and operator of an oil refinery, had loaded 1,497,676 gallons of gasoline on the steamship “Splendor,” an ocean-going tank steamer, for transportation. This steamship could not be safely and properly navigated in the Neches Eiver and in the “Port Arthur Ship Canal” without the assistance of a tugboat with adequate power to tow and guide her along a safe course through the river and canal. The Magnolia Petroleum Company owned the tug “Magnolia” and this company, with this tugboat, undertook to tow the “Splendor” through this canal and out to sea. The tugboat was under the control of the Petroleum Company and the tugboat’s captain and crew were employees of this company. The “Splendor’s” master and crew “assisted and cooperated” with the captain of the tugboat by means of whistle signals “touching the maneuvers in navigation.” The “Splendor” in its passage through the canal collided with the bridge across the canal, greatly damaging it. The question presented was whether the owner of the tugboat or the owner of the “Splendor” was to be held answerable in damages. It was held that the former was the responsible party. The Petroleum Company took an appeal and “advanced the proposition that the “Splendor” was the special master of the tug, and the tug was the special servant of the “Splendor,” and hence the relation of master and servant did not exist between the defendant [the Petroleum Company] and the tug, and the defendant was not liable for the negligence, if any, of the tug, in towing the “Splendor” down the canal.” This proposition was rejected and the <em>defendant as owner of the tug </em>was held liable for the damages suffered by the City of Port Arthur (the plain<a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>tiff) in the injuries to its bridge. The Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, in support of its conclusion, cited <em>Sturgis v.

Ed. 591</a>, where the following rule is announced: “By employing a tug to transport their vessel from one point to another, the owners of the tow do not necessarily constitute the master and crew of the tug their agents in performing the service. They neither appoint the master of the tug or ship the crew; nor can they displace either the one or the other. Their contract for the service, even though it was negotiated with the master, is, in legal contemplation, made with the owners of the vessel; and the master of the tug, notwithstanding the contract was negotiated with him, continues to be the agent of the owners of his own vessel, and they are responsible for his acts in her navigation.”</p>

An illustration of “ultra-hazardous work” is where an electric company entrusts to an independent contractor the repair of its wires used to transmit a deadly current. Illustrations of “inherently dangerous work” are the entrusting to another the use of instrumentalities such as high explosives.

If the three-thousand-pound trailer had been so much inert matter <em>on top of </em>the truck-tractor, instead of “hitched on behind” and running on its own wheels, its owner certainly could no more be charged with the death of plaintiff’s husband than could the owner of three thousand pounds of freight in a car on a railroad be charged with responsi<a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>bility for tbe death of someone who was killed because the engineer of the locomotive hauling the car containing the freight permitted the train to “run away” down a grade or because the locomotive was defective. It would be an anomaly to hold in such a case that the weight of the three thousand pounds of freight was in part responsible for the tortious death because “the pressure of this three thousand pounds” accelerated the speed of the runaway train. There is no proof whatever that had <em>all </em>the brakes, <em>incluMng the drakes on the trailer, </em>been in operation, the accident in question would have been avoided. It is a novel proposition that one who adds weight to any load transported by any vehicle is responsible for any injuries resulting from that vehicle’s colliding with somebody. Weight is one of the two factors in momentum, and if those who in any way contribute to the weight carried or pulled by a motor vehicle, should be held legally responsible whenever one of those vehicles by running away or by being operated at an excessive rate of speed causes injury to third persons, a responsibility hitherto unknown to the law would be placed on all those who as passengers ride in motor vehicles or who ship any freight by truck.</p>
