These petitions followed the rules of that county which provide the procedure for disciplining members of the bar. The misconduct charged was denied, and hearings were held by the Committee of Censors, which, on the evidence produced, recommended disbarment. Exceptions were filed in the court of common pleas, but in all but minor particulars the findings of fact were sustained, and disbarment was ordered. It is only on appeal to this Court that the procedure below is attacked as not due process. The objection is <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>that the proceedings were not initiated by the court, and as the judges had not personally heard all of the evidence, appellant was denied a substantive right.
