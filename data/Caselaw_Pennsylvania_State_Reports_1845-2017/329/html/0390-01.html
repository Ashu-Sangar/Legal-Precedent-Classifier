The first general report of the committee, popularly known as the “Goodrich Report,” was published on December 15, 1936, under the title “A Modern Public Assistance Program for Pennsylvania.” This report recommended: “That Pennsylvania’s program of public assistance of needy persons at home, including general poor relief, unemployment relief, aid to dependent children in their own homes (known as mothers’ assistance), and in foster homes, old age assistance, and aid to the blind, be unified and simplified and be administered through a single public organization in each county, subject to supervision by a single permanent department of the State government.”</p>

L. 2051, which eliminates the poor board’s historic function of providing public aid for persons in their own home and places responsibility for administration of such relief upon sixty-seven county boards, one in each county; Act No. 395 of June 24, 1937, P. L. 2003, which creates the Department of Public Assistance and the State Board of Public Assistance and defines the powers and duties of each; Act No. 396 of June 24, 1937, P.

In consolidating all relief and assistance agencies, it eliminates 400 taxing units of government and reduces the assistance organizations in each county to no more than two, and separates home assistance (Act No. 399) from institutional assistance (Act No. 396) and subjects the former to supervision by the State Department of Assistance and the latter to that of the State Department of Welfare. These acts remove the last reason for the continued existence of the poor board system, and mark <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>the culmination of an evolution that has been taking place for nearly a century and a half.</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[164,469,1151,1077]]]'>Townships were the units of poor administration provided by the earliest legislation on the subject (Act of January 12,1705, Statutes at Large, vol. 2, chapter 54) and were continued so by subsequent acts: Act of March 9, 1771, 1 Sm. L. 332; Act of March 25, 1782, chapter 951. By 1798 the transition from township to county units had begun. The Act of February 27, 1798, ch. 1960, provided for the erection of almshouses in Chester and Lancaster Counties and substituted county directors of the poor for the township overseers. By 1808 similar changes had been made in seven other counties. By a series of further special acts, twenty additional counties were established on a county unit plan. Pursuant to the general Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 78, fifteen more counties were so established. To these were added by the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 762, six additional counties, and two more by the Acts of April 11, 1929, P. L. 508, and of May 28, 1931, P. L. 208. Of all the 67 counties, only fifteen did not conform to the county unit plan when Act No. 396 made it applicable to all.</p>

They are single townships, combinations of townships, of boroughs and townships, of townships and cities, and in a few cases comprise territory which crosses county lines. In some instances they have totally ceased to function, and in some their offices have no incumbents. In Philadelphia some districts remain from the time when townships were the uniformly prevailing units of poor administration outside the then limits of the city, covering areas which have long ago been absorbed by the city, and long since lost their township identity except to give boundaries to these poor districts. As early as the Act of 1705, supra, Philadelphia was constituted a distinct and entire district. The policy in favor of having it so has not changed; re<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>vision of archaic poor laws has merely not kept pace with the expansion of the physical limits of the city.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[269,459,1148,693]]]'>Act No. 396 is not the result of a sudden recognition of the existing conditions. They were recognized in the passage of the Act of 1879, supra. It applied uniformly to every county in the Commonwealth, but being optional its effect was not as genei'al as its plan. The situation was studied by a legislative commission appointed in 1921 and continued in 1923. It recommended abolition of the smaller districts. The recommendation was adopted only in part by the Act of 1925, supra. It made so many exceptions that we thereafter had occasion to remark that “the classification of poor districts is and always has been very badly mixed up”: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. v. Liveright, </em><a href="/pa/308/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="308 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1140242" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0035-01">308 Pa. 35</a>, 83.</p>

With the exception of first- and second-class cities (Article II) each county is created an institution district (section 301) to be administered by the county commissioners (section 302). Where this arrangement has not already prevailed, existent poor districts are abolished (sections 301, 601). The officials of the old poor districts, whether county poor districts or independent districts, are retained for their terms as employees of the new district (sections 302, 601). As similarly provided in the Acts of 1879 and 1925, independent districts continue for the purpose of winding up (section 601). Liquidation is placed in the hands of the commissioners of the counties in which the districts are (section 602) or the commissioners of both counties where the district lies in more than one (section 603). Where the new and old districts are coterminous the property of the latter is transferred to the former (section 301). Where they are not, it is transferred to the municipal subdivision or subdivisions in which the old district existed with the option in the new county dis<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>triet to rent or purchase on certain conditions (sections 602, 603). And where a former district lies within a first-class city its property is transferred to the city (section 201). Various powers, duties and regulations for the administration of county institution districts (Article III) and for the administration of all institution districts, whether county or first or second class cities (Article IV), are established. The foregoing is the general framework of the act. We shall deal with certain parts of it more particularly where necessary in connection with the discussion of the constitutional questions raised.</p>
    <p id="b431-4" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[147,1009,1153,415]]]'>A statute is constitutional until it is shown to be otherwise. A presumption always favors it because the General Assembly has jurisdiction of all subjects on which its legislation is not prohibited, for which reason the provisions of the Constitution should be liberally construed and in favor of constitutionality. With this in mind we shall answer seriatim the numerous objections made.</p>
    <p id="b431-5" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[148,1445,1150,260]]]'>1. Does Act No. 396 of June 24, 1937, P.

    <p id="b431-6" data-blocks='[["BL_431.6",431,[144,1716,1153,696]],["BL_432.1",432,[292,352,1149,210]]]'>It is contended that this provision is violated because the act does not provide merely for the poor but covers this subject as well as a number of others, namely, the care of children, deaf and dumb or blind persons, mental and other patients without regard to indigence or dependency. This argument is based on a forced construction of language perfectly plain in its context. There is no violation of this clause when various subjects are connected with and germane to the one general object of the legislation. Plurality of subjects is not objectionable so long as they are reasonably germane to each other: <em>Mallinger v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/316/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="316 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1159009" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0257-01">316 Pa. 257</a>, 261.

An examination of the body of the act indicates that it has but one subject and one purpose only. It provides for indigents needing institutional care.</p>
    <p id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[290,571,1152,1833]],["BL_433.1",433,[169,346,1149,98]]]'>The title of the act refers to “indigent persons and children.” There can be no doubt that this means indigent persons and indigent children as the act throughout demonstrates. Defining the duties of the new institution district authorities with respect to children, section 405 provides that “it shall be their duty to place in foster homes or in institutions or homes for children all dependent children who are in, or committed to, their charge, and whose placement and care are not otherwise provided for. . . .” Other sections [401(d), 406] which have to do with paying the bills incurred in the discharge of that duty, while referring to children without the adjective “dependent,” must be read in connection with section 405. Undoubtedly the provisions relating to children mean dependent children only. The same objection is raised with regard to deaf and dumb or blind persons. Section 401(c) invests local authorities with the duty “to care for any dependent having a settlement in the county or city who is deaf and dumb or blind. ...” Power is given to discharge the duty by contracting “with any association in Pennsylvania organized to provide a home or employment for deaf and dumb or blind persons. . . .” It is evident that this clause refers to cases in which local authorities are relieved of the duty of caring for such persons in a county institution, and consequently must refer to dependents. There would be no thought of providing for them if not dependents. There is not the slightest doubt of this when the section is considered as a whole. The plain language of the act is indicative of its general purpose, namely, the care of dependents. This applies to and disposes of the objection that section 401(e), requiring local authorities to pay for the “maintenance of mental and other patients confined in institutions, State men<a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>tal hospitals, and other State institutions . . .,” includes patients not necessarily poor.</p>
    <p id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[167,455,1150,695]]]'>Also attacked under this objection are sections 601, 602, and 603, which abolish existing poor districts except for the purpose of liquidating their affairs. The liquidation of existing districts is thought to be unrelated to the provisions setting up a system of new institution districts. Plainly it is not. It provides merely for an orderly transition from the old to the new, is perfectly germane to the general purpose of the act, and similar provisions were so recognized in the Acts of 1879 and 1925. The single object of this act, toward which all its provisions tend, is to provide a uniform and comprehensive system for institutional care of the poor.</p>
    <p id="b433-6" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[166,1163,1151,369]]]'>The title is ample to indicate the subject matter of the act and is not misleading.

Expressly mentioned as officers of the institution districts are county commissioners and treasurers; this was enough to cause auditors and controllers of counties to realize that in the performance of their usual duties they would be required to include the new institution districts. The title expressly says that the property of abolished poor districts would be transferred. This was notice to municipal subdivisions, townships, boroughs, or cities, that they might be the transferees under the terms of the act. We said in <em>Commonwealth v. Macelwee, </em><a href="/pa/294/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="294 Pa. 569" data-case-ids="1113375" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0569-01">294 Pa. 569</a>, 571, “ ‘An act concerning townships’ is notice to all persons located <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>therein and to every subordinate municipal division of the State located wholly or partially within them, that there may be, in the body of the act, something which affects his or its interests. ...” Similarly here, the change to a county unit system was so complete, and the fact so obviously appeared in the title that anyone interested in the government of counties or lesser municipal units was bound to take notice of the contents of the act. It must be remembered that the constitutional provision as to titles was intended to curb “the vicious practice ; . . of incorporating in one bill a variety of distinct and independent subjects of legislation [the real purpose of which] was often and sometimes intentionally disguised by a misleading title or covered by the all-comprehensive phrase, ‘and for other purposes’ with which the title of many ‘omnibus’ bills concluded”: <em>Road in Phœnixville, </em><a href="/pa/109/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="109 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="542296" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0044-01">109 Pa. 44</a>, 48; <em>Sugar Notch Borough, </em><a href="/pa/192/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="192 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="908988" data-case-paths="/pa/192/0349-01">192 Pa. 349</a>, 355.

It would be difficult to imagine how it could be made more comprehensive as to territory, or more uniform and general in its effect. It is true that by its provisions it abolishes independent poor districts, winds up their affairs, and transfers their property, and that this only applies where independent districts exist. This results because many anomalous poor districts without counterpart anywhere were specially created in <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>the past. Of such the Central Poor District of Luzerne County and the Middle Coal Field District of Carhon and Luzerne Counties, involved in the cases before us, are perfect examples. There are many others.

The duty to care for the poor has, indeed, been taken away from the old districts, but not the duty to pay debts incurred for their care in the past.
