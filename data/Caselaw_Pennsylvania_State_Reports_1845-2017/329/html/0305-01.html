But the learned court below was of opinion that, as D. Edward Fisher was the son by a former marriage of the then wife of Dr. Fisher, “the intention of a husband adopting his wife’s child would be not to cut off her rights [of inheritance?] as natural mother and to make the child <em>Ms </em>child to the exclusion of her, but rather to make the child <em>their </em>child, and to assume merely the role of father and to share with his wife, as natural mother of the child, the responsibility of caring for. <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>and rearing the child, ...” He also said, “It is probable that a stepfather would become so attached to his stepchild that he would want to make him his own, but it would be most improbable that a mother would consent to that procedure if the effect would be that the child would be no longer hers. The predominating intention in such cases must be to bring the household into one legal, as well as actual, family, but this could not result if the rights of the mother were cut off.” Accordingly, he concluded that on the death of the adopted son, the inheritance passed out of the family of Dr. Fisher (thus excluding his brother) and vested in the natural mother.</p>

Now, were we to hold that Della Elizabeth Thomas, the adoptive granddaughter, could not succeed her deceased father in his inheritance rights in her adoptive grandmother’s estate, she would, by our actions, be left in a most unfortunate and regrettable position; for her father’s adoption has deprived her of all hope of ever inheriting through him anything whatsoever from his natural ascendants or natural collateral heirs. Such a ruling would leave the minor deprived of all paternal ascendants and collateral kinsmen, both natural and adoptive.
