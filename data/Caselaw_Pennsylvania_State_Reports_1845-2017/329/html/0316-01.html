During the term he purchased a mortgage on the property which antedated the lease. On default he foreclosed and purchased the property. The lease contained an option agreement, by which appellee-tenant might purchase the property from the owner for a stipulated amount exceeding that actually expended by appellee in acquiring the property on foreclosure. Appellants were also indebted to the tenant on two promissory notes. In this action to recover on these notes, <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>the landlord attempted to set off and counterclaim the difference between the purchase price fixed in the option agreement and that paid by appellee at the sheriff’s sale. Their theory was that the tenant’s purchase of the property at sheriff’s sale should be treated as an election to exercise the option right. The court below disregarded this claim and granted appellee’s motion for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, sustaining the statutory demurrer to appellants’ set-off and counterclaim. Judgment was entered for the tenant for the amount due on the promissory notes.</p>
    <p id="b350-4" data-blocks='[["BL_350.4",350,[302,962,1148,369]]]'>Appellants’ proposition is novel. They argue that between landlord and tenant there exists a relationship confidential to such an extent that though the latter may acquire for his own protection an outstanding encumbrance on the premises, he may not issue execution thereon; that, if he does, the action should be regarded as an election by law to exercise an option right.</p>

Gans, </em><a href="/pa/7/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="957796" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0117-01">7 Pa. 117</a>; <em>Garrard v.

But in this line of cases where vendee contracts to buy and vendor to sell land for a certain price, though vendee in fact secures the property, not in pursuance of the agreement but at public sale, it has been held equitable that vendee should pay vendor the agreed price, with a deduction for the amount required to satisfy the encumbrance. The reasoning is that vendor’s covenant of title has been performed with the removal of the mortgage encumbrance at sheriff’s sale; that vendee could not have secured specific performance against another purchaser at the sheriff’s sale save by paying the price specified in his contract with the original vendor, and should receive no advantage from the purely fortuitous circumstance <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>that he himself was the purchaser; <em>and, lastly, that vendee has received exactly that which he bound himself to buy.</em>

A consideration of the nature of an option to purchase shows the failure of the analogy. An option is a contract to keep an offer open: Restatement of Contracts, sections 24, 46; 1 Williston on Contracts (1920), section 61. It contemplates a subsequent contract of sale, which will, however, only arise if the optionee elects to exercise his option rights by accepting the offer: <em>Boyer v.

Ct. 523</a>; 2 Williston on Contracts, section 894. Until the optionee elects to purchase the property by an unequivocal acceptance, there is no contract for the sale of land. The optionee is not bound until he accepts the offer. Therefore it does not help appellants to point out what the result of appellee’s conduct might be had there been a contract of sale. The mere fact that an optionee, like the vendee under a contract of sale, may have some interest in the land prior to the election to purchase, does not create a relationship between optionor and optionee that would compel this court to declare the purchase of the property by the latter on foreclosure an exercise of the option.
