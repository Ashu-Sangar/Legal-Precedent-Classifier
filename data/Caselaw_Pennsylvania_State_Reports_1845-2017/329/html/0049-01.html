The wholesomeness of the prohibited thing will not render the act unconstitutional. The temptation to fraud and adulteration may be a consideration leading to regulative or prohibitive legislation.” Nor is the act discriminatory, as plaintiff contends, because it does not prohibit the sale of other food products containing either skimmed milk or cocoanut oil, or both, as an ingredient, — for example, oleomargarine, milk chocolate, confectionery, wafers and crackers. This argument overlooks the fact that where the combination of evaporated skimmed milk and cocoa<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>nut oil is easily mistaken for ordinary condensed milk, the probability of extensive deception in the sale of so unique and vital a human food as milk justifies the legislature in prohibiting the sale of such a product without similar action in regard to articles not thus likely to be confused with other foods of superior nutritive value. Of course, filled milk may properly be classified as different from whole milk, and plaintiff is treated in the same manner as all other manufacturers and sellers of filled milk.</p>

Between the time when the March act was passed and the passage of the June supplement, the legislature apparently came to realize that the use of filled milk as a food product was probably not harmful for adults and, as to them, its sale might safely be permitted, but the legislature was still firmly of the opinion that if filled milk were relied upon as a diet for infants grave malnutrition would result. The legislature had before it evidence to the effect that the butterfat in natural milk — the animal fat which nature provides in mammals for suckling their young — performs a unique biological function as a food, largely because of its vitamin A content, that when infants are deprived of this milk constitutent they are subject to retardation of growth and to the inroads of scurvy, rickets, respiratory diseases, and even afflictions of the eye; and that, in general, there is no efficient substitute for whole milk in infant diet. It is true that pediatricians recommend that children be given orange juice, tomato juice, cod-liver oil and other substances, because, though the most nearly perfect of foods, even natural milk is not wholly sufficient for infant feeding, but the peril of defective nutrition is much greater with the use of filled instead <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>of whole milk. It appeal’s, too, from the evidence in the present case that housewives, especially among the poorer classes of people, are apt to purchase products such as those sold by plaintiff without realizing or knowing that they are not getting a concentrate of whole milk, but a substance which, from the standpoint of food value, is deficient for the feeding of their children; the fact that plaintiff’s product is cheaper in price than condensed or evaporated milk naturally lures them into its purchase. The legislature, taking all this into consideration, and having in mind, therefore, that even though there be no misrepresentation by plaintiff as to the ingredients in its product, mothers, through ignorance, were likely to be deceived as to its inferior value for nutritive purposes, decided that while the ban might be lifted from such a pi’oduct for other purposes, it should still remain in force as to its sale for infant feeding. In order to accomplish this result, the legislature passed the June statute, providing that evaporated skimmed milk or any compound containing it could be sold in hermetically sealed cans or receptacles if these contained at least five pounds net weight, were labeled “Unfit for Infants,” and were not sold under a fictitious or trade name.</p>

It argues that if its product is wholesome its sale should be permitted; if unwholesome, it is no less so if sold in large cans. The argument is plausible but fallacious. Plaintiff’s witnesses all admitted that if, instead of its product being sold principally in <em>14y2-</em>ounce cans as at present, it were packed in five-pound cans, it would be purchased only by restaurants, hotels, confectioners and other users of the product in bulk, but not by mothers and housewives, partly because of the larger outlay required, and partly because the contents of such large cans would outlast the period during <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>which the product would remain fit for domestic consumption. Thus the regulation as to the size of the cans, the provision as to the label, and the prohibition of the sale under a trade or fictitious name, are all aimed to accomplish the desired objective of discouraging and practically rendering impossible the purchase of filled milk for use as a diet for infants. Being reasonably suited to accomplish a proper purpose, such regulations are not prohibited by the Constitution. It may be that a less drastic label, as, for example, “Not sufficiently nutritive for infants,” would have served the purpose, but the regulations and restrictions adopted by the legislature being within the general scope of its power, and not being unreasonable, it is for that branch of the government, not the courts, to determine the exact methods to be employed to promote the public health, welfare and safety: <em>Armour &amp; Co. v. North Dakota, </em><a href="/us/240/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="240 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="3690077" data-case-paths="/us/240/0510-01">240 U.

While the June, act does not attempt to impose regulations upon the sale of ordinary skimmed milk unless it is either concentrated or compounded, this does not work any improper discrimination, because, while skimmed milk is, of course, equally unfit for infants, it is so commonly distinguished and its true nature so well known by all likely purchasers that there is not involved the same probability of misapprehension and deception in its sale as in the case of its canned concentrates and compounds. At best this was a subject properly within the reasonable discretion of the legislature.</p>

The latest and most comprehensive act in our state is the Milk Control Law of April 28, <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>1937, P. L. 417.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> By the terms of that act, as well as by judicial decision, the milk industry has been declared to be “affected with a public interest”: <em>Rohrer v. Milk Control Board, </em><a href="/pa/322/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="322 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1167827" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0257-01">322 Pa. 257</a>; <em>Nebbia v.

Surely there is no conceivable subject of legislation more peculiarly within the police power of the State. The Act of June 29, 1923, — apart from any question in regard to the constitutionality of the Act of March 21, 1923, — is so clearly a reasonable and proper regulation in the interest of the public health, especially of child welfare, that its validity is beyond question.</p>
