They said the truck was lent to the driver on <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>the evening in question and that he was engaged upon an enterprise of his own. They admitted he was at times employed by them and that he lived with one of them, whose daughter he later married. Their testimony is characterized by the trial judge, in the opinion he filed, as unusually evasive. He states they repeatedly contradicted their own testimony, which the record discloses to be the fact, at first denying that they were partners and subsequently admitting it, equivocating on the question whether the truck was used in the business, and then conceding that it was; one of them, who saw the truck when it left their premises saying that it was empty and later admitting that it had stove fire brick in it (they were dealers in stoves) which they claimed they had given to a sister of the driver, setting up that he was transporting it to her, to be put into a stove which they alleged also was a gift to her. The court concluded defendants and the driver testified falsely, and that their credibility on the controlling questions in the case, whether the driver of the car was at the time their servant and engaged on their business, was for the jury. It is the contention of appellants that neither of these two elements, essential to recovery, was proven, that the endeavor to establish them by calling defendants under cross-examination failed, and that plaintiff, having called them as under cross-examination, and not having contradicted them, is bound by their denial of the two essential facts and therefore did not make out her case.</p>

Reviewing the court’s conclusion, we stated (p. 349) : “‘There may be such a degree of improbability in the statements themselves as to deprive them of credit, however positively made’: . . . And the witness ‘may be contradicted by circumstances as well as by statements of others contrary to his own’: ... ‘It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the jury is bound to accept evidence as true, although not contradicted by direct evidence. Thus, where there is some intrinsic improbability in the statements of the witness, and he has shown himself un <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>worthy of credit by his attempt to falsify a collateral transaction involved in the suit, the jury may reject his testimony as incredible, although he is not impeached or contradicted by direct evidence’: . . .
