No. 363, January Term, 1937, is an appeal from a judgment sustaining the act in a proceeding for declaratory judgment had in the court below.

It provides, “In every city of the first class, the offices of poor director and of poor auditor of each poor district created by local law or remaining in existence as a former borough or township poor district are hereby <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>abolished, except to the extent necessary to liquidate the affairs of the district.

L. 259, 18 Statutes at Large 644, under which the district was created, is not expressly repealed. The purpose of the present act to comprehend every poor district in the city and to include them in a department of the city government is too clear to admit of any doubt.

It is conceded that the district, being a governmental agency within the control of the legislature, has no rights to continued existence, although its charter is in terms perpetual. “Indeed, the legislature of this Commonwealth, under the Constitution, could not by contract invest any municipal corporation with an irrevocable franchise of government over any part of its territory. ... If the legislature were to attempt to erect a municipality with a special provision that its charter should be unchangeable or irrevocable, such provision would be a nullity”: <em>Philadelphia v. Fox, </em><a href="/pa/64/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="64 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1021273" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0169-01">64 Pa. 169</a>, 181. The property of the district as well as its life is within the control of the legislature.

When the legislature transfers the functions, and annexes the territory of one municipal corporation to another, the property of the municipality annexed vests ipso facto in the consolidated unit: <em>Mount Pleasant v. Beckwith, </em><a href="/us/100/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="100 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="4617" data-case-paths="/us/100/0514-01">100 U. S. 514</a>, 528; see <em>D’Esterre v.

Hence, of course, the legislature may expressly so transfer the property of the municipality that is abolished: <em>Hunter v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/us/207/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="207 U.S. 161" data-case-ids="3640845" data-case-paths="/us/207/0161-01">207 U.

All this may be done, conditionally or unconditionally, with or without the consent of the citizens, or even against their protest. In all these respects the State is supreme, and its legislative body, conforming its action to the state constitution, may do as it will, unrestrained by any provision of the Constitution of the United States”: <em>Hunter v. Pittsburgh, </em>supra, at pages 178-179. The same principle controls, a fortiori, in cases of governmental agencies, such as poor districts, having more limited powers than have cities. Thus in <em>Petition of East Fruitvale Sanitary District, </em><a href="/cal/158/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="158 Cal. 453" data-case-ids="1987677" data-case-paths="/cal/158/0453-01">158 Cal. 453</a>, 457, <a href="/citations/?q=111%20P.%20368" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="111 P. 368">111 Pac. 368</a>, which concerned the abolition of a sanitary district, it is said, “It is generally held that where one municipal corporation is annexed to another the annexing city takes over the functions of the annexed municipality, and the latter by virtue of the annexation is extinguished and its property, powers and duties are vested in the corporation of which it has become a part. ... If this be true where one of two municipal corporations having coextensive powers is annexed to another, the same result must follow a fortiori where a public corporation having powers more limited than those of a municipal corporation is annexed to a city <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>which possesses all of the powers of the corporation which has been annexed and others in addition.” Similarly in <em>Rylands v. Clark, </em><a href="/ill/278/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="278 Ill. 39" data-case-ids="4872019" data-case-paths="/ill/278/0039-01">278 Ill. 39</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20N.E.%20829" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="115 N.E. 829">115 N.

There a statute gave control of the public buildings of Philadelphia directly to the Department of Public Works as an independent body divorced from the administration of the city. This is precisely what the present act does not do. Section 201 provides, “. . . The laws as to the care of dependents shall be administered throughout each city of the first class by the department of public welfare of the city, and each such city shall constitute an institution district for the purposes of this act. <em>Such district shall not exist as an entity separate and apart from the dty hut shall he administered as a department of the city government. . . </em>. ” [Italics added.] Consequently, the Department of Welfare remains a regular department of city government. It makes no difference that throughout Article IY of the act the Department is comprehended within the term “local authorities.” This does not make it independent of the city government. As we have said in the opinion already filed the term “local authorities” is used so that the provisions of Article IY may apply equally to county districts and to first and second class cities.</p>

The reason •for the inapplicability of the restriction has been stated in a case of our own. “These sections [Article IX, sections 8 and 10] limit the power of a municipality to incur new debt and prescribe the details that must be observed in so doing. It is well settled that annexation or consolidation . . . does not operate as an increase of debt. It is the incurring of new debt that is limited by the sections of the Constitution, to which reference has just been made”: <em>Moore v.

It is claimed the act does not apply to abolish the corporation entitled, The Managers for the Relief and Employment of the Poor of the Township of German-town (No. 363, January Term, 1937). What is said above in connection with the same claim of the corporation of the Townships of Oxford and Lower Dublin likewise applies here. Whatever the name, and whether incorporated or not, every independent governmental agency that theretofore was charged with the care of the poor in Pennsylvania was a poor district within the meaning of the act, the terms and purposes of which are too comprehensive to admit of any other interpretation.</p>
