L. 239 (12 P. S. 2571 et seq.). The petition for citation was for the recovery of possession of premises at 4716-18-20 Baltimore Avenue, Philadelphia, a motion picture theatre property, and was instituted against Earl M. Forte, the person in possession of the premises, as respondent, on behalf of Northern Trust Company (successor trustee), purchaser of the premises at a sheriff’s sale on March 1, 1937. Mr. Forte answered the petition by claiming that he was entitled to remain in possession by virtue of a lease for five years from February 1, 1937. The matter having been disposed of by the court below upon the petition and answer, we must go to these pleadings to obtain the facts, and we find them to be as follows:</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[282,1164,1149,1127]]]'>In 1927, Albert Aiken owned the premises in question. As owner he gave a first mortgage on the premises for $190,000 to Jacob E. Brown. The bond and mortgage, by duly executed assignment, went to the Philadelphia Company for Guaranteeing Mortgages. The Philadelphia Company then executed a declaration of trust of the mortgage and sold the usual participation certificates. Receivers were appointed by the Federal Court for the Philadelphia Company in 1933. In December of 1936, the Northern Trust Company was appointed trustee under the first mortgage in substitution for the Philadelphia Company in receivership. In 1930, however, title to the premises passed to the Upright Building and Loan Association after foreclosure proceedings on the second mortgage. Thereafter in 1934, the building was conveyed by the Association to Herman Cohen, who reconveyed it to the Association in 1936. In the meantime in 1935 the Banking Department took over the Association’s assets, including these premises, and it remained in such possession until the foreclosure of the mortgage to which we will shortly make reference.</p>

He avers that the Deputy Receiver “accepted and agreed to” the notice of renewal and modification. He also charges that he gave a similar notice, a month later, to William H. Groetzinger, Jr., a “duly authorized officer and agent of said Mortgage Service Company, . . . that he, the respondent, had elected to renew said lease, modified as to rental as aforesaid,” and that in “the early part of November, <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>1936, lie called on William L.

No new lease was ever entered into between the parties.” All of the above notices to exercise the option to renew and extend the lease for a further term of five years, and the modification of the rental and all of the acceptances, acknowledgments, affirmations, and agreements relating thereto were verbal and not in writing.</p>

On March 8, 1937, the sheriff delivered his duly executed deed for the premises to the trustee. Two days later the trustee formally demanded possession from Mr. Forte and he refused to vacate the premises. As a result the proceedings under the Act of 1905 (supra) were instituted which resulted in the judgment of ouster and possession, from which this appeal is taken.</p>

A purchaser at a sheriff’s sale through legal proceedings under such a mortgage has the paramount right of possession over the tenant, sub<a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>ject to no limitations. This tenant can assert no right of possession by virtue of this lease paramount to that of the purchaser at this judicial sale. Section 14 of the Act of April 20, 1905, P. L. 239 (12 P. S. sec. 2585) provides as follows: “The right of possession of a tenant for years shall be deemed paramount to that of a purchaser at a judicial sale if, and only if, the letting to him shall precede in point of date the entry of the judgment, order or decree on which such sale was had, and also shall precede the recording or registering of the mortgage, deed or will, if any, through which by legal proceedings the purchaser derives title, unless the letting is made with actual notice to such tenant of the contemplated entry of such judgment, order or decree, or of the fact of the execution of such mortgage, deed or other instrument of writing, and with intent to avoid the effect thereof.”</p>

Tie concedes “that without an affirmance of the lease it could not bind the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, for the mortgage antedates the lease by almost five years, and so takes precedence over it as provided by Section 14. ...” The first question that presents itself is: When was it affirmed? Certainly no fact is set forth in the pleadings showing an affirmation of this lease subsequent to the judicial sale. The sheriff’s sale took place on March 1, 1937; the Sheriff’s Deed Poll was delivered on March 8,1937, and on March 10, 1937, the tenant was notified in writing that he was “to vacate the premises and deliver possession thereof to the said Northern Trust Company, successor Trustee, prior to March 17, 1937.” And so likewise the pleadings are devoid of facts showing a waiver by the mortgagee or purchaser of its right to disaffirm the renewed lease. Not one affirmative act is charged, in the pleadings, to the mortgagee, such as the acceptance of rent after the <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>judicial sale, tending to show a renunciation by the purchaser of his statutory right, or which may tend to show a waiver of the purchaser’s right to disaffirm the lease. See <em>Curry v. Bacharach Quality Shops, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/271/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="271 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="295672" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0364-01">271 Pa. 364</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.%20435" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="117 A. 435">117 A. 435</a>. The tenant’s answer is also silent on the question as to whether or not any notice was given at the sheriff’s sale of the alleged agreement. No purchaser at such a sheriff’s sale would be bound by any such agreement. It is conceded that there is no recorded agreement prior to the judicial sale. This being the state of the record we must hold that this lease was discharged by this sale and the tenant’s right to possession was lost.

He argues that the appellee, the mortgagee, who “was the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale . . . had expressly agreed while in possession of the premises prior to the foreclosure that the lease as renewed should be affirmed . . . ,” and then asks: “Why should it matter that the affirmance took place prior to the foreclosure and not afterwards?” What was the nature of this affirmation, as pleaded, on the part of the appellee? It is, that during the term of the lease and prior to the foreclosure proceedings, defaults having occurred, the mortgagee took possession for a brief period from November 13 to November 27, 1935, for the purpose of collecting rents, ...” and on . . October 24, 1936, . . .

The Mortgage Service Company is described in the answer as the “agent for Philadelphia Company for Guaranteeing Mortgages, for which petitioner is successor trustee under said mortgage. . . . ” In his brief of argument the appellant states that “the mortgagee’s title, while essentially a form of security for the loan, nevertheless enables the mortgagee to enter into actual possession at any time, if he can do so peaceably. <em>Bulger v. Wilderman and Pleet, </em><a href="/pa-super/101/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="101 Pa. Super. 168" data-case-ids="692918" data-case-paths="/pa-super/101/0168-01">101 Pa. Super. Ct. 168</a> (1930). <em>But this mortgagee chose rather to collect the rents from the existing tenancy, and so assumed constructive possession only” </em>(italics supplied). We cannot see how the facts as pleaded amount to anything more than the acceptance of rents by the mortgagee prior to foreclosure, and it certainly does not attain the dignity of an attornment by the tenant to the mortgagee. In <em>Randal v. Jersey Mortgage Investment Co., </em><a href="/pa/306/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="306 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1136900" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0001-01">306 Pa. 1</a>, 5, <a href="/citations/?q=158%20A.%20865" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="158 A. 865">158 A. 865</a>, Justice Simpson, speaking for this court, said: “Whenever a mortgagor or one claiming title under him leases the mortgaged premises after the execution of the mortgage, his rights are necessarily subject to the prior rights of the mortgagee or his assignee, unless there is an agreement otherwise. Hence, if, under such circumstances, upon notice to the tenant, the latter pays the rent to the mortgagee or his assignee, <em>it is equivalent of am, attornment </em>[italics supplied], and the mortgagor and those claiming title under him, cannot justly complain of such payments.”</p>

The payment of rent to the mortgagee in possession is <em>not </em>an attornment. For “his possession is never absolute, but only a security or pledge for the debt due him. He must account to the mortgagor for the rents or profits received; and when his debt is paid, the mortgagor is entitled to have back his possession . . . ”: <em>Bulger v.

The acceptance of the rents and profits under a lease by a mortgagee in possession does not affect or alter the tenant’s relationship to the parties. There is neither privity of estate nor privity of contract created by this act between the tenant and the mortgagee in possession. “As between the parties it is a conveyance, so far as is necessary to enforce it as a security.

It merely is an acknowledgment by the attornment that “the freehold is in another, or that such person is his landlord.” See 1 Words &amp; Phrases Judicially Defined 637.

By way of answer, the oral agreements were set up, but the petitioner argued that these were in derogation of the Statute of Frauds; and the judge in his opinion supporting the decree stated that he considered this one question alone, and he based his decision on the Statute. We therefore cannot hold that the petitioner, either by act or omission, waived.its right to plead the Statute of Frauds as a defense.

The first is alleged to be in writing “on or about February 1, 1933” modifying the rental for the ensuing year only. This written agreement was between the lessor and the lessee. The second and third modifications of the amount of rent to' be paid by this lessee were orally agreed to in 1934’ and 1935 for the respective ensuing years and were likewise solely between the lessor and the lessee. “Subsequently when the Banking Department of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania took possession ...” the modification was orally extended for the “balance of the term.” But all of these modifications have been fully executed and therefore they can present no issue now. This position is sustained by both reason and authority. See <em>Davis v. Hillman, </em><a href="/pa/288/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="288 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1100840" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0016-01">288 Pa. 16</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.%20254" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="135 A. 254">135 A. 254</a>, and <em>Davis v.

It is the variation of the rental for the full term of five years from February 1, 1937 (which is <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>wholly executory since no rent has been accepted under this new term), from that set forth in writing in the option to renew the written lease, that the petitioner urges makes the exercise of the option unenforceable by reason of the Statute of Frauds. The tenant’s answer is that he exercised the written option contained in the lease as orally “modified at the reduced monthly rental referred to ... , which . . . was accepted and agreed to . . . ,” and that therefore the agreement upon which he relies is not an oral agreement, but a written agreement the rental terms of which were orally modified, and that this takes his case out of the Statute of Frauds. <em>Did </em>the oral modification of this written option reduce the writing to the legal status of. a parol contract? In <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Diamond Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em><a href="/pa/234/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="234 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="982492" data-case-paths="/pa/234/0100-01">234 Pa. 100</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=83%20A.%2054" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="83 A. 54">83 A. 54</a>, this court, in an opinion by Justice Mestrezat, said: “It is the doctrine of this court, declared in numerous cases, that where a written agreement is varied by oral testimony the whole contract in legal contemplation becomes parol. If there is anything settled in our law that principle is firmly established. When therefore a party to an executory agreement in writing for the sale of lands succeeds in reforming it by oral testimony he reduces the whole agreement to a parol contract, and deprives himself of the right to have it specifically performed. He pulls down the house on his own head. When he converts the writing into an oral agTeement, the statute declares it to ‘be void.’ He has rectified the written contract and in its place has established an agreement which in contemplation of law is parol and therefore, by statutory mandate, absolutely invalid<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and without force. . . . The statute is not a <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>mere rule of evidence, but a limitation of judicial authority to afford a remedy.”</p>

The modification of a contract is subject to the same test to determine validity as is the original contract. See Williston on Contracts (1936), Vol. 2, p. 1709, sec. 594; <em>Swain v.

His insuperable barrier is the fact that the written lease here was subsequent to the mortgage and that therefore “no privity of estate or contract is created between” the mortgagee “and the lessee.” Since there was no privity of contract between the appellant and the appellee, the former is without standing to seek enforcement of the agreement invoked. Even if it should be conceded that appellee became a party by an oral agreement to an oral extension of a written option in a written lease between others, that option was one making the term of the lease exceed the term of three years. Such a lease to be effective against one who refused to be bound by it is required to be put in writing and “signed by the parties so making or creating the same or their agents thereunto lawfully authorized by writing.” This record presents no such writing signed by either the mortgagee in pos<a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>session or by its agent or its successor or by tbe purchaser at this judicial sale.
