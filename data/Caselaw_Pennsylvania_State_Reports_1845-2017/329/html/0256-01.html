On a return of n. e. i. to the original and alias subpoenas, service was. had on respondent by publication. Appellee did not appear at the hearing before the master, nor was she represented by counsel. There is no dispute that the cause for divorce was clearly established. As no legal question is raised on the evidence, because of its character, it will serve no useful purpose to recite it in detail. It is sufficient to say that it shows a course of conduct on the part of appellee which undoubtedly entitled her husband to seek an end to their marital status. The master recommended a decree, which was granted on August 6, 1935.</p>

Despite the fact there is no statute or written rule of court requiring the prothonotary of the Superior Court to issue notices when orders have been entered, we understand that he has customarily assumed such a duty. This practice, grown to a custom, to notify counsel of the decisions of the Supreme and Superior Courts likewise obtains in the Eastern and Western districts. Neither appellant nor his counsel knew, nor had any reason to believe, there had been a mistake in the prothonotary’s office. Under the circumstances they were entitled to expect this notice. The Harrisburg District is composed of twelve counties, and the opinions on cases arising there are handed down at various places at which the court sits, usually cities other than Harrisburg. Counsel lives in Adams County, and it would impose too great a burden to require him to daily inform himself by telephone. Appellant, through his at<a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>torney, was lulled into security by this practice, and his failure to receive such notice is sufficient reason for us to hold that appellant should be permitted an appeal.

The former are based on fatal defects apparent on the face of the record, while petitions to open concern other matters associated with the decree or judgment, or those upon which the decree or judgment is based, in other words, the merits of the controversy ending in the final judgment. Where, therefore, the judgment is being attacked for a matter of record, the proper motion is to strike off or vacate, which operates as a demurrer to the record: <em>O’Hara v.

Where, however, new evidence relating to the cause of action must be introduced in order to sustain the attack, the judgment or order should not be vacated or set aside, but should be opened for the purpose of admitting the new evidence.

Co., </em><a href="/pa/218/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="218 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="999623" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0423-01">218 Pa. 423</a>, 425: “It is well settled, and it needs no citations of authorities to sustain the proposition, that a judgment can be set aside or struck off only on the ground of irregularity or invalidity appearing on the face of the record.

Gilliland, </em><a href="/pa/67/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="67 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1022612" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0034-01">67 Pa. 34</a>, ‘Opening a judgment and striking it off are two entirely different things.

Nor was there fraud on the court in appellant’s failure to testify to his purchase of a house in Washington, since that was merely a single factor to determine what his mental state as to residence was. We will speak of this later. At best, this evidence could only cast doubt on his own interpretation of “bona fide residence.” There was no deception or fraud.

At the original hearing it was shown that Nixon, an army officer, was subject to be ordered anywhere by the War Department, and, as such officer, could not claim any station as a permanent home — generally these officers call their place of birth or the residence of their parents their home. Appellant was born in Gettysburg in 1895 and lived there until he was appointed to the United States Military Academy in 1915. Since his graduation in 1918, he has been continuously in the service of the United States Army, traveling from place to place in the performance of his duties. In 1922 he married the appellee in Brookline, Mass., where her home was, and from then on she lived with him at each place to which he was assigned. He testified that he had never established a residence elsewhere, that though he had never voted, he never registered elsewhere to vote; he annually gave his residence to the War Department as Gettysburg; his mother was still living there, and at his home he kept various of his personal belongings.

It would be most unwise to hold that if a citizen enters into a government service that has no fixed place of employment, he is to be deprived of his rights as a civilian under the laws of the state of his origin.

The burden was on appellee to prove a changed residence and that the alleged new dwelling really constituted a new residence. This was flatly contradicted by the depositions on the other side, indicating that the house was bought according to the custom of many such government employees who, assigned to service in Washington for a period of time, purchase houses rather than rent them, to avoid exorbitant rental charges. They consider it quite easy to dispose of such property either by sale or lease in the event of transfer to a new post. There being but “oath against oath” as to appellant’s state of mind on acquiring the Washington dwelling, appellee <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>did not bear the burden thrust upon .her by the presumption that the original bona fide residence of the appellant remained such. The fact appellant paid a tax required by the laws of the District of Columbia on all persons “maintaining a place of abode” there, does not create a residence in that place, for the statute expressly recognizes that such persons may have a “legal residence” elsewhere.
