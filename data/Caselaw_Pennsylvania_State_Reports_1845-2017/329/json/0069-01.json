Donegal and Conoy Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 301 Pa. 351, at 356. The statute of limitations must be specifically pleaded. It is not a matter of which the court will take judicial notice from the facts contained in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim: Barclay v. Barclay, 206 Pa. 307; Carter v. Vandegrift, 74 Pa. Super. Ct. 26. But, defendant having pleaded the statute of limitations as a defense and set it up at trial, the burden was then on plaintiff to raise the issue of its applicability: Reading Co. v. E. J. Keller Co., Inc., 100 Pa. Super. Ct. 579.\nJudgment affirmed.",
