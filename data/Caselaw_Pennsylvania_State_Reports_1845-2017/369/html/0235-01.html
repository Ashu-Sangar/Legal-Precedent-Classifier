      <em> </em>To permit an insurance company to protect itself with defenses, limitations, reservations and exceptions would be detrimental to the public interest and would defeat the very purpose of the act. <em>Since the purpose of such policies is to indemnify innocent third persons and protect the general public, </em>all such policy defenses are taken from the insurer”: <em>Montgomery v.

In the operator’s policy certificate which the defendant prepared and sought to file with the Department of Revenue, it recited that in compliance with the Act of 1933, as amended, <em>it had issued </em>its policy to Scholler, that the policy was <em>“in full force and effect </em>and will so continue until the expiration of fifteen days after notice of cancellation shall first have been given to the Secretary of Revenue, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in writing”. No notice of cancellation was ever given to the Secretary. Condition No. 4 of said policy states “Such insurance as is afforded by this <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>policy for bodily injury liability . . . shall comply with the provisions of the motor vehicle financial responsibility law of any state which shall be applicable with respect to any such liability ... to the extent of the coverage and limits of liability required by such law . . .”. It will be noted that the policy does not say that the filing and acceptance of the operator’s policy certificate prepared by it is a condition precedent to the issuance of its policy. Under all the facts in this case and in view of the familiar principle that an insurance policy prepared by the insurance company should, in the event of doubt or ambiguity as to its meaning or interpretation, be construed most strongly against the party who has drawn it: <em>Snader v.

Section 13 of defendant’s policy provided: “If the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by this policy the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the declaration bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible against such loss . . .”.</p>
