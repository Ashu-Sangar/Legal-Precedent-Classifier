As the learned Auditing <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>Judge points out, this rule had its origin in the English case of <em>Ringrose v. Bramham, 2 </em>Cox 384, 30 Eng. Reprint 177 (1794), where the testator provided, “I also give to Joseph Ringrose’s children £50 to every child he hath by his wife Elizabeth ... I also give to Christopher Rhodes’s children, that he hath by' his wife Peggy, £50 to every child. . . .” The court there said: “,. . if I am to let in all the children of these two persons born at any future time, I must <em>postpone </em>the <em>distribution </em>of the testator’s personal estate until the death of Joseph Ringrose and Christopher Rhodes, or their wives . . . until I know how many legacies of £50 are payable.” (Italics supplied.) It must be remembered this was an executor’s account and the rule there adopted solved the very practical difficulty of reserving a sufficient sum to meet the contingency of an unknown number of future births, or in the alternative withhold <em>all </em>distribution for an <em>indefinite </em>period from other distributees presently entitled. It is to be noted also that the words of this testator “children that he hath by his wife” were of equivocal import so that the rule there adopted was no doubt a proper solution.</p>

A familiar example of that eventuality is the Rule in <em>Shelley’s Case, </em>which became so fixed that it more often thwarted a grantor or testator’s-intent than observed it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The case of <em>Storrs v.

It was held the class closed as of the death of the testator thus extending the rule of convenience to a case where the testator’s words clearly indicated futurity. The decision seeks to explain away the words “may be born” by asserting these words would be satisfied by the period, of time between the date of the will and the date of the death, yet this is no explanation at all because even <em>without </em>such words of futurity, children born between the date of the will and testator’s death were always regarded as being within the class: 3 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>7th Ed. 1930, page 1669.</p>

In this case the basic reason, which gave rise to the “rule of convenience” is <em>not </em>present. There is here no gift of principal to any member of the class in question that vested at testator’s death. Aside from a few minor legacies given outright to nonmembers of the family by Item Second only <em>income </em>is given. No distribution is made of the principal to any family beneficiary and the whole or\it is withheld until the date of the termination of the trust as hereinafter noted. Indeed, the learned Auditing Judge admits the reason giving rise to the rule does not here exist and frankly says, “If this testator intended that the executors pay $100,000 [income] legacies to grandsons living at his death, and that the trustees of residuary estate pay similar legacies to the afterborn, it must be admitted that there is no practical difficulty in so do<a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>ing. The residuary trust will remain intact until The expiration of twenty-one (21) years after the death of my (the testator’s) last surviving grandchild or great-grandchild living at the time of my decease.’ Distribution at the termination of the residuary trust will not be delayed, because it does not seem possible that the trust can terminate before the death of testator’s two sons, when the class of grandsons will be complete.” It therefore serves no purpose to restrict words of futurity of the gifts here made to the period between the date of the will and testator’s death because when such restriction serves no purpose, words of futurity are not to be restricted to date of testator’s <em>death </em>but are projected at least to the <em>date of distribution </em>and it was expressly so held in <em>Heisse v.

Item Fourth is identical with Item Third under which the trust set up for the granddaughter, Louise, is stated to be, “. . . for the term of her life.” Upon her death the trustees are to pay the income from this trust to her issue “. . . until the time for the distribution of the principal of my estate arrives, as fixed in ITEM ELEVENTH hereof.” When the time arrives for the distribution of the principal of testator’s estate, the principal of this trust is to be paid to the issue of Louise per stirpes.

But to give a grandson born <em>after </em>the <em>testator’s </em>death a life estate would not only offend the rule against perpetuities but be inconsistent with the pattern of testator’s will. However, as Judge Bolger correctly points out in his dissenting opinion, this argument assumes that the trust for the two granddaughters fit in with the pattern of the will, whereas, in fact, they do not. This because Item Eleventh which fixes the date of the termination of the trust expressly excludes these two granddaughters as measuring lives as well as from participation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> in the corpus of the residue, and passes the corpus of their trusts on to their issue in default of which it falls into the residue.</p>

Hence, what happens in such event poses a problem equally inconsistent with the pattern of the will. It shows also that testator- failed to provide for that contingency, but such failure is no reason to deny the trusts for the granddaughters in face of the express language creating them. Neither does the fact that the testator failed to provide for the contingency of the after born grandson surviving by more than 21 years the last surviving measuring life of the trust furnish any reason for refusing to give due effect to the express language which standing alone is applicable to after born grandsons as well as those born in his lifetime. In other words, as said by Judge Bolger, “The <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>patterning of the gifts to grandsons . . . does not involve the question of whether an after born grandchild shall take, but only as to <em>how and to what extent </em>he shall take: Bowen’s Estate, 139 Superior Ct. 523.”</p>

Technically such an award <em>is </em>a distribution but it is not the <em>kind </em>of distribution which warrants the application of the rule of convenience. What Judge Ashman stated in Bonaffon’s <em>Estate, </em><a href="/citations/?q=14%20W.N.C.%20501" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="14 W.N.C. 501">14 W. N. C. 501</a>, 502 (1884), is peculiarly appropriate on this point. Said that learned jurist in dismissing exceptions to Judge Penrose’s adjudication, “In a gift to children as a class, the law aims to postpone as far as possible the period of distribution, in order to bring, within the scope of the testator’s bounty the largest number of beneficiaries. But the rule has been broken, upon the ground of convenience, where a literal adherence to it would sacrifice the interests of living children to secure the possible rights of children who may yet be born.”</p>

Consequently he points out that the increase provisions for the named granddaughter trusts appearing in the first and second paragraphs of the same item (Fifth) each begin with the same condition as the paragraph 3 creating the grandson trusts, viz., “In the event my estate . , . shall at least amount to a net sum of 5 million.” Since, proceeds the opinion, the time of the determination though not fixed must necessarily be at the audit of the executor’s account, and not thereafter, so far as the first two paragraphs are concerned the testator must have so intended as to the third. Waiving aside the obvious answer that this does not necessarily follow because had the testator <em>not </em>repeated the same condition the gifts in the third paragraph would have been free of it, it is clear that if the testator in paragraph 3 had added (what we hold is clearly implied) the additional words, “whether born before my death or after,” the fact that the increase of the granddaughter trusts was properly determinable at the time of the audit could not be held to overcome such words. Nor can that fact overcome the words which the testator actually used which we have demonstrated at the beginning of this opinion clearly imply the same thing.</p>

Though he did not think it necessary to decide that question, he took care,'in effect, to charge any future claims of after-born children on the fund awarded by him to the executors-trustees, thereby properly leaving the question to be decided if and when it might arise. In passing we note that counsel for the accountant at that audit was Mr., later, Justice Barnes, who had been testator’s personal counsel and witnessed his will. His acquiescence is somewhat indicative of the fact that afterborn children were intended to be included, otherwise he would no doubt have had a guardian or trustee ad litem appointed for that audit and the question <em>then </em>settled.</p>

By the will testator erected a $100,000 trust “for the benefit of each and every male child of my sons who shall by birth inherit and bear the name of Earle.” This was followed by a gift of the residue, under which testator erected a trust, disposing of both income and principal which is to endure to the utmost limit of permissive remoteness — lives in being and twenty-one years thereafter: <em>Warren’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/320/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="320 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1163620" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0112-01">320 Pa. 112</a>, 113, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20396" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="182 A. 396">182 A. 396</a>. The beneficiaries under the residuary trust were the widow (since deceased) and each of testator’s five named children and their issue.</p>

Earle III is taken from the residuary trust, such payment diminishes the shares of income and principal not only of George H. Earle III and his four other sons, and their issue, but also of testator’s other children and their issue. In other words, <em>the estate already given and bequeathed is necessarily cut down and diminished. </em>To accomplish this effectively requires clear and unequivocal language: <em>Haydon’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/334/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="334 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1190718" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0403-01">334 Pa. 403</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20581" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="6 A.2d 581">6 A. 2d 581</a>; <em>Harris Estate, </em><a href="/pa/351/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="351 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="462747" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0368-01">351 Pa. 368</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20715" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="41 A.2d 715">41 A. 2d 715</a>; <em>Fink et al. v. Stein, </em><a href="/pa-super/158/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="158 Pa. Super. 464" data-case-ids="1063309" data-case-paths="/pa-super/158/0464-01">158 Pa. Superior Ct. 464</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20A.2d%20249" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="45 A.2d 249">45 A. 2d 249</a>. It must be conceded that testator used no <em>express language </em>directing that afterborn grandsons of the name of Earle should have their $100,000 trust funds paid out of the residuary trust. It is only by <em>necessary implication </em>that such an intent may be declared. The majority in their opinion seek to demonstrate such implied intent. To attempt to analyze and answer the many points submitted in substantiation of the claim of proof of implied intent, would result in entering a labyrinth of generalities and legal principles, most of which I freely concede, but which clear<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>ly have no application to this case. The inferences of testamentary intent which are so voluminously submitted become less convincing the more they are advanced. And strange as it may seem, apparently in an effort still further to strengthen their contentions, the majority not only conjecture what <em>testator </em>intended but venture to suggest what <em>counsel </em>regarded as testator’s intent. In the opinion it is said: “In passing we note that counsel for the accountant at that audit was Mr., later, Justice Barnes, who had been testator’s personal counsel and witnessed his will. His acquiescence is somewhat indicative of the fact that afterborn children were intended to be included, otherwise he would no doubt have had a guardian or trustee ad litem appointed for that audit and the question <em>then </em>settled.”</p>
    <p id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[216,1205,1149,767]]]'>In construing wills it is my opinion that there should be no straying from the solid and well defined highway of testamentary construction. We should refrain from entering the misty swamp of testamentary conjecture, following an illusory will-o’-the-wisp seeking to determine what we <em>surmise </em>was testator’s true intent. It is axiomatic that in expounding a will it is not what the testator may have meant, but what is the meaning of his words. This principle is analogous to a provision of the Statutory Construction Act: “The object of all interpretation and construction of laws is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the Legislature; . . . the letter of [the statute] is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”</p>

It would be unnecessarily repetitious for me to restate what they have so well said', and with which I thoroughly agree.</p>
