There was no written agreement of sale but a receipt signed by the plaintiff was given for the first payment of $1,000. Prior thereto, viz., on February 21, 1947, the Governor had approved plans for the relocation of a state highway through the farm and on July 27th, after the property had been conveyed by plaintiff and his wife to defendants by the aforementioned deed the description of which included the bed of the relocated highway, the plaintiff executed a quitclaim deed to the Commonwealth and received $850 as damages for the land condemned by the Commonwealth.</p>

McKeen, </em><a href="/pa/112/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="112 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="546828" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0315-01">112 Pa. 315</a>, 322, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20A.%20542" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 A. 542">4 A. 542</a> (1886), and <em>Eby v.

The court held the new highway as it had been staked out was sufficiently visible and defendants were bound by this principle. The rule to open judgment was accordingly discharged. Upon an appeal, the Superior Court, by the same line of reasoning affirmed saying in the course of its opinion, “They [defendants] examined the farm before buying it, and, in the language of the Memmert case <em>[Memmert v.

Here it cannot be said with any degree of confidence that the relocated road was plainly visible or even indicated at the time the defendants agreed to purchase and paid the down money.

We are of the opinion, however, the controlling date is <em>April 15th, </em>when they agreed to buy the farm, paid $1,000 down and received plaintiffs receipt. The testimony shows that both defendants had inspected the farm a few days previously, between April 10 and April 15th, at which time the bargain was made. At that time no construction of the relocated road had been started. The only indication that a relocation might be in prospect was some old stakes which the wife defendant testified had been there for 3 years or more. This is confirmed by the testimony of the highway engineer that on April 10th only the original survey stakes were there, as they had been since 1940 or 1941, and that new stakes were customarily not put in until just before construction started. Also there was express testimony that when the purchase was being negotiated nothing was said by the plaintiff about a state highway going through the property. We do not think, in these circumstances, it can be said as a matter of law that the situation was so clear that defendants can be charged with the same knowledge of an easement as in a case where well defined, visible,notorious roadways or other physical encumbrances are apparent. None of the cases cited go that far. At most, the facts must be more fully developed and it should be for a. jury to say what indications existed and what conditions were apparent that might charge the defendants <em>at the time the land was purchased </em>with the knowledge of the prospective servitude.</p>

Believing that it has never entered the minds of the parties, when selling and buying lands in this state, to conceive that a covenant against encumbrances extended to public roads or highways, as such, and that the universal understanding of both sellers and purchasers has been in opposition to it, . . . we are convinced beyond all possible doubt, that there is no ground for holding the public highway on the lots in question to be an encumbrance within the meaning of the parties as manifested by the terms of their contract. Although a public highway no doubt is, in many instances, an injury instead of a benefit to the holder or owner of the land upon which it is located, and therefore tends to lessen its value in the estimation of a purchaser; yet it is fair to presume that every purchaser, before he closes his contract for his purchase of land, has seen it and made himself acquainted with its locality and the state and condition of it; and consequently, if there be a public road or highway <em>open and in use </em>upon it, he must be taken to have seen it, and to have fixed in his own mind the price that he was willing to give for the land, with a reference to the road, either making the price less or more, as he conceived the road to be injurious or advantageous to the occupation and enjoyment of the land.” (Italics supplied.)</p>

Section 210 of the State Highway Law of June 1, 1945, P. L. 1242, as amended, 36 P.S. pocket part 670-210, in substance makes the approval by the Governor of the plans for relocation of a highway a condemnation of an easement for that purpose and requires the. recording of the approved plan in the office pf the Recorder of <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>Deeds in the proper county.

The effect of the general warranty was not satisfactorily discussed, but the right of the grantee to recover from the state was expressly mentioned. It is to be noted also that the decision was- by a divided court. Chief Justice Sharswood and Justice Trunkey dissented and Justice Paxson was absent. Since the decision was rendered it has never been cited by this court on the proposition here discussed and must, at best, be regarded as a doubtful precedent. <em>Peck v. </em>Jones, <a href="/pa/70/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="70 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1028228" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0083-01">70 Pa. 83</a>, (1871), turned largely on the question of the sufficiency Of the averments of an affidavit of defense. In that ease also there was a mere plotting of the street at the time of the conveyance and defendant grantee had his remedy for damages against the municipality when the street was later opened. The opinion does say, “the actual opening of a public street or highway . . . would not . . . entitle the vendee to maintain an action for the breach of his covenant of general warranty” citing <em>Dobbins v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa/12/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="12 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="963739" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0075-01">12 Pa. 75</a> (1849). But an examination of the <em>Dobbins </em>case shows that Chief Justice Gibson treated the warranty there as a <em>special </em>warranty for he said at page 80, “An explicit covenant against all the world [i.e., a general warranty] would bind him [the grantor]; but the law is not so unreasonable as to imply it.” <em>Peck v. Jones </em>likewise has never since been cited by this court on' the proposition here discussed. .</p>
