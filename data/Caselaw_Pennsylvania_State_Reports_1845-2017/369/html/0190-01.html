    <p id="b263-7" data-blocks='[["BL_263.11",263,[195,1022,1148,486]]]'>The appellant, Guerino Carluccetti, was tried upon two indictments charging him, respectively, with the murder of Emilio and Laura Giovannetti, a husband and wife. The defense was insanity at the time of the killings. The jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree on each indictment and fixed the penalty at death. Motions for a new trial were filed and overruled; and the defendant took these appeals from the judgments of sentence entered on the verdicts.</p>
    <p id="b263-8" data-blocks='[["BL_263.12",263,[194,1530,1148,485]]]'>The homicides were committed in the early morning of April 2, 1935, in the village of Swatara Station, Dauphin County, which adjoins the town of Hershey on the west. Carluccetti was then thirty-eight years old, married and living with his wife and two minor daughters in a dwelling at Swatara Station. For at least fifteen years next preceding the day in question, he had been employed by the Hershey Chocolate Corporation.</p>

While there, he made a full and complete statement on the afternoon of the same day, under interrogation by police officers, as to his perpetration of <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>the homicides and the attendant as well as the immediately antecedent circumstances. A State policeman typed the statement which Carluccetti signed and swore to before a local justice of the peace, his signature being witnessed by three subscribing State policemen. Further investigation, which the State police promptly undertook, developed the fact that Carluccetti had priorly complained to friends and acquaintances that the victims of his homicidal assault had been making false and slanderous statements concerning him. Because of this information, the State police on the succeeding day (April 3rd) took a second statement from the accused at the State police barracks in Harrisburg in the presence of a county detective and four State policemen. That statement confirmed the first in all respects and contained the additional matter as to the slanders which Carluccetti said had been circulated about him; it was likewise reduced to typewritten form and signed by him. Both of these statements were received in evidence at trial over the defendant’s objections. There neither was nor is, however, any suggestion nor intimation that the statements were obtained as a result of intimidation or overreaching on the part of the police. Not only was the accused informed by the police of his right to remain silent, but, in the second statement, he expressly averred that his counsel (identified by name) had instructed him that he did not have to make any statement if he wished not to do' so. Nor were the statements otherwise impugned so far as the participation of the police in obtaining them is concerned. After the second statement had been taken, Carluccetti was lodged in the Dauphin County jail at, Harrisburg to await trial on anticipated indictments for murder which were duly returned.</p>

Spear, a neurologist and psychiatrist of Baltimore, Maryland; <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>and on subsequent petition of counsel for the defendant, the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Dauphin County on May 24, 1935, appointed a commission to examine into the defendant’s current mental capacity. On June 24, 1935, the commission, having heard several witnesses of whom Dr. Spear was the principal one, reported to the court that the defendant then lacked the mental capacity requisite to his standing trial; and, by order of court entered on the same day, he was transferred to the Farview State Hospital at Waymart, Wayne County, Pennsylvania. He remained there until May 20, 1949, when, upon petition of the Superintendent of the hospital, setting forth that Carluceetti was sane, the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Dauphin County entered an order releasing the defendant from the State Hospital to the custody of the Sheriff of Dauphin County to await trial on the two indictments for murder standing against him. The trial was had in September 1949 with result as already stated.</p>

His sole defense was that he was insane at the time of the killings. A recital of the facts is essential to a consideration of the eight reasons which the appellant advances why the convictions should now be set aside and a new trial granted.</p>

Ceresini agreed and the two of them set out in his automobile. En route, the defendant told his cousin that he wanted to see their uncle, Henry Selvaggi, in Philadelphia. When asked why, “He said that there were people around Hershey talking about him [Carluceetti], that he was in the Black Hands.” He said that the people who were doing the talking were Emilio and <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>Laura Giovannetti and one Ottavio Pace and that “If they didn’t stop talking about him he would kill them.” The defendant saw his uncle upon the latter’s return home from work in the late afternoon and, in private, complained to him that people “where he lived” were bothering him and calling him “all kinds of names.” Upon the uncle’s counselling him to “go home and stay with your family, and don’t tangle with them people,” the defendant told his uncle that if “them people bother me too much, if they keep on bothering me and calling me Black Hand, some day I will kill somebody.” The visit ended shortly thereafter and Ceresini then drove the defendant home. The things that the Giovannettis and Pace, or one or the other of them, were saying about the defendant, according to him, were that he was a member of the Black Hand, that he had tried to have improper relations with Mrs. Giovannetti, and that he had been guilty of some unnatural practices.</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[255,1341,1147,1037]]]'>About 6:15 a. m. on April 2nd, Ottavio Pace, on his way to work, was walking on the sidewalk in front of the defendant’s home. The defendant was in the yard digging a small hole to plant a bush. Pace greeted the defendant and asked him why he was not going to work, receiving a response from the defendant that he was “off today”. When Pace had walked on six or seven feet, he heard a shot. He turned around and asked the defendant, “Bill, what are you shooting for?” Pace then ran across the street to where his brother-in-law, Alfonse Carluccetti (a brother of the defendant) and Joe Pompino were standing and urged them to “Do something, he is shooting me.” The defendant with revolver in hand, having followed Pace, warned “Let him be, I want to finish him.” He then fired three more shots, two of which struck Pace, as had also the first shot, as evidenced by the fact that Pace had three bullet wounds in his body. He recovered, however, and testified at trial.</p>

      <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>After shooting Pace, the defendant proceeded a distance of some two hundred feet to a double frame dwelling house the one side of which was occupied by the Giovannettis and the other side by a' family named Martini. An alleyway to the rear ran along either side of the house. The defendant, passing in front of the Giovannetti portion of the dwelling, used the alleyway on the Martini side in order to get to the rear of the Giovannetti residence. At the back stoop of the Martini home, Basilio Martini, the father of the family, was bending over brushing some dirt from his trousers. The defendant, “afraid”, as he later explained, that Martini “was going to stop [him] from going to the Giovannetti house”, shot him. The wound was not serious and Martini recovered but died of natural causes some time before the trial.</p>

Mrs. Giovannetti came downstairs, but, seeing the defendant, who had his automatic revolver in his hand, she ran back upstairs and her husband came down with a shotgun. Giovannetti asked the defendant the reason for the commotion. The defendant deceptively told him that someone had shot him which caused Giovannetti to go to the doorway leading to the outside whereupon the defendant shot him several times from behind. Giovannetti wheeled around and the defendant shot him again in the chest. The wounds proved immediately fatal and Giovannetti fell to the floor. The defendant then fired a shot up the stairway but did not hit anyone. He laid his revolver on a table (saying later that it then contained two cartridges which he had reserved to kill himself) and picked up from the floor the shotgun which he unbreached and found to be not loaded. He went upstairs with the shotgun and followed. Mrs. Giovannetti <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>who was backing toward the bathroom. There, she either slipped or fell into the bathtub where the defendant rained blows upon her head with the shotgun until he had beaten her to death.</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.5",268,[281,568,1145,320]]]'>Having killed the Giovannettis, the defendant took his revolver from the table, left the house and retraced his steps toward his home. On his way there, his fourteen year old daughter knocked the gun from his hand. He was at once overpowered by a bystander and placed in the custody of the police.</p>
    <p id="b268-5" data-blocks='[["BL_268.6",268,[281,900,1146,652]]]'>In support of his defense of insanity, the defendant relied upon the testimony of Hr. Spear, the neurologist and psychiatrist who had examined him a month after the killings and had testified before the commission in June following. On the question of the defendant’s mental condition at the time of the homicides, the Commonwealth called in rebuttal some fifteen witnesses most of whom had been associates or acquaintances of the defendant for many years up to the time of the homicides and had been friendly with him either in the community where he lived or as fellow workers or lodge members.</p>

In the light of the testimony adduced by the Commonwealth, most of which is undisputed, the appellant can mean only that the fair preponderance of the evidence established that the defendant was insane at the time of the homicides and, therefore, was not legally responsible for them. Assuming for the moment that the appellant knew what he was doing when assaulting his victims and knew that his conduct was wrong (both of which facts the jury’s verdicts established), there can be no question that the elements of willful, deliberate and premeditated murder were present. The distinguishing feature of murder, namely malice, was present. The <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>killings were unlawful and, being suck, malice was directly inferable from the conduct of the perpetrator: see <em>Commonwealth v.

And, where there is a specific intent' to take life, which may be inferred from the fatal use of a deadly weapon against a vital part of the victim’s body, a verdict of murder in the first degree is justifiable: see <em>Commonwealth v. Samuel </em>Jones, supra, at p. 526 and cases there cited.</p>
    <p id="b269-3" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[209,1054,1148,989]]]'>As sanity is the legally recognized normal condition of human beings, its existence in any given instance is presumed. Consequently, the burden of proving insanity as a defense to a criminal charge is upon the one asserting it. It is incumbent upon him to establish the alleged defective mental condition by a fair preponderance of the evidence: <em>Commonwealth v. Iacobino, </em><a href="/pa/319/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="319 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1162358" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0065-01">319 Pa. 65</a>, 68, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.%20823" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="178 A. 823">178 A. 823</a>. Throughout, the issue remains one of fact for the jury to determine. As recognized for this court in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Iacobino, supra, — “The presumption of sanity, which is the normal condition of man, 'holds good, and is the full equivalent of express proof until it is successfully rebutted [citing cases] ’ ”; or, as otherwise stated in the <em>Iacobino </em>case (p. 69), — “Where mental capacity at the time of the act is an issue, the Commonwealth is aided by the presumption of sanity, it is not required to prove affirmatively mental capacity to commit the act.”</p>

The proof which the defendant offered as to his mental condition failed to overcome the presumption of sanity. The testimony of his expert, Dr. Spear, upon which he so largely relied, was uncon<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>vincing to the jury. On the other hand, the lay witnesses whom the Commonwealth called in rebuttal testified that they had never noticed anything about the defendant that led them to believe that he was of unsound mind. There was, moreover, direct objective testimony concerning the defendant’s actions, conversations and statements immediately prior to and on the day of the killings from which the jury could infer that he knew what he was doing when he killed the Giovannettis and knew that it was wrong, which, after all, is the test of legal insanity rather than whether the accused was mentally ill from a medical viewpoint.</p>

This testimony was clearly competent. Its admission in evidence was, therefore, not error. In <em>Commonwealth, v. </em>Wireback, <a href="/pa/190/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="190 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="905137" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0138-01">190 Pa. 138</a>, 145, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%20542" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="42 A. 542">42 A. 542</a>, a like complaint was made of the testimony of lay witnesses who knew the defendant and who were permitted to testify that they had not discovered anything in his conduct, manner and appearance that would lead them to believe he was of unsound mind. This court held the testimony to be competent and, in overruling a cognate assignment of error, said, — “The witnesses were not asked to give their opinion affirmatively, as to whether the defendant was of sound mind, for they had stated nothing to warrant such opinion; but whether they had noticed anything in his conduct or conversation irrational or indicating insanity at the times they saw and talked with him, was clearly competent.” It is where a witness is offered to testify affirmatively that a person is of unsound mind that he must first give the reasons upon which he bases his opinion. The distinction was <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>well stated for this court hy Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Schaffer in <em>Commonwealth v.

A lay witness, who has had contact with one whose mental state is the subject of inquiry, may testify, after stating his opportunities for observation but'without first stating all the facts justifying his conclusion, that he has observed nothing in the conduct or speech of the individual which would lead to the opinion that he is not of normal mind: Com. v.

However, the appellant now complains that the court’s answer to the request “. . . was in effect putting on a par with the testimony of the mental expert, Dr. Spear, the testimony of all of the sixteen lay witnesses.” There was no error in that: see quotation from Judge Maxev’s charge to the jury in <em>Commonwealth v.

The mere fact that the defendant was in custody and in the charge of police officers when he gave the confessions did not make them any less voluntary: <em>Commonwealth v.

When Dr. Spear was being cross-examined with respect to the memory displayed by the defendant on the day of the killings and the succeeding day, as indicated by the similar factual accounts contained in the two confessions, he stated that the defendant “would have signed anything that was presented to him. ... If they told him to sign it he would have done it.” By further answer, the doctor implied that the defendant signed the confessions at the direction of the police without having known what was in them. At that point the trial judge interposed to observe that “That has very serious implication, that possibly the policeman would suggest to a man the answers to questions. Do you mean to convey that to this jury?” Without answering categorically, Dr. Spear said, “I mean to say this: That this experience, from definitely honest policemen, and I assume that to be correct. Having the facts of the case, as all those who were in contact — ” The doctor’s answer was so obviously meaningless that the trial judge broke in, saying, — “Wait a minute. They asked him where he got <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>the gun. He told them where he got it. How did they know where he received that gun?” The doctor answered, “I don’t know, Sir.” The appellant urges that the court’s interrogation of Dr. Spear, as to whether he intended the serious implication of his answers, prejudiced the witness, and consequently the defendant, with the jury and that, likewise, the court’s inquiry of the doctor as to how the police would know where the defendant had obtained the gun if he hadn’t told them had the effect of suggesting doubt on the part of the trial judge with respect to the witness’ veracity. If such were the effect of the court’s interpolations, it was no more than the witness himself had invited. The learned trial judge did not abuse his discretion. In <em>Commonwealth v.

It sometimes becomes his duty to do so, even to the point of recalling a witness to supply an omission of proof on a material point [citing cases].” Moreover, no objection was made or exception taken by the defendant to the trial judge’s questioning of the witness. “If no exception is taken at the time the questions are asked a witness by the trial judge, such questions are not the subject of review”: <em>Commonwealth v.

The Legislature probably had this in mind when, under the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427 sec. 66, as amended by the Act of April 17, 1929, P. L. 532 sec. 2, 19 PS 1351, it was enacted that where it is found that a person was insane at the time of the commission of the crime, and is acquitted because of such insanity, the court is empowered to order the defendant to be kept in strict custody so long as he shall continue to be of unsound mind. In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Winter, <a href="/pa/289/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="289 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1103278" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0284-01">289 Pa. 284</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20261" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="137 A. 261">137 A. 261</a>, this Court said, p. 296: “The only effect of the special finding of acquittal on the ground of insanity would be to authorize the court to order the defendant into custody while he continued of unsound mind. . . .”</p>
