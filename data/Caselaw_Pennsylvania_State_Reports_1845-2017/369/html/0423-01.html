We are convinced that the <em>original Section 518 was restated verbatim </em>in accordance with the requirements of Article III, §6 of the Constitution <em>for the purpose and with the legislative intent to re-enact the original section with a new provision added. </em>Appellant (in one part of its contradictory argument.) construes, restricts, and <em>limits the amendment of July 15 to the new provision, </em>notwithstanding the fact, that the language which appellant seeks to ignore was neither expressly repealed nor bracketed, but was expressly restated and clearly and expressly set forth at length therein, thus clearly demonstrating the Legislature’s intent that the Act of July 15 should be and include all the provisions therein set forth.</p>

As some taxes of such nature had been paid <em>more than five years </em>prior to the decision declaring the Tax Act unconstitutional, claims for refunds therefor could not be made under then-existing law, viz., Section 503 (a) (4) of the Fiscal Code of 1929 as amended. In that situation, Section 503 (a) (4) of the Fiscal Code was amended by the Act of August 5, 1941, which provided that the <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>limitation of five years on a claim for refund of taxes paid under a, void statute should not apply to claims for refund of the liquor floor tax “. . . if application for such refunds shall be made within two years after the effective date of this amendment” which date by general law was September 1, 1941. Within the two-year limitation period thus prescribed, the amendment of August 5, 1941, was further amended by the Act of May 7, 1943, which substituted the words “final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction” for the words “the court of final jurisdiction”. Without further change, the entire section, including the two-year limitation, was, perforce, published in its original form. The Walker Company filed its claim for refund on June 5, 1944, two years and nine months after the effective date of the earlier (i.e., 1941) amendment. The company claimed that the 1943 amendment, by its publication of the 1941 amendment, had thus reenacted that amendment including the two-year extension period for claims of refund so as to make the period of limitation run from the effective date of the 1943 amendment. We flatly rejected the contention, saying at p. 182 that “The only change wrought in the [amendatory] Act of 1941 by the amendment of 1943 was the substitution of the words ‘final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction’ for the words ‘the court of final jurisdiction’ ....

The majority seeks <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>to differentiate the <em>Mansel </em>case on the ground that the second amendment supplied something which the first amendment did not contain. That is a distinction without a difference. The rule of the <em>Mansel </em>case is <em>a fortiori </em>presently pertinent. Here, the July 15th amendment merely supplied something that the July 12th amendment already contained. Nor was it intended to do more according to its title.</p>

Section 518 of the Act of 1933, as it originally existed, dealt with the right of appeal to a court of common pleas from a property assessment, the collection of taxes pending an appeal from an assessment and the right of the property owner to pay the taxes into court. The Section was headed: “Section 518. Appeal to Court from Assessments; Collection Pending Appeal; Payment Into Court.” At the 1935 session of the legislature, Section 518 was amended twice, once by the Act of July 12, 1935, P. L. 674, which had originated in the House, and once by the Act of July 15, 1935, P. L. 1007, which had originated in the Senate. The two amendments were enacted almost simultaneously, the Act of July 12th having passed both branches of the legislature on June 20, 1935, upon concurrence by the House in the Senate amendments to the House Bill, while the Act of July 15th passed both branches on June 21, 1935, upon final passage by the House of the Senate Bill. In the Senate, the House Bill, which became the Act of July 12th, was passed finally on June 19th, whereas the Senate’s own Bill, which became the Act of July 15th, had been passed finally the day before, <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>June 18th. The legislature adjourned sine die on June 21, 1935.</p>
    <p id="b514-4" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[259,460,1153,1415]]]'>The changes worked by the amendment of July 12, 1935 (House Bill), in Section 518 of the Act of 1933 were: (1) the abolition of the right to pay taxes into court upon appeals from assessments, (2) the incorporation of a provision for the payment of taxes under protest and the segregation of a portion thereof pending determination of an assessment appeal, (3) a provision empowering a court of common pleas to authorize the use by the taxing district in certain circumstances of the segregated portion of taxes paid under protest, (4) a provision for the allowance of a credit or setoff against future taxes in case of an overpayment as determined by a finding of over assessment, and (5) a provision authorizing the payment to a taxing district of the full amount of taxes, subject to the foregoing segregation provision, where such taxes had theretofore been paid into court.- As introduced in the House and as there originally passed, the July 12th amendment had contained only provision (1) supra, namely, the abolition of the right to pay taxes into court. The other amendatory provisions of the Act of July 12th were added by Senate amendments to the House Bill in which amendments the House concurred on June 20th, as above stated, thereby completing final passage of the House Bill by both branches of the legislature.</p>

That Bill contained but one amendment of Section 518, namely, a provision for the allowance of a credit or setoff against future taxes in case of an overpayment as determined by a finding of overassessment,, as already appears. The same provision was one of the amendatory provisions, (4) supra, <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>which the Senate made to the House Bill when that measure was in the Senate. Notwithstanding that the Senate passed the House Bill, which it had amended as above stated, it also passed and sent to the House the Senate Bill with its single duplicative change in Section 518, which Bill the House then passed.</p>
    <p id="b515-3" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[137,682,1154,1202]]]'>Thus, both branches of the legislature passed both Bills and sent them to the Governor for approval. The reason for so doing is obvious. The session was near an end. As already stated, the legislature adjourned sine die on June 21st. The Governor had thirty days from adjournment within which to act on the two amendatory Acts: Article IV, Section 15, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. If he should disapprove the House Bill, all of its amendatory provisions would thereby fall; whereas the credit allowance provision which the Senate Bill had independently initiated could still become effective if the Governor should approve that Bill. On the other hand, if'the Governor approved the House Bill, as <em>he actually did on July 12, 1985, </em>there would then be no point in signing the Senate Bill; its amendment would be merely a duplication of the similar provision already contained in the approved House Bill. The Attorney General’s report to the Governor on the two Bills should have pointed out as much. Whether it did or not does not appear. In any event, the Governor, having signed the House Bill on July 12, 1935, also signed the Senate Bill on July 15th.</p>

All that that amendment was intended to do, according to its title, Was to amend Section 518 of the General County Assessment Law of 1933 by “regulating the refunding of taxes where appeals are finally disposed of.” To ascribe anything more to the Act of July 15th than what its title specified would <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>operate to render the Act unconstitutional : see Article III, Section 3, of the Pennsylvania Constitution. By contrast, the Act of July 12, 1935 (House Bill), which amended Section 518 in the particulars herein-, above specified, correctly had for its title, — “An Act to amend section five hundred and eighteen” of the General County Assessment Law of 1933 “by abolishing the payment of taxes into court on appeals from assessments; providing for the payment of taxes under protest; and restricting the expenditure of such tax moneys; regulating the refunding of taxes after the disposition of appeals; conferring powers upon courts of common pleas; and providing for the disposition of funds heretofore paid into court.” And, agreeably to the Act of March 16, 1923, P. L. 11, infra, the matter to be eliminated by the July 12th amendment, namely, “Payment Into Court”, in the heading of Section 518 and all reference to payment into court in the body of the Section were enclosed in brackets and the new provisions were shown in italics.</p>

L. 11 (later re-enacted as Section 71 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 PS §§501-602), passed in furtherance of the above-quoted constitutional provision, it is necessary that a section or sections of an Act to be amended be recited in full with the proposed amendatory changes appropriately indicated by brackets enclosing portions to be eliminated and italics designating additions. Since the only change indicated by the Senate Bill (Act of July 15th) was the provision relating to a credit or setoff for an overpayment, the new matter was naturally shown in italics. Obviously, the phrase “Payment Into Court” in the heading of Section 518 and the reference to payment of taxes into court in the body of the Section could neither be enclosed in brackets nor eliminated <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>in the Senate Bill’s publication of the Section for amendment as <em>that </em>Bill neither purported to so amend Section 518 nor had the amendment in such regard (which the House Bill was contemporaneously effecting) become final as yet.</p>
    <p id="b517-3" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[162,616,1154,1094]]]'>But, even if a substantial question of implied repeal could possibly be said to be present in this case, it would have to be resolved against the taxpayer’s contention because of the evident legislative intent. It is hornbook that an implied repeal is no less a matter of intention than is an express repeal. Brief reference to facts already stated will at once disclose that neither branch of the legislature could have <em>in fact </em>intended that one of the Acts should repeal the other. For instance, the Senate Bill which became the Act of July 15th and which the majority says impliedly repealed the House Bill (Act of July 12th) was passed finally by the Senate on June 18th, a day before that body passed the House Bill (June 19th) which became the Act of July 12th. In other words, the alleged implied repealer was passed by the Senate a day before the Bill which it is said to have repealed. How can a branch of the legislature possibly be thought to, have intended to repeal one day an Act which it did not pass until the succeeding day?</p>

Obviously, the legislature could not have known which of the two Bills, if either, the Governor would sign or the order of his signing after the legislature had adjourned. The anomaly of deriving <em>legislative intent </em>from the Governor’s choice of times for the signing of the two Bills is the more manifest when it is recognized that had the Governor <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>signed the Senate Bill before he signed the House Bill or had he signed both Bills on the same day, the suggested implied repeal could mot possibly have been advanced.

It is beyond dispute that by the Act of July 12th the right to pay taxes into court was definitely and constitutionally eliminated from Section 518 of the Act of 1933. The Act of July 15th could not, therefore, as an amendment, have operated to reinsert in Section 518 the portion that had been eliminated by the Act of July 12th. Nowhere did the legislature evidence that it intended so to do. Section 77 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1937 is peculiarly applicable, viz., “Provisions of a law no longer effective shall not be construed as being revived by re-enactment in an amendatory law, unless it shall clearly appear that the Legislature intended to revive such provisions”: see <em>Commonwealth v. Provident Trust Co., </em>supra; cf. also <em>Indiana County Petition, </em><a href="/pa/360/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="360 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="475015" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0244-01">360 Pa. 244</a>, 248, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.2d%203" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="62 A.2d 3">62 A. 2d 3</a>. Furthermore, as the right to pay taxes into court was admittedly eliminated from Section 518 of the Act of 1933 upon the Governor’s approval of the Act of July 12th, the only way that that provision could, thenceforth be validly and constitutionally reinserted in Section 518 would be by an amendment reciting Section' 518 with “Payment Into Court” shown in italics and the right to pay taxes into court in the body of the Section likewise italicized : see Article III, Section 6, of the State Constitution and the Act of March 16, 1923, P. L. 11, cit. supra. If further authority be needed in support of this view, it is supplied by Section 74 of the Stat<a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>utory Construction Act which provides that “Whenever-a law has been more than once amended, the latest' amendment shall be read into the original law as previously amended and not into such law as originally-enacted.” The reasoning in <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[166,685,1151,1637]]]'>Finally, the legislature is not to be presumed to “intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable”: Statutory Construction Act of 1937, Section 52. Yet such is the character of the result which the majority’s construction of the two Acts produces. Assuming, arguendo, that the Act of July 15th did impliedly repeal the Act of July 12th with respect to the right to pay taxes into court, it is undeniable that the remaining amendatory provisions of the Act of July 12th are extant and unaffected by the Act of July 15th. Those provisions are (a) the right to pay taxes to the collector of the district under protest and the segregation of a portion thereof pending determination of an assessment appeal, (b) the right of the taxing district to use with court approval, pending assessment appeals, a certain portion of the segregated taxes paid under protest, (c) the allowance of a credit or setoff against future taxes in cases of a later determined overassessment, and (d) the payment to a taxing district of the full amount of taxes, subject to the foregoing segregation provision, where such taxes had theretofore been paid into court — a clear legislative intent that the system of paying disputed taxes into court no. longer should . obtain. The absurdity produced by holding that the Act of July 15th reestablished a taxpayer’s right to pay taxes into court is patent in the light of the foregoing provisions of the Act of July 12th and needs ho comment. It is not the. appellants’ contentions that are either “specious” or “fallacious”.</p>
