Howard McGrath, Attorney General of the United States, as successor to the Alien Property Custodian for the sum of $16,280.37, paid into the State Treasury without escheat, under an award of the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia, made because of the absence of known next of kin.</p>
    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.10",458,[252,1106,1146,818]]]'>The claim was denied because of the failure of the U. S. custodian to offer any proof that any next of kin existed who were enemy nationals or resided in any enemy country. The custodian takes the position that he need produce no proof and stands on the extreme proposition that he may by an administrative fiat seize money in a State Treasury by merely declaring it to be the property of unnamed, unidentified and perhaps nonexistent enemy heirs. The court below conceded that by such declaration alone the custodian might interfere with the state’s constitutionally guaranteed right to exercise its control over the devolution of property within its borders. The implications of such a ruling are most serious and, affecting as it does the sovereignty of a state, must be carefully examined.</p>

It would never have been ratified by the requisite number of states if it had not been for the pledge made to append a Bill of Bights and to expressly guarantee (what Madison said was implied) that “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” This guarantee became the important 10th Amendment. Step by step we have seen the Federal Government invade the prerogatives of the states through the doctrine of implied powers, but never has it been thought possible that money left by a resident decedent awarded to the State Treasury in absence of known heirs, was subject to seizure by a mere say so of an administrative official without a shred of proof to justify such action.</p>

Mary Zuercher died May 31, 1944, an admitted resident of Pennsylvania. Her estate of approximately $16,000 passed into the possession of her administrator. A vesting order on behalf of the Alien Property Custodian was served on the administrator by which he vested in himself <em>“all the right title and interest </em>of heirs and next of kin, names unknown, of Mary Zuercher, last known address Germany.” It will be observed this vesting order while it designated no <em>known </em>heirs or <em>next of kin </em>alleged to be enemy nationals, nevertheless operated to protect fully the Federal Government in its undisputed right to prevent the money from getting into an enemy country. This vesting order was effective and yet respected the prerogative of the state courts to determine if there were or who were the heirs of the estate pending therein. When the estate was called for' audit May 9, 1945, before Judge Klein of the Philadelphia Orphans’ Court which had jurisdiction, the administrator reported his in<a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>ability to locate <em>any </em>next of kin <em>here or elsewhere, </em>whereupon the attorney for the Commonwealth asked that the balance for distribution be paid into the State Treasury without escheat under provisions of Sec. 1314 of The Fiscal Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The attorney representing the Alien Property Custodian stated to the court that he had the authority of the United States Attorney General to say, <em>“If there is an award to the Commonwealth without escheat, there will be no objection.” </em>This could only mean one thing, namely that the government wished more time to determine if there were any heirs and if so to locate them. Accordingly the balance was so awarded and the money paid into the Commonwealth’s Treasury. This was a proper orderly procedure and recognized the State’s right guaranteed by the 10th Amendment to determine the parties entitled to inherit property of resident decedents. The Alien Property Custodian had by that entirely proper vesting order substituted himself for any German or enemy nationals whom he might find or who might later appear and <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>claim to be next of kin. The Federal Government was thereby assured of full protection against that eventuality and the Commonwealth’s sovereign right at the same time respected.</p>
    <p id="b461-3" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[180,570,1151,1036]]]'>However, not content with the protection thus achieved and contrary to his acquiescence to the court’s award, the Alien Property Custodian later under date of August 21, 1945, filed a <em>new </em>vesting order which he called a supplemental vesting order. The new order instead of claiming the <em>right title and interest </em>of any German heirs, now claimed <em>the specific fund </em>of $16,-279.77 theretofore paid into the treasury of the state and of course commingled with other state funds. That new vesting order declared said sum “payable ... to ... or owing to . . . nationals of a designated enemy country, Germany, namely, Nationals: Heirs-at-law and next-of-kin, names unknown, of Mary Zuercher, deceased. Last Known Address: Germany” Upon filing this new order the sum claimed was demanded of the State Treasurer, though money once paid into the State Treasury can only be paid out in the manner provided by the Constitution and statutes of the Commonwealth.</p>

It was even argued by the learned counsel for the government that this power of the custodian is so absolute that if the fund had actually been escheated to the Commonwealth he might even set that escheat aside by his mere demand. That is to say, that even if the alleged heirs were but a figment of imagination, the sovereign State of Pennsylvania would be concluded by the custodian’s mere declaration that there were enemy heirs. We cannot believe that Congress ever so intended. We <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>freely grant that the power exists in the custodian to seize property of living individuals, and corporations in the first instance without proof but there is no case that holds this power extends to seizure of funds of a decedent’s estate that have been escheated or are escheatable and actually paid into the treasury of a State.</p>
    <p id="b462-4" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[260,748,1149,650]]]'>The right to seize enemy property is nowhere expressly given by the Constitution.

S. Government argues that the vesting power is not restricted to property of a <em>person </em>but is granted without qualification as to who possesses or holds the property, person or not. This argument is specious for it attempts to split the power of the President into two separate parts, viz. “regulating” and “vesting” notwithstanding they are embraced in a single sentence and hence must be construed together. Vesting does not take place by mere operation of law without action by anyone. It is initiated by ah act of the President or the agent designated by him, hence the formal vesting order which it has been the consistent practice of the custodian to serve. That is the initial step in vesting alien property.

But it reserves to itself the right, as it always has, to take the property of a decedent when under its laws there is no one in a position to inherit. The property of an intestate decedent who dies without known heirs is not mere flotsam or jetsam to be taken by anyone claiming it. In such circumstances, the Commonwealth stands in relation to the property of the decedent as one asserting a substantial right thereto. The Commonwealth’s claim is not based on charity, gratuity, or unearned benefit; it was by its protection that it was possible for the decedent to acquire such accumulation of property as he possessed.” Thus the Commonwealth when in possession of a decedent resident’s estate may hold as a party prima facie entitled —as ultimate heir so to speak — and any person claiming to be next of kin superior to the state’s right has the burden of proof. To permit the custodian to reverse this burden and cast on the state the onus of proof of non-existent heirs is a virtual confiscation of what must otherwise belong to the state.</p>

But that definition in Sec. <em>2 </em>of the Act neither controls the definition of person in subdivision b of Sec. 5, nor in Sec. 9.

It is advanced to support the mistaken thesis that the validation of the Alien Property Custodian’s claim to the fund in controversy would violate the <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>Commonwealth’s right to determine and control the devolution of property within its borders. No such question is here involved. The fact of the matter is that ownership of the fund is not in issue. Indeed, the majority opinion at one point concedes (see footnote 2) that the only right of the Commonwealth to the fund (which the Orphans’ Court awarded it <em>without escheat) </em>is to “custody and possession subject to reclamation by one presenting proofs of better title.” Elsewhere the majority opinion proceeds on the assumption that the fund belongs to the Commonwealth. Yet, the sole question is which party presents a better right to custody of the fund, and the matter of fundamental importance is the paramountcy of a Federal statute enacted pursuant to an express power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution of the United States, — in this instance, the power to declare war.</p>

S. C. A. App. §§1-40, 616-620), as applied by the learned court below to the facts of this case, constitutes an interference with State activities. In no true sense can such application of the Act be thought of as an invasion of a State’s power over the devolution of property within its borders: see <em>Miller v. Clausen, </em><a href="/f/299/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="299 F. 723" data-case-ids="1273589" data-case-paths="/f/299/0723-01">299 F. 723</a> (C. C. A. 8), where a Nebraska county court’s decree of heirship, handed down three years after the Alien Property Custodian vested the land, was recognized by the Federal court in proceedings against the Custodian under Section 9 of the Trading With the Enemy Act. At p. 727 the court said, “The contention that the county court of Morrill county had no jurisdiction because of the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act is not sound. That act did not take away from the county court its peculiar jurisdiction <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>to determine who were the heirs . . . and to adjudicate their status as such.” Nor does the Act deprive the Commonwealth of its right to escheat if the necessary conditions are met: see <em>Commonwealth v. Von Zedtwitz, </em><a href="/ky/215/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="215 Ky. 413" data-case-ids="5780774" data-case-paths="/ky/215/0413-01">215 Ky. 413</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20S.W.%20224" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="285 S.W. 224">285 S.

In that case the Supreme Court of Kentucky, rejecting the argument of the Commonwealth that the Trading With the Enemy Act interfered with the powers reserved to it by the Constitution, declared, “The act took away from the commonwealth of Kentucky no right it had of escheating the lands in question, but only required it to institute and prosecute any such action in the federal district courts . . . .” In last analysis, the Act constitutes nothing more than an appropriate exercise of the war-making power which the Constitution of the United States reposes in the Congress (Article I, Section 8) and, being such, it binds the judges in every State “anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding” (Article VI).</p>

S. C. A. App. §616) is not limited to the vesting of property in the hands of a “person” but is applicable to “any property ... of any . . . foreign . . . national ...” and is therefore broad enough to include property in the custody of a State: <em>In re Yokohama Specie Bank, Limited, </em>188 N.

The distinction between the regulating powers and the vesting powers conferred by Section 5 (b) of the Act is by no means specious as the majority opinion states. That Section provides that “. . . the President may, through any agency that he may designate, . . . regulate,. . . nullify, ... or prohibit, any . . . transactions involving, any <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>property in which, any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest, by any’ person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; and any property ... of any foreign . . . national . . . shall vest, when, as, and upon the terms, directed by the President . . . .” This provision plainly authorizes regulation, such as licensing of transactions and blockage of assets, independent of vesting and has been recognized so to do by the Supreme Court of the United States. In <em>Propper v. Clark, </em><a href="/us/337/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="337 U.S. 472" data-case-ids="572596" data-case-paths="/us/337/0472-01">337 U.

If transactions are blocked, <em>vesting may or may not </em>follow” (Emphasis supplied). Moreover, Section 7 (c) of the Act (50 U. S. C. A. App. §7 (c)) provides that “. . . any . . . property . . . belonging to ... an enemy . . ., which the President after investigation shall determine ... so belongs . . ., shall be . . . transferred ... to the Alien Property Custodian, or the same may be seized by the Alien Property Custodian . . . .” The majority opinion ignores this Section entirely.</p>
