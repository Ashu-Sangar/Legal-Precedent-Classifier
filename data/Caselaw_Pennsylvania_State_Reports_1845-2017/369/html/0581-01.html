    <p id="b652-8" data-blocks='[["BL_652.12",652,[250,995,1151,868]]]'>The action is in trespass for personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident. The court below-entered an order directing plaintiff to answer defendant’s written interrogatories. The court approved the interrogatories, which were filed pursuant to this order. Within the period allowed for answering the interrogatories plaintiff filed his appeal. Procedure relating to Depositions and Discovery was adopted by this Court November 20, 1950, effective June 1, 1951, and is embodied in the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure 4001 to 4025 inclusive. Plaintiff’s chief complaint is that under rule 4011 a party cannot have, discovery of any fact not necessary to prepare the pleadings or prove a <em>prima facie </em>defense, and that defendant’s questions in its interrogatories violate this rule.</p>

Until such final order is entered plaintiff cannot be harmed. Cf. <em>Quinn v.

We are not unmindful of the importance of the questions sought to he raised by this appeal, but “The law aims to dispose of litigation by a single appeal and preliminary orders are not appeal-able in advance of final judgment except when made so by statute: Wood v. Harlan, <a href="/pa-super/78/0092-02" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="78 Pa. Super. 92" data-case-ids="650181,650198" data-case-paths="/pa-super/78/0092-02,/pa-super/78/0092-01">78 Pa.

The course suggested by appellant has frequently been proposed. Justice Sadler answered such suggestion in <em>American Trust Co. v.

The wisdom of such a change is, however, not for us to pass upon, and, until ordered by some statute, the long established principle, that review can be had only when the action has terminated below, must control.”</p>
