They point to the fact that even in our first adoption statute, the Act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430, section 7, it was provided that an adopted child should have all the rights of a child and heir of the adopting parent; that the same provision was contained in the adoption Act of April 4, 1925, P. L. 127, section 4; that in the Act of May 28, 1915, P. L. 580, it was provided that the “said adopting parent and said <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>child shall, respectively, inherit and take by devolution from and through each other personal estate as next of kin, and real estate as heirs in fee simple, or otherwise, under the intestate laws of this Commonwealth, as fully as if the person adopted had been born a lawful child of the adopting parent”; and that the Intestate Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 429, section 16 (a), contained this same provision and added thereto a clause (b) that “The person adopted shall, for all purposes of inheritance and taking by devolution, be a member of the family of the adopting parent or parents.” However, while these statutes progressively enlarged the rights of adopted children to inherit from and through their adopting parent, they could not, of course, actually make such children children of his blood and therefore his “lineal descendants.” What they accomplished was to establish a certain relation between the adopted child, the adopting parent, and their respective relatives, for specified purposes, but nowhere therein is there any suggestion of an intention to affect the Commonwealth in regard to its tax legislation. As the Commonwealth properly contends, adoption creates an artificial relation between the adopting parent and the adopted child conferring certain rights and imposing certain duties upon each, but in respect to the Commonwealth’s tax laws it is without effect in the absence of express provision to the contrary.</p>

Nancrede, </em><a href="/pa/32/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="32 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="986617" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0389-01">32 Pa. 389</a>, it was held that the Act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430, section 7, giving to an adopted child all the rights of a child to inherit from the adopting parent, did not exempt it from the payment of the collateral inheritance tax. Chief Justice Lowrie there said: “. . . we cannot suppose that our law of adoption- was intended to change in any respect the law relating to collateral inheritance taxes. It is property devised or descending to children <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>and lineal descendants that is exempt from the tax. . . . Giving an adopted son a right; to inherit does not make him a son in fact. And he is so regarded in law, only to give the right to inherit, and not to change the collateral inheritance tax law. As against that law, he has no higher merit than collateral blood relations of the deceased, and is not at all to be regarded as a son in fact.” In <em>The Commonwealth's Appeal, Avery's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/34/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="34 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="418038" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0204-01">34 Pa. 204</a>, 206, the <em>Nancrede </em>case was cited with approval; referring to it and other authorities, the court said: “The artificial relation thus created was undoubtedly good as to all but the Commonwealth, but she did not choose to recognize it as equivalent to the natural relation when it conflicted with her claim to revenue. These cases point to the duty of looking to the real relations of the parties in ascertaining who may be subject to the payment of this kind of tax.” To the same effect is the case of <em>Schafer v. Eneu, </em><a href="/pa/54/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="54 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="1006295" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0304-01">54 Pa. 304</a>, 306, where it was said: “Adopted children are not children of the person by whom they have been adopted, and the Act of Assembly does not attempt the impossibility of making them such. . . . The right to inherit from the adopting parent is made complete, but the identity of the child is not changed. One adopted has the rights of a child without being a child.” Other decisions of this and the Superior Court have followed in the same vein: <em>Tharp v.
