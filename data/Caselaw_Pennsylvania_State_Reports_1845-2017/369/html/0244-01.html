It was made by and between <em>plaintiff individually </em>and trading as The Dickerson Company, and for himself individually <em>and as agent for eight named shareholders </em>of <em>The Dickerson Company of Pennsylvania </em>and of the Dickersons Overseas Company, <em>parties of the first part, </em>and <em>Henshaw and Klauder, </em>tAVO of the defendants, <em>parties of the second, part. </em>After settlement was completed in accordance with the terms of this written agreement, the shares of stock of the Pennsylvania corporation knoAvn as Dickersons Overseas Company Avere actually transferred to a limited partnership known as The <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>Dickerson Company, and composed of defendants Henshaw, Klauder and McCarthy, as general partners, and defendants Mitchell, Duffell and Haggerty’ as limited partners. Thereafter the corporation known as the Dickersons Overseas Company was liquidated and all of its assets were transferred to, and its liabilities assumed by the above-mentioned limited partnership which was formed under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act of Pennsylvania, approved April 12, 1917, P.L. 55. The limited partnership then caused its general partners to register under the Fictitious Names Act under the name of Dickersons Overseas Company.</p>

The agreement then concluded with Paragraph 11: “This agreement embodies the whole agreement between the parties, superseding all previous agreements, if any, and may not be varied except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. The commitments and undertakings of this agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.” The price paid for the shares of stock and other assets of plaintiff and of the named individuals whom he <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>represented exceeded a quarter of a million dollars.</p>

(as alleged in the written agreement of January 17, 1949), whereas it had no good will; (b) that the gross monthly sales of the Dickersons Overseas Company and of The Dickerson Company had averaged $40,000. a month in 1948; (c) that the decline in sales for the month of November, 1948 was due to a New York dock strike [there was such a strike]; (d) that a similar decline in sales for December, 1948, .was due to exchange conditions in The Netherlands which was only temporary [there was difficulty concerning exchange conditions in The Netherlands]; (e) that plaintiff had deliberately concealed, with intent to cheat and defraud defendants, the knowledge that two very important contracts would shortly thereafter be terminated and not renewed; (f) that a substantial part of the business involved valuable overseas contracts including contracts in the Philippine Islands, whereas there had been no contracts in the Philippine Islands since 1945; (g) and that plaintiff knew that gross monthly sales could not be maintained at a $40,000. average upon the return of good general business conditions and that said business would only average ten to twelve thousand dollars. Incidentally, the statements of gross sales prepared by defendants for April, May and June, 1950, showed average monthly earnings of over $58,000., and the average monthly earnings over the seventeen months of this contract exceeded $40,000. The defendants further alleged that they discovered plaintiff’s false and fraudulent representations <em>immediately </em>after the execution of the contract of <em>January </em>11, 1949, and immediately offered to return the stock and other assets <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>to the plaintiff and demanded of him that he return to them the money paid him for the purchase thereof. Notwithstanding the discovery by defendants of the alleged false and fraudulent representations by plaintiff, these defendants continued to employ plaintiff and <em>paid Mm for fifteen months </em>two per cent of the gross sales <em>as required by his employment contract of January 24, </em>1949. One cannot help wondering how they justify such payments with their present allegations.</p>
