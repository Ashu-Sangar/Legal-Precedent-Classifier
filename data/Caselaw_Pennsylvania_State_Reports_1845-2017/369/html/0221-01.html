Plaintiff’s claim as widow was in a “death action”, whereas her claim as administratrix was a “survival action.” An examination of the record discloses that upon trial plaintiff <em>in the death action </em>suffered a voluntary non-suit. “Individually and as widow”, she had released the defendant <em>Edward </em>Follweiler (the owner of the car), <em>Robert </em>Follweiler, its operator, and also the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, the indemnity insurance carrier of the defendant. The named consideration was $1,500. The trial proceeded <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>in the survival action, with plaintiff <em>as administratrix. </em>The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff-administratrix for $7,280. The court refused defendant’s motion for judgment n.o.v. Defendant appealed to this Court. The Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland (the present defendant) with defendant in such tort action, filed an appeal bond in usual form, in the penal sum of $15,000. The surety company obligated itself to pay the judgment, interest and costs, should the principal (the defendant in the appealed action) fail to <em>“prosecute the appeal with </em>effect.” This Court, in a per curiam opinion, reported in <a href="/pa/364/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="364 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1223612" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0553-01">364 Pa. 553</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.2d%20410" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="73 A.2d 410">73 A. 2d 410</a>, affirmed the judgment. As the judgment debtor did not pay the judgment, the <em>plaintiff-administratrix </em>then instituted the present suit against the surety company on the appeal bond. An answer with new matter was filed by the defendant to the complaint (hereafter discussed). A motion was made by plaintiff for judgment on the pleadings. The court below decreed that action on the motion should be suspended and held in abeyance pending proceedings instituted by the <em>judgment debtor and his indemnity company in the tort case </em>before the orphans’ court having jurisdiction over the settlement and distribution of the estate of plaintiff’s deceased husband. This appeal followed.</p>

Under Eule 213 (e) of the Pennsylvania Eules of Civil Procedure, it is provided: “A cause of action for the wrongful death of a decedent and a cause of action for his injuries which survives his death may be enforced in one action but if independent actions are commenced they shall be consolidated for trial.”</p>

Plaintiff, in one of the many proceedings in this case, entered into a written stipulation, wherein she admitted that she was the sole heir of her deceased husband and represented that there were no debts in the estate. It is now belatedly contended that plaintiff by her release not only released any interest she possessed in the <em>death action </em>but also released and assigned her distributive share in her husband’s estate, involved in the <em>survival action. </em>This contention is spurious. Our examination of the tort record discloses that defendant, by his answer to plaintiff’s claim, made the release an issue in that case. The judgment therefore became conclusive concerning the effect of such release in the survival action. In <em>Wallace’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/316/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="316 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1158970" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0148-01">316 Pa. 148</a>, 153, <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a><a href="/citations/?q=174%20A.%20397" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="174 A. 397">174 A. 397</a>, we said: “Broadly stated, the rule of res judicata is that when a court of competent jurisdiction has determined a litigated cause on its merits, the judgment entered, until reversed, is, forever and under all circumstances, final and conclusive as between the parties to the suit and their privies, in respect to every fact which might properly be considered in reaching a judicial determination of the controversy, and in respect to all points of law there adjudged, as those points relate directly to the cause of action in litigation and affect the fund or other subject-matter then before the court.” All that plaintiff released was her claim as an <em>individual </em>in the death action. As administratrix of her husband’s estate, she lacked authority, as fiduciary, to release her deceased husband’s estate. To do so required leave of the orphans’ court, upon proper cause shown. Furthermore, she could not effectively stipulate, as fiduciary <em>in her husband’s estate, </em>that there were no debts or taxes due. Only an audit and adjudication could determine that. Nor can plaintiff’s release in the <em>death action </em>of her <em>individual </em>rights be regarded in the <em>survival action </em>as a release and assignment of her distributive share under the intestate laws in her deceased husband’s estate. What the plaintiff receives in distribution in settlement of her husband’s estate is what the <em>law </em>directs shall be paid to her <em>as her distributive share. </em>The situation is analogous to that of an heir excluded by will, and an intestacy thereafter results in another part of the will. In such circumstances the excluded heir nevertheless takes the intestate portion not under the <em>will </em>but under the <em>law: Thistle’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/263/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="263 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="1047428" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0060-01">263 Pa. 60</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.%2094" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="106 A. 94">106 A. 94</a>; <em>Gibbons’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/317/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="317 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="8846246" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0465-01">317 Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.%2050" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="177 A. 50">177 A. 50</a>; <em>Verner Estate, </em><a href="/pa/358/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="358 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="8845475" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0280-01">358 Pa. 280</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20667" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="56 A.2d 667">56 A. 2d 667</a>.</p>

It is a matter of judicial knowledge that corporate sureties on appeal to appellate courts, ordinarily require counter indemnity. The duty of sustaining the appeal, however, is the <em>primary </em>responsibility of the principal. It follows that if and when the Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland is required to pay this judgment, it will then call upon the principal (defendant Edward Follweiler) to reimburse it. Should defendant reimburse his surety, he will look to his original indemnitor corporation, the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, to reimburse <em>him. </em>Obviously such matters merely affect the defendant and his sureties. They do not in the slightest degree concern the judgment creditor. After payment of the judgment — whoever pays it — defendant and his sureties may then contest this question among themselves, should it prove necessary.</p>

When the plaintiff-administratrix was granted letters of administration by the register of wills, apparently there were then no <em>Imown </em>assets. A nominal fidelity bond of $100 was therefore filed. As the fiduciary is about to receive the amount of the judgment, she must enter an additional bond. This is for the protection of creditors, <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>distributees and any interested party in the decedent’s estate, including the Commonwealth. Should the plaintiff-administratrix neglect or refuse to so qualify herself by the entry of sufficient security in order to receive the fund, this may be enforced under sec. 324 of the Fiduciaries Act of April 18, 1949 P. L. 512, 20 PS 320, 324.</p>
