Accordingly, under the Act of June 1,1889, P. L. 420, §24, as amended, an annual tax is assessed against it at the rate of 2% of the gross premiums received from Pennsylvania business. The amount thus determined has been paid without protest and is not questioned here. The California gross premiums tax on foreign insurance companies is 2.5 <em>% </em>and as a result of that an additional charge of .5% was levied against appellant under the terms of Section 212 of the Act of 1921, supra, as amended by the Act of May 24, 1933, P. L. 988, which provides: “If, by the laws of any other state, any taxes, fines, panalties, licenses, fees, or other obligations or prohibitions, additional to or in excess of those imposed by the laws of this Commonwealth upon . . . insurance companies . . . are imposed on . . . insurance companies ... of this Commonwealth doing business in such state, like obligations and prohibitions shall be imposed upon all . . . insurance companies ... of such state doing business in .this Commonwealth, so long as such laws remain in force.” The charge made under that sec<a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>tion was later resettled by deducting from it the amount of license fees paid by appellant during the year.

Such an argument misconceives the purpose of the retaliatory charge. It is certainly not a revenue raising measure. In fact, its success might be said to depend on how little is collected under its terms rather than how much. It is designed to bring about equality of treatment between domestic and foreign corporations and to break down interstate barriers. Such a purpose falls within the police power and is properly classified as a regulation of the insurance business under that power. It is in the same category as a license fee or other similar charges. This is demonstrated by <em>Phila. Fire Association v. New York, </em><a href="/us/119/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="119 U.S. 110" data-case-ids="8299631" data-case-paths="/us/119/0110-01">119 U.

It must be conceded that license fees are regulatory and that being true, the subject matter of Section 212 is included in the title of the Act and Article III, §3 of our Constitution is satisfied.</p>
    <p id="b635-3" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[199,681,1150,1558]]]'>Appellant next contends that Section 212 violates Article IX, §1, of the Pennsylvania Constitution which provides: “All taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax . . .” What we have said above goes far toward answering this argument also. The charge imposed is in the nature of a license fee levied under the police power. The rule is well established that uniformity requires only that a basis of classification be reasonable: <em>Com. v. Girard Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/305/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="305 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1134688" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0558-01">305 Pa. 558</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=158%20A.%20262" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="158 A. 262">158 A. 262</a>; <em>Knisely v.

As we have stated, the purpose of imposing the charge is to bring about equality of treatment. Under Section 212, foreign insurance companies are treated precisely the same as our domestic companies are treated in their state. This is both a reasonable and proper basis of classification. In <em>Philadelphia Fire Association v. New York, </em><a href="/us/119/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="119 U.S. 110" data-case-ids="8299631" data-case-paths="/us/119/0110-01">supra,</a> the United States Supreme Court reached the same result in holding that the New York statute did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.

    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.6",636,[234,1403,1150,812]]]'>The Fire Insurance Patrol was originally incorporated as a non-profit organization under the Act of February 17, 1871, P. L. 59. It was later reorganized and is now operating under the Act of May 22, 1895, P. L. 102. By the terms of that Act, it became lawful for certain officers of fire insurance companies doing business in cities of the first class to form a corporation for the purpose of protecting life and property from fire. A corporation thus formed was given the power to maintain a corps of men to affect this purpose. The costs of maintaining the necessary men and equipment were to be paid by all companies doing business in the first class cities and were to be assessed at an annual meeting at a rate not to exceed 2% of the gross premiums received.</p>
    <p id="b636-6" data-blocks='[["BL_636.7",636,[234,2236,1144,101]],["BL_637.1",637,[173,344,1153,1154]]]'>Appellant became a member of the Patrol upon its reorganization under the Act of 1895 and has regularly <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>paid all assessments levied against it. It argues that, since under the terms of the Act all companies must pay the assessments regardless of membership, they are an obligation imposed by law and should be deducted from the retaliatory charge. To accept such an argument would be to place far too broad a meaning on Section 212. When that section speaks of “taxes, fines, penalties, licenses, fees, or other obligations” it is not and cannot be referring to all legal obligations. If such were the case, appellant could also deduct the amount of claims it pays since they are legal obligations imposed by and enforceable under the laws of this Commonwealth. What Section 212 means is that all taxes, fines, penalties, licenses, fees, or other obligations <em>of similar nature </em>are to be computed. The assessment by the Patrol is in no way similar to the specific items named. It is not levied by the Commonwealth but by the Patrol itself and it is collected and disbursed by that organization, a private body and not a part of the government. The Commonwealth in no way controls the amount, collection or use of the funds.</p>
    <p id="b637-4" data-blocks='[["BL_637.5",637,[170,1515,1147,707]]]'>Moreover, the Patrol operates in cooperation with the Fire and Police Departments by standing by damaged property or property exposed to damage after the Fire Department has abandoned it. In that way the Patrol is able to prevent or extinguish further fires with a resultant saving of thousands of dollars worth of property in the course of a year. This is, of course, a direct benefit to the fire insurance companies and it is because of that benefit that the Patrol was originally organized and has been maintained. Thus the payments made to the Patrol are a quid pro quo for the benefits received and as such are not within the meaning of Section 212.</p>
