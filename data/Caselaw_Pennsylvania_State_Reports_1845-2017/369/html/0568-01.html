The Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County decreed that the corpus amounting to $1,222,123.53 passed to the minor children. The appeal followed.</p>

It is upon this principle that the guardians of the minor children claim the corpus, and upon which <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>it was awarded to them by the court below. The executrix under the will of the grandson, who was testator’s sole heir, contends, upon the contrary, that such gift being merely <em>implied, </em>constitutes but an <em>inference </em>or <em>presumption, </em>which may be rebutted as any other presumption. Regarding the will from its four corners, is urged that such presumption is rebutted and that an <em>intestacy </em>results. To rebut such <em>implied </em>gift, appellant points to the fact that when testator devised and bequeathed a one-eighth share of the corpus to such children he did so <em>by a specific grant to the children or their issue in plain and unequivocal language. </em>Also he employed the same language in two other instances in case of the death of the grandson <em>leaving issue </em>(1) prior to the death of testator’s wife and (2) prior to the death of the sister-in-law. It is therefore urged with great vigor that when testator devised and bequeathed the seven-eighths share of the corpus he gave it to the Masonic Lodge only in the event that the grandson left <em>no issue; </em>that he made no gift to issue in case the grandson <em>left issue. </em>Because of the absence of such express grant to the issue, it is urged that this constituted an omission, which was either <em>intentional or accidental, </em>which in either case resulted in an intestacy.</p>

      <em>/ </em>First considering whether there was an <em>intentional </em>omission, resulting in intestacy, there is a presumption testator intends to dispose of his whole estate. Such [presumption, however, is met by an equally potent presumption that an heir is not to be disinherited except by plain words or necessary implication. The effect of the conflict of rules is well stated by Judge Hunter in his Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court Commonplace Book, Yol. 2, Wills, sec. 4 (b) p. 1436, in the following language: “These presumptions are of like force and effect, and in applying one we must not overlook the other. Neither presumption, however, can be permitted to defeat the <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>intention of the testator which is expressed in apt words or appears by clear implication.” See <em>Grothe’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/229/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="229 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="971815" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0186-01">229 Pa. 186</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20A.%2088" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="78 A. 88">78 A. 88</a>; <em>French’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/292/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="292 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="1109692" data-case-paths="/pa/292/0037-01">292 Pa. 37</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.%20549" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="140 A. 549">140 A. 549</a>; <em>Loving Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/159/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="159 Pa.

In <em>Grothe’s Estate, </em>supra, Justice Mestrezat said, p. 192: “. . . if it was an oversight, the courts have no authority to insert a provision . . . under the assumption that it was the intention of the testator. It is only when the language of the will expressly or by clear implication discloses the intention of the testator that the courts may carry it out. It will not do for the courts to undertake to guess at the intention of a testator and declare that to be his will. If he sees fit for any reason not to dispose of any part of his estate, or such is the result of ignorance or oversight, the courts cannot supply the gap or hiatus and reconstruct the will. To do so would be a perversion of the functions of the court, and deprive a testator of the right to dispose of his property.” See: <em>Morrison Will, </em><a href="/pa/361/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="361 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="476380" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0419-01">361 Pa. 419</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20384" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="65 A.2d 384">65 A. 2d 384</a>, and cases therein cited.</p>

A testator is not <em>required </em>to employ the same words or use the same phraseology in expressing the same testamentary design, even in the same document. In devising and bequeathing the one-eighth share the grandson and his children were the sole objects of testator’s considera<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>tion. The same exclusive consideration is apparent when he contemplated the possibility of his grandson pre-deceasing testator’s wife and sister-in-law. However, when testator was disposing of the seven-eighths share, he was not only considering the grandson and his issue but he was also providing for his wife and sister-in-law. It was only in this connection that testator contemplated the possibility of his grandson dying without issue. In that event, but in that event only, did he pass the corpus to the Masonic Lodge. It would, of course, have removed all possible doubt had testator said in unambiguous language that upon the death of the grandson, his children or their issue should take the remainder, but if the grandson left no such children, then the corpus should pass to the Masonic Lodge. We see no difference in the use of the language which testator did employ in so expressing his intent. Such testamentary provision discloses a clear and unequivocal implication, which is not substantially rebutted,. that testator passed the entire residuary trust estate to the children and issue of his grandson-life tenant. There is no other language in the will which could be fairly held to demonstrate a contrary intent.
