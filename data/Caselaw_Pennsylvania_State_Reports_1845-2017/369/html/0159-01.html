In some cases, however, in varying circumstances, either market <em>or </em>book value of property <em>may </em>be its net worth. A stock freely sold on the stock exchange might well have its worth established in such market. But where, as here, stock is closely held and represents but a minority interest, and is rarely sold, (and when sold perhaps under necessity or pressing circumstances) such sales do <em>not </em>fairly establish a true market value. Neither do book values, earnings or dividends <em>alone </em>establish such worth. On corporate books a valuable asset may be listed at a nominal figure. On liquidation or sale of corporate assets, such an asset may realize a large price, not adequately reflected in book value. While earnings and dividends play an important part in determining the worth of a stock, yet this <em>alone </em>is not controlling. This depends upon the financial policy of the corporate management as to what is charged to net earnings and what dividends and the amount thereof are paid to stockholders. All of these elements must be taken into consideration in fixing “clear value.”</p>

This argument was rejected. The court below found in that case that the <em>booh value </em>constituted its “clear value.” Among the elements considered in fixing the clear value was the corporation’s franchise tax report; that the stock was unlisted, was closely held and there were no sales on the market.

The unfairness of the Commonwealth’s valuation on a price earnings ratio basis is further graphically illustrated by the fact if the “or<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>dinary earnings” or the “capital gains and losses earnings” of the corporation in 1947 had been <em>1‡ </em>a share instead of a loss of $1.20 a share, and $4.10 a share respectively, the Commonwealth’s appraisal would Be 5000 times earnings.

Putting it more succinctly, unless a purchaser wished to liquidate the company and needed the stock for control, can anyone imagine a willing buyer paying $83,300. or $50. a share for decedent’s block of stock?</p>
