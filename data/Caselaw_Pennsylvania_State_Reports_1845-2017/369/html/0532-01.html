The learned trial judge held that plaintiff had failed to bring himself within the scope of that rule and accordingly entered a nonsuit. From an order denying a motion to remove the nonsuit, plaintiff has appealed.</p>

Finding no jobs available they started to return home. En route they were joined by Edward Jennings’ uncle, William Eckrote. Instead of following the highway they proceeded across land owned by defendant, Glen Alden Coal Company. On that land was a hole approximately <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>fifty feet in diameter which had resulted from defendant’s strip mining operations and which had been allowed to fill with water to a depth of approximately twenty-five feet. Eckrote led the boys to this pool and suggested to them that they go swimming. Jennings, along with several others, went in the water and swam around for some time. He came out of the water then dove back in and started to swim across the pool again. When he reached a point near the far side of the pool he went down and was drowned. Eckrote, in an effort to save the boy, dove into the water and was also drowned.</p>
    <p id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[269,1003,1148,922]]]'>James Jennings, the father of Edward and administrator of his estate, brought these actions to recover damages' for his death. At the trial, in addition to the above facts, the testimony disclosed that defendant’s land was wild and uncultivated and from the point where the pool was located to the nearest highway or habitation was at least one-half mile, although paths which had been used by defendant in its mining operations were still visible on the ground. It was also shown that on one or two previous occasions boys had been swimming in this pool. On the basis of this evidence plaintiff contends that the question of negligence is for the jury under the doctrine laid down in Section 339 of the Restatement, Torts which was expressly adopted by this Court in <em>Bartleson v. Glen Alden Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/361/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="361 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="476388" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0519-01">361 Pa. 519</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.2d%20846" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="64 A.2d 846">64 A. 2d 846</a>.

Society Di M. S. Del Lazio, </em><a href="/pa/366/0629-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="366 Pa. 629" data-case-ids="8846185" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0629-01">366 Pa. 629</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.2d%20237" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="79 A.2d 237">79 A. 2d 237</a>.

    <p id="b605-4" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[168,1052,1156,924]]]'>There is no evidence that defendant knew or should have known of the likelihood of children trespassing-near the pool. It is true that there was a path which led from the highway to the pool but there is nothing to show that that path was used for any purpose after defendant ceased its mining operations. The path may have made trespassing possible but no duty arises out, of mere possibilities. Likewise, the facts that a few people occasionally hunted or picked berries on the tract or even that children had on one or two occasions gone swimming in the pool does not prove defendant knew or had reason to know of the trespasses. This is merely a pool of water which had been used once or twice by boys for swimming. Certainly an owner of land cannot be charged with constructive notice of trespassing children on the basis of two widely separated visits.</p>

There is no evidence that children regularly played in this area or passed through it. This case is in no way analogous to <em>Bartleson v. Glen Alden Coal Co., </em>supra, or <em>Thompson v. Reading Co., </em><a href="/pa/343/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="343 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="1208371" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0585-01">343 Pa. 585</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20729" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="23 A.2d 729">23 A. 2d 729</a>.

Obviously in those cases the long continued and regular usage by the children constituted constructive notice to defendants. Such evidence is wholly lacking in this case.</p>
    <p id="b606-4" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[259,728,1149,697]]]'>An even more compelling reason for denying liability is found in clause (c) of Section 339 which states that “the children because of their youth do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved . . It certainly cannot be said that a normal boy thirteen and one-half years of age who has been in and around water often enough to have learned how to swim does not realize the risk involved in swimming in deep water. We have repeatedly held that the perils contained in a body of water are obvious to children at an early age: <em>Simon v.

In the <em>Mussolino </em>case a three year old child, while following a path regularly used by young children fell in an unguarded pond. In the <em>Altenbach </em>case a fence around a reservoir was allowed to fall into disrepair in an area where children played daily and a four year old boy crawled through the fence and was drowned. Those cases go no farther than to hold that where an artificial body of water is located in a place where extremely young children habitually play and is not supplied with an adequate safeguard to prevent children from falling in the water the owner is liable under Section 339. Here, as we stated above, children did not regularly play in the area; the boy was of at least average intelligence for his thirteen and a <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>half years; furthermore he did not fall into the water but deliberately dove in and went swimming. Under' these circumstances Section 339 cannot apply for as is stated in comment e of that section “The purpose of the duty is to protect children from dangers which they are unlikely to appreciate and not to protect them against harm resulting from their own immature recklessness in the case of known danger.” As this Court held in <em>Prokop v. Becker, </em><a href="/pa/345/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="345 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1213414" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0607-01">345 Pa. 607</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%2023" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="29 A.2d 23">29 A. 2d 23</a>, The duty of a possessor of land to trespassing children does not extend to those conditions the existence of which is obvious even to children and the risk of which is fully realized by them. In the instant case, the boy was of sufficient age and understanding to fully appreciate the dangers inherent in the pool and no recovery can be allowed.</p>
    <p id="b607-3" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[166,1238,1148,543]]]'>In so holding we are not, as plaintiff argues, finding as a matter of law that Jennings was guilty of contributory negligence. That question has no place in this case. The sole issue is whether defendant was under a duty to protect tne boy from this type of accident. Under Section 339 that duty extends only to those children too young to appreciate the dangers involved. Such was not the case here and hence no duty was breached by defendant. Accordingly a nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

On the contrary, the testi<a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>mony is all to the contrary. Edward Jennings was a strong, active, healthy boy who had never been seriously ill and who participated in athletics. The record is not clear as to how long the four boys swam in the water-filled crater before the tragedy, but it could only have been for a very short time. The witness Walter Paprota stated that the swimmers swam the pond a couple of times and then Edward decided to. swim the pond once again. As the hole at no point was more than 30 to 50 feet across, it is unreasonable to suppose that a healthy boy could become exhausted swimming across the pool even 20 or 30 times. At the time the boy drowned he was only 8 to 12 feet from shore. And then, of course, we have the evidence of the fully developed adult, Eckrote, sinking to his death <em>immediately </em>after entering the pond.</p>

Also “while wires are necessary to carry high-tension electric current, the burden of properly insulating wires maintained at places where trespassing children may be expected ,to come in contact with them, is obviously slight as compared with the gravity of harm which they threaten and the chance that such harm will result.” The burden to the defendant company in this case of shutting off this flooded crater was slight in comparison with the gravity of harm which it threatened and, as it turned out, accomplished.</p>

The Bartleson case involved a dangerous tower which the trespassing minor plaintiff climbed to his injury. Here we have a dangerous pool in which the minor decedent swam to his death. In that case the Supreme Court said at page 527: “The modern rule, applicable in such circumstances, limits unrestricted use of land in the interest of safeguarding children from the danger of serious injury. So long as defendant can be charged with the duty to anticipate trespassing children, that they will accept the invitation to enter the enclosure and climb the tower it cannot remain passive.”</p>
