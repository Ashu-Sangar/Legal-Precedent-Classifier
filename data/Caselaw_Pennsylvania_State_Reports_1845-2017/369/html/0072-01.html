The jury found all of the defendants guilty and each, except Tarpley (whose sentence was deferred because of illness) was sentenced to one year in the Allegheny County Workhouse. The same four defendants were also indicted charged with (1) assault and battery, and (2) aggravated assault and battery upon the person of John Bordonaro, who was Captain of Police in the City of New Kensington, Westmoreland County. They were all found guilty as indicted, by the jury, and each, except Tarpley, was sentenced to the Allegheny County Workhouse for three years. Robert T.

Employes of Ellay were represented by local 65 of the Wholesale and Warehouse Workers Union. No labor dispute existed with Eagle’s employes. Defendant Smith, who was not a member of Local 65, was sent by that Union from New York to New Kensington as strike leader. In Pittsburgh he hired defendants Peay and Tarpley and also other male and female pickets. Defendant Truitt is a dental technician, whose office and apartment are near the Eagle store. Officials of Local 65 had directed Smith to contact Truitt. All the pickets, including defendants, used Truitt’s office and apartment for their personal convenience.</p>

All of defendants were involved. A friend of Fee came to his rescue. A general fight or fray ensued, in which many people engaged. A large crowd gathered. Police rushed to the scene. Police Captain Bordonaro observed Smith running away. Smith was followed by the Captain and was seen entering defendant Truitt’s apartment through the rear entrance.</p>

Thereafter he went up the front stairs to Truitt’s office on the second floor of the building while the other officer watched the rear entrance. Bordonaro met Truitt, Allen, and Peay coming down the steps. He demanded that Truitt surrender Smith but was told by Truitt that there was no one there. Bordonaro went to Truitt’s apartment on the third floor in his search for Smith. As he came down Bordonaro met Truitt, Allen, and Peay on the second floor landing. Bordonaro again demanded that Truitt surrender Smith. According to Bordonaro, Truitt replied: ‘Get out of here. You ain’t got no business in here. You ain’t getting any fellow.’ Truitt, Allen, Peay, and Tarpley attacked the officer. Someone hit him in the back as he attempted to use the telephone. Truitt took hold of Bordonaro and forcibly removed the telephone from his hands. In doing so, Bordonaro’s arm hit'the door and his wrist was severely injured. Truitt thereupon said to Bordonaro: ‘Don’t make me laugh; you’re not taking that fellow out of here anyhow.’ Peay grabbed Bordonaro and ripped his coat. Bordonaro then informed Truitt, Allen, and Peay that they were under arrest; he succeeded in getting Allen and Peay downstairs where they were turned over to other police. Truitt returned to his apartment. He was later arrested by other officers.”</p>

They sought to minimize the Police Captain’s painful injuries, torn clothing, and the mauling to which he was subjected. However, in essential features, the <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>charges in the indictments were amply and sufficiently established.</p>
    <p id="b147-3" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[225,445,1150,654]]]'>The chief complaint of defendants is that the court below erred in refusing to grant a new trial because of the injection into the case of incompetent and irrelevant testimony concerning' communist connections and activities of defendant Truitt and Smith. It is charged that this is a collateral issue, and had nothing to do with the crimes charged for which defendants were indicted, and should not have been permitted in the record; that the effect of such innuendoes, inferences and unsupported irrelevant accusations created prejudice and antagonism against defendants in the minds of the jury.</p>
    <p id="b147-4" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[229,1112,1147,653]]]'>The trial judge in his charge said: “At this stage I want to say to you that these men are not being tried for being communists.

The Superior Court decided, in such circumstances, that the testimony was properly admitted. President Judge Bhodes said: “Appellants elected to try their case with the communist issue injected into it, and we cannot say they did not have a purpose in doing so. Evidence introduced by the Commonwealth, without objection, established that Local 65, which conducted the picketing <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>at the New Kensington store, was communist dominated and had been thrown out of the C. I. O. for that reason. The cross-examination of Truitt and Smith as to the character of Local 65 and their connection with it was proper. Likewise, without objection, Truitt and Smith were cross-examined as to whether they were Communists or had any affiliations with the party. Smith had been hired by Local 65 as the picket captain; he brought the pickets to New Kensington on behalf of that organization, and he met Truitt the same day. Truitt knew the officers of Local 65, and was contacted by its organizer from New York relative to the picketing. Appellants met this subsidiary issue and presented testimony in contradiction of the testimony of Commonwealth’s rebuttal witness Cvetic. It was relevant for the Commonwealth to disclose fully the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crimes with which appellants were charged and on trial. It was permissible for the Commonwealth to show Truitt’s relations with Smith and the pickets generally and with Local 65. This evidence had a bearing on whether Truitt harbored Smith at the time Smith'was sought by “the police, and as to whether Truitt did commit the offenses of resisting arrest and assaulting an officer. The testimony as to the communistic character of Local 65 and the communistic connections and activities of appellants relates to an issue in which the appellants had tacitly acquiesced. The evidence as to communism was in the case for all purposes for which it was relevant, and this applies to Cvetic’s testimony introduced by the Commonwealth in rebuttal. See Com. v. Albert, <a href="/pa-super/169/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="169 Pa. Super. 318" data-case-ids="473044" data-case-paths="/pa-super/169/0318-01">169 Pa.

The evidence relating to appellants’ alleged communistic connections was certainly admissible also to show appellants’ motive in committing the offenses with which they were charged. Cf. Com. v.

Here again, such testimony was without the slightest probative or relevant value. If it had been objected to it ought to have been, excluded. Defendant Smith was cross-examined about the communist influence in Local No. 65, although he was not a member of it. Smith was also questioned whether or not certain named officers of the Union had been cited by the United States Congress “for communistic activities”. Counsel for defendant then objected in the following language: “By Mr. McKague: Now if the court please, something tells me this is the time to object to this going into the stuff that Mr. Loughran <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>is trying to inject into this case for the purpose of prejudicing these defendants.” The objection was overruled and the cross-examination proceeded concerning the communist activities of Local 65 and of the witness. Both defendants Truitt and Smith denied that they were communists. In rebuttal the Commonwealth offered the testimony of Matt Cvetic, who styled himself “an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation”. His testimony was offered to attack the credibility of defendant Truitt’s testimony when he denied that he was a communist. An objection was then entered by the attorney for defendants, which was overruled and an exception allowed. The witness was permitted to testify that Truitt was an active communist, and gave testimony concerning Truitt’s communist activities. This was clearly error.

The right is all-inclusive; it embraces every class and type of person.

The trial in the present case was not “free from passion or prejudice”; on the contrary, passion and prejudice ran riot throughout its entire course. Page after page of the record is replete with attempts on the part of the Commonwealth to establish that “Local 65” in New York was controlled by communists and that Philip Murray had thrown it out of the C.- I. O. because of its being communist dominated; that all its officers were communists; that its president and vice-president had been cited by a Committee of Congress for communist activities; that apparently the defendants did not care whether or not those persons were in fact communists; that defendants’ counsel probably had in mind to charge Local 65, rather than defendant Truitt, for his services in the case; that Truitt was a State committeeman of the Progressive Party; that that party was dominated and controlled by communists; that Henry Wallace had withdrawn from it; that Truitt had had meetings of the Progressive Party in his house; that he had also held meetings there of the American Slav Congress, of which he was a member; that that organization was controlled by the Communist Party and had been declared subversive by a Congressional Committee; that Truitt had been seen at communist <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>meetings; and that all the other defendants were communists also.</p>

Three of the defendants were colored men. The District Attorney “for purpose of the record” asked Truitt whether he wasn’t of the Caucasian race,— a white man,— and then asked him in cross-examination why he would allow “these colored people” to “associate” with his two daughters and two white women pickets; (the “association” in fact consisting merely of the defendants and these women being temporarily engaged in conversation in the living room of Truitt’s house with Mrs. Truitt present). Truitt replied that he had never discriminated in choosing his friends because of their color, whereupon the District Attorney said: “You want the jury to believe that?” and again asked whether he never discriminated between colored people and white friends associating with his daughters. He suggestively inquired of one of the defendants on cross-examination whether Truitt did not have “girls” on his third floor to “entertain” the defendants.</p>

True, he told the jury that “these men are not being tried for being communists” and that they were not to let any prejudice that they might have against communism or against the Communist Party influence their decision. But of course that admonition was, under the circumstances, nothing more than a formal, futile pronouncement, hopelessly inadequate to repair the damage that had been done by the mass of testimony on that subject that had been received in evidence. If the court thought it necessary to deliver such a warning it is difficult to understand why it allowed all the testimony in regard to communism to be brought into the case, and why it repeated all of it in its charge to the jury. <em>There are at least four places in the record where counsel for defendants strenuously objected to the admission of such testimony, </em>and even if he had failed to do so it would have been the duty of the court of its own motion to prevent the injection into the trial of such wholly irrelevant, incompetent, inflammatory and sinister evidence: <em>Wagner v.

Being a member of the Communist Party, involving as it does the .teaching and advocating of the overthrow of our government by force and violence, is itself a crime, and one far more grievous than any of those with which these defendants were charged; their conviction therefore should not have been sought by attempting to prove, or by insinuating, that they were guilty of this much graver crime for which they were not indicted nor then being tried. As to defendant Smith the sole issue was as to who started the fighting, — he or the witness Pee, — and on that point there was diverse testimony, there being an intimation that the latter, aided by. his friends, might have been the real instigator of the fight that followed. As to the other defendants, there were also different stories told by the witnesses for the Commonwealth and the witnesses for the defendants as to who was responsible for the scuffle with the officer which took place at Truitt’s home. Certainly in determining where the truth lay as to these factually controverted matters questions of communist affiliation, race, and the rights of labor to picket, were wholly immaterial.</p>

      <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>There was another fundamental legal question involved, but completely ignored, in the trial, namely, the lawfulness of the presence of the officer in Truitt’s home. It is hornbook law that an officer may not make an arrest for a misdemeanor unless the offense was committed in his presence. The crimes with which these defendants were charged were all misdemeanors: The Penal Code of 1939, §§314, 401, 708, 709. There is room for doubt in the testimony as to whether officer Bordonaro actually saw an affray being committed or defendant Smith engaging in any affray; apparently, when he came upon the scene, Smith was running away, whether because he had been the culpable aggressor, or, as he and others on his behalf testified, the victim of an assault. The question, therefore, should have been submitted to the jury as to whether the officer did witness the' crime for which he attempted to seek out and arrest Smith in Truitt’s home, and the jury should have been instructed that if the offense for which Smith was indicted and tried was not committed in the officer’s presence the latter had no right, without a warrant, to attempt to arrest him in Truitt’s home, for, under such circumstances, he would have been an intruder there, and Truitt would have had the constitutional right to prevent him from searching his home. It is true that this question was not raised at the trial by defendant’s counsel, but it is so vital and fundamental, going to the very heart of the question as to the relative legal rights of the parties when the scuffle with the officer took place, that, under the authorities hereinbefore cited, this court may nevertheless take cognizance of it.</p>

A defendant, no matter how bad his criminal record may be; has the. mantle of innocence draped around his shoulders as soon as he is arrested; his crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; the jury must be unanimously convinced of his guilt; under the Courts’ decisions, he is protected against the police, against the Commonwealth’s witnesses, against the district attorney, against the trial judge; and now he is to be protected against the unsuccessful strategy, the assumed ignorance or stupidity or the imagined neglect of his experienced lawyer.
