Defendant signed on September • 5, 1950 a confession in which, after stating that Lemin twice threw her to the ground, she said: “Herbert then got into his car and sat down behind the wheel. The car door on his side was open, and I walked over to the door and kept on arguing with him about the gun. I told him that he could not have the car unless he gave the gun to me. Finally, he handed the gun to me, and I closed his door shut. At this time, we started to argue about the fellow who had taken me to the dance at the Cashtown Hotel on August 19, 1950. Herbert kept on harping about my running around, and I told him that a couple of his girls needed something done to them too. Herbert told me that I was too yellow to do anything and that made me mad. All the time that we were arguing, I had my both arms on the ear door and window was rolled down. I pointed the gun toward him and pulled the trigger. After I pulled the trigger of the gun, I opened the door and Herbert rolled out. As Herbert rolled out, I told him that maybe this will learn you a lesson. <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>He said Shorty, <em>if you never did anything for me, take me to a doctor. </em>I helped him get up on his feet and helped him get into the car.”</p>

She then took him to a doctor who ordered an ambulance which rushed him to the hospital. Dr. Hudson testified that when he first saw Lemin at the hospital, at about 7:15 o’clock that evening, “He was in extreme shock, perspiring, had lost considerable blood and was actually at a point not too far from death, requiring blood transfusions and immediate surgery in order to prevent his death immediately.” When asked, “Was there anything concerning his visage or his actions which indicated that he thought he was going to die?”, Dr. Hudson answered, “Yes, sir.” “Q. What was it? A. He was very apprehensive, restless.” The doctor testified that he performed a long and very serious operation; that it was impossible to remove the bullet, and that Lemin died eight days later from <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>wounds caused by the bullet. There then followed this examination: “Q. Doctor, you asked him certain questions concerning how he was wounded, did you not? A. Yes, sir. Q. Following those questions, did he make a statement concerning whether he was dying or not? A. Yes, sir. Q. Go ahead Doctor, what was the statement? A. ‘Don’t let her get away with it.’ ” Defendant’s counsel objected and moved that the answer be stricken; the court overruled the objection and noted an exception.</p>
