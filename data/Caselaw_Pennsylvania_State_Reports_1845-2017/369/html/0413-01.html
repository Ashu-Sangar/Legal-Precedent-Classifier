The accident occurred at 6:15 P.M. on December 20, 1947. It was dark at the time. The weather was “fairly clear”; there was some smoke and mist in the air. The railroad, at the place of the accident, runs in a generally east-west direction and more or less parallel to the Ohio River which is approximately 200 feet to the south of the railroad. River Road extends from the river in a northerly direction across the railroad at right angles and then across the Ohio River Boulevard, a four-lane “very much travelled highway” which lies immediately north of and parallel to the railroad; the distance between the southerly curb of the Boulevard and the northernmost rail of the tracks is about 28 feet at the location of the crossing. The width of the separation between the highway and the railroad diminishes as they extend eastward. From the south, the tracks are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4: No. 1, being the eastbound passenger <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>track; No. 2, the eastbound freight track; No. 3, the westbound freight track; and No. 4, the westbound passenger track.</p>

The last 10 feet rise even more steeply. Because of the angle at which the hood of an automobile, approaching the crossing from the south, is elevated, it is impossible for a driver to see a man standing in the middle of the road at the far side of the crossing. That situation continues until the vehicle is leveled off on track No. 1. The driver’s view to the east, approaching the crossing from the south, is similarly obstructed by the rising elevation of the road as well as by a number of industrial buildings and a passenger shed which, at the time of the accident, stood within 14 feet of the south (or outside) rail of track No. 1 and close by the road. From this point, the view to the east is further interfered with by a series of telegraph poles planted on a line parallel to the tracks 8 feet south of the southernmost rail. From about 10 feet south of and onward to the crossing a driver had a fairly uninterrupted view of the track to the east for approximately 1400 feet, and at certain points along the road back to about 20 feet south of the crossing a clear view of the tracks to the east could at times be had between various obstructions. To the west of the crossing at a point 170 feet distant, the tracks curved to the left so that, from a point 10 feet south of the south rail of the No. 1 track at the crossing, a train approaching from the west on that track could be seen for a distance of only 700 feet. Further difficulty attended an approach to the crossing from the south at nighttime because of the confusing background to the east created by the lights of cars moving westward along the Ohio River Boulevard; and loud noises from the heavy forging hammers <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>in the steel mills directly across the river, which were operating at the time of the accident, were plainly audible at the crossing.</p>
    <p id="b487-3" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[154,507,1150,755]]]'>In committing himself to the crossing, the deceased was first observed at a point 5 feet south of the south rail of the No. 1 track proceeding at a speed of 5 miles an hour. He continued over the crossing at the same speed; the cartway was rough; he passed safely over the first three tracks and was struck when upon the fourth track. The headlight of the locomotive was dim; no warning of the train’s approach was given. There was on guard at the time a crossing watchman who was standing with lanterns 15 feet north of the north rail of the No. 4 track, that is, across all the tracks and back toward the Ohio River Boulevard. However, the watchman was not visible to the deceased until the latter had leveled off on the No. 1 track.</p>

The deceased having been killed in the accident, a presumption arises that he used due care, in committing himself to the crossing. In <em>Perry v. Pittsburgh Railways Company, </em><a href="/pa/357/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="357 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="472095" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0608-01">357 Pa. 608</a>, 612-613, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20354" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="55 A.2d 354">55 A. 2d 354</a>, we said that “. . . in a case, such as the present, where the accident in suit resulted in death, a presumption attends the plaintiff that the decedent exercised due care for his own safety.” As there noted, the rule and its rationale were well stated by the late Chief Justice Maxey in <em>Morin v. Kreidt, </em><a href="/pa/310/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="310 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1144251" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0090-01">310 Pa. 90</a>, 97, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.%20799" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="164 A. 799">164 A. 799</a>, as follows, “When a person is killed in an accident there is a presumption arising from the general knowledge of the strength of the instinct of self-preservation and the natural desire to avoid pain and injury to oneself that the deceased at the time of the accident was exercising due care”, quoted with approval in <em>Michener v. Lewis, </em><a href="/pa/314/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="314 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1154633" data-case-paths="/pa/314/0156-01">314 Pa. 156</a>, 158, 170, A. 272. See, <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>also, <em>Ehrhart v. York Rys. Co., </em><a href="/pa/308/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="308 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1140249" data-case-paths="/pa/308/0566-01">308 Pa. 566</a>, 570, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.%20810" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="162 A. 810">162 A. 810</a>, and cases there cited. It follows, therefore, that the plaintiff’s decedent stopped, looked and listened before entering upon the crossing. There is nothing from which it can be concluded as a matter of law that the passenger train approaching from the east was then observable from a point on the roadway south of the crossing. Nor is there anything otherwise in the plaintiff’s case to negate the presumption. When the plaintiff’s eyewitness to the accident first saw the deceased in motion, he was then within 5 feet of the south rail of No. 1 track which, manifestly, does not establish that he had not stopped, looked and listened elsewhere at a proper place. In <em>Bush v. Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railway Company, </em><a href="/pa/232/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="232 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="977879" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0327-01">232 Pa. 327</a>, 328-329, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.%20409" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="81 A. 409">81 A. 409</a>, where plaintiff’s chauffeur drove upon a railroad crossing at night, after having stopped, looked and listened, we said that “Whether he stopped a sufficient length of time to inform himself of conditions, and whether he advanced with due caution from that point, were questions to be determined not by hard and fa at rules of positive duty applicable in all cases, but by the jury upon a consideration of all the circumstances in the case . . . .” See <em>Muehlhof v.

The inapplicability of the above-mentioned rule in such circumstances was pertinently stated by our present Chief Justice in <em>Muehlhof v. Reading Co., </em>supra, where he said (p. 21), — “Plaintiff’s truck, traveling at a very low rate of speed, was-hit as its rear wheel was clearing the last rail of the second track, <em>and not immediately after entering the crossing, </em>hence the rule contended for by the defendant that ‘It is vain for a man to say that he looked and listened, if, in spite of what his eyes and ears must have told him, he walked directly in front of a moving locomotive and was immediately struck’ cannot apply: [citing cases]. That rule, first enunciated in Carroll v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=12%20W.N.C.%20348" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="12 W.N.C. 348">12 W.N.C. 348</a>, . . . ‘applies only where a person enters upon a railroad track, and is struck by a moving train so instantaneously as to raise a legal presumption that he did not stop, look and listen, and to rebut any presumption that he had done so’ ” (Emphasis supplied), citing <em>Howard v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, </em><a href="/pa/219/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="219 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1002674" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0358-01">219 Pa. 358</a>, 360, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20A.%20848" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="68 A. 848">68 A. 848</a>, as quoted in <em>Waltosh v.

The plain intendment of the ruling in the <em>Muehlhof </em>case is that where a traveller stops, looks and listens before entering upon a grade crossing and, neither seeing nor hearing anything approaching on the tracks, proceeds and is thereafter struck by a train on a track beyond the first, the question of his contributory negligence is for the jury. There are a number of other decisions of this court to like effect: see, e.g., <em>Thomas v.

He was employed at a factory nearby; had formerly lived in the neighborhood and had also been a watchman at this crossing. The witness testified (p. 34a et seq.) that he saw deceased driving the bread truck at between 5 and 10 miles an hour; that (69a) “Q. . . . the truck continued up on to the crossing and across number 1 track and number 2 track . . . and was finally on number 4 track when it was struck? A. That’s right. Q. And in all the time you saw the truck it never stopped, did it? A. No, sir.” The witness also testified (41a) that when the truck was 5 to 10 feet from the first rail he heard the railroad crossing watchman “holler” and (70a) saw the train coming approximately 100 to 200 feet from the crossing; that he saw the crossing watchman (71a) just north of No. 4 track; that immediately after the accident he observed that the watchman had two lighted lanterns in his hands. <em>Before the accident </em>the witness had not observed the lanterns because (72a) after the watchman called to deceased and the witness saw the train coming he “fastened my eyes on the truck to see if it would stop. ... I kept my eyes on the truck until the accident happened.”</p>
    <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[262,1668,1148,538]]]'>The majority opinion states “Perhaps [deceased] thought that by continuing across, he could clear the oncoming westbound train, which he almost did.” This statement, it is true, was based upon the assumption that deceased was on the first eastbound track before he observed the oncoming westbound train. But the uncontradicted testimony of plaintiff’s witness Martin was that the truck was 5 to 10 feet from the first eastbound rail when the watchman called, and <em>without stopping </em>deceased continued across the tracks.</p>
