Five other nephews and nieces contested the will and eventually the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County heard evidence to determine whether the testatrix was of sound testamentary capacity at the time she executed the will and whether she had been subjected to undue influence by Mrs. Edenborn in the making thereof.</p>

Nerves of the spinal column were apparently damaged, preventing her from assuming an erect posture and compelling her to walk in a bent over position with the aid of a cane. Later she lost practically all locomotion and was confined to bed or chair. Multiple sclerosis added its burden of torment. She was also deprived of much of the use of her hands, and a throat affliction distorted her speech to the point often of unintelligibility. One of the witnesses, who saw her in September, 1949, testified: <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>“She was in a chair, she didn’t sit up straight in the chair, she was partly over, and she couldn’t get out of the chair herself and her hands were terribly crippled and she was physically in a terrible condition, you would never know it was the same person.”</p>

That’s right, I have seen her head laying on her chest for a good ten minutes. Q. And what was she endeavoring to do if anything with her head? A.

    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[156,462,1149,550]]]'>This Court has frequently indicated that the draftsman of a will, especially if he be a lawyer, is always an important and usually the most important witness in a contested will case and where, as here, he knew the testatrix prior to the execution of her will, since he had handled her husband’s estate, his testimony showing voluntary and intelligent action by the testatrix, makes out a prima facie case that requires very strong evidence to offset it: <em>Kustus v.

Munnell, </em>supra, the fact that the testatrix changed her will in favor of one with whom she took up domicile is not material as showing undue influence, for a new will cannot be set aside merely because it departs from the old one.</p>
