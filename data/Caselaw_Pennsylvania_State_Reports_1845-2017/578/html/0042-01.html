In other words, because Appellee did not challenge the denial or cancellation of his driver’s license or the recall, suspension, revocation or disqualification of his operating privileges, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1550(a)’s jurisdictional grant was not met.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

We find guidance, however, in certain principles that have traditionally assisted us in determining when an order is final and may be appealed. As we have stated, “[i]n ascertaining what is a final order, we have looked beyond the technical effect of the adjudication to its practical ramifications[,]” and have defined a final order as one that “ends the litigation” or “disposes of the entire case” or “effectively puts the litigant ‘out of court.’ ” <em>T.C.R.

As noted, the Notice does not merely advise Appellee of a requirement for operating privileges restoration. Rather, the Notice also suspends Appellee’s operating privileges. Moreover, the suspension that the Notice effects is for two years—for one year under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1532(b) and for an additional year under Act 63. That the Notice holds out the possibility that PennDOT may restore Appellee’s operating privileges and lift the additional year of suspension should he equip his vehicles with an ignition interlock system does not alter the fact that the Notice constitutes PennDOT’s last word and definitive decision on suspension. In this regard, therefore, the Notice has the earmarks of a final order for purposes of appeal. Accordingly, we conclude that the Notice is a final order within the meaning of 42 Pa.C.S. § 933(a), which gave the court of common pleas jurisdiction.</p>

In enacting Act 63, the General Assembly could have reasonably concluded that the Commonwealth’s interest in shielding its citizens from the hazards that intoxicated drivers pose would be furthered by denying the privilege of driving for an additional year to those recidivist DUI offenders who cannot pay to install such a device on their respective vehicles.

The only state equal protection claim that Appellant developed and the only state equal protection claim that the trial court decided was one that focused on the assertion that Act 63 unlawfully divides DUI offenders into certain classes. This equal protection claim is associated with Article 1, Section 1, which provides that "[a]ll men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.” Pa.

Const. art. 1, § 26, is associated with an equal protection claim that focuses on the assertion that a person has been penalized for the exercise of a constitutional freedom. <em>See Fischer, </em><a href="/pa/509/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="509 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1795370" data-case-paths="/pa/509/0293-01">502 A.2d at 123-24</a>.
