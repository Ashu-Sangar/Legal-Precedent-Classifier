    <p id="b629-8" data-blocks='[["BL_629.9",629,[143,935,1155,1052]]]'>In October of 1988, appellant raped and murdered the two-year-old child victim in a particularly gruesome fashion. Appellant scalped the child by cutting with a sharp knife from one of her ears across her front hair line to her other ear and peeling back her scalp to the nape of her neck, thereby exposing her skull. Appellant also inflicted blunt force trauma to the child’s chest and stomach which was sufficient to tear her liver and lungs. That force may also have been the cause of two feet of the child’s intestines protruding from her genital area, but it is also possible that appellant simply pulled the girl’s intestines out of her body through her genital area. Appellant ripped the child’s genital area to such an extent that there was one large bloody cavity in the area of her vaginal and anal orifices. Appellant burned the child’s body, inflicted numerous lacerations, and fractured her skull. All of these injuries occurred while this child was still alive. Appellant then took the child to an isolated area of a state forest in Cambria County where he hid her corpse. Appellant confessed his acts to the police, and drew a map for them which led to the discovery of the child’s decayed body.</p>

The trial court formally sentenced appellant to death and, in addition, sentenced him to consecutivé terms of imprisonment of ten to twenty years each for rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, as well as a concurrent term of five to ten years of imprisonment for statutory rape. This Court affirmed on direct appeal. <em>Commonwealth v.

A claim is previously litigated under the PCRA if the highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(a)(2). In light of the PCRA’s previous litigation bar, we agree with the PCRA court that appellant is not entitled to relitigate the question of whether he was denied due process when the trial court and the prosecution failed to disclose the contents of “social service” records from Clearfield Youth Services files concerning the victim and her family (Argument III). Those records were examined by the trial court <em>in camera </em>before trial and the court determined that they contained no exculpatory evidence. Appellant claims that the issue of his entitlement to those records was not decided on direct appeal, but he is mistaken. In the supplemental brief filed in that appeal, appellant claimed that his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to review the Children and Youth Services files for evidence helpful to his defense.

N.T. 10/21/98, a.m. at 73-74; p.m. at 29-35. Appellant now argues that a different psychiatric expert with a better understanding of the phenomenon could have been retained and could have taken the fact of appellant’s pedophilia and explained it in a fashion that might have been accepted by a jury as supporting various statutory mitigating circumstances. Though studies and expert opinions concerning pedophilia may have some basis in science, the question of how a lay jury might react to a diagnosis of pedophilia offered as a mitigating circumstance for the gruesome injuries inflicted upon this child is not nearly so certain as appellant apparently believes. Indeed, it is not difficult to imagine that, if trial counsel had presented such “mitigating” evidence, they would now be faulted for doing so by appellant. <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>We cannot say that counsels’ strategic decision, made with an awareness of the availability of this volatile evidence, was objectively unreasonable.

Appellant took the stand at his bench trial and claimed an alibi; in convicting appellant, the trial court disbelieved that alibi. Appellant also took the stand at the penalty phase and reiterated his alibi claim before the jury notwithstanding that he had been convicted of murder in the first degree. During the penalty phase jury charge, the trial court accurately instructed the jury that appellant had raised an alibi defense at trial, but that the defense “was not accepted by the Court in the guilt phase and found to be not credible.” Appellant argues that, while the court could inform the jury of the fact of his conviction at the guilt phase, it had “no cause” to state that it had found the alibi defense not credible. Citing to two cases from New Jersey, but to no governing federal or Pennsylvania authority, appellant suggests that he was entitled to renew his failed alibi defense before his new fact-finder in the hopes of establishing “lingering or residual doubt before the jury.” Brief of Appellant at 76. Appellant argues that trial counsel should have objected to the charge and should have requested a curative instruction and the failure to do so prevented the jury from weighing his credibility concerning residual doubt.</p>

Even if we were to assume that residual doubt may properly be argued to a jury in some circumstances, it is difficult to perceive its relevance where, as here, the sentencing jury did not pass upon the defendant’s guilt or innocence. The question of underlying guilt or innocence, and any level of doubt as to that guilt, was never before the jury: there is, thus, no “residue” for it to consult.

In any event, in defense counsel’s penalty phase summation, he did not argue residual doubt based upon appellant’s testimony denying his guilt. Rather, counsel argued “within the confines of the law” (counsel’s words), recognizing that appellant had been convicted. What counsel then stressed was not residual doubt, but that the question of penalty was distinct from the question of guilt, and that a penalty of death was appropriate “only in the rare, the unusual, the exceptional cases.” N.T. 10/5/89 at 216. Counsel then went on to argue appellant’s character as a mitigating circumstance. Nor did the court charge the jury on any theory of residual doubt which would authorize it to employ residual doubt as some additional factor weighing in favor of a sentence of life imprisonment. Given that the court did not comment on the credibility of appellant’s testimony except to advise the jurors that such was for them to determine, that trial counsel did not argue residual doubt, and that the jury was not instructed that it was empowered to consider appellant’s continuing denial of guilt as a ground for returning a life sentence, the claim that the court’s comment was prejudicial fails.</p>

Second, although appellant is correct on the two essential legal predicates for his <em>argument—i.e., </em>that future dangerousness is not a valid aggravating circumstance in Pennsylvania and that injecting non-statutory aggravating circumstances into a capital jury’s sentencing determination is reversible error—the defect with appellant’s argument lies in his attempt to apply those predicates to this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Appellant essentially argues that his future dangerousness was used by the Commonwealth as a pseudo-aggravator, resulting in his death sentence. But the record is wholly devoid of support for this claim. What is clear from the record is that the jury <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>found two aggravating circumstances, that appellant tortured his infant victim and that the murder was committed in the course of rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. The sole mitigator found by the jury was that appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, and the jury determined that the two aggravating circumstances outweighed this mitigating circumstance. Logically, whether appellant presented a danger to others in the future does not factor into either of the aggravating circumstances, which were concerned with the particulars of this murder. Because there is no underlying merit to his claim, appellant has failed to demonstrate that his prior counsel were ineffective.</p>

The PCRA court found that the prosecutor’s comments were not a misstatement of the law, but instead, merely argued the prosecutions view of that evidence. The PCRA court noted that, in his own penalty phase closing, appellants counsel had argued as a mitigating circumstance that appellant was intoxicated, angry and emotionally disturbed. Appellants counsel specifically pointed to the testimony of witnesses and appellant’s own actions that would lead to a conclusion that appellant was intoxicated at the time of the murder. In response, the prosecutor stated that the jury was required to consider whether appellant was so intoxicated as to not be accountable for his actions, and that to make this determination, the jury should consider the strength of the evidence presented. The PCRA court held that both appellants counsel and the prosecutor argued their respective side of the issue and both made it clear to the jury that it was ultimately the role of the jury to determine if appellants intoxication was sufficient to be considered a mitigating circumstance. Our review of the penalty phase transcript reveals that the PCRA courts analysis of the arguments advanced by appellants trial counsel and the prosecutor is accurate. The fact that the parties lawyers dispute the significance of proffered evidence does not mean that one <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>must be misstating the law. In any event, it is the court which instructed the jury on the law, and counsel could trust in the fact that the jury was made well aware of the role of counsels argument in the jury’s determination. The underlying claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness therefore lacks merit.</p>
    <p id="b649-4" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[145,639,1153,855]]]'>Appellant’s sixth and final layered claim is that all prior counsel were ineffective for failing to claim that the prosecutor improperly questioned appellant at the penalty phase concerning his prior arrest, trial and acquittal of sexual assault and molestation charges involving his adopted daughter. Citing to no case authority, appellant states that Pennsylvania law prohibits a prosecutor from cross-examining a criminal defendant on his prior convictions and, therefore, a prior acquittal cannot be an appropriate topic for cross-examination either. By cross-examining him regarding the prior acquittal, appellant asserts, the prosecutor introduced “irrelevant” evidence and improperly injected a non-statutory aggravating circumstance into the penalty proceedings. The Commonwealth counters that appellant opened the door to the cross-examination in this instance by volunteering testimony on direct examination regarding the charges and acquittal.</p>
    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.6",649,[144,1527,1154,853]]]'>The record reveals that, in his direct testimony at the penalty phase, and apparently as part of his continuing denial of guilt, appellant claimed that the state trooper who had questioned him regarding the murder “was very accusative;” said that he believed appellant was responsible for the death of the child; and stated that “because of my past situation with my wife and kids that I had committed this crime against [the child], that I was sick.” Appellant further claimed that he felt that the trooper “directly accused” him of committing the instant crime because of “a past charge” he had faced. Asked by his counsel what had happened on that past charge, appellant testified that he was tried before a jury and was “found innocent and that it was my wife that which basically had”—at which point his counsel cut him off and asked whether the verdict in the prior case was “not guilty,” and appellant agreed.

      <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked appellant to explain the past “situation” with his wife and kids which appellant had claimed was the basis for the trooper accusing him of this crime. Appellant responded that his wife had had him arrested for molesting his daughter and that he was then tried before a jury in Reading, Pennsylvania. Appellant repeated the claim that he was “found innocent of those charges.” Appellant added that “it’s listed in transcripts that my wife in fact had sexual preferences.” The prosecutor, like appellant’s counsel on direct, clarified that appellant was found not guilty, rather than innocent. In response to appellant’s apparent suggestion that his wife was behind the charges, the prosecutor asked, “your wife wasn’t in [sic] trial down there,” to which appellant responded, “No, but she admitted to the facts.” N.T. 10/5/89 at 143-44.</p>
    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[233,1144,1158,576]]]'>Again citing no authority, appellant now contends that the prosecutor’s accurate comment that appellant was found not guilty, rather than “innocent,” was “inherently prejudicial ... improper and unethical.” In appellant’s view, the prosecutor’s statement implied to the jury that appellant was actually guilty of molesting his daughter. In forwarding this argument, appellant inexplicably fails to acknowledge that it was he who broached the topic of the prior charge and verdict on direct examination and that, indeed, his own counsel had corrected appellant’s initial erroneous claim that he was found innocent, rather than not guilty.</p>

First, although it might have been improper for the prosecutor to have initiated an examination concerning a prior acquittal, the calculus is entirely different when the defense opens the door to the subject. Second, the prosecutor did no more than appellant’s own counsel on direct, when faced with appellant’s initial inaccurate claim that he was found innocent, rather than that he was acquitted or found not guilty. When appellant repeated the mischaracterization of the previous verdict on cross-examination, the prosecutor was no less warranted in correcting it. Third, appellant’s argument that he was preju<a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>diced by the correction fails. Indeed, since appellant’s argument on prejudice fails to come to terms with the record facts that it was he, and not the prosecutor, who broached the subject of the prior charges, and that his own counsel made the same corrective point concerning the verdict in that case, no relevant argument on prejudice is forwarded. In any event, the prosecutor never argued that appellant’s prior acquittal constituted an additional aggravating circumstance; the jury was never told that it could find such an additional aggravating circumstance; and the only two aggravating circumstances found by the jury—that appellant tortured his infant victim and that the murder was committed in the course of rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse-had nothing to do with the prior charges. Because the underlying claim of prosecutorial misconduct is meritless, the layered claim of counsel ineffectiveness necessarily fails.</p>

The first is appellants procedural claim that the PCRA court failed to provide him with a “meaningful” hearing on his claims (Argument I). The record is clear that the court did, in fact, conduct evidentiary hearings on October 21 and December 16, 1998. In addition, the PCRA court held two lengthy sessions on August 12 and September 29, 1998, at which the parties argued legal issues arising out of appellant’s petition.

The situation is different where (as here) the post-conviction petitioner’s allegation that the Court did not fulfill such obligations rests upon a mistake of fact patent from the face of the opinion itself. In this case, the claim could not logically have been raised or litigated prior to the issuance of the Court’s opinion. Therefore, I believe that Appellant’s contention in this regard is cognizable under the PCRA. Moreover, it is not apparent, to me at least, that, simply because the mistake of fact appears in a different part of the paragraph, it could not have affected the proportionality analysis. We cannot know, at this juncture, that the three distinct statutory review functions set forth in that paragraph were undertaken with such clean boundaries that erroneous information reflected in one aspect of that function could not also have been relied upon for any other portion of it. Accordingly, I would find that Appellant is entitled to a new proportionality review by this Court.</p>
    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.5",655,[128,1306,1158,523]]]'>That said, I reach the same ultimate result as the majority, namely, that this claim does not entitle Appellant to a new sentencing hearing. This was a particularly gruesome rape and murder of a two-year-old girl, whom Appellant had separated from her family and transported to a remote area where it was impossible for any help to come to her. In such circumstances—and taking into account the relevant data from the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts and other information pertaining to similar cases—imposition of the death penalty here was neither disproportionate nor excessive.</p>

He contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge such jurors for cause (Argument VII). The majority rejects this claim without reaching its merits on the basis that Appellant allegedly waived it by failing to raise it before the PCRA court. The <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>record reveals, however, that, on December 16, 1998, Appellant filed a motion seeking to amend his petition, in which he raised the issue. The PCRA court never ruled on the motion, and hence, we have no substantive basis to conclude that the court either allowed the amendment or disallowed it. <em>See generally </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 905(A) (stating that amendments to PCRA petitions “shall be freely allowed to achieve substantial justice”). Under such circumstances, this Court should not summarily consider the issue waived. Rather, if there is any potential merit to the claim, the preferred course would be to remand the matter to the PCRA court for a ruling on the motion to amend.</p>
    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[246,1009,1153,957]]]'>Nevertheless, a remand is unnecessary here because the claim lacks arguable merit. Although Appellant identifies several jurors whom he argues should have been struck, he only supports his contentions by highlighting limited portions of the <em>voir dire </em>proceedings which are taken out of context. Appellant asserts, for example, that venireman Robert Santee was biased in favor of the death penalty. However, after the portion of the questioning that Appellant cites, defense counsel and the court both interviewed Mr. Santee, whose unequivocal responses reflected that he would follow the instructions of the court. <em>See </em>N.T. 9/26/89 at 239-41. Furthermore, earlier in the interview, the prosecutor asked Mr. Santee whether he would presume that death was the appropriate penalty, to which he responded that he would not. <em>See id. </em>at 235-36. Similarly, a full review of the questioning of the other jurors identified by Appellant gives little foundation to conclude that they would not be fair and impartial, or would have trouble following the judge’s instructions.</p>
