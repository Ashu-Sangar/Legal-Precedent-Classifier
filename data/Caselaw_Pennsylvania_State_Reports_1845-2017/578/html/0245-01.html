Hall (Hall) appeals from an Order of the Commonwealth Court, which dismissed his <em>pro se </em>Petition for Review in the Nature of Mandamus, brought in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. Hall contends that the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (Board) improperly denied his numerous requests for parole by judging his applications pursuant to standards enacted in 1996, five years after his date of sentence.

Appellant points to the amendments to the 1996 Parole Act that he asserts altered the focus of the parole policy in Pennsylvania from one that centered on the rehabilitation of the offender to one that now emphasizes public safety, deterrence, and the incapacitation of criminals.

In each of those cases, the Court was faced with an argument that a decrease in the frequency of scheduled parole hearings constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation as to the prisoners sentenced under the prior scheme. In <em>Morales, </em>the changes occurred via statutory enactment; while in <em>Gamer, </em>the change in frequency of parole hearings was accomplished through the exercise of the parole board’s legitimate discretion. In each case, based on the specific facts presented, the Court found no <em>ex post facto </em>violations. However, the critical points made in those cases are first, that retroactive changes in the laws governing parole may violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause; and second, that the test for determining if such a violation has occurred is “whether retroactive application of the change in law created a significant risk of increased punishment.” <em>Garner, </em>at 256, <a href="/us/529/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="529 U.S. 244" data-case-ids="9508391" data-case-paths="/us/529/0244-01">120 S.Ct. 1362</a>.

      <em>Winklespecht </em>was a plurality opinion. The Appellant had presented his <em>ex post facto </em>challenge to the denial of his parole application by bringing a petition for the writ of habeas corpus. The court was presented with two questions, whether a writ of habeas corpus was the correct means to challenge the denial of parole, and whether Appellant had suffered an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. Three of the justices agreed that the 1996 amendments to the Parole Act did not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause. The opinion announcing the judgment of the court (OAJC) reasoned that although the 1996 amendments added new language, the alteration in wording did not create a change in the concepts considered by the parole board when exercising its discretion over an application for parole. According to the OAJC, a reordering of the considerations necessary to resolve an application for parole could not result in an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. 813 A.2d at 691-92. Two <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>justices concurred in the result without opinion. I authored a short opinion concurring in result only. I agreed with dismissing the writ of habeas corpus as I believed that a writ of mandamus was the correct method for challenging a denial of parole; and that resolution of the case should have ended short of a discussion on the merits of the <em>ex post facto </em>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 692. Justice Castille concurred in the OAJC, with the exception that he believed a habeas petition to the trial court would be the best means to adjudicate constitutional challenges to a denial of parole. <em>Id. </em>at 693. Justice Saylor authored a concurring and dissenting opinion. In sum, he agreed that there was no facial violation of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause and that Appellant could not establish a constitutional violation without pleading and proving that the new guidelines effected a change in the rate at which prisoners were paroled. <em>Id. </em>at 700. However, in the portion of his opinion concurring in the result, Justice Saylor, viewing the <em>ex post facto </em>claim in light of the decisions in <em>Morales </em>and <em>Gamer, </em>stated that he would not go as far as the OAJC, leaving open the possibility that a prisoner could meet the burden of demonstrating an <em>ex post facto </em>violation through the application of the 1996 amendments in a specific case. <em>Id. </em>at 697.</p>

The <em>Mickens-Thomas </em>court did not view the 1996 amendment to the Parole Act as simply reordering policy considerations that had always been reviewed by the parole board, but rather, found the change in language in the 1996 amendments to signal a change in the weight to be afforded those policy concerns within the deliberative process of considering an application for parole. <em><a href="/f3d/321/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="321 F.3d 374" data-case-ids="9361336" data-case-paths="/f3d/321/0374-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/321/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="321 F.3d 374" data-case-ids="9361336" data-case-paths="/f3d/321/0374-01">at 385</a>. Although the Circuit Court did have the benefit of the recent pronouncement of this court in <em>Winklespecht, </em>the court did not consider that case dispositive in its analysis of Mr. MickensThomas’ <em>ex post facto </em>claim. Focusing on the critical points established by the United States Supreme Court in the <em>Morales </em>and <em>Gamer </em>decisions, the court concluded that the change <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>in emphasis in the parole process could create a significant risk of prolonged incarceration. Accepting the premise that an <em>ex post facto </em>violation may occur through application of the amended parole policy guidelines to a prisoner sentenced before the adoption of the 1996 amendments, the court then turned to the specific circumstances in Mr. Mickens-Thomas’ case. Specifically the court looked at the emphasis by the parole board on public safety as a paramount consideration in denying the application for parole. In the court’s view, the concern for public safety eclipses other factors in weight after the 1996 amendment. Thus, if the application for parole had been reviewed prior to the amendment, when public safety was not so heavily emphasized, it was more likely than not that parole would have been granted on the facts of this case. Accordingly, the court concluded that Mr. Mickens-Thomas had established a substantial likelihood of an increase in the period of his incarceration because of the policy changes. The case was then remanded to the parole board to reconsider the application for parole in light of the Circuit Court’s observations regarding the <em>ex post facto </em>claim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

The dissent disputed that holding, pointing out that the underlying issue was one controlled by federal law, and reminding the majority that in <em>Gamer, </em>the United States Supreme Court unmistakably recognized that the <em>ex post facto </em>clause bars retroactive changes in parole policies that create a substantial risk of prolonging a prisoner’s incarceration.

The majority now compounds that mistake by its blanket refusal to consider the reasoning employed by the Third Circuit in <em>Mickens-Thomas. </em>The critical point is that a change in parole policy as applied to a person sentenced under the previous policy can in fact create an increase in that person’s period of incarceration and that any individual prisoner has the right to mount such a challenge.

I recognize that <em>Finnegan </em>is a recent majority decision of this court and under the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>it would ordinarily be entitled to adherence as precedential authority. However, this court has never uncritically employed the concept of <em>stare decisis </em>to perpetuate error, particularly in the constitutional arena, where the Legislature cannot correct any error we make. <em>See generally Hohn v. United States, </em><a href="/us/524/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="524 U.S. 236" data-case-ids="11182106" data-case-paths="/us/524/0236-01">524 U.S. 236</a>, 251, <a href="/us/524/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="524 U.S. 236" data-case-ids="11182106" data-case-paths="/us/524/0236-01">118 S.Ct. 1969</a>, 1977, <a href="/us/524/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="524 U.S. 236" data-case-ids="11182106" data-case-paths="/us/524/0236-01">141 L.Ed.2d 242</a> (1998) (‘‘Considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>have special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress is free to alter what we have done.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).
