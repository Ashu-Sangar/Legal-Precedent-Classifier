Appellant testified that he and Appellee met in January of 1998 to settle certain outstanding economic issues and agreed that after a specified amount in alimony was paid, Appellant’s alimony obligation would cease if Appellee remarried or began living with another person. In a follow-up letter that was sent to Appellee’s attorney, Appellant’s attorney confirmed that the parties had agreed that Appellant was to pay $1,000 per month in alimony for five years, but that alimony would end if Appellee “remarries or cohabitates with another person.” (R. <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>78a-79a, 126a).

According to Appellant, he and Appellee contemplated that alimony was for Appellee’s sole living expenses, and that it would not continue if Appellee began residing with a member of her family or if she were to live with another man or another woman. When asked by the trial court why the parties’ discussion of the cessation of alimony payments included references to Appellee’s living with a woman, as well as with a man, Appellant explained that the primary reason for the dissolution of his marriage was his discovery that Appellee was involved in an intimate relationship with a woman.</p>

The [Agreement] itself does not provide definitions for any of the terms contained in the document. The term cohabitation is defined and used in a number of different ways. The American Heritage Dictionary, third edition, defines cohabitation in two ways: 1) To live together as spouses; and 2) <em>To live together in a sexual relationship when not legally married. </em>Black’s Law Dictionary, sixth edition, defines cohabitation as To live together as husband and wife. Section 3706 of the Divorce Code provides that “cohabitation with a <em>person of the opposite sex </em>who is not a member of the family of the petitioner within the degrees of consanguinity” is a bar to alimony. However, the parties themselves, both lay people, with their own frame of reference hand-wrote the cohabitation verbiage onto the typewritten document. The term cohabitation has a common usage (see definition 2 above) that when applied to the case <em>sub judice </em>takes on a special significance. [Appellant] was permitted to testify concerning the parties [sic] understanding of the cohabitation verbiage. He testified that the demise of the marriage was brought about, in part, from his discovery of [Appellee’s] relationship with a female friend. This factual situation helped form the parties’ understanding of the word “co-habitation” to be living in a sexual relationship when not married. He testified that he and [Appellee] discussed cohabitation with <em>anyone </em>including other females after twenty-four months would bar the remaining alimony payments. We found [Appellant’s] testimony credible and is corroborated by Attorney Mirable’s correspondence of January 13,1998.</blockquote>

    <p id="b432-5" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[247,552,1154,952]]]'>We agree with Appellant. In our view, the Agreement’s provision as to when Appellant’s alimony obligation ends after a certain minimum period of alimony has been paid and before five years of payments have been completed is susceptible of different constructions and capable of being understood in more than one sense. It is, therefore, ambiguous. <em>See Hutchison, </em><a href="/pa/513/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="513 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="1802525" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0192-01">519 A.2d at 390</a>. This, we believe, is the result of the word “cohabitate” in paragraph 4 of the Agreement. The Agreement neither defines “cohabitate” nor incorporates a definition of the term from an outside source. Significantly, the word “cohabitate” in paragraph 4 is not followed with any language that clarifies the specific person or persons with whom Appellee may or may not cohabit for purposes of continuing to receive alimony payments. Further, in common usage, as various dictionaries reflect, the word “cohabit” has several definitions, and is not necessarily limited to that which occurs between a man and a woman, but can also encompass that which occurs between persons of the same gender.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

It can mean that once a minimum alimony period of 24 months is paid and before five years of payments have been completed, alimony payments cease if Appellee cohabits with a man. It can also mean that <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>once a minimum alimony period of 24 months is paid before five years of payments have been completed, alimony payments cease if Appellee cohabits with a woman. In addition, it can mean that that once a minimum alimony period of 24 months is paid before five years of payments have been completed, alimony payments cease if Appellee cohabits with either a man or a woman. Accordingly, we conclude that the Agreement’s alimony provision is ambiguous and hold that the trial court properly admitted parol evidence on the Agreement’s meaning in this regard.</p>
    <p id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.5",433,[139,865,1154,772]]]'>The Superior Court’s conclusion that the Agreement is not ambiguous was premised on the belief that the word cohabitation in paragraph 4 must mean what cohabitation means in 28 Pa.C.S. § 3706. The Superior Court was mistaken. That section of the Divorce Code serves one purpose—it provides parameters for the trial courts to follow in ordering alimony awards, precluding the trial court from awarding alimony in a specified circumstance. There is nothing in 23 Pa.C.S. § 3706 or in the Divorce Code to show that the General Assembly intended that the definition of cohabitation set forth in the statute be incorporated into or control private agreements or that the courts are foreclosed from applying the law of contracts to determine the parties’ intent on such a matter. Nor is there a principle of law that would compel any one of these results.</p>
    <p id="b433-6" data-blocks='[["BL_433.6",433,[138,1679,1154,521]]]'>Finally, Appellee’s contention that even if the Agreement’s alimony provision is ambiguous, its meaning should not be determined through parol evidence of the parties’ intent; but should flow from a construction of contractual terms that achieves fairness, is without merit. The contract principles that govern this case are well-settled. In Pennsylvania, in the area of contract construction, the parties’ contracting intent is paramount. <em>Robert F.
