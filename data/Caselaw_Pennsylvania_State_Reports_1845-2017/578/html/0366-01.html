As AMP’s products were designed as component parts, its primary customers were other manufacturers of electronic equipment. AMP also sold to distributors, but the company made no retail sales.</p>
    <p id="b709-8" data-blocks='[["BL_709.7",709,[140,1186,1156,635]]]'>In the early 1990’s, AMP constructed a Pennsylvania distribution facility (the “Distribution Center”), in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, as a hub to receive product shipments from fifteen of its Pennsylvania and Virginia manufacturing facilities. The products were initially packaged at the manufacturing facilities, either individually in small boxes, self-sealing plastic bags, rigid blister packs, or, in the case of small components, multi-count bags. Products reaching the Distribution Center underwent a weighing and inspection process, then were stored on shelving or in bins until selected to fill a customer’s order. The average duration of this storage was just over five weeks.</p>

In addition, AMP was permitted to supplement the record with a document entitled, “Analysis of House Bill 337 (Printers’ No. 160) Session of 1957,” which was prepared by the then-Pennsylvania Department of Justice. The Analysis pertained to the amendment adding the scope-of-manufacturing language to the definition of manufacturing (including the “packaging, if any, passing to the ultimate consumer” phraseology) and concluded that the effect of the amendment “would be to exempt [from use taxation] all equipment used for packaging, wrapping, filling, and the material handling equipment incidental to such operations.” Analysis of House Bill 337 at 11. Further, AMP advanced its position that equipment and materials at the Distribution Center were used predominantly and directly in operations occurring after the first production stage, which ends with the wrapping of its manufactured products for shipment to other manufacturers, and therefore, the equipment at issue qualified for exclusion <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>from use taxation. In addition, AMP asserted that a manufacturer making use of component parts was itself an “ultimate consumer” of those parts, since AMP components were “consumed” in the subsequent operations of its customer manufacturers. Thus, according to AMP, the exclusion applied to purchases of equipment used predominantly in the packaging of manufactured property sold to other manufacturers.</p>
