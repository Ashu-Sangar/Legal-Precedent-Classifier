In December of 1995, appellee began to experience pain and numbness in both hands and wrists during the day; at times, the numbness continued through the night, awakening her and causing her to fear that she was having a stroke. In January of 1996, appellee informed her supervisor, Barry Bessler, of the nature of her symptoms and that she was going to miss work to seek treatment for her condition. Appellee consulted Dr. William Murphy, D.O., who conducted an electromyogram (EMG),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which led to the diagnosis of <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>carpal tunnel syndrome.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellee continued to work through the pain and numbness, but her condition grew progressively worse until the workday of March 17, 1997, when her hands went totally numb, leaving her unable to finish typing a letter.

    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[233,666,1155,635]]]'>In July of 1997, appellee filed a claim petition alleging that she had sustained a disabling repetitive motion work injury, in the form of carpal tunnel syndrome, on or about March 17, 1997, while employed by the City.

Appellee testified that she had been employed by the City for seven years in the same position until March 17, 1997.

Based upon appellee’s medical history, a physical examination, and the results of two EMGs, Dr. Papa diagnosed appellee as suffering from right carpal tunnel syndrome, left carpal tunnel syndrome, and tendonitis of the right wrist. Dr. Papa concluded that appellee’s medical problems stemmed from the work-related events of March 17, 1997. He described appellee’s condition as a progressively deteriorating process, and continued actions that lead up to the problem will result in increasing the problem. Papa Deposition at 38. Dr. Papa testified that appellee remained disabled and should refrain from activities that utilize repetitive hand motions or require excessive exertion of the wrists and hands, because such activities would <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>increase inflammation and cause additional damage to the nerves, and could ultimately result in the loss of the use of her hands.</p>

Turner testified that appellee had signed a form acknowledging that she was aware of the City’s policy regarding the reporting of work injuries, but that appellee did not report her carpal tunnel syndrome as a work-related injury until March 24, 1997. Bessler testified that, although appellee had complained of discomfort as early as April or May of 1996, she did not specifically inform him that the injury was work-related until March 17, 1997.</p>

Dr. Sattel acknowledged that a continuation of appellee’s job activities could produce increasing symptoms. Dr. Sattel further acknowledged that appellee’s second EMG had indicated that the problem had worsened since the first EMG.

Applying <em>Zurn, </em>the WCJ here concluded that appellee’s injuries likewise did not become disabling until her last day of work, and therefore the duty to give notice to the City arose only as of that date. Because appellee promptly informed her employer of her disabling injury, the WCJ found that appellee gave timely notice.</p>

The Board determined that the last day of employment is the preferred injury date when a claimant sustains a cumulative trauma injury. [A]s each day of work constitutes a new injury, and as [appellee’s] last day of work was March 17,1997, the same day she told [the City] of her work-related injury, the WCJ did not err in concluding that [appellee] provided timely notice of her work injury.

The panel found that the City’s reliance on <em>Piad </em>and <em>Leber </em>was misplaced, noting that those cases did not involve disabilities that, according to the credited medical evidence, resulted from an aggravation/cumulative trauma injury. The panel stressed that aggravation is a term of art in workers’ compensation law, denoting a new injury, as opposed to the mere manifestation of symptoms from a past discrete injury. The panel also noted that Section 311 of the Act does not define injury date. Commonwealth Court precedent, however, recognized that in the case of cumulative trauma or aggravation injuries, ‘determinations <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>of the date of injury depend largely on the facts of each case, the purpose for which the injury date must be established and the medical evidence presented.’ Slip op. at 6-7, <em>quoting Curran v.

When the purpose for which the injury date is being established is to determine proper notice of an aggravation/cumulative trauma injury, the panel reasoned, the remedial purpose of the Act is best effectuated by acknowledging each day of employment as a new injury. In those instances, the last day of employment is the preferred injury date for notice purposes. Slip op. at 6-7, <em>citing Roberts v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Bd.

The panel cited both appellee’s credited testimony that she was able to work through her pain until it actually disabled her on March 17, 1997, at which time she promptly informed the City of the work-related injury, and Dr. Papa’s credited testimony that appellee’s job duties aggravated her existing carpal tunnel condition and increased the problem. The panel also recognized that the WCJ made a credibility determination in accepting the testimony of Dr. Papa that appellee’s cumulative trauma injury was in fact aggravated on March 17, 1997. Since that date represented a new aggravation injury, the panel concluded that appellee’s immediate notice to the City complied with the 120-day requirement of Section 311.</p>

Our purpose in granting allocatur was not to seek to harmonize existing Commonwealth Court authority and, as our analysis <em>infra </em>demonstrates, we do not approach the question presented in the same way as the panel below. Nevertheless, we note that the panel certainly did not err in deeming <em>Leber </em>and <em>Piad </em>distinguishable from the Commonwealth Court's aggravation/cumulative trauma injury cases. The claimant in <em>Leber </em>did not argue that his was a cumulative trauma injury where each day at work caused an aggravation of the condition; the only disputed issue there was whether the employer waived the 120 day notice of injury requirement ... by [allegedly] failing to raise the issue specifically as an affirmative defense. <em>Id. </em>at 495, <a href="/pa-commw/156/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="628 A.2d 481" data-case-ids="1447166" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/156/0491-01">628 A.2d 481</a>. In <em>Piad, </em>the employer had changed workers’ compensation carriers after the claimant became symptomatic for carpal tunnel syndrome, but before a medical diagnosis had been made, and the issue was which of the two carriers was liable for coverage. The question was not whether the date of medical diagnosis versus the date of disability controlled the question of timeliness of notice; it was whether the date of first <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>symptoms or the date of medical diagnosis controlled in determining which insurance carrier was liable. In finding the second carrier liable based upon the date of diagnosis, the panel did not suggest that all claims arising from carpal tunnel syndrome must be reported within 120 days of initial medical diagnosis. <a href="/a2d/761/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="761 A.2d 640" data-case-ids="11156531" data-case-paths="/a2d/761/0640-01">761 A.2d at 641-42</a>.</p>

Brief for Appellant, 13. This argument is premised upon an erroneous factual predicate. Dr. Sattel was the City's expert, not appellee’s; and the WCJ specifically credited the testimony of appellee’s actual medical expert, Dr. Papa, over the contrary testimony of Dr. Sattel.</p>

The question in <em>Pawlosky </em>was whether a disability caused by the job-related aggravation of a pre-existent disease (asthma), which was not specifically designated as an occupational disease under the Act, nevertheless was a compensable injury under Section 301(c)(1). The aggravation consisted of chemical fumes which, with each exposure, irritated the claimant’s pre-existing condition to the point where he had become totally disabled. The Court concluded that the adverse effect of the chemical fumes upon the claimant’s pre-existent asthmatic condition <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>constituted an ‘injury’ within the meaning of section 301(c)(1) of the Act. <a href="/pa/514/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="525 A.2d 1204" data-case-ids="1804529,1804531,1804614" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0450-01,/pa/514/0448-01,/pa/514/0449-01">525 A.2d at 1210-11</a>.</p>

In answering the question, this Court followed the analysis in <em>Pawlosky, </em>ultimately concluding that [njormal working conditions, in the nature of scheduling an employee to work a night shift, are not injuries for purposes of the Act merely because an employee undergoes physical or psychic reactions to those conditions. <a href="/a2d/718/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="718 A.2d 759" data-case-ids="11687686,356200" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0759-01,/pa/553/0177-01">718 A.2d at 761-62, 764</a>.</p>

The <em>Armco </em>Court, applying <em>Pawlosky, </em>recognized that a job-related aggravation of a pre-existing condition is a compensable injury under Section 301(c)(1), and that each aggravation constitutes a new injury. Therefore, we reasoned, the last day the aggravation occurs, which will most often be the last day of work, is the date from which the three year limitation should be calculated. <a href="/pa/542/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="667 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="458324,7866223" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0364-01,/a2d/667/0710-01">667 A.2d at 717</a>.
