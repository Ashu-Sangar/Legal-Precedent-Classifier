    <p id="b929-10" data-blocks='[["BL_929.11",929,[131,1011,1152,260]]]'>In this appeal, the Commonwealth challenges the Superior Court’s conclusion that a post-conviction court properly authorized a withdrawal of guilty pleas grounded on the absence from the plea colloquy of any discussion of the factual basis supporting the pleas.</p>
    <p id="b929-11" data-blocks='[["BL_929.12",929,[131,1294,1156,530]]]'>On July 1, 1981, the victim, James Redman, was robbed, beaten, and killed. Ten days later, police arrested appellee, Dennis Flanagan, and George Yacob, based on an affidavit of probable cause detailing police interviews with persons to whom both Flanagan and Yacob had admitted to having assaulted, robbed, and killed a man, while describing circumstances closely resembling those surrounding Mr. Redman’s death. Following their arrest, Flanagan and Yacob provided statements describing their respective roles in the events leading to the murder.</p>
    <p id="b929-12" data-blocks='[["BL_929.13",929,[131,1847,1154,533]],["BL_930.1",930,[233,335,1158,306]]]'>In his statement to police, Flanagan related that he and Yacob planned a non-fatal assault on Mr. Redman on account of Mr. Redman’s sexual orientation and his having made advances toward Yacob. Flanagan indicated that he and Yacob arranged to meet with Mr. Redman in his automobile and lured him to a remote industrial park, which Flanagan selected as a suitable location for the beating, under the pretext that Flanagan would have sexual relations with Mr. Redman. According to this account, while the vehicle was parked and Yacob was outside of it, Mr. Redman made an <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>advance toward Flanagan, who pushed him away, got out of the car, and told Yacob what had happened. The three then drove a short distance and exited the vehicle, with Flanagan pushing Mr. Redman against the car and holding him there (Flanagan purported to having done so defensively, believing that Mr. Redman may have intended to assault him).</p>
    <p id="b930-5" data-blocks='[["BL_930.5",930,[229,665,1158,1058]]]'>Flanagan described the events that followed largely as a series of acts carried out by Yacob, who purportedly: began taunting, hitting, and kicking Mr. Redman; demanded Mr. Redman’s wallet and car keys; gave the keys to Flanagan and instructed him to move the vehicle to the front of the industrial park and wait twenty minutes before returning; and, when Flanagan did so and returned, announced that he (Yacob) had dropped a rock on Mr. Redman’s head, kicked him in the face, and choked him with a bandana. Flanagan purported to having asked Yacob if they should call an ambulance, and to having inferred from Yacob’s response that Mr. Redman was dead or near death. Flanagan also admitted that: he acquiesced in leaving the scene without attempting to personally verify Mr. Redman’s condition; personal items of Mr. Red-man’s were thrown from the vehicle upon leaving the industrial park; he and Yacob drove the automobile around the local area in the days following the killing, then took it on an excursion to the New Jersey shore with several young women; and he and Yacob planned to conceal their crimes by hiding or “dumping” the vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b930-6" data-blocks='[["BL_930.6",930,[226,1749,1156,630]]]'>In his statement to police, Yacob claimed that, on the evening of the killing, he and Flanagan had joined Mr. Red-man in his automobile, believing that they would be taken on a trip to obtain and consume illicit drugs. Yacob indicated that Mr. Redman diverted to the industrial park, where he made advances toward Flanagan and, in an ensuing confrontation, approached Yacob with a knife. The purport of Yacob’s initial statement was essentially that he had killed Mr. Redman inadvertently and in self-defense, and that Flanagan had not participated or played a significant part in the killing or in the struggle that assertedly had preceded it. At the time of his arrest, Yacob’s hands bore impact injuries.</p>

      <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>Following a preliminary hearing, charges against Flanagan and Yacob including, <em>inter alia, </em>first- and second-degree murder, robbery, and conspiracy were bound over to the common pleas court, and the Commonwealth gave notice of its intention to seek imposition of the death penalty. Flanagan, who was at the time seventeen years old, sought transfer to juvenile court. A series of decertification hearings was convened, during which Flanagan testified, offering a substantially different account of the circumstances of Mr. Redman’s killing than he had related in his statement to police. Flanagan’s decertification hearing testimony mirrored Yacob’s initial statement in the claim that he and Yacob believed that they'had joined Mr. Redman for a drug-related excursion, and that Mr. Redman selected the industrial park location at which to stop for reasons that were unknown to Flanagan and Yacob. Flanagan testified that he understood at the time (based on Yacob’s assertion) that Mr. Redman had a knife in his possession; he also knew Yacob to carry a knife on occasion.</p>
    <p id="b931-5" data-blocks='[["BL_931.5",931,[123,1305,1162,846]],["BL_932.1",932,[244,334,1150,349]]]'>The remainder of Flanagan’s account at the decertification hearing loosely tracked his statement to police. He stated that Mr. Redman made sexual advances; Yacob immediately responded with violence, pulling Mr. Redman from the vehicle and hitting him; a struggle ensued, during which Flanagan pushed Mr. Redman only after Mr. Redman grabbed his leg; as the confrontation between Yacob and Mr. Redman continued, Yacob instructed Flanagan to leave the scene for a period of time; and when Flanagan returned, Yacob was alone and implied that Mr. Redman had been killed. On direct examination, Flanagan testified that he had no prior agreement with Yacob to assault Mr. Redman, but that his frame of mind was that he would defend himself and Yacob if necessary. On cross-examination, however, Flanagan admitted that he and Yacob had made a prior agreement to assault Mr. Redman if sexual advances were made during the trip.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Flanagan’s prior <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>statement was discussed extensively on direct and cross-examination, and he admitted to having fabricated various portions of it, claiming to have done so because he knew that Yacob had confessed to the killing, and wished to conform his account to Yacob’s and/or tell police “what they want[ed] to hear.” At the conclusion of the hearings, the common pleas court denied decertification.</p>
    <p id="b932-5" data-blocks='[["BL_932.6",932,[244,715,1152,516]]]'>A suppression hearing followed, at which the Commonwealth presented testimony from the detectives who signed the affidavit of probable cause, who related, <em>inter alia, </em>witness descriptions of inculpatory conversations with Yacob and/or Flanagan in which the participation of both men in the robbery/homicide was described (Flanagan also testified briefly in support of his request for relief). Suppression was denied, and Yacob subsequently pled guilty to first-degree murder and the related offenses, and, as a result of a plea agreement, was sentenced to life-imprisonment.</p>
    <p id="b932-6" data-blocks='[["BL_932.7",932,[243,1255,1152,785]]]'>By this time, the Commonwealth had filed discovery responses containing witness statements including those of a young acquaintance who affirmed that he had overheard Flanagan and Yacob discussing plans to rob and severely beat a man whom they believed to be a homosexual in the days prior to and on the evening of the murder, as well as several persons who attested that Flanagan and Yacob admitted to having beaten and killed a man in'a joint physical and verbal assault motivated by discriminatory animus. Among the latter was one of the young women who had traveled to the New Jersey shore with Yacob and Flanagan. She affirmed that Flanagan had admitted to having personally stabbed the victim during the course of the assault, and conveyed that the victim was exposed to a prolonged period of suffering, throughout which he pled for mercy.</p>
    <p id="b932-7" data-blocks='[["BL_932.8",932,[243,2064,1154,201]],["BL_933.1",933,[131,330,1158,895]]]'>Two days later, on the day scheduled for commencement of his trial, Flanagan pled guilty to murder generally, <em>see </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 802 (formerly Rule 352), robbery, and conspiracy to commit murder and robbery. At the plea hearing, Flanagan’s <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>counsel noted that Flanagan had endorsed the information by pleading guilty, and the plea court opened its colloquy by asking Flanagan if he wished to enter guilty pleas to the charges contained in the criminal information, to which Flanagan responded in the affirmative. The plea court then correctly elucidated the various elements of the crimes with which Flanagan had been charged; delineated various defenses; described the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof resting on the Commonwealth in a criminal prosecution; admonished Flanagan that he had a right to a trial by a jury on a unanimous verdict; and specified the applicable ranges of punishment for the offenses that were the subject of the pleas. With respect to the open plea to murder, Flanagan affirmed his understanding that, as a result, it was initially presumed that he was guilty of the lowest degree of murder (third-degree). The plea court also elaborated on third-degree murder and the attendant concept of malice as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b933-4" data-blocks='[["BL_933.5",933,[175,1241,1112,364]]]'>Malice, generally speaking means, is said to be a hardness of heart, a mind or a heart that is disregarding his social duty, acting in a way which you know to be contrary to proper acceptable, ethical standards. Malice can mean a direct malice, a hatred of a particular person or it can be manifested generally speaking or indirectly by a generalized hardness of heart, wickedness of disposition.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b933-5" data-blocks='[["BL_933.6",933,[175,1679,1111,524]]]'>Murder of the third degree is an unlawful killing of another person with malice. I’ve defined malice for you. However, we say that the distinction is that where as first degree murder must be an intentional killing we say that for third degree murder the killing need not be intentional but rather that the intention be to inflict serious or grevious bodily harm upon someone, and if as a result of doing that he dies, that would be third degree murder if in fact the intention was not necessarily to kill but to inflict serious bodily harm. Do you understand that?</blockquote>

    <p id="b934-5" data-blocks='[["BL_934.5",934,[234,443,1155,150]]]'>In connection with Flanagan’s plea to conspiracy to commit murder and robbery, the court explained the central concept of an agreement:</p>

First, it failed to adduce the factual basis for the plea, <em>see </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 590 (comment) (formerly Pa.R.Crim.P. 319); <em>Commonwealth v. Willis, </em><a href="/pa/471/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="471 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1725154" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0050-01">471 Pa. 50</a>, 51-52, <a href="/pa/471/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="471 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1725154" data-case-paths="/pa/471/0050-01">369 A.2d 1189</a>, 1190 (1977) (reflecting the mandatory requirement for a plea court to adduce a factual basis for the plea during a guilty plea colloquy); instead, the court merely alluded to its basic familiarity with the circumstances underlying the plea. The plea court then erroneously advised Flanagan that accomplice theory renders an accomplice liable for “any crimes committed by any other accomplice regardless of whether a particular accomplice committed the particular crime about which we are talking.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court elaborated as follows:</p>

Despite the absence of any discussion of the factual basis for the pleas during the plea colloquy, and the plea court’s erroneous explanation of accomplice liability, Flanagan’s counsel offered no objection, and the court accepted the pleas.</p>

The Commonwealth introduced evidence from medical and scientific experts concerning the severity of Mr. Redman’s injuries (separated scalp, skull and larynx fractures, cerebral hemorrhaging, contusions to the trunk, and deep penetrating wound to the right-side rib area), the pathological diagnosis of multiple blunt impacts to the head, neck, and trunk; and the substantial likelihood that Mr. Redman endured a prolonged period of suffering. The person who discovered Mr. Redman’s body testified to its concealment in a remote location under a substantial pile of debris. A detective testified to the recovery of items of Mr. Redman’s personal property from along the roadside leading from the scene of the killing, the discovery of <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>Mr. Redman’s automobile during the interview of a witness to whom Flanagan and/or Yacob related an account of the killing, the gathering of evidence from the vehicle, and the identification of various implements believed to have been used in the killing, including the rock used to smash Mr. Redman’s skull. Fingerprints and hairs gathered from Mr. Redman’s vehicle were identified as belonging to Flanagan and Yacob. The witness to Flanagan’s and Yacob’s planning of the robbery/assault testified, indicating that they had discussed with him, <em>inter alia, </em>a plan to leave the victim in such a condition as would render him incapable of implicating them; he also stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that Yacob showed him a bloody knife the day after the murder. The Commonwealth offered testimony from the female traveling companion who stated that, during the trip to the New Jersey shore, Flanagan boasted that he had beaten, stabbed, and killed a man to obtain the car. She also indicated that Yacob admitted his participation and showed her a knife with a substance on it that appeared to be blood. Further, she reiterated that both Flanagan and Yacob explained that they planned the robbery/homicide because the victim was a homosexual. A prisoner incarcerated with Flanagan testified that Flanagan told him that he had stabbed a man because he did not like his sexual orientation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Yacob admitted that Mr. Redman had never had a knife or weapon of any kind. After arriving at the industrial park, Yacob testified, both he and Flanagan participated in prolonged and severe physical and verbal assaults, and while Yacob was choking Mr. Redman, Flanagan took the knife from Yacob’s pocket and stabbed Mr. Redman twice. In addition, Yacob stated that Flanagan bludgeoned Mr. Redman’s head <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>with the rock, after commenting that it was taking too long for him to die. Yacob admitted that the two used the money stolen from Mr. Redman to buy drugs, alcohol, and gasoline, and confirmed that he, Flanagan, and Mr. Redman had never set out on any trip to obtain illegal drugs, but rather, the encounter resulted from the luring of Mr. Redman to the industrial park to be robbed and killed. The Commonwealth also introduced Flanagan’s statement to the police in which he had admitted to a prior agreement with Yacob to assault Mr. Redman, as well as the materially different account that Flanagan related at the decertification hearing.</p>
    <p id="b937-4" data-blocks='[["BL_937.5",937,[133,932,1153,467]]]'>Flanagan did not present evidence at the degree-of-guilt hearing; however, his counsel contended that the felony-murder rule did not apply as, according to his account, he only developed an intent to rob Mr. Redman subsequent to the murder. Counsel also urged the court to disbelieve Yacob, arguing that the evidence supported a version of the events more in line with Flanagan’s accounts, and asked that the court enter a verdict of guilty of third-degree murder. Counsel summarized his argument as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b937-5" data-blocks='[["BL_937.6",937,[175,1416,1110,519]]]'>If you believe the testimony of Dennis Flanagan, that his intent on that night was to conspire with George Yacob to go to a place with James Redman and George Yacob, where James Redman would be beaten and that that was the purpose of that conspiracy, that as a result of the beating a murder occurred and that they did not form an intent, that this perpetrator did not form any intent to take a car until after the murder occurred, that the murder did not occur during the perpetration of the underlying felony and, therefore, the felony murder rule would not apply.</blockquote>

At the conclusion of the proceeding, the common pleas court found that, although aggravating circumstances were present (killing in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6)), there were sufficient mitigating factors to outweigh them and thus to prevent the imposition of the death penalty. Accordingly, the court sentenced Flanagan to life imprisonment, with a concurrent term of ten to twenty years’ incarceration for the robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery convictions.</p>

On the merits, the Commonwealth argues that the Superior Court and the PCHA court erroneously reviewed the record to determine whether a factual basis existed at the time of the plea to support a first-degree murder conviction; however, an open plea to murder is tantamount only to an admission to third-<a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>degree murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, according to the Commonwealth, it need only establish that the record reflects a factual basis for third-degree murder, which does not require a specific intent to kill, but rather, attaches to the broader culpability conception of malice, as was explained by the plea court. In this regard, the Commonwealth emphasizes that it would be absurd to require a defendant entering an open plea to murder to admit to having had specific intent to kill, as the defendant will put the Commonwealth to its proofs in this regard at a degree-of-guilt hearing. The Commonwealth contends that the record of the proceedings before and immediately after the plea hearing amply establishes the predicate for third-degree murder—malice; Flanagan was well aware of the charges against him and the character of the Commonwealth’s evidence;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> and the guilty plea colloquy between the plea court and Flanagan was otherwise thorough and comprehensive. Indeed, the Commonwealth stresses that the evidence considered in the totality overwhelmingly established that Flanagan and Yacob jointly committed a brutal, premeditated robbery/murder based, in large part, on personal prejudices. <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>Additionally, the Commonwealth relies on plea counsel’s testimony from the post-conviction proceedings concerning the rationale underlying the plea. Finally, the Commonwealth stresses that Flanagan did not testify at the PCHA hearing or present evidence relating to his claim that he did not apprehend the factual basis underlying his pleas, or that the pleas were not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered.</p>
    <p id="b944-5" data-blocks='[["BL_944.5",944,[241,716,1156,1370]]]'>In his brief, Flanagan maintains that the defects in the plea colloquy not only rendered his pleas unknowing, but also contributed to his entering guilty pleas to crimes of which he was innocent. Again, he indicates that he mistakenly believed, and, by virtue of the plea court’s erroneous description of accomplice liability, was in fact instructed, “that the loose plan hatched with Yacob (to ‘beat up’ the victim), the failure to stop the beating, and the failure to immediately report the killing rendered him guilty as the killer, George Yacob.” Further, Flanagan highlights that at no time prior to the degree-of-guilt hearing did the Commonwealth produce any evidence in his presence running contrary to his statements concerning the degree of his involvement in Mr. Redman’s murder. In the absence of such direct confrontation and/or factual development at the plea colloquy at least on the order of an inquiry into whether or not he killed or helped to kill Mr. Redman, and in the face of the purportedly exculpatory explanations that he had provided to police and to the court at the decertification hearing, Flanagan contends that his pleas cannot be sustained on this record. In this regard, he cites, in particular, <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellee then recalled that, after several days with Redman’s car, they picked up three hitchhikers and traveled to Atlantic City, New Jersey. Yacob’s initial taped confession was consistent with appellee’s account: Ya-cob said that appellee never touched Redman, and that during the attack he had instructed appellee to leave in Redman’s car until he was done. <em>See </em>Yacob Statement, 7/10/81.</p>

The Commonwealth sought the death penalty against both defendants. On November 5, 1981, at a pre-trial hearing on appellee’s motion to transfer the matter to juvenile court, the trial court, per the Honorable Isaac S. Garb, Jr., heard evidence concerning the facts of the case, including the autopsy report, appellee’s taped statement and his subsequent in-court testimony.

Lieutenant Robert Eckert testified that, prior to the arrest, police had interviewed several witnesses, including Andrea McGlinchey. Lieutenant Eckert said that Ms. McGlinchey had told police that Yacob had pointed to Redman’s car and boasted to her and a friend that he and appellee had “just beat up a guy to get that.” Lieutenant Eckert further testified that, after appellee and Yacob were arrested and en route to the police station, appellee volunteered, “You know the guy was a fag, don’t you?”</p>

Judge Garb then informed appellee that he had the right to a trial in which the Commonwealth would bear the burden of proof, and that he did not have to plead guilty. Further, Judge Garb informed appellee that, as a result of his plea, the presumption would be that he was guilty of murder of the third degree, and that the Commonwealth would bear the burden of proof at the subsequent degree-of-guilt hearing. Throughout the colloquy, appellee repeatedly stated that he understood the charges and the consequences of entering the general plea.

Moreover, the Commonwealth avers that the PCHA court’s conclusion that the colloquy was defective for failing to establish a factual basis ignores the crucial fact that this was not simply a guilty plea, but a general plea of guilty which was to be followed by a degree of guilt hearing. The evidence which was adduced immediately following the colloquy—and which appellee was free to contest in order to determine the degree of guilt—proved appellee’s willful, deliberate and malicious murder of Redman. The Commonwealth also contends that appellee’s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the plea colloquy was untimely under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), and its amendments, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9541 <em>et seq., </em>which were enacted during the pendency of his petition.</p>

There, as here, the defendant pleaded guilty to murder generally, after which the trial court conducted a degree-of-guilt hearing and found him guilty of murder of the first degree. On PCHA review, however, this Court concluded that the plea was invalid because the colloquy failed to establish a factual basis for the plea.

Rather, the colloquy there utterly failed even to explain to the defendant the nature of the charges against him, his right to a jury trial, or the consequences of entering a guilty plea. Indeed, this Court noted that the colloquy “did no more than inform appellant of the name of the crime after he had pled guilty.” <em>Id. </em>at 1183. We further noted that the defendant had, on the record, denied killing his victim prior to entering the guilty plea, and that he asked to withdraw the plea shortly after it was entered. Under those circumstances, we concluded that there was no factual basis upon which to conclude that the defendant had understood either the charges to which he had pled or the consequences of his plea.

Notably, appellee here did not testify at the PCHA hearing and claim that, in fact, he was unaware of the factual basis—or the legal basis—for his general plea of guilt, much less that that was the reason he actually entered his plea. Instead, he confined his complaint to attacking the record. The Majority’s conclusion that, under the totality of these circumstances, appellee would not have entered the plea is rank speculation.

The record shows, however, that appellee did submit "suggested amendments” at that time.

On November 14, 2000, appellee filed a counseled “brief in support of post conviction collateral relief,” which reframed appellee's allegations of trial court error as counsel ineffectiveness claims, including the instant claim: "Whether [appellee’s] trial counsel were ineffective when they failed to object to a guilty plea colloquy without a factual basis to substantiate any of the claims.” This is the claim that the lower courts considered.

In that case, this Court concluded that the 1995 amendments to the PCRA applied even though the petitioner had originally filed a <em>pro se </em>petition requesting an evidentiary hearing in June of 1995, before the PCRA amendments took effect. There, however, petitioner had received leave of court to withdraw the original <em>pro se </em>petition and incorporate the allegations into a new post-conviction petition. In April of 1996, petitioner filed a counseled PCRA petition. In concluding that the amended PCRA applied, this Court noted that the petition was filed well after the date the amended PCRA became effective. Here, appellee never withdrew his original PCHA petition, but rather, was permitted to amend his PCHA petition.
