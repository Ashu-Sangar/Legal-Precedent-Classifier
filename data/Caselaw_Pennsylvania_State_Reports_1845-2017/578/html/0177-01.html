The Township further asserts that the repeal of 53 P.S. § 65741 and the simultaneous enactment of 53 P.S. § 66601 vitiates this Court’s analysis in <em>Cranberry Park. </em>In support of these assertions, the Township notes that 53 P.S. § 66601, unlike 53 P.S. § 65741, contains a so-called “savings clause” to prevent procedural infirmities in the enactment of an ordinance from having any effect on its validity.

As stated above, 53 P.S. § 66601(a) provides that “[i]f the full text [of an ordinance] is not included ...

Accordingly, the statute merely provides that a township’s failure to file a copy of an ordinance with the county law library or other designated county office within thirty days of enactment or its failure to record the ordinance within the time provided will not render the ordinance void <em>ab initio, </em>without addressing in any way the effect of other procedural deficiencies. As such, pursuant to <em>Lower Gwynedd </em>and <em>Cranberry Park, </em>a township’s failure to comply with <em>other </em>statutory procedural requirements continues to render the resultant ordinance void. Indeed, the fact that the General Assembly specifically identified in the “savings clause” only two specific types of procedural defects that do not affect an ordinance’s effective date is, if anything, a clear implication that it did <em>not </em>intend other types of defects also to have no effect. <em>See, e.g., Atcovitz v.

Our discussion of "such" in <em>Cranberry Park </em>arose in the context of interpreting the last sentence of then-applicable 53 P.S. § 65741, which read: "Such ordinances shall be recorded in the ordinance book of the township and shall become effective five days after such adoption.” <em>Cranberry Park, </em><a href="/a2d/751/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="751 A.2d 165" data-case-ids="11508905,92845" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0165-01,/pa/561/0456-01">751 A.2d at </a>167 n. 5. Upon examining this language, we determined that "such adoption” referred to recordation in the township ordinance book, as that was the concept that had just been mentioned. Accordingly, we concluded that an ordinance could not become effective in the absence of recordation. <em>See <a href="/a2d/751/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="751 A.2d 165" data-case-ids="11508905,92845" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0165-01,/pa/561/0456-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/751/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="751 A.2d 165" data-case-ids="11508905,92845" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0165-01,/pa/561/0456-01">at 167</a>. Notably, the operative “such” in section 1741 was deleted in 53 P.S. § 66601, so that the corresponding sentence in section 1601(a) reads: "Ordinances shall be recorded in the ordinance book of the township and are effective five days after adoption....” 53 P.S. § 66601(a). Neither of the parties develops any arguments as to the effect of this excision, but we read it to support our ultimate conclusion that the Ordinance is void <em>ab initio. </em>Indeed, by removing the "such” that previously modified “adoption” in the sentence at issue, the General Assembly broadened the meaning of "adoption” such that it no longer refers to recordation alone but rather, signifies the enactment process as a whole. Consequently, whereas section 1741 only specified that an unrecorded ordinance was void <em>ab initio, </em>section 1601 also leaves room for other significant irregularities in an ordinance's enactment to prevent the ordinance from ever becoming effective. As such, the statute is more closely aligned with the general principle set forth in <em>Lower </em>

The Township claims that because <em>Cranberry Park </em>involved the failure to record an ordinance, and because section 1601 now states that "the failure to record within the time provided [shall not] be deemed a defect in the process of the enactment or adoption of such ordinance,” the <em>Cranberry Park </em>analysis should now be wholly disregarded. However, irrespective of the nature of the particular defect at issue in <em>Cranberry Park </em>or the fact that section 1601 may have superseded the <em>Cranberry Park </em>analysis insofar as it applies to that particular defect, section 1601 does not “vitiate” the underlying analysis of <em>Cranberry Park, </em>which followed <em>Lower Gwynedd </em>in setting forth the general rule that defectively enacted township ordinances are void <em>ab initio.</em>

Moreover, it should be noted that the Commonwealth Court below erred in finding that the enactment of 53 P.S. § 66601 had effectively overruled <em>Valianatos v.

We are aware that the ordinance in <em>Cranberry Park </em>was enacted eight years before the contractor in that case filed its procedural challenge. However, as that ordinance was never subsequently record<a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>ed in the township ordinance book, it was never "on the books” in such a way that the public could have had notice of or acquiesced in its terms.</p>

The Township also seems to insinuate that Schadler’s procedural challenge should be barred because, even if the public at large had no notice of the Ordinance's enactment in February 2000, Schadler himself did have actual notice. <em>See </em>Appellee's Brief at 10 n. 5. However, the procedural requirements for the enactment of a law are nonwaivable, and when the lawfulness of the enactment is in question, the law is either void or not void, without regard to the identity of the challenger. Meanwhile, finding the notice of an individual litigant to have any bearing on the litigant’s ability to challenge the law in the circumstances of this case would lead to the absurd result of a single township ordinance being valid with respect to some citizens and simultaneously invalid with respect to others. <em>See also Lower Gwynedd, </em><a href="/pa/527/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="527 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1827702" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0324-01">591 A.2d at </a>287 (citing <em>Fierst v.
