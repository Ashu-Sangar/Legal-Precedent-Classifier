The trial court refused to grant a mistrial and the Superior Court affirmed. For the reasons discussed herein, we now affirm the orders of the courts below.</p>
    <p id="b413-7" data-blocks='[["BL_413.8",413,[142,1020,1154,949]]]'>The facts set forth by the Superior Court establish that the police arrested Appellant, Christopher Young, following a shooting during which two persons were injured and one person murdered. Appellant and his co-defendant were tried before a jury. During trial, Detective Charles Brown, of the Philadelphia police department, related that an eyewitness to the shooting came into the police station and was shown photographs in a “photo imager.” Detective Brown then explained that the photo imager can bring up photographs of individuals “who have had contact with the police” based on certain variables, descriptions, ages, and locations in different areas of the city. N.T., 11/7/2000, p. 64. Defense counsel immediately objected and requested a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65. Following a sidebar discussion, the trial court denied counsel’s request for a mistrial and offered to give a curative instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 65-69. Counsel declined the curative instruction since he “didn’t want to highlight” the statement. <em>Id. </em>at 67, 69.</p>

Detective Brown replied, “Yes, he did. He also identified a photograph of Christopher Young, Police Photo Number 775—.” <em>Id. </em>at 71. The Commonwealth then asked, “Did he say anything—did he specifically say anything at all when he observed the photograph of Christopher Young?” <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>
      <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel immediately requested a sidebar. The court sustained counsel’s objection and the prosecution moved on with the examination of the witness.</p>

The jury sentenced Appellant to life imprisonment for first degree murder. The trial court imposed a concurrent term of ten to twenty years of imprisonment on each count of attempted murder, a consecutive term of ten to twenty years for criminal conspiracy and a concurrent term of one to two years for possession of an instrument of crime. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence.</p>

Appellant argues that pursuant to <em>Allen </em>the statements made by Detective Brown created a reasonable inference of prior criminal conduct in the minds of the jury and denied Appellant a fair trial. Accordingly, Appellant concludes that a mistrial was warranted.</p>
    <p id="b414-8" data-blocks='[["BL_414.8",414,[229,1728,1165,302]]]'>The Commonwealth responds that in this case, the detective stated that the photos were obtained from “prior police contact.” Under the standard set forth in <em>Allen, </em>mere references-to an accused’s past contact with the police do not imply that the accused committed prior crimes.

      <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>In <em>Allen, </em>this court considered whether reversible error occurred when the trial court “permitted several of the Commonwealth’s witnesses to make references to the fact that the police had shown photographs of the appellant to the alleged eyewitnesses” over defense counsel’s objections. <em>Allen, </em><a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20373" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="292 A.2d 373">292 A.2d at 374</a>. In reviewing appellant’s challenge, this court specifically rejected an “inflexible” rule that any reference to a graph at trial requires reversal.

    <blockquote id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[175,811,1115,529]]]'>whether or not a juror could reasonably infer from the facts presented that the accused had engage in prior criminal activity. A mere passing reference to photographs from which a reasonable inference of prior criminal activity cannot properly be drawn does not invalidate the proceedings since there has been no prejudice as a result of the reference; so too, where it appears on the face of the record that there is an explanation of the police possession of the photograph unrelated to any inference of prior criminal activity.</blockquote>

We therefore find that the explanation of how the photo imager compiled photographs and the statement regarding “contact with the police” focused only on prior contact with the police and did not reasonably imply prior criminal conduct. The prior contact with the police could have occurred under a variety of circumstances that were not criminal in nature including involvement in a motor vehicle accident or violation, as a witness to a crime, or as a victim of a crime.</p>

    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[246,656,1155,1710]],["BL_421.1",421,[140,325,1154,357]]]'>Here, Detective Brown testified that an eyewitness to the shooting came to the police station and was escorted to an area of the station with computers, one of which is called a “photo imager.” N.T., 11/7/2000, at 64. The detective then explained to the jury that “what that machine does is that based on certain variables, descriptions, ages, locations in different areas of the city, it can bring up photographs of individuals who have had contact with the police.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20373" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="292 A.2d 373">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added). Contrary to what the majority suggests, it is highly unlikely, at least in my view, that a juror would imagine that such “contact” was as a witness to or victim of a crime, or was in connection with a motor vehicle accident or violation. This is especially true given that any average layperson could reasonably question whether police even take photographs of people in such situations as a matter of routine and if so, whether the police would then place those photographs of victims and witnesses in a system being used for purposes of identifying criminal suspects. I simply find it much more tenable that the jury would deduce from the detective’s testimony that at some point in the past, Appellant was involved in some type of criminal activity, at which time the police took his photograph so that it could be used in future investigations. Indeed, the use of the “photo imager” here is remarkably similar to the practice of showing an eyewitness a group of “mug shots” fitting the eyewitness’ description of the suspect. Given that this Court has indicated that mug shots cannot be referred to at trial because such a reference creates an impermissible inference of prior criminal conduct in the minds of the jury, I see no reason why a detective should be permitted to refer to a machine that “brings up photographs of individuals who have had contact with the police” when such a machine appears to be little more than a computerized <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>catalogue of mug shots.

In <em>Carlos, </em>a Commonwealth eyewitness testified that he had identified the defendant from approximately ten photographs shown to him by a detective. <em>Id. </em>at 72. There, unlike in the present case, the photographs were never characterized as pictures of individuals “who have had contact with the police.” Rather, as the Court explained, “aside from the fact that a police detective displayed the [defendant’s] photograph, there was nothing else linking it to the police.” <em>Id. </em>at 73. Thus, the testimony in Carlos is clearly distinguishable from Detective Brown’s testimony in the present case, where he went one impermissible step further and explicitly stated that the photographs were of people who “have had prior contact with the police.”</p>
    <p id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.6",421,[139,1625,1153,253]]]'>Similarly, I do not believe that Detective Brown’s testimony is comparable to that of the officer’s testimony in <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Riggins, </em>the arresting officer testified that he went to talk to the defendant for the following reasons:</p>
    <blockquote id="b421-7" data-blocks='[["BL_421.7",421,[182,1895,1112,253]]]'>[Another officer] brought out a yellow piece of paper with some names on it, and he read these names off, and one of the names I recognized and I told Lt.

    <p id="b421-8" data-blocks='[["BL_421.8",421,[139,2169,1153,201]],["BL_422.1",422,[234,327,1155,748]]]'>
      <em>Id. </em>at 524 (emphasis added). This Court held that the officer’s mere passing reference to the fact that he knew where the defendant lived could not have reasonably led the jury to believe that the defendant had been involved in prior criminal <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>activity. <em>Id. </em>Again, this reference to knowing where the defendant lived is clearly different from what occurred here, where Detective Brown specifically explained to the jury that Appellant’s photograph was in the police department’s “photo imager,” a computer system that brings up images of “individuals who have had contact with the police,” and that the eyewitness identified Appellant from a group of 200 photographs in this “photo imager.” See N.T., 11/7/2000, at 64, 70-74. Clearly, Detective Brown’s repeated reference to Appellant’s photograph, which the jury knew was obtained through “prior contact with the police,” was much more likely to lead the jury to infer that Appellant had previously engaged in criminal conduct than the passing reference made by the officer in Riggins that he knew where the defendant lived.</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[233,1101,1155,258]]]'>Accordingly, because there is no question in my mind that Detective Brown’s testimony could reasonably have led the jury to infer that Appellant had been involved in prior criminal activity, I would find that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial based on that testimony.</p>
