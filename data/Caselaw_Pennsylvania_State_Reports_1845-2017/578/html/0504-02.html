Appellant and Frances Williams, the victim in this case, married in June of 1995. On August 12, 1999, Frances disappeared. Immediately prior to Frances’ disappearance, the couple had been experiencing marital discord that stemmed from various problems, including allegations of infidelity and drug abuse.</p>
    <p id="b848-11" data-blocks='[["BL_848.11",848,[242,1535,1153,581]]]'>Following the disappearance, Appellant maintained that he did not know Frances’ whereabouts and that she probably left him due to their marital problems. On August 20, 1999, Janice Smith, Frances’ younger sister, filed a missing persons report. The Pittsburgh Police Sexual Assault/Family Crisis Unit assigned Detective Susan Keasley to investigate Frances’ disappearance. From August 24, 1999 until January 5, 2000, the investigation was limited to telephone conversations with Appellant. However, on January 5, 2000, Appellant gave Detective Keasley permission to search his residence for evidence and clues concerning Frances’ disappearance.</p>

In that interview, Appellant answered several of the detective’s questions in a vague and equivocal manner, which raised the detective’s suspicions. Later that day and in a follow up on January 14, 2000, members of the Allegheny County Crime Lab’s Forensic Serology Division inspected Appellant’s residence.</p>
    <p id="b849-4" data-blocks='[["BL_849.5",849,[140,819,1153,360]]]'>In their investigation of Appellant’s home, the Forensic Division utilized luminol, a chemical that illuminates when it contacts the iron component of blood. Several areas of the home, including the kitchen, the steps leading to the basement, and the basement, reacted with the luminol. These results led the investigating forensic serologist to conclude that blood had been present in those areas.</p>
    <p id="b849-5" data-blocks='[["BL_849.6",849,[139,1202,1154,519]]]'>Due to this conclusion, Detectives Dennis Logan and Richard McDonald of the Pittsburgh Police Department met with Appellant at their office on the morning of January 14, 2000. The detectives advised Appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and Appellant signed an acknowledgement of those rights. The detectives questioned Appellant, and at first, he insisted that he and Frances had an argument before she disappeared and that she left their home due to that argument. However, Appellant eventually relented and admitted to stabbing and killing Frances.</p>

He stated that she was angry with him for going through her purse and removing her marijuana. According to Appellant’s statement to the detectives, the couple began to argue about Appellant’s son’s presence in the home, about Appellant’s alleged infidelity, and about Frances’ alleged drug use. He stated that Frances called him a “poor ass nigger” and that the argument escalated to the point that <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>he got so angry that he blew up and stabbed Frances in the chest. N.T., 1/22/02,133-134.</p>
    <p id="b850-5" data-blocks='[["BL_850.5",850,[231,454,1154,415]]]'>Appellant then stated that after he realized that Frances was unable to talk and that she had no pulse, he dragged her body down the steps and into the basement. He said that he followed up by immediately cleaning up the kitchen. According to Appellant’s statement, later that night, he wrapped Frances’ body in a multicolor comforter and a white sheet. At that point, he stated that he drove to a ravine located in the North Side of Pittsburgh, where he dumped the body.</p>
    <p id="b850-6" data-blocks='[["BL_850.6",850,[230,894,1155,414]]]'>After Appellant gave this statement to the detectives, he accompanied them to the location of the body. The body was found and recovered. The Allegheny County Coroner performed an autopsy the next day and discovered that the victim’s hands, feet, and head were missing. When Detective Logan questioned Appellant about these discoveries, Appellant quipped that “some people will steal anything” and then began to laugh. N.T., 1/22/02,146.</p>
    <p id="b850-7" data-blocks='[["BL_850.7",850,[228,1333,1156,517]]]'>Appellant eventually admitted to cutting up the body with a hacksaw in his basement. He stated that he did not share this information initially because he felt that “it was too gross” to tell the detectives. N.T., 1/22/02, 146. Appellant informed Detective Logan that the day after he killed Frances, he buried the body parts in a salvage yard in McKees Rocks. Following this discussion, Appellant accompanied the detectives to the salvage yard and pointed out where he buried the body parts. Subsequently, the authorities recovered the remains.</p>

At sentencing, the jury found one aggravating circumstance and one mitigating circumstance.

    <p id="b851-5" data-blocks='[["BL_851.6",851,[130,560,1158,477]]]'>In his direct appeal to this Court, Appellant raises three issues: whether the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of first-degree murder; whether the Commonwealth’s introduction of the testimony of four victim impact witnesses resulted in a capricious and arbitrary imposition of the death penalty; and whether the sentence of death in this case amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Supreme Court of the United States’ prohibition against the execution of the mentally retarded.</p>
    <p id="b851-6" data-blocks='[["BL_851.7",851,[132,1074,1157,908]]]'>Appellant argues that the evidence the Commonwealth presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a verdict of first degree murder. “In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court must determine whether the evidence admitted at trial, and all reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in favor of the Commonwealth as verdict winner, supports the jury’s finding of all of the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>Commonwealth v.

N.T., 1/22/02, 197-199. The jury’s verdict reflects that the jury chose not to believe that Appellant forgot that he had a knife in his hand when he stabbed Frances. Appellants testimony alone is sufficient to establish that Appellant unlawfully killed Frances, and, because Appellant stabbed Frances in her chest and through her heart, the jury could properly infer that <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>Appellant had the specific intent necessary to be convicted of first-degree murder. <em>Bond, </em><a href="/pa/539/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="652 A.2d 308" data-case-ids="474243,7867065" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0299-01,/a2d/652/0308-01">652 A.2d at 311</a>.
