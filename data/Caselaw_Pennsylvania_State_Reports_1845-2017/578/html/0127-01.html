Based upon the positive results of the canine search, the police secured Appellant’s vehicle and towed it to the police barracks.

The facts of the matter <em>sub judice </em>give rise to just such a suspicion. Appellant was unusually agitated; the paperwork for his vehicle was out of order in several key respects; his answers regarding the location he had just departed were vague; and, most importantly, the back seat of his car contained products that Trooper Banovsky knew, via his extensive professional experience, are commonly used in the packaging of illegal narcotics.

In <em>Martin, </em>we were unwilling to allow a canine sniff of a person to be conducted upon a mere showing of reasonable suspicion.

Unlike the expectation of privacy in one’s person, which in <em>Martin </em>we noted to be particularly high, one’s expectation of privacy in the exterior of a vehicle is more modest. While many in our society have a great fondness for their vehicles, it is too great a leap of logic to conclude that the automobile is entitled to the same sanctity as a person’s body. Furthermore, the exterior of a vehicle is exposed to the public, and is not considered an intimate space. Thus, considering the relatively minor privacy interest in the exterior of the vehicle and the minimal intrusion occasioned by a canine sniff, we conclude that mere reasonable suspicion, rather than probable cause, was required prior to Rosie sniffing the exterior of his vehicle. As Trooper Banovsky had reasonable suspicion prior to Rosie responding to the scene, <em>see supra, </em>then Rosie’s sniff of the exterior of the vehicle passes constitutional muster.</p>

Contrary to Appellant’s supposition, <em>White </em>is not on all fours with the matter <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>White, </em>the interior of the car was searched by police officers. In contrast, at issue here is a canine sniff. While we have recognized that canine sniffs are searches, we have carefully articulated that they are not akin to searches conducted by human law enforcement officers and need not in all instances be supported by probable cause. <em>See Johnston, <a href="/pa/515/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="515 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1806041" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0454-01">supra.</a> </em>Thus, while <em>White </em>requires that a police officer have probable cause prior to entering and searching a car, it did not address the scenario of a dog sniff.

In this matter, probable cause existed prior to Rosie jumping through the window of Appellant’s vehicle. As discussed above, the police had reasonable suspicion before Rosie responded to the scene. After Rosie arrived, and while she was outside the automobile, she alerted to the driver’s side door; this indicated to the officers that she had detected narcotics. At that juncture, “a person of reasonable caution [would believe] that an offense has been or is being committed!,]” <em>Gibson, </em><a href="/pa/536/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="638 A.2d 203" data-case-ids="1843233,7357001" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0123-01,/a2d/638/0203-01">638 A.2d at 206</a>, and reasonable suspicion ripened into probable cause.

This case involves the third of the generic nouns, <em>i.e., </em>a thing (an “effect” for fourth amendment purposes; a “possession” for Article I, Section 8 purposes). Rote application of the <em>Johnston/Martin </em>categorical approach would make resolution of this appeal simple: an automobile is certainly not a person, it is more similar to a place; but it is not entitled to heightened scrutiny vis a vis other places or things (such as the home). Accordingly, all canine searches of automobiles should only need to be supported by reasonable suspicion. Ultimately, the Majority approves of the canine sniffs here based upon this existing categorical analysis.</p>

But, the complexities of this case cause me to query whether this category-based construct is appropriate in the first place. There may be canine sniffs of places or things—such as things in public view in public places— which should not have to be supported by any level of suspicion whatsoever. On the other hand, where, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the canine sniff is affected only after a seizure, the underlying seizure must comport with governing standards. Similarly, if the canine sniff requires entry into a constitutionally-protected area, traditional search and seizure doctrines beyond the law governing canine sniffs must be consulted and satisfied. In other words, in a case like this, the constitutional problem of the dog’s entry into the car is not diminished by the fact that a canine sniff upon that entry is less intrusive than a human search of the interior would be. Indeed, the lack of intrusiveness of the canine sniffs in <em>Place </em>and <em>Edmond </em>did not cure the unreasonable detentions which allowed those unintrusive sniffs to occur. In my view, this case confirms the necessity for flexibility in this Court’s approach to these cases and persuasively impeaches the categorical construct.</p>

In <em>Johnston, </em>a majority of this Court rejected the then-recent decision in <em>Place </em>as a matter of Pennsylvania constitutional law, preferring instead the fourth amendment views of the three justices who dissented in <em>Place. Johnston </em>involved a canine sniff of the corridor of a storage locker facility, conducted by police with the explicit permission of the owner of the facility. The sniff was not arbitrary or random, for police had observed conduct leading them to believe that bales of marijuana were being stored in one or more of the lockers in the facility. A majority of this Court held that, although such a consensual canine sniff was probably not even a search under the fourth amendment in light of <em>Place, </em>it nevertheless was a search for purposes of Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The <em>Johnston </em>majority declared that such a limited “search” required: (1) reasonable suspicion to believe that drugs may be present in the place to be tested; and (2) that <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>police were lawfully present in the place where the canine sniff was conducted. The majority concluded that the canine sniff of the outside of the lockers in <em>Johnston </em>was lawful because its newly formulated two-part state constitutional test was satisfied.

Stops of the person always require, at a minimum, reasonable suspicion.

Thus, it is not the Platonic conception of the nature of a canine sniff that dictates the outcome, but the circumstances (here, of undisputed seizure) which surrounded it. Indeed, the closer question might be that which was ultimately determinative in the defendant’s favor in <em>Place: i.e., </em>whether the length of time (over 70 minutes) during which appellant was detained on a highway, in snowy January weather, was so unreasonable as to run afoul of <em>Terry, </em>irrespective of the canine sniff question.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> But, that question is not before us.

The sniff search only provided police with the limited information of whether contraband was present, and therefore was unlikely to intrude, except marginally, upon an innocent person’s rights. The additional inconvenience of a brief sniff search conducted during a valid investigatory stop was minimal. Further, the subject of the investigation was reasonably protected from police harassment, annoyance and humiliation since both the investigatory stop and the canine sniff were supported by reasonable suspicion. Thus, the limited intrusion in the present case was not qualitatively different from the sniff search permitted in <em>Johnston.</em>

According to the majority, these factors, when viewed together, add up to support a finding that Trooper Banovsky had reasonable suspicion that Appellant was carrying drugs in his car.

In the first instance, it is more than clear that laundry supplies are not contraband and have legitimate uses. The majority, however, turns the innocent activity of carrying laundry supplies into a criminally suspicious one by pointing to Trooper Banovksy’s observation that laundry supplies <em>can </em>be used to mask the odor of marijuana.

Instead, the majority places great emphasis, as the Superior Court did, on the fact that Appellant was also “extremely agitated.” I do not believe, however, that the additional fact that Appellant was nervous gives rise to a finding of reasonable suspicion, especially in light of the fact that it is not at all uncommon for a driver to be nervous when stopped by the police. <em>See United States v.

Thus, I simply cannot agree with the majority’s conclusion that a nervous driver, who happens to be carrying laundry products and out-of-order paperwork, is properly subject to an investigative detention.</p>

While that may be true in limited circumstances, I simply cannot agree that the innocuous factors here, even when viewed as a whole, support a finding of reasonable suspicion any more than they would if looked at separately. Rather, in the end, Trooper Banovsky at best had a mere hunch that Appellant was carrying drugs in his car, which of course, is insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion under the jurisprudence of this Commonwealth. <em>See Commonwealth </em>

While the presence of masking agents may be a factor to consider in making a determination of whether reasonable suspicion exists, such agents must be analyzed in context, considering the nature of the items, its potential uses, and whether, in light of its nature and use, the location where it is found is unusual. <em>See People v. Cervantes-Arredondo, </em><a href="/p3d/17/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="17 P.3d 141" data-case-ids="11125929" data-case-paths="/p3d/17/0141-01">17 P.3d 141</a> (Colo.2001).
