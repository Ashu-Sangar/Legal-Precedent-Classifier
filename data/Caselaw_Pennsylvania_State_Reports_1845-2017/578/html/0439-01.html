The Township’s zoning officer denied her application, concluding that the proposed use is not a permitted use in the R-l Low Density Residential District (the “R-1 District”) in which the property is located.</p>
    <p id="b782-4" data-blocks='[["BL_782.5",782,[230,601,1159,737]]]'>Albert appealed to the Township’s Zoning Hearing Board (“ZHB”), and the ZHB held a public hearing on March 14, 2000. As the ZHB stated in its findings of fact, Albert testified at the hearing that “her goal was to establish ... a sober, family-type residential environment for females ... who had completed in-patient rehabilitation programs [for drug or alcohol abuse at other facilities].” ZHB Op. at 3; R.R. at 60a. Albert testified that she intended to accommodate between six and fifteen women at the Retreat and that there would be no limit on the length of a resident’s stay, provided that the resident followed the Retreat’s rules. R.R. at 67a; ZHB Op. at 5. That said, Albert also presented evidence that the average stay for a resident at the facility would be between two and six months. R.R. at 49a, 92a.</p>

The housemother would “help plan and arrange for the activities of the group,” would resolve disputes among the residents, and would enforce the rules of the Retreat. R.R. at 65a; ZHB Op. at 4. Albert testified that the housemother would also be responsible for meal planning, which would be served “family style” and would be “prepared by members of the group on a rotating basis.” R.R. at 65a; ZHB Op. at 4-5. Together the residents would maintain the common areas of the residence, but each would be “responsible to maintain her own personal living space.” R.R. at 65a; ZHB Op. at 5. A “substantial part of each day’s activities” would be “devoted to addressing and solving common problems in addiction,” and the residents would “meet frequently in small groups to discuss their common experiences.” R.R. at 61-62; ZHB Op. at 5. Albert testified that the residents would pay <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>approximately $100 a day for residential services, but that the project was “not proposed as a profit-making enterprise.” R.R. at 69a-70a; ZHB Op. at 12, 20. According to the ZHB, Albert “indicated that if the revenues derived from the payments by residents exceeded the expenses of the residents, she was prepared to make an appropriate pledge to a recreation or education program for the youth of the township.” ZHB Op. at 20; <em>see also </em>R.R. at 70a. Nevertheless, the only evidence presented at the hearing regarding the Retreat’s expected expenses was a lease showing that the Retreat would lease the property from the owners (Albert and her siblings) for $4,000 per month. <em>See </em>ZHB Op. at 3.</p>

Ordinance § 3.111, R.R. 419a. A single-family dwelling is defined under the Ordinance as “a detached building, designated for or occupied exclusively by one <em>family </em>and containing not more than one dwelling unit.” Ordinance § 11.122a (emphasis added), R.R. at 503a. Meanwhile, the Ordinance defines “dwelling unit” as “[o]ne (1) or more rooms, including a kitchen or kitchenette, and sanitary facilities in a dwelling structure, designed as a unit for occupancy by not more than one (1) <em>family </em>for living and sleeping purposes.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ordinance § 11.124 (emphasis added), R.R. at 504a. In light of these definitions, the parties and the lower tribunals agree that whether or not the Retreat qualifies as a “single-family detached dwelling” ultimately turns on the meaning of “family,” which the Ordinance does not define. That is, only if the residents of the Retreat are a “family” for purposes of the Ordinance can the Retreat qualify as a “single-family detached <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>dwelling” and thereby obtain a permit to operate in the R-l District.</p>

In that case, Irene C.

When the township zoning officer ordered Miller to cease such use of the property, declaring that it was not a permitted “single-family” use, Miller appealed to the township’s Zoning Board of Adjustment (the “Board”). However, the Board agreed with the zoning officer that the residents of the home did not constitute a “family” under the terms of the relevant township ordinance, which defined “family” as “any number of persons living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit.” Specifically, the Board reasoned that the residents were not a “family” because the boarders either paid money or rendered services for their room and board, and because “the membership of the group was subject to periodic change.” <em>Id. </em>at 906.

Without some level of stability and permanence in the composition of the groups residing in such residential districts, this goal is necessarily subverted. <em>See, e.g., 2 </em>Rathkopf’s The Law of Zoning and Planning § 23.27 (“Many courts have used a so-called ‘functional family’ standard ... by considering whether the group possesses a family-like structure of household authority, <em>functions as a relatively stable </em>and integrated <em>housekeeping unit, </em>and whether the living arrangement is consistent with or likely to impact negatively the residential character of the neighborhood.”) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we conclude that in order to qualify as a “single housekeeping unit,” a group of individuals in a single household must not only function as a family within that household, but in addition, the composition of the group must be sufficiently stable and permanent so as not to be fairly characterized as purely transient.</p>

In concluding as such, we necessarily reject Appellants' assertion that we must find the Retreat to be profit-driven because it would be impossible for the Retreat <em>not </em>to generate a substantial profit when it will charge residents between $2,000 and $3,000 per month while paying just $4,000 per month in rent. Certainly, the $30,000-$45,000 <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>that the Retreat expects to collect per month at full capacity is a substantial sum, but Albert explained that she had estimated the Retreat’s expenses based on discussions with not only her accountants, but also representatives of other similar facilities, which charge their residents between $2,000 and $4,000 per month. R.R. at 87a. Moreover, Albert's attorney explained at the hearing that before opening, the Retreat would have to invest at least $50,000 to refurbish the existing facilities and that using the $2000 per month figure, the Retreat expected to <em>lose </em>money until it had at least ten residents. R.R. at 85a-86a; 88a. Finally, Albert made clear that the amount she would charge the residents was not set in stone. R.R. at 87a. As she explained, until the Retreat began operating and incurring daily expenses, she could not state with certainty how much income it would need to break even. R.R. at 87a-88a; <em>see also </em>R.R. at 84a-85a (representations of Albert’s counsel). Under these circumstances, this Court cannot simply presume that the Retreat will generate a profit, and certainly has no basis on which to conclude that it is explicitly profit-driven.</p>

We also reject Appellants’ alternative argument, buried in a footnote in their brief, <em>see </em>Appellants’ Brf. at 20 n. 6, that we remand the case for the development of a more detailed record regarding the Retreat’s expected expenses and income. Simply put, the mere fact that residents will likely pay substantial sums to stay at the Retreat does not, in and of itself, require that this Court remand the case for more evidence, when other record evidence makes clear that a profit motive is not the basis for the relationships at issue. <em>Cf. Eichlin v.
