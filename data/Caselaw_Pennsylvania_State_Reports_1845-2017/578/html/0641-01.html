Our grant of allocatur extends to the question of whether the trial court committed certain procedural errors regarding the conduct of the competency hearing itself, if those errors impacted the decision on competency, the trial court’s rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony as to the reliability of the hearsay statements of the child witnesses, and the admissibility of the hearsay statements made by the child witnesses. Upon our consideration of these issues, and for the reasons set forth herein, we direct that the case be remanded for a new competency hearing.</p>
    <p id="b987-7" data-blocks='[["BL_987.7",987,[120,1299,1158,742]]]'>Appellant, Gerald John Delbridge, was convicted of sexually assaulting his children between June 1, 1997 and January 14, 1998. The victims of the assault were A.D., born August 5, 1991, and her brother L.D., born September 3, 1993. The time frame of the assaults corresponds to the period when Appellant and his wife, Deborah Delbridge, were experiencing serious problems in their marriage. Although the Delbridge family was still residing in the same house, Appellant and Mrs. Delbridge were no longer sharing a bedroom. A.D. began sleeping with Appellant in the master bedroom while Mrs. Delbridge slept either on the couch or in L.D.’s bedroom. Throughout this time period Mrs. Delbridge became increasingly worried about A.D. as the child began exhibiting behavioral problems at home.</p>

A.D. has a speech impediment and is developmentally slow, however, the teacher reported regression in motor skills and academics along with aggressive behavior by A.D. towards her classmates. This information, coupled with her own concerns about A.D., <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>prompted Mrs. Delbridge to arrange counseling sessions for A.D. -with a psychologist, Linda Keck (at the time the sessions began Mrs. Keck was Ms. Colbert). About the same time A.D.’s behavioral problems were being addressed, Appellant was forced to vacate the family residence when Mrs. Del-bridge obtained a Protection From Abuse Order on January 14, 1998.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

At the Layfette residence they were neighbors to Lisa Rodriguez and her two children, a girl and boy, each about the same age as A.D. and L.D. The children became playmates and A.D. was a regular visitor to the Rodriguez home.</p>

Upon arriving home, A.D. went to the Rodriguez home where she repeated to Mrs. Rodriguez the statement that “Daddy touched my ‘tee-tee.’ ” A.D. made similar statements to Mrs. Rodriguez on other occasions as well. While A.D. was with Mrs. Rodriguez, Mrs. Delbridge placed a call to Mrs. Keck, leaving her a message about A.D.’s revelation. A.D. had a therapy session with Mrs. Keck on May 18, 1998. At that session, when asked by Mrs. Keck to repeat what she had told her mother, A.D. responded “Daddy touched my ‘tee-tee’ and his friend touched me in the butt.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>The allegations of possible sexual assault were referred to the Pennsylvania State police. Trooper Peter Salerno conducted interviews of A.D. and her brother L.D. Trooper Zellner was present during the interviews conducted by Trooper Salerno with A.D. and L.D. A.D. told Trooper Salerno that she watched movies with Appellant, where people were naked and kissing. A.D. also told the Trooper that Appellant touched her “tee-tee” and her butt with his fingers. A.D. stated that she took showers with Appellant and that his “tee-tee” was hard. Initially L.D. denied that Appellant ever touched him other than spanking him on the butt. Eventually, L.D. told Trooper Salerno that he watched movies with Appellant where naked people were kissing, and that Appellant touched his “tee-tee” with a finger and stuck a finger in L.D.’s butt. Charges were filed against Appellant as to criminal conduct involving both children.</p>
    <p id="b989-5" data-blocks='[["BL_989.5",989,[129,1197,1154,793]]]'>Prior to trial, Appellant filed motions contesting the testimonial competency of A.D. and L.D. Appellant asserted that given their youth, the children did not have the mental capacity to perceive the events at the time they occurred and accurately recall them. At the time of the assaults, the children were ages six and four; they were seven and five at the time of trial. Additionally, Appellant alleged that the children’s memory of the events had been tainted by repeated and suggestive interviews. Finally, he alleged that the competency of the children was highly suspect as they were subject to abnormal influence by their mother who suffered from paranoia over her own sexual victimization as a child.

First, in one of the hearsay statements attributed to A.D. by Mrs. Rodriguez, A.D. stated that when Appellant touched her “tee-tee” she could not tell anyone because she was still in diapers. Appellant asserts that this statement creates the incredible inference that A.D. could recall events that occurred while she was an infant. <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>Second, when Trooper Salerno conducted his interviews of A.D. and L.D., he was accompanied by Trooper Zellner in a blatant attempt to pressure the children as Trooper Zellner was well known to, and trusted by, A.D. and L.D. Appellant asserts that Trooper Zellner was designated as the guardian angel for the children and that the children were told he would protect them from Appellant, and that this was a deliberate ploy by the interviewers to vilify Appellant in the eyes of A.D. and L.D. Finally, Appellant claims that their mother influenced the children’s allegations of abuse. According to Appellant, a family member had victimized Mrs. Delbridge during her own childhood and this victimization caused Mrs. Del-bridge to be paranoid regarding sexual behavior. In support of this point, Appellant references a previous incident, on June 15, 1994, where Mrs. Delbridge took A.D. to Berks County Children and Youth Services reporting her concern that the child, who was two years old at the time, was acting out sexually. During the interview Mrs. Delbridge revealed that she had been the victim of sexual abuse as a child and that she could not distinguish sexually appropriate behavior in her own children. The counselor was concerned for Mrs. Delbridge and recommended that she seek counseling. A.D. made no statements to the counselor at that time. The investigation in Berks County concluded with a finding of no abuse on June 23,1994.</p>

To that end, Appellant applied for a specific date for the hearing on the motion. The President Judge of Luzerne County, Judge Joseph M. Augello, granted the Motion for Specific Date, and the hearing was set for May 10, 1999. Appellant subpoenaed his out-of-town expert witness, Larry M. Davis, M.D., for May 10, 1999. The Honorable Ann H. Lokuta was scheduled to preside over the trial and all pre-trial motions. Despite the Order of Judge Augello setting a specific date for Motions, Judge Lokuta advanced argument on the pre-trial motions to <a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>May 3, 1999.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Argument was heard on May 3, 1999 regarding many of the pre-trial motions, and May 5th was set for the competency hearing. Judge Lokuta granted the Commonwealth’s motion to preclude expert testimony on the competency of the children, and rejected Appellant’s objection as to the alteration of the date set for the competency hearing.</p>
    <p id="b991-4" data-blocks='[["BL_991.5",991,[119,666,1157,803]]]'>Before the competency hearing began, the Commonwealth moved to exclude Appellant from being physically present during the testimony of the children. Over objection of Appellant, the motion was granted. Appellant requested leave to cross-examine the children about the particulars of the allegations at issue. The trial court denied Appellant’s request to examine the children as to the specific factual allegations of sexual abuse. The trial court also rejected Appellant’s request to explore the nature of the interviews through which the children revealed the information regarding the sexual abuse claims. The trial court limited the competency hearing to questions examining the ability of the children to understand the difference between truth and non-truth, the general capacity to remember and the ability to communicate that memory.</p>

A.D. had difficulty <a id="p652" href="#p652" data-label="652" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*652</a>remembering the name of her school and which teacher she had in first grade as opposed to kindergarten. L.D. could not recall his address nor distinguish a town from a state. However, the children displayed an understanding of telling the truth and the consequences of not telling the truth: if they did not tell the truth they would be placed in “time out” and the judge would be “mad”. Each child displayed an understanding of the distinction'between reality and fantasy, identifying their favorite cartoons as not real. A.D. and L.D. each recalled a past event, such as a previous Christmas celebration or a birthday, and remembered a gift received or an activity that occurred. A.D. and L.D. each displayed an ability to communicate about a remembered event. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that the children were legally competent to testify.</p>

Prior to taking testimony, Appellant renewed his objection to the competency of the child witnesses. Appellant requested that the trial court reconsider its ruling and permit expert testimony on the question of competency. The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration. Appellant requested that his expert, Dr. Davis, be permitted to testify as to the reliability of the hearsay statements of the children. The court entertained voir dire of Dr. Davis to assess the admissibility of his proffered testimony. At the conclusion of voir dire, the trial court found that Appellant had failed to establish the validity and accuracy of the proposed field of expertise—assessing the reliability of hearsay, statements by child sexual abuse victims—and that Dr. Davis could not be qualified as an expert in this proposed area of expertise.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The hearing continued with an examination of the persons who would testify as to the hearsay statements of the children. The court considered the context in which the various statements were made and the content of the statements. The trial court found that the hearsay state<a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>ments made by A.D. and L.D. to Linda Keck, Lisa Rodriguez, Deborah Delbridge and Trooper Peter Salerno were admissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

All the evidence against Appellant was testimonial, coming either in direct testimony from A.D. and L.D, or through hearsay statements the children made to various adults regarding the sexual assaults. Appellant was convicted of two counts each of Endangering the Welfare of Children, Corruption of Minors, Aggravated Indecent Assault and Indecent Assault.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The total term of incarceration imposed on all charges was 72 to 172 months. An appeal was perfected from the judgment of sentence and the Superior Court affirmed that judgment.

Appellant asserts that taint <a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>is a legitimate question when considering the competency of young children, as they are peculiarly susceptible to the implantation of false memories by biased interviewers and suggestions imposed by trusted authority figures. Appellant urges this court to permit the introduction of expert testimony on the question of taint. Appellant relies heavily upon the decision of <em>State v. Michaels, </em><a href="/nj/136/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="136 N.J. 299" data-case-ids="712200" data-case-paths="/nj/136/0299-01">136 N.J. 299</a>, <a href="/nj/136/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="136 N.J. 299" data-case-ids="712200" data-case-paths="/nj/136/0299-01">642 A.2d 1372</a> (1994) to support his position. In particular, Appellant argues that there is significant evidence of taint in this casé given the tender age of the children, the vilification of Appellant, the bias of the social and law enforcement interviewers and the unique circumstance of the mother’s prior victimization and its effect upon the children. Appellant claims prejudice by the trial court’s refusal to permit exploration of the question of taint in the competency hearing given the facts of this case.</p>

Additionally, the Commonwealth asserts that there is no basis to find that the theory of taint has gained general acceptance within the relevant scientific and/or law enforcement communities. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that there is no evidence to support Appellant’s allegation of taint in this case, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding A.D. and L.D. competent to testify.</p>

The core belief underlying the theory of taint is that a child’s <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>memory is peculiarly susceptible to suggestibility so that when called to testify a child may have difficulty distinguishing fact from fantasy. <em>See </em>Josephine A.

Although the question of taint has not been widely reviewed, several jurisdictions have found taint to be a relevant consideration in the pre-trial assessment of the admissibility of the testimony of child witnesses in cases of child sexual abuse claims. As referenced extensively by Appellant, the New Jersey Supreme Court undertook a thorough analysis of the concept of taint in its decision in <em>Michaels. </em>Other states, following the New Jersey lead, have found the idea of taint relevant in a pre-trial assessment of the admissibility of the proffered testimony of a child witness. <em>See Fischbach v.

The New Jersey Supreme Court rendered the most extensive decision on the concept of taint in <em>Michaels. Michaels </em>involved the conviction of a day care teacher on 115 counts involving various charges of sexual assault committed on twenty children in her charge at the Wee Care Day Nursery. On appeal, the court found evidence that the children’s accusations were founded on unreliable perceptions or memories caused by improper investigative procedures and that admission of testimony premised upon those accusations could lead to an unfair trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>
      <em>Id. </em>at 1376. In reaching this conclusion, the court acknowledged the problem of relying on scientific and psychological theories in the context of considering the susceptibility of children to manipulative interrogations. The court discussed the tension between the accepted legal standard that children as a class are not suspect witnesses, and the commonly held belief that children are peculiarly susceptible to undue influence. <em>Id. </em>The court reviewed the various treatises written and relied upon by the scientific and law enforcement communities regarding the susceptibility of children to coercive interview techniques, and reached its <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>conclusion as to the concept of taint by judicial recognition. <em>Id. </em>at 1378.

The court identified various factors for assessing accusations of sexual abuse made by children, however, it cautioned that the list was not exhaustive and that the matter must be analyzed in the totality of the circumstances involved. The factors identified in <em>Michaels, </em>are: “(1) the age of the victim, (2) circumstances of the questioning; (3) the victim’s relationship with the interrogator; and (4) the type of questions asked.” <em>Id. </em>at 1381.</p>

By application of the clear and convincing standard, the court recognized that the burden on the prosecution is to establish that despite the presence of some suggestive or coercive techniques in the manner in which it was gathered, when considered in the totality of the circumstances, the proffered testimony is sufficiently free from contamination, thus outweighing the effects of taint. <em>Id. </em>Although expert testimony is admissible on the propriety of the interrogation techniques used, it cannot extend to the ultimate issue of the credibility of the child witness. <em>Id. </em>at 1383.

On the first occasion, B.N.M.’s mother bathed the children and dressed B.N.M. in a blanket style sleeper before she left for the evening. Upon arriving home, the mother discovered B.N.M. sleeping in a tee shirt with no underwear. The child explained that she had removed the sleeper because she was hot. On the second occasion, a mutual friend of the defendant and B.N.M.’s mother stopped by the house while B.N.M. was in the defendant’s care. This friend observed B.N.M. and the defendant naked in the bathtub. The friend shared his observation with B.N.M.’s mother the next day.

In order to trigger an investigation of competency on the issue of taint, the moving party must show some evidence of taint. Once some evidence of taint is presented, the competency hearing must be expanded to explore this specific question. During the hearing the party alleging taint bears the burden of production of evidence of taint and the burden of persuasion to show taint by clear and convincing evidence. Pennsylvania has always maintained that since competency is the presumption, the moving party must carry the burden of overcoming that presumption. <em>Rosche, </em>at 309. As this standard prevails in cases where the witness’s memory may have been corrupted by insanity, mental retardation or hypnosis, we see no reason to alter it in cases where the memory of the witness is allegedly compromised by tainted interview techniques. Further, as the burden in all other cases alleging incompetency is clear and convincing evidence, we will continue to apply that existing legal requirement for cases involving taint. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The potential for undue influence in this regard is heightened by reference to Mrs. Delbridge’s prior allegations of suspected sexual abuse of A.D. when the child was two years old, allegations that were dismissed as unfounded.

The purpose of the expert testimony was to correlate the behavior of this victim, from 1983 to 1986, to the behavior typical of an abused child, and also to inform the jury that child sexual abuse victims may not always report incidents of abuse promptly. On appeal this court reversed. We determined that the “Child Sexual Abuse Syndrome” had not gained sufficient acceptance in the psychiatric community to warrant admission as expert testimony, and that the testimony itself about the behavior patterns was so speculative that it did not constitute probative and relevant evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 834-35.

Credibility is an issue uniquely entrusted to the common understanding of laypersons. The teaching of <em>Dunkle </em>is that expert testimony will not be permitted when it attempts in any way to reach the issue of credibility, and thereby usurp the function of the factfinder. As we have addressed <em>supra, </em>a question of taint corrupting the actual memory of the witness speaks to competency, not credibility.

Appellant argues that cross-examination of A.D. and L.D. was necessary to test the accuracy of the statements themselves. In many cases the accuracy of a hearsay statement must be determined without the opportunity to cross-examine the party that uttered the statement. However, where the party is available, and there exists a degree of uncertainty as to the reliability of the facts upon which the hearsay statements turn, it would be prudent to permit examination of the original speaker to test the accuracy of the hearsay statements. Given the possibility of taint impacting the competency of the child witnesses in this case, should taint be shown upon remand, the trial court shall permit Appellant to cross-examine A.D. and L.D. to test the accuracy of the statements they made to third parties.</p>

Dr. Davis is board certified in psychiatry and neurology, a Diplomat for the American Board of Forensic Examiners, a Diplomat of the American Board of Forensic Medicine, and a Diplomat of the American Board of Clinical Sexology. After a thorough voir dire on his qualifications, the trial court found that Dr. Davis’s proposed area of expertise was not sufficiently accepted in the relevant scientific community to permit acceptance of expert testimony thereon.

Rather, allegations of “taint” merely contend that improper interviewing techniques have marred select memories that a child would otherwise be capable of retaining and conveying. In my view, questioning regarding the effect of these external forces on a child’s memory simply do not go to a child’s <em>competency </em>to testify, but rather merely probes whether the child’s supposed memory of an event should be believed. As such, I believe that the taint inquiry is more appropriately characterized as a classic question of credibility. <em>See Black’s Law Dictionary </em>374 (7th ed.)

Taint may be an “emerging” notion, but it is nothing but a variation of traditionally recognized considerations; it does not require departure from traditional and tested principles for evaluating witnesses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

I must assume that expert opinions on taint are likewise to be inadmissible at trial; if expertise on taint is allowed at trial, then other expertise on the subject of credibility is also appropriate. Pretrial, if taint is a recognized subject for opinion evidence, then certainly areas such as Child Sexual Abuse Syndrome, as recognized a phenomenon as taint, must also be proper subjects of expert testimony. The admission of expert testimony is not determined by which side wishes to address the issue; the search for credibility or competence is only served by allowing, or disallowing, experts <a id="p681" href="#p681" data-label="681" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*681</a>on all issues affecting testimony of abused children. As I believe this is really a credibility matter, I would opt to disallow opinion testimony on the point.</p>
    <p id="b1021-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1021.5",1021,[131,509,1154,512]]]'>The factors the majority suggests comprise a threshold showing here are these: (1) the age of the children, which make their memories “suspect merely because of their tender years,” Majority Opinion, at 20; (2) their mother was abused sexually as a child; (3) she had sole custody; (4) her prior report of sexual abuse, which was held “unfounded”; and (5) the presence of Trooper Zellner during interviews. I believe these factors simply do not establish anything approaching a tainted process, much less one that tainted this witness, and find no basis for further examination of the issue.</p>
    <p id="b1021-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1021.6",1021,[130,1053,1155,568]]]'>First, the age of the children has little to do with taint. Their age may be relevant, but if a child’s ability to remember is “suspect” because of age, as the majority states, that is a far cry from suggesting a false memory has actually been implanted. Children are presumed to be competent, and the bar establishing that competence is low. <em>See Commonwealth v. Washington, </em><a href="/pa/554/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="554 Pa. 559" data-case-ids="766002" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0559-01">554 Pa. 559</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="722 A.2d 643" data-case-ids="11773621,766002" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0643-01,/pa/554/0559-01">722 A.2d 643</a>, 646 (1998) (citing <em>Rosche v.

Age may allow a naive child to be more easily tainted than a cynical adult, but age has nothing to do with whether a person <em>was </em>tainted.</p>

It appears we are to infer this is a potential case of crying wolf by the mother of the victim, but again no reason is given to suspect actual taint. Mrs. Delbridge may be understandably sensitive to signs of sexual abuse, but how does this suggest she did anything to implant false memories in her children? The majority suggests “her experiences may have influenced the course of the investigation,” but every witness in every case from shoplifting to murder has experiences which affect (taint?) their involvement in an investigation. Even if she had run the investigation all by herself, the majority does not tell us why we should think a victim of <a id="p682" href="#p682" data-label="682" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*682</a>sexual abuse will implant false memories of victimization in others. This is plain and simple innuendo, and borders on an offensive stereotyping of victims. It is not based on evidence, and is no reason to suspect taint.</p>
    <p id="b1022-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1022.4",1022,[234,563,1156,573]]]'>The prior allegation of abuse was dismissed as unfounded, at a time when AD was two years old and incapable of testifying; that case was hardly capable of being “founded” absent physical injury. Mere dismissal, without more, does not suggest the report was fabricated; the causes of the report were behavioral changes of the child, which were established by persons other than Mrs. Delbridge. Rather than support a suspicion she tainted the child, this prior report actually belies fabrication or implantation of false memory. If this implies she cried wolf, there is equal independent evidence there really was a wolf.</p>
    <p id="b1022-5" data-blocks='[["BL_1022.5",1022,[230,1160,1157,679]]]'>The majority also notes Mrs. Delbridge’s influence over the children may have been enhanced because she had sole custody of them when the abuse was uncovered. Again we are to infer this common fact of life-after-divorce somehow implies she implanted specific memories of abuse in the minds of her children. Motive to dislike appellant is certainly understandable—witness the PFA Order—but a reason to dislike does not equal evidence there was action on that dislike, much less action of this nature. She was abused as a child, abused by appellant to the point of getting a PFA, protected her child by reporting prior behavioral changes that indicated abuse, won sole custody of the children—why does any of this lead to the suspicion she implanted false memories in the children?</p>

Why this supports such a spurious inference, we are not told. At most, the record states Trooper Zellner told the child not to fear appellant, but does this support an inference appellant was “vilified”? Besides, the factual memories of the children, the very root of the allegations, necessarily preceded the trooper’s involvement—even if Trooper Zellner had spoken ill of appellant, something not of <a id="p683" href="#p683" data-label="683" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*683</a>record, does this show the children were tainted <em>after the fact? </em>There is no allegation their testimony changed after his appearance; the very complaint is that the process implanted memories in the children, but the memory preceded the trooper. Having a protector with them does not imply the protector acted improperly or suggestively, or that he vilified anyone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

    <p id="b1023-4" data-blocks='[["BL_1023.4",1023,[120,733,1159,693]]]'>In sum, there is not one fact that would logically suggest anyone did anything to taint these children. All of the listed factors are at most matters of credibility, reasons a skeptic might question the side denying taint, but they do nothing to affirmatively show there was taint in the first place. One is reminded of the rule of <em>corpus delicti; </em>there must be some independent evidence suggesting that a crime actually happened before the supporting credibility reasons allow the factfinder to believe and convict. Likewise, we cannot examine reasons to believe an allegation of tainting a witness until we have independent reason to believe that something approaching taint actually resulted. The factors cited are bootstrapping at its best, and I do not find the threshold met here.</p>

There, cross-examination revealed that a key eyewitness had memorized her story of what happened, and on the stand was merely repeating the story, time after time, word for word. This was a question of credibility, though, not competence. The witness, though clearly tainted, was merely incredible, not incompetent. <em>See People v.
