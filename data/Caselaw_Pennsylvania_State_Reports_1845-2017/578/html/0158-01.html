    <p id="b498-15" data-blocks='[["BL_498.16",498,[227,1715,1156,468]]]'>Kerry Benninghoff (Benninghoff) is an incumbent Republican state representative from the 171st Legislative District. In filing nominating petitions to have his name placed on the ballot for the April 27th Primary Election, Benninghoff failed to list a direct source of income from his current employment as a State Representative from the 171st Legislative District in Block 10 of his Statement of Financial Interest requiring that he list all “direct and indirect sources of income.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 1105(b)(5).</p>

Smith (Smith), a registered Republican and qualified elector of the 171st District. She sought to <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>prevent Benninghoff from appearing on the ballot because of the above referenced omission. Smith took the position that the omission is a “fatal flaw” pursuant to applicable Pennsylvania law. Benninghoff takes the position that because he is a state representative, which he disclosed in Blocks 4, 5 and 6 of the Statement of Financial Interest, it is unnecessary to identify the Commonwealth as a source of income in Block 10 of the form; in the alternative, he asserts that the omission is an amendable defect.</p>

In a dissent, Judge Leavitt of the Commonwealth Court took the position that the State Ethics Commission had “primary jurisdiction” to decide this matter. Benninghoff has now filed a direct appeal from the Commonwealth Court’s decision and a petition seeking expedited relief.</p>

    <p id="b500-7" data-blocks='[["BL_500.9",500,[248,1036,1152,736]]]'>I dissent. This Court is the ultimate arbiter of the Election Code, 25 P.S. § 2600 <em>et seq., </em>and the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act, 65 Pa.C.S.A. § 1101 <em>et seq., </em>and the matter is ripe for disposition. I would proceed to decide this matter immediately given the pendency of the primary election. Further, I would hold that the omission here is an amendable defect since the Statement of Financial Interest Form clearly identifies Benninghoff as an incumbent State Representative. As such, Benninghoff is salaried and that salary is of public record. Therefore, I would hold that the omission of the salary information is harmless, and therefore, an amendable defect, and I would reverse the Commonwealth Court and allow petitioner’s name to stay on the primary ballot.</p>
