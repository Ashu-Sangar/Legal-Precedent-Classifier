Smith averred that this, in turn, constituted a fatal defect pursuant to Section 1104(b)(3) of the Ethics Act, specifying that “[fjailure to file the [Financial Statement] in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to any other penalties provided, be a fatal defect to a petition to appear on the ballot.”</p>

In the alternative, Benninghoff argued that even if his Financial Statement were found to be deficient because of the omission, he should be permitted to correct the alleged defect.

Additionally, he argues that the Commonwealth Court erred by not recognizing that nominating petitions can be subject to amendment under the Election Code, and that the Ethics Act does not preclude amendment under the circumstances of this case. We agree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b747-6" data-blocks='[["BL_747.6",747,[133,1323,1158,746]],["BL_748.1",748,[247,329,1150,88]]]'>We note that prior to our review of this matter, without addressing the question of jurisdiction, we transferred the case to the State Ethics Commission and directed that the Commission issue a disposition regarding whether the defect at issue in this case was a fatal or amendable defect. Interestingly, the Commission concluded that Benninghoffs failure to list the Commonwealth as the direct source of his income as a state representative did not constitute a defect at all as it concluded such disclosure was not required under the Ethics Act. Specifically, the Commission noted that because the definition of “income” set forth in Section 1102 of the Ethics Act excludes “governmentally mandated payments or benefits” and Benninghoffs salary from his position as a state representative is a “governmentally mandated payment,” he was not <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>required to list the Commonwealth as a direct or indirect source of income in Block 10 of the Commission’s form.</p>
    <p id="b748-5" data-blocks='[["BL_748.5",748,[246,458,1152,958]]]'>While we appreciate greatly the substantial time and effort expended by the Commission and its staff in deciding this issue, we reject its decisional basis. Specifically, we do not agree with the Commission that Section 1102’s exclusion of “governmentally mandated payments or benefits” from the definition of “income” was meant to exclude the receipt of a salary paid by a governmental entity. In the first instance, the statutory definition of income expressly encompasses income in the ordinary sense, including, “[a]ny money ... received ... in recognition of services rendered in the past ... in the form of a salary....”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> It is substantially outside the boundaries of ordinary usage to equate the sorts of contractual interests arising in the course of an ordinary employment relationship with the government as giving rise to “governmentally mandated payments.” Thus, a natural reading of the statute strongly suggests that the General Assembly had no intention of creating a government-employer exception to the income disclosure requirement.</p>
    <p id="b748-6" data-blocks='[["BL_748.6",748,[246,1442,1150,257]],["BL_749.1",749,[137,329,1154,365]]]'>Indeed, the Commission’s own instructions supplied with the Financial Disclosure Form recognize as much. Regarding Block 10, the Commission instructs that “[t]his block contains the name and address of each source of income of $1,300 or more of gross income. List the name and address of all <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>employers <em>(including governmental bodies).” </em>(Emphasis added). Further in the instructions, the Commission indicates “DO NOT INCLUDE”: “governmentally mandated payments.” Thus, the Commission’s own form reflects the inherent difference between “governmentally mandated payments,” and the receipt of a salary from a governmental entity for purposes of the Ethics Act.</p>
    <p id="b749-4" data-blocks='[["BL_749.5",749,[140,716,1153,361]]]'>Even if we were to discern an incongruity in the Act’s definition of income, Section 1921(a) of the Statutory Construction Act provides that, “the object of all interpretations and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.

The obvious purpose of the Ethics Act is to mandate disclosure of the financial dealings of public officials. To construe the salaries of state legislators as well as other incomes flowing to them as payments from a governmental entity that are “received ... in recognition of services rendered in the past ... in the form of a salary ...” fulfills the statutory purpose. To hold that compensation from governmental entities to their employees are exempt from disclosure as “governmentally mandated <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>payments,” would thwart this statutory purpose. Construing compensation as reportable direct income and items such as workers’ and unemployment compensation benefits, public assistance and the like as “governmentally mandated benefits” better fulfills the purpose of the Ethics Act and also gives full effect to both sections of the applicable statutory section. This reading of the provision comports with the purposes of the .Ethics Act, which, <em>inter alia, </em>declares “that the people have a right to be assured that the financial interests of holders of or nominees or candidates for public office do not conflict with the public trust.” Applying the Commission’s broad reading of the exclusion, i.e., that “governmentally mandated payments or benefits” includes salary payments by a governmental entity, would frustrate the purposes of the Ethics Act and allow for the non-disclosure of numerous financial dealings of public officials with governmental bodies. Thus, based on the foregoing, we decline to adopt the Commission’s reasoning.</p>

Benninghoff notes that he specified in his Financial Statement that he is currently serving as a state representative. It is public knowledge that members of the General Assembly receive salaries. Moreover, those salaries are a matter of public record as they are available from the Pennsylvania Bulletin and they are also set forth in the Public Officials Compensation Act, 65 P.S. § 366.4(d). Benninghoff correctly notes that a person reviewing his Financial Statement would not need any additional information than that which is already <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>disclosed, in order to know that he draws a salary from the Commonwealth in his capacity as a State Representative.</p>

Listing the General Assembly or the Commonwealth as a direct source of income in Box 10 would not disclose anything that is not already disclosed by Benninghoff s submissions in Boxes 4, 5, and 6. Additionally, Section 1105(b), which enumerates what information is required on the Financial Statement, does not specifically require the information regarding sources of income to be listed in Box 10 of the form. While we recognize that Section 1105(a) indicates that the Financial Statement “shall be on a form prescribed by the Commission,” and that the use of a form in this regard provides an orderly way in which the Commission can obtain the required information, where, as here, all of the information required by Section 1105(b)(5) can be facially obtained from the information provided on the form as a whole, we conclude that it is fully appropriate to permit an amendment to the form to duplicate, or triplicate, in Box 10, what is already plainly stated in Boxes 4, 5 and 6.</p>

Thus, for example, the Majority does not look to the occasion for this relatively recent amendment to the Ethics Act. Instead, the Majority formulates and applies an <em>ad hoc </em>standard to govern defects in financial statements. Under the Majority’s formulation, patent defects will not be deemed fatal if a court later determines that the defective Statement otherwise was in “substantial compliance” with the provisions of the Ethics Act. Nothing in the plain language of the Act suggests that “fatal defect” can be defined to mean “non-substantial compliance,” or that the General Assembly intended all disputes such as these to lead to lawsuits where courts will have to apply such an amorphous standard.

Our General Assembly, however, in apparent response to our <em>Baldwin </em>decision, amended and reenacted the Ethics Act in 1989 to include the following language: “Failure to file the [financial <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>interests] statement in accordance with the provisions of this act shall .... be a fatal defect to a petition to appear on the ballot.” 65 P.S. § 404(b)(3). This language is clear and unambiguous. Our Statutory Construction Act of 1972 explicitly provides that “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). Hence, the General Assembly foreclosed the possibility for curing by amendment the untimely filing of a financial interests statement with the local governing authorities, and by the same token foreclosed our inquiry into the individual circumstances which may have contributed to the untimely filings.</blockquote>

(footnote omitted). Given the occasion for the amendment, I would conclude that fatal defects are limited to untimely filings. Mere defects or omissions in timely filings, such as the ones at issue here, should be subject to amendment. Notably, the regulations promulgated by the Commission, which the Majority details, <em>see </em>Majority slip op. at 8-9 &amp; n. 6., afford time for amendment, without drawing a distinction between substantially compliant defects and non-substantially compliant ones. I would not read the Majority’s distinction into the statute. Since appellant’s Statement was timely filed, the omission in Block 10 was not a fatal defect, but was one which is subject to amendment. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court erred in denying appellant an opportunity to amend.</p>
