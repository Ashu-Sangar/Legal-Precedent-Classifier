Although Ms. Tritt’s filing fee was retained, the Secretary refused her application, returning it with a note indicating that she must satisfy the educational requirement six months prior to October 5, 2004, and that she could re-submit her application in August of 2004. In response, Ms. Tritt filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Writ of Mandamus in the Commonwealth Court, naming the Secretary as respondent and averring, in pertinent part, that her application was properly completed, and that the educational prerequisite in Section 5(c) of the Act, 57 P.S. § 151(c), did not apply to her.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In particular, Ms. Tritt emphasized that subsection (c) specifically excluded notaries who had been appointed prior to its effective date, and that the requirements referred to in Section 6 of the Act, 57 P.S. § 152, for reappointment could not be read as nullifying such exclusion.

Rather, Section 5 of the Act includes a number of requirements in addition to the educational obligation; for example, an applicant must be of good moral character, familiar with the duties of a notary public, not have been convicted of a felony offense or an offense incompatible with the duties of a notary, and not have had his/her commission revoked. <em>See 57 </em>P.S. § 151(b)(1), (2).

In this case, however, Ms. Tritt filed her application for reappointment approximately sixteen months before her current term was to expire. As noted, pursuant to Section 6 of the Act, applicants for reappointment must continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 5, and the Secretary is charged with ensuring that applicants are in compliance. <em>See </em>57 P.S. § 151(b). Certain of these requirements may be affected by the timing of the application, for instance, the Secretary must be satisfied that an applicant has not been convicted of a felony offense or an offense incompatible with the duties of a notary during the five year period preceding the date of application. <em>See </em>57 P.S. § 151(b)(1). Of additional import, the Secretary is vested with discretion to reject an application based upon good cause. <em>See </em>57 P.S. § 151(b).

In conducting such an examination, we are directed to inquire, <em>inter alia, </em>as to the mischief the legislation was to remedy, the object to be obtained by the legislation, and the consequences <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>of a particular interpretation. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(3), (4), and (6). We are also specifically cautioned that we should presume that the Legislature did not intend an absurd result. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1).</p>
    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[141,558,1154,740]]]'>I believe the Legislature engrafted these new continuing educational requirements on the Act in order to ensure that our notaries are informed of the nature of their work and stay current with regard to any legal developments that would affect the discharge of their duties. In short, it desired that our notaries be competent. Contrary to the assertion of the majority, I cannot see how this legislative goal will be effectuated by interpreting the Act in such a way that essentially two classes of notaries are created: those who will complete continuing educational requirements, and presumably will be abreast of any changes regarding their duties, and those who will not. Such an interpretation will not logically advance the goal of the Legislature and, in my opinion, borders on the absurd.</p>
    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[142,1331,1153,204]]]'>Accordingly, because I do not agree that the Act provides a permanent exemption from continuing educational requirements to those notaries appointed before July 1, 2003, I must respectfully dissent.</p>
