In June of 1998, Claimant sustained a work-related injury and received workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to a notice of compensation payable, which described her injury as carpal tunnel syndrome of the right wrist. On September 30, 1998, Employer filed a petition to suspend Claimant’s benefits, on the basis that she refused reasonable medical treatment, namely, carpal tunnel release surgery. Employer subsequently amended its suspension petition to request, in the alternative, modification of Claimant’s workers’ compensation benefits, alleging that Claimant had been offered a modified-duty position.

With respect to the modification petition, the WCJ found that, as of January 27, 1999, Claimant was entitled to only partial disability benefits due to the availability of a modified-duty position at reduced earnings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Concerning the suspension petition—which was based solely upon Claimant’s alleged refusal of reasonable medical treatment—the WCJ found that Claimant had been willing to undergo carpal tunnel release surgery, but that Employer and its insurer had effectively precluded such treatment by refusing to pay for the procedure. Thus, the WCJ determined that Employer had acted in bad faith in pursuing suspension of benefits and, accordingly, ordered Employer to pay, <em>inter alia, </em>the entire amount of Claimant’s attorney’s fees, which totaled $4,200.00.

Additionally—and critically for this appeal—the WCAB directed that, pursuant to Section 440(a), Claimant should recover any paralegal and law clerk fees associated with the awardable portion of attorney’s fees, observing that “it is to the advantage of all employers in the Commonwealth to reduce attorney’s fees by the usage of paralegals or law clerks, whose hourly rate[s] are much lower than that of an attorney.” Thus, on remand the WCJ awarded attorney’s fees in the amount of $1,134.00, a sum which included $92.00 in law clerk and paralegal fees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Therefore, applying the principle <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>the Commonwealth Court held that the WCAB’s award of paralegal and law clerk fees was improper and, accordingly, reduced the fee award to $1,042.00. <em>See Vitac Corp. v.

According to Employer, this omission reflects a legislative intent that such fees should not be subject to shifting. Employer thus asserts that a plain-text analysis of the statute leaves little doubt that paraprofessional fees are entirely excluded from the provision under review, and submits that such a construction would be consistent with other cases in which this Court has interpreted the terms of Section 440(a) strictly. As an example, Employer cites to <em>Phillips v.

Indeed, the dissenting opinion fully accepted that such services were properly within the purview of the fee-shifting statute under review, and reasoned only that remuneration for those services should be obtained by including them as a component of attorney office overhead rather than as a separate billing item or category. <em>See Jenkins, </em><a href="/us/491/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="491 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="6213071" data-case-paths="/us/491/0274-01">491 U.S. at 296</a>, <a href="/us/491/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="491 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="6213071" data-case-paths="/us/491/0274-01">109 S.Ct. at 2476</a> (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (suggesting that “a prudent attorney customarily includes compensation for the cost of law clerk and paralegal services, like any other sort of office overhead—from secretarial staff, janitors, and librarians, to telephone service, stationery, and paper clips—in his own hourly billing rate”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Contrary to that dissenting position, however, in common experience segregation of paraprofessional services from overhead in accounting for legal services has emerged as a prevailing custom. Presumably, the practice reflects, among other things, a desire to apportion, as fairly and accurately as possible, charges for such services to the clients on whose behalf the services were rendered.</p>

Thus, as observed by the Justices in that case, general costs such as those expended for office supplies and secretarial work are ordinarily folded into the hourly rate which an attorney charges the client. That the General Assembly did not delineate the specific boundaries for the range of costs subject to compensation as an attorney’s fee under Section 440(a) means only that we proceed by reference to pertinent principles of statutory interpretation. <em>See O’Rourke v.

This construction is also consistent with the “clear intent” of the provision at issue to protect the claimant from the costs of defending against bad-faith filings challenging legitimate compensation for injuries sustained. <em>Phillips, </em><a href="/pa/554/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="554 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="765962" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0504-01">554 Pa. at 510</a>, <a href="/a2d/721/1091-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="721 A.2d 1091" data-case-ids="11799308,765962" data-case-paths="/a2d/721/1091-01,/pa/554/0504-01">721 A.2d at 1094</a>.

Jenkins, </em><a href="/us/491/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="491 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="6213071" data-case-paths="/us/491/0274-01">491 U.S. 274</a>, <a href="/us/491/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="491 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="6213071" data-case-paths="/us/491/0274-01">109 S.Ct. 2463</a>, <a href="/us/491/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="491 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="6213071" data-case-paths="/us/491/0274-01">105 L.Ed.2d 229</a> (1989)), which construed similar language in a federal fee-shifting provision “that the general use of the term ‘attorney’s fees’ in a fee-shifting statute functions as an umbrella capturing a range of costs expended and services performed in producing attorney work product.” 578 Pa. at 580-81, 854 A.2d at 485.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
      <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>There is no basis in the work product of our General Assembly for believing that it legislated upon this “umbrella” assumption. This statute sets forth very specific categories of recoverable costs, and that list does not include the costs which attorneys incur in employing paraprofessionals. The existence and role of paraprofessionals is not mysterious or arcane. When drafting this legislation, the General Assembly no doubt was well aware that lawyers and firms commonly employ paralegals and law clerks to perform certain tasks, and it could have included the costs of those services in its list of recoverable costs. It did not, and I think it unwise for this Court to step in and rewrite the legislation based upon policy concerns (whether sound or unsound), which our General Assembly was in a better, and more appropriate, position to evaluate and balance. The plain language of Section 440(a) does not support the Majority’s expansive interpretation.</p>
    <p id="b926-4" data-blocks='[["BL_926.6",926,[227,1199,1157,630]]]'>In my view, the cost to law firms of employing paraprofessionals is a cost of doing business just as the cost of employing secretaries, messengers, receptionists, janitors and other non-lawyer employees is a part of a law firm’s business costs. Law firms are free to, and in fact regularly do, factor these business costs into their attorneys’ hourly rates. An attorney’s fee that factors in the cost of the services of paraprofessionals is recoverable under Section 440(a); however, the separate “fees” generated by those paraprofessionals cannot be the subject of a compensatory award under the plain language of Section 440(a), as they were not authorized by our General Assembly.</p>

If this Court were a legislative body engaged in debate as to the best or fairest method of compensating the prevailing party in this sort of litigation, I might be able to agree with the proposed legislation. But this Court’s role is a limited one: we are left to interpret the <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>legislation as it is enacted and it plainly does not authorize an award of fees for paraprofessional services. Accordingly, because I would affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court finding that a worker’s compensation claimant cannot recover fees generated by paraprofessionals, I respectfully dissent.</p>

While this Court may look to decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court for guidance or persuasive legal support for novel propositions of state law facing this Court, we are not bound by those federal opinions, and we certainly should not follow them when they are clearly erroneous. The Majority’s quotation from <em>Missouri v. Jenkins </em>contains the <em>reductio ad absurdum </em>which makes clear the error in the analysis: the <em>Jenkins </em>
        <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>Court, by some inexplicable leap of logic, would deem a janitor's salary to constitute a compensable attorney's fee. I would not rely upon the logic of <em>Jenkins </em>in interpreting this workers’ compensation statute.</p>
