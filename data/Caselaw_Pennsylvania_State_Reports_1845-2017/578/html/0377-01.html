While Appellant’s argument concerning counsel’s ineffectiveness in this regard is both underdeveloped and unclear, Appellant appears to be arguing that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Caison with information contained in these records concerning Caison’s history of both mental illness and drug abuse. This claim, to the extent that it is properly presented to this Court, fails in both respects. First, given that the trial court explicitly precluded Appellant’s counsel from introducing information in these records pertaining to Caison’s mental health, trial coun<a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>sel clearly cannot be held ineffective for failing to do so. Second, with respect to Appellant’s argument that counsel should have impeached Caison with evidence of his drug abuse history contained in the records, we note that such impeachment would not have been proper.

Thus, Appellant’s claim that trial counsel should have also asked Caison about the information contained in these records concerning his general history of drug use fails, given that such information, which pertained to Caison’s conduct at times <em>other </em>than on the evening of the murder, was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. <em>See id.</em>

This claim is a bit curious, as an objection was made to this testimony, albeit by Appellant’s co-defendant’s counsel. In any event, to the extent that Appellant is suggesting that his counsel should have also objected, this claim fails, as we agree with the PCRA court that Parrish’s testimony was properly admitted. As noted above, Parrish testified that during the week that he had worked at the store, he witnessed Edwards pick up the money at the end of the night when the store would close.

Moreover, the jury heard the stipulation right after Caison’s testimony.

As such, I believe that Appellant has done enough to put the issue before this Court on such terms, particularly where he has not been afforded an evidentiary hearing at which to submit his proofs. I make this point only because I believe that, although form is certainly important, particularly in the aftermath of <em>McGill, </em>in which the Court implemented a fairly formalistic set of requirements for layered claims in subsequent cases,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> I understand the Court’s concomitant commitment was to focus more closely on substance with respect to those claims, such as these, that were advanced prior to <em>McGill’s </em>issuance. <em>See generally McGill, </em><a href="/pa/574/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="574 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="588049" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0574-01">574 Pa. at 590-91</a>, <a href="/pa/574/0573-02" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="832 A.2d 1014" data-case-ids="587990,588049,9088752,9088766" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0573-02,/pa/574/0574-01,/a2d/832/1014-01,/a2d/832/1014-02">832 A.2d at 1024</a>.</p>

      <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>In my view, the weakness of this claim lies in Appellant’s failure, even at the post-conviction stage, to proffer testimony or other evidence that would establish impairment beyond that which was noted in the records derived from Caison’s sentencing proceedings, which were apparently before the trial court at the time that it made its ruling. <em>See </em>N.T., at 66. A post-conviction petitioner, however, has an obligation to supply an adequate proffer in order to secure entitlement to an evidentiary proceeding. <em>See generally </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(d) (“Where a [post-conviction] petitioner requests an evidentiary hearing, the petitioner shall include a signed certification as to each intended witness stating the witness’s name, address, date of birth and substance of testimony and shall include any documents material to that witness’s testimony.”). As Appellant has offered to prove nothing beyond what the trial court ruled inadmissible on grounds of relevance and hearsay, and did not (in his post-conviction pleadings) raise a derivative claim to preserve any claim of trial court error in terms of such ruling, he failed to establish a basis to support either an evidentiary hearing or relief.</p>

Rizzuto, </em><a href="/pa/566/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="566 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="706217" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0040-01">566 Pa. 40</a>, 62-64, <a href="/a2d/777/1069-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="777 A.2d 1069" data-case-ids="11082939,706217" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/1069-01,/pa/566/0040-01">777 A.2d 1069</a>, 1082-83 (2001) (framing the essential inquiry concerning the admissibility of witness mental-health evidence in terms of the witness’s ability to observe and remember). In absence of some offer of explanatory, expert testimony, a fair degree of speculation would have been required to close the gap between the proffered records and the witness’s capacity in the relevant respects, thus implicating the trial court’s discretion to disallow the references. <em>Compare, e.g., Commonwealth v.
