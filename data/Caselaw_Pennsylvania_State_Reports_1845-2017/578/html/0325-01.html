PCRA counsel reiterated her argument that appellant’s brain damage rendered him incapable of earlier exercising his PCRA rights and thus qualified him under the after-discovered evidence exception to the PCRA time-bar. Counsel noted that she had spoken to a psychologist who informed her that when a person “become[s] lobotomized that you lose all sense of temporal awareness ... which might explain why [appellant] didn’t really have the sense of time that would be necessary to meet this sort of deadline.” N.T. 11/21/00, 2-3.

      <em>Id. </em>at 3. Counsel proffered that she would provide expert testimony on the effect of a lobotomy on the brain and “how it can recover,” and also would offer testimony from appellant regarding his mental state “back in '93 and '94 and how through time and through the brain’s ability to repair itself or compensate, he is moving forward in terms of his ability to read and comprehend.” <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. The Commonwealth responded that no proof had been forwarded that appellant’s brain injury affected his “ability to read or comprehend;” that the 1994 psychiatric report revealed that the part of the brain <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>affected by the injury was that which governed emotions; that appellant was able to interact with the interviewer; that he had been serving as an interpreter while in prison before entering his plea; and that the plea colloquy itself revealed that the plea was intelligently and voluntarily entered. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>

Counsel replied that: “if we could get past the timeliness issue, what [appellant] would be asserting is because of his brain injury he was not able to understand the plea colloquy or participate meaningfully in his defense.” <em>Id. </em>at 5. The court then suggested that claims premised upon incapacity generally do not toll operation of the time-bar and, thus, that hurdle had to be cleared “before we can decide whether or not you’re entitled to introduce expert testimony about the effects of [a] gunshot wound to the brain.” <em>Id. </em>at 6. Counsel responded by recognizing that her burden would be twofold, <em>i.e., </em>first to establish the time-bar exception and then the merits of the underlying claim:</p>

      <em>Id. </em>at 6.

Until that time, counsel argued, the facts that formed the basis for appellant’s substantive claims were unknown to him “in that they were not remembered or able to be applied in any meaningful way.”</p>

Slip op. at 4. The court then made a number of “observations,” including that: (1) the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel recited in appellant’s <em>pro se </em>PCRA petition clearly were time-barred; (2) the plea colloquy demonstrated that appellant’s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary; (3) appellant’s mental impairment (which the PCRA court described as amnesia) at the time of the plea was not such as to “preclude[ ] a trial and conviction;” (4) insanity is not a tolling factor for PCRA purposes; and (5) appellant’s right to the appointment of an expert was fulfilled when a psychiatric expert was appointed before his plea, and he was not entitled to appointment of another expert to aid in the presentation of a PCRA petition. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.

Thereafter, the Department of Corrections continued to monitor Haag’s mental state.

This author filed a Concurring Opinion in <em>Haag, </em>expressing disagreement with the Majority Opinion’s interpretation of the application of the after-discovered evidence exception to the "futuristic scenario” described. I made essentially three points: first, that anything we might say about the availability of future review was "necessarily both speculative and ephemeral” for a variety of reasons including that, if and when Haag returned to competence and sought further review, the <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>governing law might be different; second, that Haag might not qualify under the terms of the exception as then drafted since the facts underlying his defaulted claims might be deemed known to him, if not to counsel; and third that, in light of the PCRA's requirement that petitions alleging after-discovered evidence be filed within sixty days, Haag "might find himself unable to negotiate this narrow avenue of review as a practical matter.” <em><a href="/a2d/809/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="809 A.2d 271" data-case-ids="11423868,270329" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0271-01,/pa/570/0289-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/809/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="809 A.2d 271" data-case-ids="11423868,270329" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0271-01,/pa/570/0289-01">at 288-89</a> (Castille, J., concurring). I went on to suggest another possible avenue for review of claims that Haag was prevented from raising due to his incompetence. <em><a href="/a2d/809/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="809 A.2d 271" data-case-ids="11423868,270329" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0271-01,/pa/570/0289-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/809/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="809 A.2d 271" data-case-ids="11423868,270329" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0271-01,/pa/570/0289-01">at 289-90</a>. Although I continue to adhere to these views, I recognize that they were not accepted by a majority of the <em>Haag </em>Court. Moreover, although certain of the practical difficulties I outlined in my concurrence no doubt will be a challenge to appellant upon remand (such as the 60-day deadline), others have been removed. Specifically, this case possesses a concreteness and immediacy that <em>Haag </em>lacked on the question of the after-discovered evidence exception: <em>i.e., </em>it does not involve a speculative future scenario, and the governing law is known.</p>

The question of Gamboa-Taylor's competence to stand trial and his understanding of the consequences of his decision not to present mitigation evidence had already been litigated on his first PCRA petition. <em><a href="/a2d/753/0780-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="753 A.2d 780" data-case-ids="11212841,225976" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0780-01,/pa/562/0070-01">Id.</a> </em>According to Gamboa-Taylor's proffer on his second PCRA petition, he now had new evidence to attack those findings: two medical experts who had examined him prior to trial would have changed their opinions on the question of his mental fitness if they had been aware of the new information; and two other experts, who had not examined Gamboa-Taylor before, likewise would have opined that he was unfit to waive his right to present mitigation evidence. This Court rejected the argument that these additional "facts” concerning the already-litigated issue of Gamboa-Taylor’s mental state at the time of trial qualified as after-discovered evidence. In this regard, we noted that all of the facts respecting Gamboa-Taylor's mental slate were ascertainable in the exercise of due diligence. <em><a href="/a2d/753/0780-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="753 A.2d 780" data-case-ids="11212841,225976" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0780-01,/pa/562/0070-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/753/0780-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="753 A.2d 780" data-case-ids="11212841,225976" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0780-01,/pa/562/0070-01">at 786-87</a>. <em>Gamboa-Taylor </em>is distinguishable from the scenario discussed in <em>Haag </em>and now before this Court. The question of mental fitness in <em>GamboaTaylor </em>was presented only as the substantive, underlying question the defendant was seeking to litigate (or relitigate), via his alleged new evidence. Here, in contrast, the question of appellant’s incompetence (a question not previously litigated) is offered, at least in the posture in which we now consider the case, as the very basis for his invoking the after-discovered evidence exception.</p>

As the majority here notes, the majority in <em>Haag </em>held that the PCRA court did not err in requiring the next friend of an incompetent PCRA petitioner to proceed with the PCRA petition filed on his behalf, pointing out that the petitioner could always seek review of any previously undiscoverable fact-based claims through a second PCRA petition if he later regained his competency. The appellant, also the appointed next friend, in <em>Haag, </em>however, argued that such a procedure <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>would not adequately protect the rights of the incompetent PCRA petitioner as any second PCRA petition would be time-barred by the PCRA. In addressing that claim in a footnote, the majority suggested that, although this Court had not yet addressed the issue and could not do so in the case at hand due to its lack of ripeness, a PCRA petitioner who regains competency would “arguably” be able to file a second PCRA petition pursuant to the “after discovered evidence” exception to the timeliness requirements found at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(h). <em><a href="/a2d/809/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="809 A.2d 271" data-case-ids="11423868,270329" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0271-01,/pa/570/0289-01">Id.</a> </em>at 280 n. 11.</p>
