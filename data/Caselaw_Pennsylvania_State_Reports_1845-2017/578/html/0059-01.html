The Public Defender system has its roots in the United States Constitution, which guarantees criminal defendants the right to legal assistance for their defense. U.S. Const amend. VI.

The Dauphin County CCP notes that the second part of section 9960.6(b) of the Act provides that "every person who requests legal counsel shall sign an affidavit that he is unable to procure sufficient funds to obtain legal counsel to represent him and shall provide, under oath, such other information as may be <em>required by the court </em>...,” 16 P.S. § 9960.6(b) (emphasis in Dauphin County CCP's Brf. at 18, 21), and suggests that this language establishes that the ultimate responsibility for eligibility determinations lies with the court. However, in quoting section 9960.6(b), the Dauphin County CCP tellingly omits the provision's conclusion. Indeed, the provision does not require appli<a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>cants to provide only such information "as may be required by the court,” but actually requires them to provide “such other information as may be required <em>by the court, the public defender, or the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure.” </em>16 P.S. § 9960.6(b) (emphasis added). As such, far from indicating that the court has the ultimate responsibility for eligibility determinations, the full provision merely recognizes that the court has <em>some </em>role in such determinations. Moreover, as explained in greater detail below, that role is limited and in no way either gives the court license to prohibit the public defender from representing a defendant whom it has determined qualifies for representation or otherwise alters the first part of section 9960.6(b)'s mandate that it is <em>the public defender </em>who must provide legal counsel to those <em>it </em>determines lack sufficient funds to obtain their own counsel.</p>

Certainly, the court's determination that a particular defendant may require public defender representation may conflict with a prior determination by the public defender of financial ineligibility, thus explaining one rationale for Rule of Criminal Procedure 1101(4). However, individual circumstances in which the court may override a public defender’s determination of financial ineligibility do not concern us here, as the Administrative Order does not require the Public Defender to represent defendants, but rather, prohibits it from representing a whole class of individuals whom the Public Defender might otherwise find financially eligible.</p>

We also reject the Dauphin County CCP’s argument that the Public Defender cannot determine eligibility because it would violate the separation of powers doctrine to grant the Public Defender total control over the eligibility process, when the courts clearly have a role in that process. Dauphin County CCP's Brf. at 28 (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Lockridge, </em><a href="/pa/570/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="570 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="270338" data-case-paths="/pa/570/0510-01">570 Pa. 510</a>, <a href="/pa/570/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="810 A.2d 1191" data-case-ids="270338,9319892" data-case-paths="/pa/570/0510-01,/a2d/810/1191-01">810 A.2d 1191</a>, 1195 (2002) ("[A] statute cannot abrogate any of the procedural rules this court has adopted.”)). As this opinion makes clear, we are not granting the Public Defender total control over the eligibility process. Rather, we retain for the courts that authority which we have granted to them through our procedural rules, <em>see, e.g., </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 122(B), (C), and merely reaffirm the Public Defender’s shared role in ascertaining eligibility as set forth in the Public Defender Act.</p>
