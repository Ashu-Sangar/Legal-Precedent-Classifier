Yocca, Paul and Patty Serwonski, and Ronald P. Carmassi, individually and on behalf of all similarly situated persons who purchased “stadium builder licenses” (“SBLs”) from the Steelers. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the Commonwealth Court’s order.</p>

According to Appellees, sometime in October 1998, they received a brochure from the Steelers (the “SBL Brochure” or the “Brochure”), which advertised a new football stadium that the Steelers planned to construct for the Pittsburgh Steelers football team and advised them of the opportunity to purchase SBLs for football games in that stadium. The SBL Brochure explained that the new stadium would be both bigger and better than the existing stadium, Three Rivers Stadium, and <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>would have more seats closer to the field.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <em>See </em>R.R. 86a. The SBL Brochure then stated that any person could purchase an SBL for $250 to $2,700, depending on the section in which the SBL purchaser’s seat would be located.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
      <em>See id. </em>at 44a-45a. According to the SBL Brochure, each SBL purchaser would be assigned a particular seat in the new stadium and have the right and obligation to buy season tickets for that seat as long as the Steelers football team continues to play in the new stadium. <em>See id. </em>at 40a-41a, 46a, 109a. However, the Brochure also stated that all SBL purchasers would be free to either transfer their rights to purchase season tickets or terminate their SBLs if at some point in the future they determined that they no longer wanted to purchase season tickets for the seats assigned to them. <em>See id.</em>

A second payment totaling one-third of the amount due was required by October 1, 1999, and a third installment, representing the remaining balance, was to be submitted by October 1, 2000. <em>See id. </em>at 49a. The application further asked the SBL applicant to specify the section of the stadium where he would most like to sit (and' calculate the amount due for a seat in that section), as well as list those sections of the stadium that were his second and third preferences.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <em>See id. </em>at 46a. Notably, the SBL Brochure included <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>two small diagrams of the planned stadium. <em>See id. </em>at 44a-45a. The first diagram depicted the general locations of the sections in the lower level of the stadium while the second diagram showed the general locations of the sections in the upper level of the stadium. <em>See id. </em>Neither diagram was sufficiently detailed so as to show the number of rows or seats in the sections. <em>See id. </em>However, based on the lower level diagram, one of the sections in the lower level, the Club I Section, only appeared to include seats between the twenty-yard lines of the football field. <em>See id. </em>at 44a. Similarly, the depictions of certain sections in the upper level diagram, namely, Sections D, E, and F, appeared to show each section as having the same number of rows. <em>See id. </em>at 45a.</p>
    <p id="b825-4" data-blocks='[["BL_825.6",825,[139,1072,1159,1146]]]'>The SBL Brochure indicated that first priority for seats would be given to those SBL applicants who already had season tickets in Three Rivers Stadium and who applied for seats in a section of the new stadium that corresponded with their current seating sections. <em>See id. </em>at 46a, 50a. With regard to those applicants, the SBL Brochure stated: “We will try to assign seats as close to your current seat location as the new stadium seating configuration will allow.” <em>Id. </em>at 50a. According to the Brochure, after seats were assigned to those applicants with first priority, seats would be assigned to all other applicants based on a “random computerized priority number” placed on every application received by the November 30th deadline. <em>Id. </em>at 46a, 50a. Significantly, the SBL Brochure not only made clear that an SBL applicant’s first seating preference was “not guaranteed,” <em>id. </em>at 50a, but also that no SBL applicant was assured the right to purchase an SBL. <em>See id. </em>at 46a (“To give yourself <em>the best chance of securing seating </em>in the new stadium, you must list your first, second and third preferences. The new seating configuration is much different than Three Rivers Stadium and some Sections are sure to be over-subscribed.”) (emphasis added).</p>

      <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>The SBL Brochure further notified SBL applicants: “You will be mailed a contract by the end of March 1999, notifying you of your Section assignment. The contract must be signed and returned within 15 days. If the completed contract is not returned as required, your season ticket holder discount seating priority and deposit will be forfeited.” <em>Id. </em>at 50a. According to the SBL Brochure, SBL applicants would be given their actual seat assignments “in the Spring of 2001 after the seats have been physically installed in the new stadium.” <em>Id. </em>at 49a.

Accordingly, each Appellee completed his application in the SBL Brochure, indicating his seating preferences, and mailed the application and the required deposit to the Steelers by November 30, 1998.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In August 1999, the Steelers sent each Appellee a letter (the “August 1999 Letter”), advising them that they had been assigned SBL seats and notifying them of the stadium sections in which their seats were located.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The letter also reminded Appellees that they would soon be mailed a contract that they would have to sign to purchase SBLs to the seats assigned to them. A document containing two diagrams (the “August 1999 Diagrams”) was attached to the August 1999 Letter to show “the location of all sections.” R.R. 142a. Like the earlier diagrams included in the SBL Brochure, the August 1999 Diagrams only offered a general description of the location of each section, and did not indicate how many rows or how many seats were in any given section. However, in spite of the lack of specificity in both sets of diagrams, it was apparent that the parameters of the sections in the August <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>1999 Diagrams varied from those in the earlier diagrams. Specifically, in the August 1999 Diagrams, the Club I Section appeared larger than it had in the earlier diagrams, apparently including seats between the ten-yard lines, instead of only those seats between the twenty-yard lines. In addition, the depictions of Sections D, E, and F in the August 1999 Diagrams no longer appeared to be equal in size, but rather, Sections D and E appeared larger than Section F. Nevertheless, it was still impossible to ascertain the precise sizes of these three sections as the August 1999 Diagrams did not specify the number of rows in each section.</p>

Moreover, to assist the Licensee in identifying the location of his seats, the Agreement directed the Licensee to Exhibit A, which it described as representing the “Stadium Seating Area.” While the document containing the August 1999 Diagrams was not specifically labeled as “Exhibit A,” it was clearly meant to be Exhibit A as it was the only document attached to the contract documents, <em>i.e., </em>the SBL Agreement and the Additional Terms document, and as it clearly described the “Stadium Seating Area.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The Additional Terms document was a four-page document outlining the use of SBLs (including the fact that the Licensee would be notified of his seats prior to the first season of play in the stadium), the SBL fee, the term of an SBL, a Licensee’s duty to continually purchase <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>season tickets to maintain his SBL, the terms and conditions associated with transferring an SBL, and the conduct expected of Licensees and their guests.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The Additional Terms document also contained a clause stating that the Licensee “has read and understands the terms of this Agreement,” R.R. 158a, and an integration clause, which stated as follows:</p>

Moreover, in accordance with the provisions in the SBL Agreement, Appellees purchased season tickets for the 2001 Steelers’ football season for the SBL seats awarded to them. In the spring of 2001, after all of the seats in Heinz Field were installed, the Steelers informed Appellees of the specific locations of their SBL seats. Appellees subsequently used their seats, and according to Appellees, they immediately discovered that the seats were not located where they expected them to be based on the diagrams in the SBL Brochure. Appellees contend that several of the seating sections surrounding the football field were expanded to include a greater area of seats than shown in the SBL Brochure diagrams. Thus, although Appellees acknowledge that the names of the sections associated with each of their seats are the ones that they had requested to sit in, they assert that their seats are actually in other less desirable and less expensive sections according to the SBL Brochure diagrams.</p>

      <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>Specifically, Appellee Ronald A. Yocca alleges that he applied for and was awarded two SBL seats in the Club I Section. Mr. Yocca contends that based on the lower level diagram in the SBL Brochure, he reasonably believed that his Club I seats would be located between the twenty-yard lines of the football field. However, Mr. Yocea’s seats ended up on the eighteen-yard line, two yards outside of the twenty-yard line. Similarly, Appellees Paul and Patty Serwonski and Ronald P.

According to Appellees, the terms in the SBL Brochure constitute the terms of the parties’ contract and the Steelers breached those terms by failing to: (1) provide them with seats in the sections depicted in the two diagrams included in the SBL Brochure; (2) issue seats to them in accordance with the priority promised in the SBL Brochure; and (3) refund their deposits or reduce their future payments, as promised by the SBL Brochure, once the Steelers learned that they could not give Appellees seats in the higher priced sections they had requested.

The trial court also found that Appellees’ claims that the Steelers had violated the UTPCPL failed as a matter of law because private causes of action under the UTPCPL may only be brought based on the sale of goods or services and SBLs are neither goods nor services.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> The trial court further noted that even if the UTPCPL applied to SBLs, Appellees’ claims would fail because Appellees had to establish that they relied on the <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>representations in the SBL Brochure to prevail on those claims and Appellees could not prove that they had relied on those representations given that they had signed the SBL Agreement which specifically superseded the representations in the SBL Brochure.</p>

The court further found that the terms in the SBL Brochure could not be integrated into the SBL Agreement to define and describe the sections assigned to Appellees because the SBL Agreement included a copy of the document containing the August 1999 Diagrams to define and describe the section locations. Moreover, the court explained that “[i]t is simply not logical to believe that a sketch of the seating areas of the Stadium published almost two years before the Stadium was built <em>[i.e., </em>the SBL Brochure diagrams] was included in the final contract of the parties <em>[i.e., </em>the SBL Agreement], particularly when a diagram <em>[i.e., </em>the August 1999 Diagrams] was included with the contract.” Tr.

Lastly, with regard to Appellees’ claim for injunctive relief, the trial court concluded that such relief was not warranted as Appellees “have failed to allege any irreversible harm that will occur in the absence of an injunction and have failed to plead a clear right to such relief.” <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>

Thus, the court concluded that “the trial court’s dismissal of [Appellees’] action under the UTPCPL was improper at [the] preliminary objection stage.” <em>Id. </em>Lastly, the Commonwealth Court found that the trial court had improperly dismissed Appellees’ secondary claim for declaratory relief because “the law does not state with certainty” that Appellees are not entitled to a declaratory judgment stating that the terms of the SBL Brochure must be integrated within the SBL Agreement to define and describe the section locations referred to in the SBL Agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a>

Indeed, by signing the SBL Agreement, which contained an integration clause stating that the terms of the SBL Agreement superceded all of the parties’ previous representations and agreements, Appellees explicitly disclaimed reliance on any such representations. <em>See Gianni, </em><a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20791" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="126 A. 791">126 A. at 792</a>; <em>see also Blumenstock v.

Accordingly, as any reliance on the SBL Brochure or any other representation preceding the SBL Agreement was <em>not </em>justifiable, Appellees’ allegations in their complaint fail to establish that they are entitled to relief under the UTPCPL and the trial court did not err in dismissing Appellees’ UTPCPL claims for failing to state a claim.</p>
