During that hearing, Claimant introduced all of her medical records since her August 1999 fall. Claimant also testified, explaining that when she returned to work in October 1999, her neck and shoulder injuries had resolved, but her lower back was sore. <em>See </em>WCJ Hearing, 12/15/1999, at 9. In addition, she stated that her leg became numb while she was working on a flight on November 13, 1999. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, following the November 13th flight, Claimant called out sick from work and scheduled an appointment with Dr. Metcalf regarding her lower back and leg problems. <em>See id. </em>at 10. After examining Claimant, however, Dr. Metcalf concluded that she remained fully capable of returning to work. <em>See id. </em>Claimant then went to see Dr. Ednie, who also determined that Claimant was capable of returning to work -without limitations. <em>See id. </em>In spite of the doctors’ findings, Claimant testified that she remained on sick leave from work and was being treated by a new doctor for her lower back and leg problems. <em>See id. </em>at 15-16. Based on this testimony, Employer argued that Claimant was no longer disabled due to her August 1999 fall because she was out of work due only to her lower back and leg injuries, which were not referenced in the NCP related to the August 1999 fall. <em>See id. </em>at 18. The WCJ, finding that an issue existed regarding whether Claimant’s lower back and leg injuries were related to her original fall, rescheduled the supersedeas hearing for another date. <em>See id. </em>at 19-20.

During the hearing, both Employer and Claimant offered additional medical records regarding Claimant’s treatment since she had been released in October 1999 to return to work. Claimant also testified again and reiterated her earlier testimony that she was not working because of low back pain and numbness in her left leg. <em>See id. </em>at 20-21, 29-31. She further testified that she believed that her back problems stemmed from her August 1999 fall. <em>See id. </em>at 21. Employer, however, continued to contest any relationship between Claimant’s current problems and the August 1999 fall. <em>See id. </em>at 25-30. At the conclusion of the hearing, the WCJ announced that she would make a decision “together” on both Claimant’s challenge to Employer’s notice of suspension and Employer’s section 413(a.2) request for a supersedeas “and then [issue] a separate Supersedeas order.” <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>

The WCJ stated that based on her review of the evidence, she found that “the claimant was appropriately returned to work on October 29, 1999, and that she did in fact return to work at wages equal to her time of injury average weekly wage.” WCJ Op., 2/15/2000, at 3. Accordingly, the WCJ found that Employer had properly established that it was entitled to suspend Claimant’s benefits pursuant to its notice of suspension as of October 29th. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 774.3 (“an insurer may suspend the compensation during the time <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>the employe has returned to work at his prior or increased earnings”). The WCJ further determined that although Claimant stopped working after November 13,1999, Employer had proved that it was entitled to continue to suspend Claimant’s benefits after that date because Claimant’s “excuses [for not working] after November 13, 1999, are for reasons which are not related to her work injury of August 26, 1999, as reflected by the notice of compensation payable.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
      <em>Id. </em>Based on this latter determination, on the same day that she entered her order on Claimant’s challenge, the WCJ entered a separate order granting Employer’s section 413(a.2) request for a supersedeas pending her decision on Employer’s suspension petition, which had been amended into a termination petition, <em>see supra </em>n. 8.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Claimant appealed from the WCJ’s order on her challenge, arguing that the WCJ had improperly found that Employer could suspend her benefits after she stopped working on November 13th.</p>

According to the Board, the only relevant inquiry for a workers’ compensation judge deciding a claimant’s challenge to an employer’s <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>notice of suspension is whether the claimant has returned to work with wages equal to or greater than her pre-injury wages, as the employer has alleged in its notice of suspension, and the duration of such a return. Thus, the Board determined that Employer had properly suspended Claimant’s benefits pursuant to the notice of suspension on October 29, 1999, because it was undisputed that Claimant had returned to work without a wage loss as of that date. Unlike the WCJ, however, the Board refused to continue that suspension beyond November 13th, when Claimant stopped working, based on its view that an employer can only suspend a claimant’s benefits pursuant to a notice of suspension if the claimant is working. Accordingly, the Board affirmed the WCJ’s decision insofar as it suspended Claimant’s benefits between October 29th and November 13th, but reversed the decision insofar as it permitted Employer to suspend Claimant’s benefits after November 13th. Notably, in making its decision, the Board did not consider the fact that the WCJ had been assigned Employer’s separate section 413(a) petition for termination with a section 413(a.2) request for a supersedeas while she was considering Claimant’s challenge.</p>

In his view, the majority improperly found that Claimant’s challenge converted Employer’s notice of suspension into a request for a supersedeas because the Act requires a completely different procedure for a section 413(c) notice of suspension than it does for a request for a supersedeas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Judge Kelley noted that section 413(c) <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>“confers upon an employer the power to unilaterally suspend a claimant’s compensation benefits, without a prior hearing or a WCJ’s determination, based upon an allegation that the claimant has returned to work at his prior or increased wages.” <em><a href="/a2d/808/1064-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="808 A.2d 1064" data-case-ids="11368333" data-case-paths="/a2d/808/1064-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/808/1064-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="808 A.2d 1064" data-case-ids="11368333" data-case-paths="/a2d/808/1064-01">at 1072</a>. Judge Kelley then pointed out that, in contrast to a section 418(c) notice of suspension, a request for a supersedeas does not permit the unilateral suspension of benefits, but rather, an employer must file a request for a supersedeas along with a section 413(a) petition for the modification, suspension, or termination of benefits, and then await a workers’ compensation judge’s determination as to whether the requested suspension pending the judge’s decision on the section 413(a) petition is warranted. <em><a href="/a2d/808/1064-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="808 A.2d 1064" data-case-ids="11368333" data-case-paths="/a2d/808/1064-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/808/1064-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="808 A.2d 1064" data-case-ids="11368333" data-case-paths="/a2d/808/1064-01">at 1071</a>.

Moreover, as an insurer may only suspend a claimant’s benefits pursuant to a notice of suspension where the claimant has returned to work without a wage loss, we agree with the Board that the only relevant questions in the special supersedeas hearing on the claimant’s challenge are whether: (1) the claimant has indeed returned to work without a wage loss as the insurer has averred; (2) she returned as of the date the insurer issued the notice of suspension and started suspending her benefits; and (3) she is still currently working without a wage loss.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

In doing so, the Commonwealth Court did not take into account that there can be no viable request for a supersedeas in the absence of a petition for modification, suspension, or termination, as it did not even acknowledge that a request for a supersedeas is merely a request for a temporary suspension of benefits until the WCJ decides the accompanying petition. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court apparently presumed that any time a claimant leaves a job that gave rise to an employer’s section 413(c) notice of suspension, the employer will be interested in establishing that it is entitled to suspend the claimant’s benefits for <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>reasons outside of section 413(c) at the supersedeas hearing on the claimant’s challenge.

As such, it is clear that the decision of how to proceed should be the employer’s and instead of automatically converting the notice of suspension, the WCJ should permit the employer to signal how it desires to proceed, by either filing a separate petition for suspension with a request for supersedeas or choosing not to do so.</p>

The employer may present such a petition to the claimant and the workers’ compensation judge prior to or at the supersedeas hearing on the claimant’s challenge petition, and if the judge finds that the claimant would not be prejudiced by the introduction of evidence on the matter, the judge may permit the employer to present evidence on its request for a supersedeas at the hearing.</p>

She also presented multiple medical records to establish that her lower <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>back strain was related to her August 1999 fall. Given that Claimant voluntarily presented this medical evidence to show her continuing entitlement to benefits, she cannot now claim that she was prejudiced or otherwise denied due process of law when the WCJ permitted Employer to introduce its own medical evidence that rebutted Claimant’s evidence and supported its pending supersedeas request to suspend Claimant’s benefits after November 13, 1999.</p>

The judge, however, refused to also treat the employer's notice of suspension as a petition for suspension, instead requiring the employer to file a separate petition for suspension. The employer appealed, arguing that the judge’s failure to treat the notice of suspension as a suspension petition would prejudice its right to seek reimbursement from the supersedeas fund if it was ultimately successful on its suspension petition. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20655420" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="2000 WL 655420">2000 WL 655420</a>, at *1 (referring to 77 P.S. § 999 which grants an insurer the right to seek reimbursement from a supersedeas fund where the insurer is initially denied a supersedeas, but it is ultimately determined that the supersedeas should have been granted).</p>

The Board found that to adequately protect an employer’s right to seek reimbursement from the supersedeas fund where a claimant’s challenge is granted and an employer's request for a supersedeas is thereby denied, the employer “should be left in the position of having an open suspension petition before the Judge which it may either litigate or withdraw, with the Judge’s order granting the challenge constituting a denial of the defendant’s request for supersedeas on such petition.” <em>Id. </em>One Board member, Susan McDermott, dissented, stating that the plain language of section 413(c) “indicates that the purpose of a supersedeas hearing is limited to resolution of a contest regarding the allegations in [the] insurer's affidavit.” <em>Id. </em>at *4. Furthermore, Ms. McDermott found that, contrary to the majority’s finding, converting a notice of suspension into a request for a supersedeas and a suspension petition was not necessary to protect an employer's right to seek reimbursement from the supersedeas fund because when an employer files a section 413(c) notice of suspension, it can always also file a separate suspension petition with a request for a supersedeas to protect its right to seek recovery from the supersedeas fund if the claimant’s challenge is granted. <em>See id.</em>

Claimant also argues that the WCJ’s decision denying her challenge was improper because it was not issued within 14 days of the WCJ's first hearing on the challenge as required by 34 Pa.Code § 131.50a. <em>See </em>34 Pa.Code § 131.50a ("If the judge ... fails to issue a written order approving the suspension or modification of benefits within 14 days of the [challenge] hearing, the insurer shall reinstate the employee's workers’ compensation benefits [at the rate the employee received before the suspension].”). However, we disagree that the WCJ's decision violated the time requirements in 34 Pa.Code § 131.50a when Claimant never objected to the WCJ's decision to delay her decision and hold a second hearing on Claimant’s challenge, and the WCJ's decision on February 15 th was made within 14 days of the second hearing on February 4th.</p>
      <p id="b809-7" data-blocks='[["BL_809.7",809,[175,1666,1121,707]]]'>Claimant additionally argues that if her challenge to Employer’s notice of suspension converted the notice into a section 413(a.l) automatic request for a supersedeas, as the Commonwealth Court found, the WCJ erroneously granted Employer’s request because she did not issue her decision within seven days of the hearing on the request as required by section 413(a.1) and the regulation concerning that section, 34 Pa.Code § 131.49. <em>See </em>34 Pa.Code § 131.49 (“If the judge to whom the special supersedeas request has been assigned ... fails to issue a written order within 7 days of the hearing [on] the supersedeas request, the automatic request for a supersedeas will be deemed denied.”). However, we see no need to review this claim because, as explained above, <em>see supra </em>n. 12, we presume that Claimant's challenge did not convert Employer’s notice of suspension into a section 413(a.1) request for a supersedeas. Moreover, although we ultimately hold that the WCJ properly denied Claimant's benefits after November 13, 1999 based on Employer's section 413(a.2) request for a supersedeas, the time restraints in section 413(a.1) and 34 Pa.Code § 131.49 do not apply to a section 413(a.2) supersedeas request.</p>

Those are the only two averments contained in the notification to the employee and the department. It is inherent in the statute that, when the <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>employee checks the box to challenge the suspension of compensation, the challenge is limited to whether the employee returned to work and whether current earnings are equal to or greater than those prior to the work injury. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the employee returned to work on the date indicated in Employer’s suspension notice, without wage loss. It is subsequent to that return to work without wage loss that the employee left work. The Majority position would prevent a WCJ from receiving any evidence other than the Suspension Notice and the claimant’s challenge. If this were in fact the intent of the General Assembly, why include a requirement for a special supersedeas hearing within the text of the statute? Why not merely have the Bureau inform the employer that there has been a challenge and that benefits must be reinstated until further appropriate action, if any, is taken?</p>

In that instance, I believe that a WCJ is permitted to waive or modify the special rules of practice. 34 Pa.Code § 131.3(a).

This section itemizes the evidence that a WCJ may consider “in relation to a request for supersedeas,” which is the action that results from checking the box.

    <p id="b817-7" data-blocks='[["BL_817.7",817,[141,933,1160,1070]]]'>In the instant matter, the subject of the proceeding was the challenge to the suspension of benefits. When Claimant challenged that suspension, she was alleging that she had a right to continued benefits. I believe that the WCJ, in deciding whether Claimant did, indeed, have a right to continued benefits, was entitled to consider evidence proffered by both Claimant and Employer that indicated that her failure to return to work was not work related. As articulated by the Commonwealth Court, it is beyond reason to require a WCJ to turn a blind eye toward evidence entitling a party to a supersedeas when all parties are assembled. <em>See U.S. Airways v.
