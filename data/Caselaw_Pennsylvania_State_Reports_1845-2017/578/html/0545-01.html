Notably, as well, the PCRA court treated the claim on its merits, and I would affirm its reasoning as such. In particular, in its role as fact-finder, the PCRA court accepted the testimony of the Commonwealth’s expert psychiatrist to the effect that Appellant suffered from no mental health deficits; furthermore, the court highlighted the substantial weaknesses in the case of mental-health mitigation offered by Appellant in the post-conviction proceedings.
