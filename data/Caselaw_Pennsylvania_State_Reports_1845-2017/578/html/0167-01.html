If we would grant the jury discretion to ignore stipulations of fact, we would be granting the right to arrive at a sentencing verdict in an arbitrary and capricious fashion. Such a conclusion would undercut the very purpose of the death penalty sentencing scheme as developed by our General Assembly. A sentence of death cannot be “the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(i).</blockquote>

Thus, according to <em>Rizzuto, </em>where the jury fails to find a stipulated mitigator, such failure introduces an arbitrary element into the process by which the defendant is sentenced to death. <em>See 'id. </em>Because <em>Rizzuto </em>post-dated Appellant’s trial, however, Justice Nigro observed that Appellant would not be entitled to relief pursuant to a post-conviction claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. On that basis, Justice Nigro concurred in the result. <em>See Ogrod, </em><a href="/pa/576/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="839 A.2d 294" data-case-ids="16708,9057166" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0412-01,/a2d/839/0294-01">839 A.2d at 348</a> (Nigro, J., concurring).</p>

Rather, he asserts that this Court has an independent statutory duty to vacate death sentences imposed due to an arbitrary factor. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(i). He avers that this Court erred in affirming his sentence because, as reflected in Justice Nigro’s concurrence, the jury failed to find a stipulated mitigator, and such failure constitutes an arbitrary factor, per <em>Rizzuto, </em>requiring vacation under Section 9711(h)(3)(i). The Commonwealth responds by noting that, at the time of Appellant’s trial, <em>Copenhefer </em>had not been overruled, and hence, the trial court did not err in accepting the death sentence reached by the jury.</p>

It is nonetheless evident from the passage quoted above that this Court’s decision rested, ultimately, not on an evaluation of the trial court’s performance as such—as indeed <em>Copenhefer </em>reflected the governing law at the time—but upon the conclusion that the jury’s failure to find the stipulated mitigating circumstance was inherently fatal to the validity of the death sentence under Section 9711(h)(3)(i). In this regard, it is relevant that Appellant’s present contention is not premised upon a waived allegation of trial error or ineffective assistance, but upon an assertion that this Court failed to fulfill its independent statutory duty to vacate his death sentence which the record revealed to have been the product of an arbitrary factor. In order to evaluate this claim, it is necessary to consider whether this Court’s duty subsisted independently of Appellant’s obligation to assert it, and if so, whether Appellant was entitled to the benefit of the <em>Rizzuto </em>rule.</p>
    <p id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[229,1242,1159,950]]]'>First, it is apparent that Appellant is correct in his assertion that this Court’s obligation to vacate arbitrary death sentences exists separately from a capital defendant’s duty to preserve issues and raise them on appeal to this Court. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

DeJesus, </em><a href="/pa/567/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="567 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="404481" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0415-01">567 Pa. 415</a>, 445-46, <a href="/pa/567/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="787 A.2d 394" data-case-ids="404481,9454620" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0415-01,/a2d/787/0394-01">787 A.2d 394</a>, 412 (2001) (same). In short, Appellant could not “waive” any claim that his death sentence was the product of an arbitrary factor, because the responsibility to conduct a record search for such factors is imposed on the Supreme Court by the Legislature.
