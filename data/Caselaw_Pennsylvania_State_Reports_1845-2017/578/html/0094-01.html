Therefore, consistent with our decision in <em>St. Joe Container Co., </em>we hold that when an employer refers the claimant to a job, which will become unavailable to the claimant at a set date in the future, the claimant’s benefits should only be modified for that period of time that the job was available regardless of whether or not the claimant accepts the position or improperly refuses it.</p>

We do not agree, however, that a workers’ compensation judge abuses her discretion in considering the subsidized nature of a proffered job and its effect on the temporal length of the job. Clearly, in circumstances in which the new light-duty employer that is receiving the subsidies (the “New Employer”) has no interest in employing the claimant beyond the subsidy period and the claimant is therefore bound to lose the job when the subsidy is terminated, the workers’ compensation judge should be free to consider this fact when assessing whether the position constitutes a mere short-term fix to the claimant’s lack of productive employment. Moreover, even where the New Employer has expressed a willingness to employ the claimant once the subsidies have stopped, the workers’ compensation judge may justifiably consider a subsidized job arrangement to be temporary if, for instance, the <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>New Employer anticipates any continued employment to be in a completely different position than that which was subsidized. To that end, where the evidence establishes, <em>inter alia, </em>that at the end of the subsidy period, the claimant will not only be asked to change his duties, but also to move to another location, reduce his hours, and work for less pay, it is within the workers’ compensation judge’s discretion to find that the post-subsidy job is not one in the same as the subsidized job first presented to the claimant, and that the light-duty job initially presented to the claimant was a temporary job only lasting the length of the subsidy period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

Approximately two months later, the Radon Division was sold and the position that Bennett had been offered was apparently eliminated. Sometime thereafter, the employer filed a modification petition seeking to reduce Bennett’s benefits based on his refusal to accept the Radon Division light-duty job. Bennett contested the petition, arguing that he had been physically unable to perform the position, but that even if he had been capable of performing the job and thus, rejected it in bad faith, his benefits could only be modified for the limited time period that the job had been actually available.

Employer contends first, that the Commonwealth Court erred as a matter of law in equating a limited period of employer subsidization with temporary employment and, in any event, that each of the tribunals below misread the record as supporting such a limitation on the term of the position offered to <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>Claimant.

The testimonial evidence is of usual cases, common practices, and typical ranges of the term of subsidization. There is simply no evidence that a ninety-day period of subsidization was preset at the outset for the telephone survey position offered to Claimant. Evidence that a five-hundred hour or ninety-day subsidization period is “common”; that there is “usually” an end point to subsidization; that “typically” the Smart Telecommunication’s job referrals from Expediter are subsidized for an “indefinite period of time,” “anywhere from a week to three months,” and that the longest period of subsidization in the experience of the witness was “about six months” is, irrespective of the assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded to the evidence, simply inadequate to support the WCJ’s pivotal finding: that the telephone survey “position was a funded position only guaranteed for a period of ninety (90) days.”</p>

Where a claimant is offered suitable employment, the claimant cannot decide that he does not like the position,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> resign and accept <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>another position he cannot perform,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> or remain in a lower paid position<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> to avoid a suspension of benefits because of bad faith. The rationale employed by the Commonwealth Court in these cases is that, unlike a claimant who has accepted employment that is terminated, the claimants in these cases are unemployed, not because of a medical disability, but because they chose not to accept employment made available by the employer. Thus, when an employer offers a claimant a position within his physical limitations, a claimant is obligated to accept that offer of available employment in good faith or suffer a suspension of his benefits. Further, the Commonwealth Court has concluded that, once a claimant has exhibited bad faith by refusing employment within his restrictions, the claimant cannot cure his bad faith by finding another job. <em>See, e.g., Liggett v.

In <em>Bennett, </em>the claimant followed up on numerous referrals produced by the employer. However, when he was offered a permanent, light-duty position at a lower wage than his pre-injury job, he refused the offer, and sabotaged the interview by giving the interviewer three reports stating that he was totally disabled. Three months later, the light-duty position was eliminated for economic reasons. The employer sought a modification of benefits and <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>the referee<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> reduced the claimant’s benefits from total to partial, based upon the wages he would have earned had he accepted the position proffered. The claimant in that case argued that he was entitled to a reinstatement of total disability benefits as of the date when the job was eliminated. He contended that the employer was in the same position after the job was eliminated that he would have been had the claimant accepted the job. The referee rejected this argument and the Commonwealth Court affirmed finding that:</p>

    <p id="b464-4" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[245,872,1154,1210]]]'>I do believe that one viable principle emerged from the decision of the Commonwealth Court in <em>Bennett, </em>which is that the determination of the permanent or temporary nature of the position should be decided at the time that the position is offered. The Majority concludes that, even if Smart hired Claimant at the end of the subsidization period, that the job, the hours, and the pay would change, virtually rendering the position offered a temporary one. I believe that subsidized employment only becomes temporary employment where there is no intent on the part of the employer receiving the wage subsidies to assimilate the employee into its work force. In the instant matter, the testimony indicated that both Employer and Smart intended that Claimant be assimilated as a regular employee on Smart’s payroll and, in fact, Smart had hired at least four such previous employees. Accordingly, I believe that the WCJ erred in concluding that subsidized employment and temporary employment were the same for purposes of determining that disability benefits should be awarded only for a closed period. It was further error on the part of the WCJ to reinstate total disability benefits after a finding of bad faith where the Claimant did not demonstrate that there were no jobs within his medical restrictions available to him.</p>
    <p id="b464-5" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[244,2115,1152,255]],["BL_465.1",465,[141,323,1155,460]]]'>Based on established workers’ compensation jurisprudence in this Commonwealth, Claimant’s benefits should be modified indefinitely, following a finding of bad faith, until Claimant demonstrates that there is no work available to him within his medical restrictions. If Claimant had accepted the position <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>and had been hired at the end of the subsidy period, he would be working today.

Therefore, Claimant’s loss of earning power resulted from his refusal to return to gainful employment. At that point, Claimant was required to show that the work was “unavailable” to him<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_9" id="ref_footnote_3_9">9</a> or that there were no jobs available that he could perform within his work restrictions to effect a reinstatement. Claimant failed to carry his burden of proof that he was deserving of reinstatement by proving the negative required by <em>Stanek, </em>and the WCJ erred in reinstating Claimant’s benefits at the end of a closed period. The fact that Employer was subsidizing the employment does not make it temporary in nature where the owner of Smart testified that, if Claimant met the qualifications for regular, full-time employment, Claimant would be placed on its regular payroll. Claimant should have attempted the position and, at the close of the subsidization period, if the position terminated through no fault of his own, he should have pursued the options available to him pursuant to the Act. As observed by the <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>Commonwealth Court in <em>Bennett, </em>“[i]t is eminently fair to require claimants who act in bad faith to live with the foreseeable consequences of their actions and a rule which would discourage bad faith on the part of claimants would further ensure the cooperation of efforts necessary to maintain the [equality] of the system.” <em>Bennett, </em><a href="/pa-commw/158/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="632 A.2d 596" data-case-ids="1451000" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/158/0547-01">632 A.2d at 600</a>. The decision reached by the Majority rewards the Claimant in this case for bad faith conduct and chills the viable attempt of an Employer to return an injured worker to gainful employment. The modification of Claimant’s benefits should be effected, not according to the principles enunciated in <em>Bennett, </em>but consonant with <em>Dillon </em>and <em>Stanek, </em>until Claimant can demonstrate that there are no jobs available to him within his medical restrictions. Where there is no evidence that the subsidization period has a definite terminus, there can be no finding that subsidized employment is temporary employment for the purposes of benefit modification. Further, subsidized employment may only be considered temporary where there is a lack of intent on the part of the new employer to assimilate the employee into its workforce. In the instant matter, Claimant never gave the employment opportunity with Smart a chance to extend beyond the subsidy period. Accordingly, I believe that the decision of the Commonwealth Court must be reversed and that Employer’s Petition requesting a modification of benefits should be granted.</p>
