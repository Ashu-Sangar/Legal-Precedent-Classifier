On December 3, 2003, the trial court entered an order dismissing Fisher’s petitions, although not for the reason advanced by Matheny in her preliminary objections. In its opinion filed with its order, the trial court explained that Matheny’s preliminary objections were overruled because, contrary to Matheny’s assertions, the electors’ verifications did not need to be made before a notary public. Relying on the definition of “verify” in the Judicial Code, the trial court <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>determined that the verifications could be unsworn so long as they were made subject to the penalties of 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904 (providing penalties where person makes a false statement to authorities). <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 102 (“verified” includes “an unsworn document containing a statement by the signatory that is made subject to the penalties of 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904”). As the electors’ verifications were made subject to such penalties, the trial court concluded that they were properly made. However, the trial court then found <em>sua sponte </em>that all nine petitions were deficient because they did not state that the electors who had verified each petition were actually qualified electors in the election district at issue. Moreover, the court determined that the petitions were also defective because they did not contain averments that the electors who had verified the petitions were in fact petitioning the court or had joined Fisher in petitioning the court. Thus, given these latter findings, the trial court dismissed Fisher’s petitions.</p>

On December 10, 2003, the trial court entered an order denying Fisher’s request that it reconsider its December 3rd order, but granting Fisher three days to cure the errors in her nine petitions by filing nine amended petitions. Accordingly, on December 12, 2003, Fisher filed nine amended petitions that contained averments by the electors who verified each petition that they were qualified electors in the election district at issue and that they were joining Fisher in filing the petition they had signed.</p>

In the opinion filed with its order, the Commonwealth Court explained that because the trial court had not specified exactly why the amended petitions did not comply with the Election Code, <em>see supra </em>n. 7 and accompanying text, it would consider both of the reasons raised by Matheny in her preliminary objections to the amended petitions, <em>i.e., </em>that the petitions were defective because: (1) they were not properly verified by the electors; and (2) the electors had not signed the actual petitions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> With regard to the former claim, the Commonwealth Court noted that although the Election Code does not specify what constitutes a proper verification for purposes of petitions filed pursuant to its provisions, the Judicial Code and the Rules of Civil Procedure “accept as verification a statement that is made subject to the penalties of 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904.” <em>In re Contest of 2003 General Election for Office of Prothonotary of Washington County, </em><a href="/a2d/841/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="841 A.2d 606" data-case-ids="9285337" data-case-paths="/a2d/841/0606-01">841 A.2d at 613</a>.

Following the Commonwealth Court’s decision, the trial court issued a 1925(a) opinion explaining the reasoning for its December 22nd order. In the opinion, the trial court states that it dismissed Fisher's amended petitions because the three electors who verified the petitions did not also sign the actual petitions.

In its opinion, the Commonwealth Court also addressed a motion to quash that had been filed by Matheny before the case was argued. In that motion, Matheny argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to permit Fisher to amend her nine petitions because it had already <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>entered an order dismissing them and because the defects in the original petitions were not amendable. Matheny further asserted that Fisher did not have standing to bring the appeal from the trial court's decision solely in her name. According to Matheny, only the electors who had verified Fisher's petitions could appeal from the trial court’s decision, and because those electors had not joined Fisher in filing the appeal to the Commonwealth Court, Matheny argued that Fisher’s appeal must be quashed. In considering this motion, the Commonwealth Court first found that the trial court had jurisdiction to permit Fisher to amend her petitions after it had initially dismissed them because section 5505 of the Judicial Code allows a court to “modify or rescind any order within 30 days after its entry, notwithstanding the prior termination of any term of court, if no appeal from such order has been taken or allowed.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 5505. Next, the Commonwealth Court determined that the trial court properly decided that the defects present in Fisher’s initial petitions were amendable. Lastly, with respect to Matheny’s standing argument, the Commonwealth Court concluded that Fisher had standing to appeal from the trial court’s order because she was an aggrieved party to the trial court’s order dismissing the nine amended petitions that had been filed, in part, in her name.</p>

While Matheny does not argue that Fisher’s Petitions to Open were untimely, she nevertheless asserts that the Petitions may not be considered because they were <em>presented </em>to the trial court on December 2, 2003, after the election results were certified. According to Matheny, section 1703(b) of the Election Code requires that Petitions to Open be <em>presented </em>to the trial court before the election results have been certified. <em>See </em>25 P.S. § 3263(b). However, although section 1703(b) states that a trial court’s order concerning a Petilion to Open shall not have any effect unless the Petition to Open was presented before the election results were certified, we interpret “presented” here to mean that the Petition must have been filed with the Prothonotary. Such a reading is consistent with section 1703(a), which states that an elector must <em>“file </em>” a Petition to Open no later than five days after the completion of the computation of the votes, and section 1404(1), which states that the Board may certify the votes on the expiration of the fifth day following the computation unless a Petition to Open has been <em>“filed.” Id. </em>§§ 3263(b) (emphasis added), 3154 (emphasis added).</p>

Notably, ihe Statutory Construction Act does not also provide that the term "verified” may include an unsworn document made subject to the penalties of 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904. In 1976, when the General Assembly adopted the Judicial Code, it introduced the concept that a verified document and an affidavit could include an unsworn document subject <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>to the penalties of 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904. <em>See </em>Pa. R.C.P. 76 cmt. (1981). The Rules Committee of this Court subsequently incorporated this concept into the Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that in 1981 the definitions of verified and affidavit in the Rules of Civil Procedure were “enlarged to include two alternatives: ... (1) the usual oath or affirmation before a notary or other person authorized to administer oaths or (2) a statement by the signer that it is made subject to the penalties of 18 Pa.C.S. § 4904....”). In contrast, the General Assembly did not incorporate this concept into the Statutory Construction Act, which continues to define "verified” as a writing supported by an oath or affirmation and an "affidavit” as a written statement sworn to or affirmed before an officer authorized to administer oaths or accept affirmations. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1991.</p>

The Statutory Construction Act, which as noted above applies to the provisions of the Election Code, defines an affidavit as “[a] statement in writing of a fact or facts signed by the party making it, sworn to or affirmed before an officer ... authorized to administer oaths, or before the particular officer or individual designated by law as the one before whom it is to or may be taken, and officially certified to in the case of an officer under his seal of office.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1991.
