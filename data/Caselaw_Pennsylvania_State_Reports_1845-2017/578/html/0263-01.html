The Commonwealth rests its position in this regard on the fact that, in the Superior Court, Melendez did not independently list the legality of the warrantless entry of the home among her complaints (although the Commonwealth candidly acknowledges that Appellant did). The Commonwealth emphasizes that, in granting Melendez relief, this Court agreed with her primary claim—unique to her and not raised by Appellant—that the detectives improperly stopped and searched her in the driveway behind her house, and that there were no exigencies to excuse the officers’ conduct outside the house. Although the Commonwealth recognizes that the <em>Melendez </em>Court expressly disapproved the warrantless entry into Melendez’s house, the Commonwealth characterizes such discussion as <em>dictum. </em>Since the Commonwealth views the <em>Melendez </em>case as having been decided on grounds unique to Melendez, it asserts that Appellant cannot credibly maintain that he was denied due process or equal protection where this Court merely exercised its discretionary review prerogative and concluded that the concerns it harbored in Melendez’s case simply did not apply to a distinctly situated litigant. Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>Appellant and Melendez had been identically situated, the Commonwealth describes Appellant’s claim as previously litigated on direct appeal; indicates that Appellant cannot be entitled to retroactive application of <em>Melendez </em>since it announced no new rule of law and was not issued during the pendency of his direct appeal; and asserts that Appellant’s <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>claim does not implicate the truth-determining process or otherwise warrant habeas corpus relief.</p>

After outlining the important, difficult, and potentially far-reaching due process/equal protection claim arising from this Court’s management of its discretionary review docket which is squarely presented in this Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> appeal, the Majority Opinion inexplicably declines to decide the claim. Instead, the Majority revisits the underlying search and seizure claim which was raised and finally litigated on appellant’s direct appeal to the Superior Court, and then summarily resolves the claim in appellant’s favor. The Majority recasts the issue presented, despite the fact that appellant insists that he is not attempting to relitigate the search and seizure claim. Instead, appellant makes clear that his is a distinct claim which only matured years after trial when he supposedly was a victim, at the <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>hands of this Court, of an “arbitrary, capricious and unequal” discretionary appeal system.</p>

As the Majority notes, however, <em>Tyson </em>is distinguishable because, in denying earlier relief to the appellant there, this Court had noted that the denial was without prejudice to post-conviction relief. The <em>Tyson </em>Court specifically emphasized the appellant’s reliance upon the earlier “without prejudice” notation in determining that she was entitled to PCRA relief notwithstanding the previous litigation of the claim:</p>

      <em>Tyson </em>is also distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice </em>because it involved the availability of a defense at trial— expert evidence concerning the so-called “battered woman syndrome”—and thus inured to appellant’s actual guilt or innocence. Finally, given this Court’s decisions in the previous litigation arena since <em>Tyson, </em>as well as the fact that the <em>Tyson </em>Court never attempted to explain under what authority the statute could be negated on “fairness” grounds, it is unwise to read <em>Tyson </em>in the Majority’s expansive fashion-ie., as if it permits the Court to ignore the previous litigation bar provision whenever a Majority is of a mind to do so. <em>Tyson, </em>which went to such extraordinary and near-apologetic lengths to tie itself to its unique facts, should be confined to those facts.</p>

However, I note my concern with the Majority’s easy acceptance of the notion that the situations of Melendez and appellant respecting the search of Melendez's home was “identical" and should have been apparent as such to those of our predecessor brethren who voted to dismiss appellant's appeal and later to sustain Melendez's. First, it is not self-evident that appellant and Melendez were “identically situated.” The warrant-based search which resulted in the actual seizure of the evidence which formed the basis for appellant's prosecution was of Melendez's home. Appellant was present at the time of the search and, having been charged with possessing the contraband, he had automatic standing to challenge that seizure. <em>See Commonwealth v. Peterson, </em><a href="/pa/535/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="535 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1841539" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0492-01">535 Pa. 492</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="163" data-cite="636 A.2d 615" data-case-ids="1841539,7363833" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0492-01,/a2d/636/0615-01">636 A.2d 615</a>, 617 (1993), <em>citing Commonwealth v.

In forwarding his suppression challenge, however, appellant had the affirmative preliminary burden at the suppression hearing to show that the entry into Melendez's residence and the ensuing search violated a reasonable expectation of privacy which was personal to him. As this Court explicitly noted in <em>Peterson:</em>

      <p id="b624-16" data-blocks='[["BL_624.4",624,[276,1979,1121,389]]]'>My second concern with the merits has to do with the Majority’s equally rash acceptance of the notions that (1) <em>Commonwealth v.

In my view, a fair and careful reading of those two rather unfocused opinions supports neither notion. If we are about reinterpreting the conduct of the Court in those years, perhaps those opinions should be fair game for scrutiny as well.</p>
