They further agreed that alimony would cease upon Wife’s cohabitation, remarriage or death. On September 25, 1996, the parties entered into a stipulation whereby they agreed that Husband would continue to pay Wife $500.00 per month as alimony without any reduction if, in the future, he was to receive social security benefits. They again agreed that alimony would cease upon Wife’s cohabitation, remarriage or death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The trial court made the stipulation an Order of Court, and on October 28, 1996, the parties were divorced.</p>

Husband arranged for the workers’ compensation insurance carrier to send Wife a monthly check for $500 .00 through the Lehigh County Domestic Relations Section, and later through the Pennsylvania State Collection and Disbursement Unit (PASCDU). Husband and the insurance carrier of his employer subsequently reached an agreement for compromise and release of his claim for workers’ compensation benefits. On July 20, 1999, following a hearing, a workers’ compensation judge entered an Order approving the compromise and release.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As Husband and Wife could not <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>agree on the disposition of the award, the workers’ compensation judge directed the insurer to issue a check payable to counsel for Husband and counsel for Wife.

The Court dismissed the Petition on January 13, 2000, “due to the defendant’s present medical condition and pending workers’ compensation settlement claim .” On June 29, 2000, the Domestic Relations Section again filed a Contempt Petition, this time alleging arrears of $3,921.97. Husband then filed a Petition for Modification on July 27, 2000, seeking release of the funds held in escrow. By Order dated October 6, 2000, the trial court denied the Petition. Husband made no alimony payments to Wife from August 19, 1999 until March 22, 2001. He argues that “Wife’s alimony payments ceased as a result of Husband’s funds being frozen due to Wife’s insistence that she was entitled to a portion of her Husband’s workers’ compensation lump sum award.” Appellant’s Brief at 13. While Husband blames Wife for the fact that he did not make timely alimony payments, the fact remains that he did not fulfill his obligation toward her.</p>

He began receiving payments in May of 2000. On March 22, 2001, the parties stipulated to the release of $9,437.04 from the escrow account to satisfy Husband’s alimony obligation through April of 2001. No arrearages have accumulated since that time. By Order dated April 5, 2001, the trial court held that Husband was not in contempt, noted the recent lump sum payment to Wife and dismissed the Rule to Show Cause issued following the filing of the June 29, 2000 contempt petition.</p>

The trial court therefore considered it necessary to segregate the funds to ensure that Wife would receive her alimony payments. Husband filed a timely appeal from the Order of the trial court, and the Superior Court affirmed in a published opinion. <em>Dudas v.

It is true that the court did not hold Husband in contempt. <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>However, the Joint Submission of Stipulated Facts provides in relevant part, “[t]he parties entered into a Stipulation dated March 22, 2001, which authorized the release of $9,937.04 from the Quakertown National escrow account to satisfy an arrearage balance owed by [Husband] to [Wife]____” Accordingly, there was a sufficient basis in the record for the trial court to conclude that Husband had allowed significant arrearages to accrue. In support of its decision, the trial court cited <em>Petto v. Petto, </em><a href="/pa-super/372/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="372 Pa. Super. 558" data-case-ids="693650" data-case-paths="/pa-super/372/0558-01">372 Pa.Super. 558</a>, <a href="/pa-super/372/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="372 Pa.

In <em>Petto, </em>husband and wife, who were the parents of two children, separated in September of 1984. One month later, husband moved to Brazil, taking with him bank funds and the children’s bonds totaling $86,000.00. In 1987, the trial court issued a divorce decree requiring husband to pay wife $200.00 per month in child support, awarding the family residence and investment properties to wife, and directing wife to pay husband $12,419.43 as part of equitable distribution. Wife then requested the trial court to secure the monies she owed husband to ensure future child support payments. The trial court disagreed, and on appeal the Superior Court reversed, noting that failure to sequester the funds would “frustrate the objectives of justice.” <em>Id. </em>at 1340. One of the reasons supporting the decision of the Superior Court was the fact that the obligor in <em>Petto </em>allowed support arrearages to accumulate for five months.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The fact that the trial court did not actually hold the obligor in contempt for his failure to make timely child support payments, did not deter the Superior Court from securing the funds in question.</p>

Pursuant to Section 3502(b) of the Divorce Code, 23 Pa.C.S. § 3502(b), the “court may impose a lien <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>or charge upon property of a party as security for the payment of alimony or any other award for the other party.” Accordingly, the trial court had the power to place Husband’s assets in escrow in order to ensure the timely disbursement of alimony payments. The actual question before us is whether the trial court properly exercised that power.</p>
    <p id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[134,673,1161,861]]]'>Husband became entitled to the sum of money at issue in this case through the Workers Compensation Act, Act of June 2, 1915, as amended. Courts “have recognized that an important purpose of the Act is to provide a regular form of future income ... in installments over long periods and even for [a] lifetime in some cases.” <em>Bush v.

Therefore, we agree with the trial court that the lump sum payment, which Husband’s employer paid as a result of the compromise and release, was intended to compensate him for lost wages. Where, as in this case, a trial court orders that a sum of money that substitutes for income be placed in escrow based on a history of arrearages, the court must consider Section 3703 of the Divorce Code, which provides in relevant part: Enforcement of arrearages</p>
