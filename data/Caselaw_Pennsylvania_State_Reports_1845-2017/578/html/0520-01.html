Such a policy would be tantamount to putting a price on an appeal, and would “chill” the exercise of that right. “[D]ue process of law ... requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.” [T]o assure the absence of a vindictive motivation, ... “whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear.” This requirement has been read to create “a presumption of vindictiveness, which may be overcome only by objective information in the record justifying the increased sentence.”</blockquote>

Here, after denying relief on any of the claims respecting the guilt phase of the trial, the PCRA court awarded Appellant a new penalty hearing, citing trial counsel’s lack of preparation. Specifically, the PCRA court referenced trial counsel’s failure to secure a psychiatric or psychological evaluation of Appellant, review Appellant’s juvenile file or prison records for mitigation information, and life-qualify the jury; further, the court noted that, while questioning the jurors, trial counsel confused Appellant’s right not to testify with his right against self-incrimination. The PCRA court also stated that if no appeal was filed, the <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>case could be re-listed before the court without a jury and a life term of imprisonment would be imposed.</p>

For example, on the same day and immediately after Appellant filed a notice of appeal to challenge the portion of the PCRA court’s order denying him relief on the claims involving the guilt phase of his trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration of the order granting Appellant a new penalty hearing, averring as the sole reason in support that nothing in Appellant’s juvenile file would have been helpful to him at the penalty hearing. At the ensuing argument on the Commonwealth’s motion, the PCRA court reversed its earlier order awarding a new penalty hearing, stating that it was doing so based upon the assertions in the Commonwealth’s reconsideration petition and upon reviewing the entire record. At that time, the PCRA court did not address the reasons it cited in previously granting relief, other than stating that such grounds were “very loosely” based upon the law and that the court had been primarily acting on the basis of sympathy arising from the disproportionate conviction and sentence Appellant received in relation to his co-defendants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> More important, in responding to PCRA counsel’s concern with the appearance of vindictiveness, the court explained:</p>

In my view, such statements, in conjunction with the attending circumstances, are sufficient to demonstrate a “reasonable likelihood” of retaliation against Appellant for exercising his right to appeal such that a presumption of vindictiveness is implicated. <em>See generally United States v.

In this case, the record indicates that the PCRA court had initially been motivated by a concern with the sentencing disparity between Appellant and his co-defendants. As the PCRA court conceded, however, “[b]ecause a sentencing jury is required to look beyond the facts of the crime to the character and record of the individual defendant, different sentences for co-conspirators does not mean that one of the sentences is disproportionate.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Absent such proof, no basis existed upon which to award Appellant relief in the first instance. <em>See generally Commonwealth v.

The trial court is therefore required to “clarify for the jury that the specific intent to kill necessary for a conviction of first-degree murder must be found present in both the actual killer and the accomplice.” <em>Commonwealth v.

As indicated by the majority, however, the trial court instructed the jury concerning accomplice and conspirator liability, explaining that Appellant could be found guilty of a crime without finding that he personally engaged in either the conduct required or the commission of the crime, provided that he acted as an accomplice or conspirator. In addition, the court permitted the jury to infer that Appellant possessed the specific intent to kill necessary for first-degree murder based upon the use by one of his accomplices or co-conspirators of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victims’ bodies. These instructions permitted the jury to find Appellant guilty of first-degree murder based upon the mental states of his accomplices or co-conspirators.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

The evidence surrounding the murders indicates that Appellant and his co-defendants confronted the victims on a street corner after warning them about interfering with the drug trafficking conducted in that area by Appellant’s group. <em>See Speight, </em><a href="/pa/544/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="544 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="463538" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0451-01">544 Pa. at 458-59</a>, <a href="/pa/544/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="677 A.2d 317" data-case-ids="463538,7861134" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0451-01,/a2d/677/0317-01">677 A.2d at 320</a>.

Particularly given the involvement of deadly weapons and the manner of their use, it seems to me to be far more likely that the jury determined that the intended object of the conspiracy was its actual result, i.e., the killing of the victims. Thus, I conclude that Appellant has not satisfied the prejudice requirement for relief under the Post-Conviction Relief Act. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(ii).</p>
