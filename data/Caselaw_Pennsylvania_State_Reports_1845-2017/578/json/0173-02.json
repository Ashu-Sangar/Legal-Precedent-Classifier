Since the trial court accepted Petitioner\u2019s supplemental statement pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.1925 and addressed Petitioner\u2019s fourth issue in its Rule 1925 opinion (\u201cDid the trial court commit an error of law in determining that Appellant was a sexually violent predator when the Commonwealth did not present clear and convincing evidence to establish the classification of sexually violent predator?\u201d), the Superior Court\u2019s order is VACATED in relevant regard, and the matter is remanded for appellate consideration of such issue.\nJurisdiction is relinquished.",
