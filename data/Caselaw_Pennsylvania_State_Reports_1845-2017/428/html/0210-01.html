On that same day all evidence relating to degree of guilt was presented; however, before rendering its decision or passing sentence, the court decided to take the case under advisement. Appellant next came before the court on October 19, 1945. On that day, according to a copy of the official transcript, an opinion was read from the bench by the president judge. This opinion stated that the defendant was guilty of first degree murder, but that, because the facts so closely approximated second degree murder, the penalty would be fixed at life imprisonment, the lightest sentence permissible under Pennsylvania’s first degree murder statute. Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §701, as amended, 18 P.S. §4701. At the conclusion of this reading, the defendant was asked if he had anything to say before sentence was officially pronounced. When he replied that he did not, the court then read the traditional language used to sentence a man to life imprisonment. The record indicates that no other events took place at the October 19th proceeding. Appellant’s sole contention in this Post Conviction Hearing Act proceeding is that he had no counsel present with him on October 19, 1945, and that this constituted denial of due process.</p>

It then appears that, sua sponte, he amended the form to include a space for the specific attorneys desired. In this space appellant wrote the names of three lawyers. The court, however, refused to appoint any of the named attorneys, but instead appointed a voluntary defender to represent Johnson. Appellant immediately petitioned the court to have this defender withdrawn, on the ground that the entire voluntary defender system was ineffective and inadequate, and on the further ground that he was entitled, in a capital case, to have <em>two </em>attorneys of his own choice. The court accepted the defender’s voluntary withdrawal, but still refused to appoint the lawyers named in appellant’s post-conviction form. As a result, Johnson appeared in court without an attorney on the day of his evidentiary hearing.</p>

The Act of March 22, 1907, P. L. 31, §1, as amended, 19 P.S. §784 provides only that a person <em>“charged </em>with murder” and who cannot afford counsel is entitled to court appointed counsel “not <em>exceeding </em>two” to defend him. (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, not only is dual counsel not required by the statute, but even if it were, the language <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>clearly refers only to those individuals <em>charged </em>with murder. We fail to see how a man who has been in prison for twenty-two years, and who now brings a post-conviction proceeding can still be said to he “charged” with murder in the same manner as one who has not yet stood trial. Finally §12 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act, unlike the statute cited, supra, contains <em>no </em>mention of more than one lawyer, nor have any of the cases decided by this Court construing §12 required more than a single lawyer, including those involving petitioners who had originally been convicted of murder.</p>

    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[207,910,1159,964]]]'>We reach this conclusion employing the definition of waiver adopted for federal courts in <em>Johnson v.

Therefore, only the <em>Gideon </em>waiver standard seems appropriate.</p>

At the outset of his evidentiary hearing Johnson complained that he was appearing without counsel. To this the court replied: “You had a chance to have a <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>Voluntary Defender represent you. This was brought before the Court; the Court heard it, and said that you would accept the services of the Voluntary Defender or else proceed without counsel.” Although appellant contended that the court’s statement did not represent the true content of Judge Hagan’s order, there can be no doubt that from this point on Johnson in fact must have known that he could have <em>only </em>the services of a voluntary defender appointed by the court. Yet, in spite of this knowledge, just a few seconds later, when Judge Smith again offered Johnson the right to have a voluntary defender, appellant refused, claiming that defenders were worthless. The record of his evidentiary hearing shows clearly that appellant is an articulate, intelligent man. There can be no doubt that he knew of his right to have counsel appointed, knew also that he could not choose this lawyer himself, yet still decided to proceed in propria persona. It is of no moment that Johnson, at several points during the hearing, reiterated his request for counsel; for in each case he was given a chance to take a voluntary defender, but refused to do so.</p>

Johnson argues that on October 19, 1945, the day sentence was formally pronounced, he was unrepresented. Initially, the Commonwealth contends that this proceeding was so ministerial and formalistic that it was not such a critical stage as to require the presence of counsel. With this position we cannot agree. Although it may be true that in the present case nothing was said on appellant’s behalf at the October 19th proceeding, we would be loathe to hold that nothing of aid to the client <em>could </em>have been said by counsel. Perhaps just a few words, if spoken effectively enough, might have persuaded the court to reconsider its finding of murder in the first degree, particularly since the court realized that the facts <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>closely approximated second degree murder, and in fact suggested that appellant might be paroled at the end of twenty years. To say that this proceeding, the very last contact appellant had with the court before his cell door slammed shut, perhaps for life, is not a critical stage of the litigation, substantially affecting Johnson’s rights, is to completely ignore reality.</p>

Mr. Justice Marshall was quick to point out that the “special circumstances” aspect of <em>Betts </em>was overruled by <em>Gideon v.

He noted that although <em>Gideon </em>did not discuss aspects of <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>the criminal proceeding other than trial itself, nevertheless, with the “special circumstances” requirement completely stripped away, <em>Townsend, </em>which “illustrates the critical nature of sentencing in a criminal case . . . might well be considered to support by itself a holding that the right to counsel applies at sentencing.” <a href="/us/389/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="389 U.S. 128" data-case-ids="11335632" data-case-paths="/us/389/0128-01">389 U.S. at 134</a>, <a href="/us/389/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="389 U.S. 128" data-case-ids="11335632" data-case-paths="/us/389/0128-01">88 S.

As we read <em>Mempa, </em>this statement would surely constitute the broad “per se” holding suggested above were it not for later language in the opinion demonstrating that the <em>particular proceeding </em>there involved was a “critical stage”.

To support this contention, testimony of appellant’s original trial counsel was taken. Although the attorney was unable to recall the events, and thus could not say whether he was present, he did introduce, without objection, a copy of the October 19, 1945 record, as prepared and certified by the official stenographer. It appears that the original record was not available. This record recites at the very top of the first page the names of those present on the 19th. The list includes Johnson’s lawyer. In addition, the Commonwealth introduced a carbon copy of the court’s opinion which Johnson’s trial counsel claimed was handed to him in person by Judge Gordon, the presiding judge. This opinion did contain one notation that was not part of the carbon copy, but was obviously typed directly onto the page. That notation was the number “19” interposed between “October” and “1945.” It is the Commonwealth’s position that since this date was typed in at the time the opinion <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>was handed down, since Johnson’s lawyer remembered that it was given to him from the bench, and since there would have been no time subsequent to October 19, 1945 when Judge Gordon would have handed such a document to the lawyer, it therefore follows that the lawyer <em>was </em>in court on the day this opinion was read. It is readily apparent, both from the remarks made by the court at the hearing, and also from Judge Smith’s opinion, that the court chose to believe the 1945 record and disbelieve appellant’s contentions that no lawyer was present and that the record was prepared ahead of time as a mere formality. We see no reason to question this finding.</p>
    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.5",322,[223,1023,1164,1120]]]'>One further point, however, deserves mention. During his hearing, Johnson suggested that the court might call as a witness Judge Carroll, the only surviving member of the three judge court which convicted Johnson in. 1945. The court refused to call Judge Carroll, concluding that he could not possibly have remembered what happened. Although we cannot approve the court’s refusal to subpoena a witness simply because the hearing judge has pre-determined that the witness would be of no assistance, nevertheless, we feel there were other reasons here sufficient to sustain the court’s refusal to call Judge Carroll. Judge Smith chose to believe a clear record of the 1945 proceedings which indicate that Johnson’s attorney was present. Given such a record, sworn to be accurate by the official court stenographer, any personal recollection could properly be deemed irrelevant. Furthermore, the same stenographic notes relied upon by Judge Smith for his finding that the lawyer was present also indicate that only Judge Gordon sat at the time the opinion was' delivered.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
