In the Second Paragraph of her will she provided: “I give and bequeath <em>200 shares of my Smith, KUne &lt;&amp; French stock </em>to . . . St. Giles Church.” Could any language be clearer! In the same Paragraph of her will she gave either 200 shares or 100 shares of SKF stock to various relatives of hers and to a number of her friends, fourteen of them in all. These bequests totaled 2,400 shares, which was the total of SKF stock she owned at that time, and it is, as we shall see, principally on this totality that appellant bases its claim that the bequest to it was intended to be <em>a fraction </em>of all the SKF stock which the testatrix owned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">*</a>

The stock was split 20-for-l in 1947, and 2-for-l in 1950, and 3-for-l in 1954. It is only reasonable to assume that when she made her will in <em>1956, </em>she was familiar with the fact that her holdings of SKF stock had grown tremendously as a result of these stock splits and another stock split was quite possible if not likely. Even more important, on May 29, 1959, over three years after she had made her will and several months before she was declared incompetent, she had received additional SKF stock as a result of another stock split of 3-for-l, thus giving her a total of 6,000 shares at her death (see infra). Yet with all this <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>knowledge, <em>testatrice never changed her will </em>with respect to her gift of 200 shares of SKF stock to the Church, or any of her other specific gifts of SKF stock which she had made in the Second Paragraph of her will as aforesaid.</p>

For example, on August 2, 1956, only a few months after her will was executed, testatrix purchased 35 additional shares of SKF. If she had intended, as appellant claims, to give to appellant and to each Second Paragraph legatee a percentage or fraction of her total holdings in SKF stock, <em>which is contrary to the clear and specific language of her will, </em>why didn’t she change her will during the next two years! In September, <em>1958, </em>she sold 400 shares of SKF which then totaled 2,435; and in October, <em>1958, </em>she sold an additional 35 shares, leaving her 2,000 shares. This was fewer shares of SKF than she had bequeathed in her will to appellant and to each legatee. If she had intended, as appellant claims, to give to appellant and to each legatee <em>a percentage or fraction of </em>her total holdings in SKF stock, <em>which is contrary to the clear and specific language of her will, </em>why didn’t she change her will at these times? Nevertheless, after August 2, 1956, when her total holdings were more than 2,400 shares and after September, 1958, when her total holdings were less than 2,400 shares, she never changed her bequest to St. Giles Church of 200 shares of SKF stock, nor did she change any of her other bequests of SKF stock which were contained in the Second Paragraph of her will.</p>

At the time of the execution of her will she owned 2,400 shares of the capital stock of Smith, Kline &amp; French Laboratories. In the second paragraph of her will she bequeathed all of <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>these shares in 100 and 200 share lots to fourteen named persons, and 200 shares to her church (the appellant), thus disposing of her entire SKF holdings.</p>

On May 29, 1959 SKF stock split 3 for 1, increasing her holdings to 6,000 shares—this stock split did not increase the capital of SKF nor did it affect the total book value of any stockholder’s shares. Four months after this stock split Miss Greathead was hospitalized and less than two months later was adjudicated incompetent. The issue here presented is whether appellant-church is entitled to receive the fruits of the stock split, or, as the lower court decided, the additional 4,000 shares pass to the residuary legatees. I believe that the church is so entitled.</p>

To my mind that fact is strongly indicative of an intent to give each of the fifteen legatees the fraction of her holdings in SKF represented by the proportion each bequest bore to her total holdings. I do not see why the failure of testatrix to change the terms of her will in response to a purely formal alteration in the number of those shares by unilateral corporate action should be construed to indicate a change in such intent. Certainly, had SKF stock not split, this would be a simple case of ademption and each legatee under the second paragraph of testatrix’s will would be entitled to 5/6 of the number of shares left to him under the will. Corporate action, changing the form but not the substance of testatrix’s holdings, should not affect <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>a testator’s intended disposition. Furthermore, if SKF management had, instead of a stock split, undertaken what is commonly called a reverse stock-split (e.g., an exchange of three old shares for one new one), each legatee would surely still be entitled to have his bequest satisfied with these new shares. The result should be identical whether corporate action results in an increase or decrease in the number of shares held by a decedent.</p>

Moreover, the disposition of the lower court (now affirmed by an equally divided Court), which has the effect of distributing SKF shares to residuary legatees, seems to run' contrary to testatrix’s intent, since under the testatrix’s scheme of distribution viewed from the date of the execution of her will her SKF stock was to be left solely to legatees of specific bequests.</p>
