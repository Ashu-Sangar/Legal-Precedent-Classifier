However, our case law indicates that such is not the rule. See <em>Gill eland, Erie City, </em>and <em>Stone, </em>supra. Nor is it time that to escape the label of “speculative,” the condemnee must show that there are plans to convert the property to the desired use immediately or in the very near future.

Uses have been termed speculative, and hence not provable as the highest and best use, only in those instances where the condemnee sought a measure of damages that was in essence based on anticipated <em>profits </em>from a use not yet being made of the property. For example, in <em>Laureldale Cemetery Co. v. Reading Co., </em><a href="/pa/303/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="303 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="1130070" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0315-01">303 Pa. 315</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20372" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="154 A. 372">154 Atl. 372</a> (1931), relied upon both by the appellee and the court below, the plaintiff cemetery company unsuccessfully tried to show that its condemned land was being held for use as burial plots and that the measure of damages should be based upon the profits plaintiff could have earned <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>from the sale of these plots.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> This loss of profits measure is clearly distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Laureldale </em>the unimproved lots, qua lots, were worth no more simply because the plaintiff had the business acumen needed to operate a cemetery thereon. However, appellant water company has never claimed that its property should be valued on the basis of profits made from the operation of a reservoir. Nor has it claimed that its land should be valued as though a reservoir already existed on the tract. Instead it claims simply that the land itself is worth more than the $72,000 awarded below because it is physically suitable for a reservoir and because such a project is needed in the area.</p>

For even though the valuation of appellant’s property as a reservoir does not fail on the basis of its being a speculative use, nevertheless, in order to establish a reservoir as the highest and best use, the water company must show that a reservoir is needed in the area. <em>A. D. Graham &amp; Co., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm., </em><a href="/pa/347/0622-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="347 Pa. 622" data-case-ids="1217386" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0622-01">347 Pa. 622</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20A.2d%2022" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="33 A.2d 22">33 A. 2d 22</a> (1943). On its face this hurdle may <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>appear somewhat similar to the speculative use issue, insofar as both bear ultimately on the financial success or failure of the suggested venture. Procedurally, however, they are quite different. If in fact it is determined that the condemnee is trying to prove anticipated profits, the court may quite properly exclude such testimony. However, since the condemnee <em>must </em>show that some demand exists in the area for the use sought to be established, far from excluding testimony on this issue as was done below,® the court is under a duty to admit it. Clearly one owning a flat strip in Heath Valley may show that the property is physically suited for a race track or a parking lot. But, without proof of need for such a structure <em>in that area, </em>it would be folly to hold that such is the highest and best use.</p>
    <p id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[135,1142,1153,857]],["BL_186.1",186,[218,326,1163,870]]]'>There are then two requirements, and only two, for proving highest and best use. First, the condemnee must show the physical adaptability of the land to such a use, and second it must be demonstrated that this use is needed in the area. This second test, however, does not require that the condemnee himself convert the land to its highest and best use. See, e.g., <em>Wadsworth v. Manufacturer’s Water Co., </em><a href="/pa/256/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="256 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="1030713" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0106-01">256 Pa. 106</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.%20577" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="100 A. 577">100 Atl. 577</a> (1917); <em>Brown v.

Unlike the water company here, in each of these cases the original land owner never intended to construct a reservoir. In fact, were it not for the condemnation there would probably never have been a reservoir at that spot. Nevertheless, in each case the landowner was <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>permitted to show that the highest and best use for the property was as a reservoir site.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Of course, even if the need is present, if the land <em>at the time of the condemnation </em>is not yet physically suited for the claimed best use, the condemnee will not prevail. For example, in <em>Bitting v. Philadelphia Suburban Water Co., </em>73 Montg. Co. L. Rep. 235 (1956), the condemnee-farmer could not establish a reservoir as the highest and best use, in spite of the condemnation by a water company, since his land, unlike the properties in <em>Wadsworth, Brown </em>and <em>Gearhart, </em>supra, had no natural water or water basin on it at the time of the condemnation. Thus, by analogy, appellant could not, nor does it try, to argue that its property should be valued as a turnpike right of way. In its present condition the land is suitable for a reservoir, not a road.</p>

    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[138,698,1152,1228]]]'>However, in spite of this settled rule, appellant seeks a somewhat unusual form of relief. If possible, the water company would like to be able to purchase another tract suitable for reservoir purposes, or in the alternative, to erect a retaining wall on their existing tract which would enable them to construct a reservoir of the same size as that originally planned. In view of the somewhat unique circumstances of this case, we feel that appellant’s prayer Is not without merit. The water company is a public utility with monopolistic privileges within its own territory. Because of this, there simply does not exist a market, in the classic sense, for reservoir property. It is not traded between water companies. Furthermore, as a public utility, appellant has not only the privilege, but the duty, to supply its area with an adequate amount of water.

Moreover, it concedes, as it must, that if the situation were reversed and the same land was condemned by the water utility, the private owner or cohdemnee could not collect on the basis that the land was adaptable to reservoir use unless he could also establish that a demand for private reservoirs exists to give the land market value for that use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Why, then, is a different rule applied in this ease?</p>
    <p id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[207,1356,1159,530]]]'>The only reason suggested by the majority is that the utility has a duty to supply adequate water service in the area. It seems apparent, however, that the duty is part of the price that the utility pays for its exclusive franchise. It is a duty assumed in return for a monopoly on public water services at rates designed to give the utility a fair return on its investment. Why, then, should a public utility be entitled to more on condemnation than anyone else because of a duty it is otherwise paid to perform.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

      <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>Let there be no mistake: it is the utility and its owners not the utility’s customers, who would benefit from a payment in excess of market value. Water rates will be no lower because the utility receives a special benefit and will be no higher if it does not. Assuming that the condemned site is considered in rate-making,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> the gain resulting from its condemnation is a nonrecurring income item that will not be included in the company’s “operating revenues,” used in rate-making by the P.U.C. to calculate the utility’s return on its investment. If the company buys a substitute site or restores the partly condemned site to its original capacity, its investment, used in rate-making by the P.U.C. to determine what revenue is reasonable, will be no less because it is traceable to condemnation damages.
