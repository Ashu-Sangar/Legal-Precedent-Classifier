    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[215,1015,1159,1282]]]'>On Monday, January 2, 1967, the dead body of Albert Yoithofer was found in a dry creek bed near a secluded dead-end road outside of Carmichaels, Pennsylvania. The head was covered with a mass of congealed blood coming from a stellate wound of the scalp on the top rear of the head. The skull had suffered a compound fracture and was partially imbedded in the brain. The sagittal sinus vein was ruptured, leading to profuse bleeding. The body was covered with bruises and the second bone of the middle finger of the left hand was broken. The trousers and underpants were down at the ankles with the lower part of the body exposed. The coat or outside jacket was pulled up underneath the armpits and over the head. An eighty foot long trail of blood, brush burns on the buttocks of the body, and fibers of cloth on a wire fence indicated that Voithofer had been dragged over the fence to the creek from a nearby road where his abandoned automobile was found and had been seen parked since early evening of the previous Saturday, December 31, 1966. The weapon used to inflict the injury to the head could not be found in the vicinity. The victim’s empty wallet was discovered on the road some thirty feet from his automobile.</p>

      <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>To establish appellant’s connection with the crime, the Commonwealth relied at trial upon admissions he made to relatives whom he visited shortly after the homicide. At trial Lawrence admitted the killing, but plead self-defense or excusable homicide.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b295-4" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[164,582,1150,151]]]'>From Lawrence’s admissions following the occurrence and his testimony at trial, the following pertinent facts appear:</p>
    <p id="b295-5" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[162,746,1153,686]]]'>Lawrence and the deceased were complete strangers until they met at a bar in Carmichaels at about noon on Saturday, December 31, 1966. Following some drinking, the deceased made an immoral reference to Lawrence’s girl friend and a heated argument ensued. Later the parties made up and at about 4:40 p.m. Yoithofer drove Lawrence to his home about three miles outside of town, where Lawrence lived alone as a tenant farmer. On the way Yoithofer proposed that Lawrence commit an act of sodomy upon him. Lawrence refused. When Lawrence arrived at his destination and left the automobile, Yoithofer grabbed him, but he broke loose and went about his work around the farm.</p>
    <p id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.7",295,[159,1452,1152,472]],["BL_296.1",296,[210,316,1157,205]]]'>Yoithofer then drove back to town, but about one-half hour later returned to the Lawrence place, suggested they forget their differences, take a ride and continue their drinking. Lawrence agreed and entered the automobile. Instead of driving to a bar, as suggested, Yoithofer drove to the secluded spot, described before, stopped the automobile and again proposed that Lawrence commit an act of sodomy. Lawrence jumped out of the automobile and went to the rear thereof <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>where the parties engaged in a violent fight. Lawrence was fifteen years younger than Voithofer and about forty pounds lighter in weight. Both were in good physical condition.</p>
    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[208,534,1158,521]]]'>Voithofer first grabbed Lawrence around the throat and the latter kicked him in the crotch to break the hold. Punches were exchanged and Voithofer was knocked to the ground. As he came up in a crouching position as if to rush Lawrence, the latter picked up “a stick” and hit him over the head with sufficient force to render him unconscious. Lawrence then dragged Voithofer, unconscious but still alive, from the roadway to the creek bed eighty feet away and left the scene.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[207,1077,1158,314]]]'>Lawrence then hitchhiked to his sister’s home three miles away and told about being in a fight. No one was informed of Voithofer’s plight. Evidence was also introduced to show that whereas Lawrence was broke a few hours before the fatal fight, immediately thereafter he was seen in possession of at least eight dollars.</p>

The sentence of ten to twenty years at separate and solitary confinement is within the range of penalties provided for second degree murder by the Act of December 1, 1959, P. L. 1621, 18 P.S. §4701. No reason is suggested to show that the sentence imposed was undeserved except that the district attorney prior to trial was willing to accept a guilty plea to voluntary manslaughter, which carries a lighter penalty. This is irrelevant to the question of whether the trial judge imposed a proper sentence. The court is not bound by the actions of the district attorney in this respect. We find nothing in the record to warrant our interference with the sentence imposed.</p>
