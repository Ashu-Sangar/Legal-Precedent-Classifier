      <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>The Superior Court dissenters carefully summarized the Commonwealth’s evidence <em>(Commonwealth v.

Carlin, the driver, observed a Bambler automobile about one car length in front of them which had stopped to let out one of its occupants, later identified as William A. Miller. As Miller was getting out of the right side of the car, Bacino saw a weapon fall to the ground and said to Carlin, ‘That man dropped a gun, let us check them.’ Miller picked up the gun and threw it on the back seat of the car. The officers approached on foot—Bacino on the right side and Carlin on the left. Bacino asked Miller, ‘What did you throw in the back seat?’ Miller did not reply. Bacino looked into the back seat and saw a .32 automatic pistol.</p>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.5",388,[205,1346,1157,151]]]'>“Carlin ordered the occupants—Joseph L. Giambi [the driver] and appellant—out of the car. They were searched, but no weapons were found.</p>
    <p id="b388-5" data-blocks='[["BL_388.6",388,[204,1509,1158,313]]]'>“Bacino later noticed a second gun—a .22 Derringer—partially concealed under the front seat on the passenger side. After securing a warrant for the car, a subsequent search revealed a shotgun under the hood. Appellant was tried jointly with Giambi and neither testified nor presented evidence on their behalf.”</p>

See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Whitman, </em><a href="/pa-super/199/0631-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="199 Pa.

Two elements are essential to a finding of joint possession : the power of control over the weapon and the intention to exercise this control. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Thurman, </em><a href="/pa-super/167/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="167 Pa. Super. 642" data-case-ids="470552" data-case-paths="/pa-super/167/0642-01">167 Pa.

Appellant concedes that the evidence was <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>sufficient to sustain a finding of power of control, but insists that, under the doctrine of <em>Whitman, </em>the Commonwealth has failed to demonstrate any knowledge on his part of the presence of the weapons, an element which is a necessary predicate to a finding of intention to exercise control.</p>
    <p id="b389-3" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[141,634,1154,695]]]'>Although the trial judge based his finding of guilt in great measure upon the fact that Townsend was sitting in the front seat (and thus the weapon partially concealed under the front seat would have been between Townsend’s legs), there is absolutely no evidence of record indicating where Townsend was sitting. The totality of the Commonwealth’s evidence on this point is contained in the following dialogue between the defense attorney and Officer Bacino:<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> “Q. When you went up to the automobile, isn’t it a fact that Townsend was sitting in the middle of the automobile? A. I cannot recall that. Q. Giambi was driving, is that correct? A. Yes.”</p>

Each of these decisions is clearly distinguishable. In <em>Pinohney </em>and <em>Thurman </em>both defendants stated to the arresting officers that they were involved in offenses utilizing the items of which they were found in possession. Such a statement was never made by Townsend. Whitman was convicted of possession of burglary tools and possession of an unlicensed weapon. The crucial distinction between Whitman’s conviction and that of Townsend is the very fact upon which the trial judge erroneously relied—Whitman <em>was </em>sitting in the passenger’s seat under which two weapons were found.</p>
    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[211,1179,1161,858]]]'>Hooe, according to the Commonwealth’s brief, is its strongest case. Two narcotics officers observed Hooe and one Heflin, known narcotics users, in an automobile driven by Heflin. The’ officers were apparently recognized and a chase ensued during which one of the officers observed Hooe reach down and disappear from sight; a moment later a white envelope was ejected from the car window. The envelope contained heroin. Hooe was later apprehended in Alabama. Two distinguishing circumstances are thus present—Hooe’s actions which gave rise to the permissible inference that he had ejected the envelope, and his subsequent flight. Not only was Townsend completely cooperative with the arresting officers, but there is not a shred of testimony beyond his mere presence to indicate that he was in any way associated with the weapons found.</p>

Given the fact that a Rambler is a compact car, Miller’s position could just as easily have been a result of alighting from the front seat.</p>
