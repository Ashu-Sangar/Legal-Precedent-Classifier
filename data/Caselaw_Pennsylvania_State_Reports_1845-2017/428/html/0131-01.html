Albeit dictum, <em>Bosurgi </em>contains perhaps the best statement governing a defendant’s right to appeal a pretrial refusal to suppress evidence (<a href="/pa/411/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="411 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1885971" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0056-01">411 Pa. at 64</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20304" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="190 A.2d 304">190 A. 2d at 308-09</a>) : “The right of appeal by a defendant stands upon an entirely different footing. The denial of a defendant’s motion for the suppression of evidence does not deprive a defendant of an appellate review of the validity of that order. At trial, the defendant still has full opportunity to object to the introduction into evidence of the allegedly improper evidence and, in the event of his conviction, he will then have an opportunity to secure an appellate evaluation of the propriety and admissibility of such evidence. Therefore, unlike the Commonwealth, an adverse pretrial disposition of a motion to suppress evidence does not deprive the defendant of his only opportunity for appellate review. Under such circumstances, the element of finality, which is the basis of appealability, is lacking in an order denying suppression and the defendant should have no right of appeal from such order.”</p>

Thus, if the Commonwealth is deprived of the use of significant evidence by an erroneous pretrial suppression decision, unless an appeal from that order is permitted <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>this pretrial error could not be corrected. The defendant, however, may challenge the decision not to suppress in an appeal from his conviction. Since appellant can thus obtain relief from an erroneous pretrial decision, his present: appeal will not be entertained.</p>

Article I, §14 of our state constitution provides that “[a] 11 prisoners shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offenses when the proof is evident or presumption great, . . .”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Contending that his statement is the only evidence the Commonwealth possesses sufficient to meet this constitutional standard, appellant insists that unless he can now attack the suppression hearing his right to bail will be lost. The fallacy in this argument is appellant’s assumption that access to the appellate process is a necessary predicate to preservation of his rights. Not only is the right of appeal a matter which is peculiarly within the province of the state courts, see <em>Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, </em>supra at 61, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20304" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="190 A.2d 304">190 A. 2d at 307</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> but a state could abolish all appellate courts without impinging upon constitutional rights.

    <p id="b240-4" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[215,478,1157,640]]]'>In the alternative, appellant contends that the prohibition contained in Rule 324 against relitigating at trial the admissibility of his statement is an unconstitutional restriction of his right to have a jury determine his guilt under all the evidence. If appellant is correct, then his argument that the “final” decision below is now appealable loses all force for he would be able to relitigate the admissibility of his statements. However, since we have determined to quash this appeal and since this argument may be presented to the trial court, we express no view as to the merits of appellant’s contention.</p>
