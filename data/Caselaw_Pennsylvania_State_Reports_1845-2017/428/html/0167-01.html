Appellant was tried, convicted, and sentenced in the United States District Court in Newark, New Jersey in January, 1965, and was committed to the custody of the Attorney General of the United States.

He has left the jurisdiction of the demanding state and is found in the territory of another state whence he refuses to return to satisfy the charges made against him.

There, it is true that petitioner was surrendered merely for the purpose of trial, not for serving a sentence, and that this was specifically authorized by statute.

There petitioner was convicted in a state court of Ohio and sentenced to the Ohio Penitentiary in November, 1957. While his case was on appeal, he was out on bail. While his appeal was still pending, he was indicted by a federal grand jury and in September, 1958, convicted and sentenced to the Federal Penitentiary at Lewisburg. While petitioner was awaiting transportation to Lewisburg, the Ohio authorities placed a detainer on him. In October of 1958, petitioner was committed to Lewisburg where he remained until October of 1961 when he was paroled. Thereupon, he was returned to Ohio where the court ordered into execution the sentence imposed on petitioner in 1957. He then brought the habeas corpus petition. The court held, in language directly apposite to the instant case: “The release by the state of one in its custody or under sentence by it to the federal government to serve a subsequently imposed federal sentence does not constitute a waiver by the state to carry into execution its previously imposed sentence after the termination of the federal sentence.</p>

The holding in abeyance of the sentence pending satisfaction by the petitioner of the federal penalty and the mere delay in execution of the Ohio sentence gave no right to the petitioner to a discharge therefrom. . . . The power and right to punish the violator of its laws is not lost by a state because it consents to waive the infliction of punishment pending punishment by another state of the same criminal for the violation of its laws. . .</p>

The last-cited case points out that although <em>People ex rel. Barrett v. Bartley </em>spoke vaguely of violating the constitutional rights of the accused by his temporary relinquishment, neither that case nor any other case says what those rights are. The <em>Grady </em>court concluded, correctly it seems, that no rights had been violated. The Ohio court in <em>Guerrieri v. Maxwell, </em>supra, at 44 and 46, summed up well: “Therefore, where one has placed himself in the position of being wanted at the same time by two different sovereigns for the violation of penal statutes of both, it is a matter for the sovereigns to determine which shall first exact punishment from the offender, and not the offender. Under such circumstances it is the interested sovereigns who make the determination and the offender cannot complain of the order of his trials or punishment for such offenses. . . . Petitioner has had full and complete due process of law. He was properly indicted by a valid indictment, represented by counsel and tried and convicted by a jury. He has exhausted his state remedies of appeal. More he is not guaranteed by the Constitution. He is seeking in this action to circumvent his conviction and escape the penalty of his crime by attempting to use as a shield the subsequent action of the federal government of interposing its penalty before that of the state. This he cannot do. He owed <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>a debt to two different sovereigns. Under onr law these debts must be paid, and it is not up to tbe accused to determine in what order they should be paid.”</p>

The court below relied at least in part on the second paragraph of §5 of that Act providing that: “The Governor of this State <em>may </em>also surrender on demand of the executive authority of any other state any person in this State who is charged . . . with having violated the laws of the state whose executive authority is making the demand, even though such person left the demanding state involuntarily.” (Emphasis added) <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>Appellant argues that it would be improper to permit his extradition under §5 since that section, like §6 (See <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

The Governor never had the opportunity to exercise his discretion in the instant case because the warrant of the Governor of New Jersey recited that petitioner had fled from the justice of New Jersey and had taken refuge in Pennsylvania. Moreover, appellant points out that the Governor of Pennsylvania will never have the opportunity to exercise his discretion in the case of involuntary departures as provided in §5 because §3 requires that the warrant, except in cases under §6 (extradition of persons not present in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the crime) allege that the person sought “fled” from the demanding state.</p>
