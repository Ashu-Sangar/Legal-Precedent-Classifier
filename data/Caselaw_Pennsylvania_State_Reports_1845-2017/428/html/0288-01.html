    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.8",394,[227,421,1155,263]]]'>The plaintiff in this case brought a suit in trespass charging the defendant, Dardanell Press, and others, with libel. The defendants filed preliminary objections which were sustained by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, and the plaintiff appealed.</p>
    <p id="b394-6" data-blocks='[["BL_394.9",394,[222,693,1160,752]]]'>The plaintiff, Mrs. Phyllis T. Kernick, is the elected auditor of the township of Penn Hills, and functions as such. It appears that some time in April, 1966, Mrs. Kernick had a conversation with one of the township commissioners, George Taylor, III, who allegedly said to Mrs. Kernick that the commissioners would build a road into her property if she went “easy on the audit.” At a meeting of the commissioners on June 7, 1966, Mrs. Kernick referred to this asserted conversation. At a subsequent meeting of the commissioners on July 11, 1966, Mrs. Kernick again commented on the colloquy with Taylor who now explained that tvhatever he had said to Mrs. Kernick was spoken in jest.</p>
    <p id="b394-7" data-blocks='[["BL_394.10",394,[222,1457,1158,476]]]'>Nevertheless, three of the board of commissioners, Charles'• Williams,. Alfred C. Ireland and Wm. Tobay, asked the District Attorney of Allegheny County to investigate into Mrs. Kerniek’s charges to ascertain if Commissioner Taylor had conducted himself in such fashion as to warrant initiation of criminal prosecution. The district attorney, after an appropriate investigation, reported that he found nothing to justify criminal proceedings against Taylor.</p>
    <p id="b394-8" data-blocks='[["BL_394.11",394,[222,1944,1156,372]],["BL_395.1",395,[145,300,1154,320]]]'>On August 28, 1966, the three named commissioners issued a statement stating that Mrs. Kernick had “failed to substantiate her outrageous accusation.” They said further that her remarks had “carefully calculated to disparage the Township and its officials,” that her utterances cost the taxpayers money in order to conduct an investigation of her charges, “even though <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>they consistently turn out to be baseless,” that her “peculiar actions in suppressing the facts” were unexplained, that she owed the township “an explanation of her actions,” and that finally, “we hope that in the future Mrs. Kernick will conduct herself in a manner befitting an elected public official.”</p>
    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[148,630,1151,534]]]'>A newspaper entitled “The Progress” and published by the Dardanell Press, printed the commissioners’ statement, as well as a story on the district attorney’s investigation. The plaintiff felt herself injured and brought suit in libel against the owners of the newspapers, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, and the three named commissioners. As already stated, the court of common pleas sustained the preliminary objections filed by the defendants, declaring that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action.</p>
    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.6",395,[143,1175,1156,855]]]'>It appears that Mrs. Kernick did not know of former President Harry S. Truman’s oft-quoted remark that “If you can’t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.” The statement issued by the commissioners may have caused the political pot to boil in Penn Hills township, but it is not apparent that it boiled at such temperature that it blew off the top and scalded Mrs. Kernick, or even burned her to any traumatic extent. The person who is the target of unkind words is bound to feel hurt, but he or she often exaggerates in his or her mind the extent of the damage done to his or her reputation in the public mind. The public has many things to think and talk about, and it does not linger on a debate which may occur at a township commissioners’ meeting or on a statement issued by commissioners in the heat of an altercation.</p>
    <p id="b395-6" data-blocks='[["BL_395.7",395,[147,2049,1150,313]],["BL_396.1",396,[212,307,1156,318]]]'>Whatever sensation the commissioners’ statement may have caused could not have endured for any appreciable period. It could be compared to the ripples in the water caused by the passing of a rowboat, which rippling quickly tranquilizes after the dipping oars have ceased their momentary agitation. A minute <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>later, there is nothing written in the water to suggest what had blithely passed over its serene surface. Thus, had it not been for Mrs. Kerniek’s lawsuit, it is to be doubted whether there would be many in Penn Hills township who could fish out of the pools of their memory the details of the Kernick-Commissioners dispute.</p>
    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[208,635,1160,859]]]'>Mrs. Kernick felt herself offended by the assertion that she should “conduct herself in a manner befitting an elected public official.” What <em>is </em>the manner befitting public officials? No Emily Post has laid down a code of manners for elected public officials. And is there a different code for <em>appointed </em>public officials? If there is one field that is as empty as a football gridiron after the teams have left and the tumult has died away, it is the field of manners befitting public officials. There is no specified code on this subject, although, obviously, there are certain rules built up over the years indicating what is generally proper and improper in public officialdom. The commissioners, however, in no way indicated how, or if at all, Mrs. Kernick had deviated from any implied code of propriety.</p>

It could have been humor on the oblique, but there is some rationalization to support his non-scintillating bon mot, since the audit Mrs. Kernick was conducting was that of 1965 and Taylor was not a commissioner in 1965. Thus, he had nothing to hide by building a road over it.</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.6",397,[140,1017,1155,859]]]'>If Taylor was joking, he is not the first person who failed to heed the admonition of Cicero, that “one should be moderate in his jests.” To tell a fiscal officer to wear dark glasses when checking returns is to spring a joke that can backfire. It would appear that the attorney for the plaintiff has, himself, indulged in some whimsical badinage when he says in his brief that the defendants’ use of the word “Auditor,” was “a deliberate play on words.” He suggests that the public did not know whether the statement referred to Mrs. Kernick as an auditor, that is one who listens, or an auditor, one who examines accounts. Obviously, the statement was referring to Mrs. Kernick’s official position as auditor of Penn Hills township, and not as a listener to the poor jokes related by Commissioner Taylor.</p>
    <p id="b397-6" data-blocks='[["BL_397.7",397,[143,1889,1152,413]]]'>Even so, Mrs. Kernick never explained why, if she regarded Taylor’s alleged quips as an attempt to improperly influence her in her work, she waited from April to June to inform the board of township commissioners of Taylor’s alleged whisperings of a highway under the Christmas tree of promise, if she looked at the ceiling while auditing the <em>Commissioners’ </em>books of 1965.</p>

Since the present appeal comes to us from the lower court’s sustaining of defendant’s preliminary objections, we must accept, as true, all the factual allegations in plaintiff’s complaint.

The misconduct alleged by the libel must really be in derogation of the oath of office taken by the public officer.” <a href="/f2d/126/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="126 F.2d 53" data-case-ids="1081681" data-case-paths="/f2d/126/0053-01">126 F. 2d at 54-55</a>.

The article is critical, but it does not even come close to charging plaintiff with such acts as would lead to her removal from office. As this Court said in <em>Bogash v. Elkins, </em><a href="/pa/405/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="405 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1303546" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0437-01">405 Pa. 437</a>, 440, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%20677" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="176 A.2d 677">176 A. 2d 677</a>, 679 (1962) : “Statements which represent differences of opinion or are annoying or embarrassing, are, without more, not libelous.” Plaintiff, however, alleges that there is “more” here. Her complaint invokes the theory of innuendo whereby a seemingly innocuous remark can become libelous because of certain inferences that the public would naturally draw from it. Specifically, she claims that a reader of this article would as<a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>sume that the criticism was actually directed against her performance as a township auditor, rather than against her over-suspicious nature. I cannot agree that such an inference is reasonable. Even a cursory reading of this article would convince any reader that the attack was <em>not </em>aimed at plaintiff’s performance of her official duties as auditor. An innuendo must be warranted, justified and supported by the publication. <em>Bogash v. Elkins, </em>supra; <em>Sarkees v. Warner-West Corp., </em><a href="/pa/349/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="349 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="459115" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0365-01">349 Pa. 365</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20544" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="37 A.2d 544">37 A. 2d 544</a> (1944). This one is not.</p>
    <p id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[141,851,1151,209]]]'>As Mr. Chief Justice Maxey said in <em>McAndrew v.
