While, of course, everybody should foresee on Saturday that he would need to eat on Sunday, and therefore should lay in a supply of provisions for the morrow, yet circumstances could prevent a realization of that anticipation and one should not be subjected to the hardship of fasting when, without any defilement of the pure Sabbath atmosphere, he could still obtain the required provender to sustain him over the weekend. Accordingly, the Legislature, in the Act of 1961, declared that: “This section shall not apply to any retail establishment employing less than ten persons or to any retail establishment where fresh meats, produce and groceries are offered or sold by the proprietor or members of his immediate family or employing less than ten persons nor shall it apply to any retail establishment where food is prepared on the premises for human consumption.”</p>

It wheels into play a battery of decisions to support this position—-all so unnecessarily. Obviously, if a statute is printed in Chinese or is proclaimed in such badly expressed English that one cannot learn from it what is permitted and what is prohibited, it cannot be enforced. Instead of emphasizing the obvious, the plaintiff should show wherein the statute is vague. It attempts to do this by aiming its artillery of argumentation against the three exceptions in the Act, but its aiming is faulty because it does not set its sights in accordance with the criteria laid down in the Statutory Construction Act (May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, §51, 46 P.S. §551), which declares that in interpreting a law one must take into consideration, inter alia, “(1) the occasion and necessity for the law; (2) the circumstances under which it was enacted; (3) the mischief to be remedied; (4) the object to be attained; (5) the former law, if any, including other laws upon the same or similar subjects; (6) the consequences of a particular interpretation, (7) the contemporaneous legislative history . . .”</p>

It is a branch grafted to the original tree, and who can determine the nature of the resulting fruit without studying the trunk and the roots of the original plant? The Act of 1961, as already stated, is an amendment of the Act of 1939, which is but a descendant of the original Act of 1794, which declared that: “If any person shall do or perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever on the Lord’s day, commonly called Sunday, works of necessity and charity only excepted, or shall use or practice any unlawful game, hunting, shooting, sport, or diversion whatsoever, on the same day, and be convicted thereof, every such person, so offending, shall, for every such offence, forfeit and pay four dollars, fco be levied by distress; or in case he or she shall refuse or neglect to pay the said sum, or goods and chattels cannot be found, whereof to levy the same by distress, he or she shall suffer six days imprisonment in the house of correction of the proper county: Provided, always, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit the dressing of victuals in private families, bake-houses, lodging-houses, inns, and other houses of entertainment, for the use of sojourners, travellers, or strangers, or to hinder watermen from landing their passengers, or ferrymen from carrying over the water travellers, or persons removing with their families, on the Lord’s day, commonly called Sunday, nor to the delivery of milk, or the necessaries of life, before nine of the clock in the forenoon, nor after five of the clock in the afternoon, of the same day.”</p>

William Biaekstone, in his immortal Commentaries, declared: “the keeping one day in the seven holy, as a time of relaxation and refreshment as well as for public worship, is of admirable service to a state, considered merely as a civil institution. It humanizes by the help of conversation and society, the manners of the lower classes, which would otherwise degenerate into a sordid ferocity and savage selfishness of spirit; it enables the industrious workman to pursue his occupation in the ensuing week with health and cheerfulness; it imprints on the minds of the people that sense of their duty to God so necessary to make them good citizens, but which yet would be worn out and defaced by an unremitted continuance of labor, without any stated times of recalling them to the worship of their Maker.” (4 Bl.

The objectives of the Act of 1794 were to secure: “the observance of a day of rest for the community, thereby enabling every one to worship according to the dictates of his conscience, without distraction, and without disturbance, and thus giving a check to vice and immorality.” <em>(Sparhawk v.

As churchgoers have the right to be saved from the firing of cannon or the beating of drums outside their houses of worship on Sunday, so also are householders protected under the laws of the Commonwealth from turbulences generated by excessive population movement attendant on business enterprises not falling within the exceptions listed in the Sunday Closing Laws. All the legislation on this subject departs from the premise that Sunday is a day different from the other days.

These statutes were not designed to compel men to go to church, or to worship God in any manner inconsistent with pergonal preferences, but to compel a cessation of those employments which are calculated to interfere with the rights of those who chose to assemble for public worship. The day was set apart for a purpose, and the penal enactments guard it, but they leave every man free to use it for the purpose or not. If he wish to use it for the purpose designed, the law protects him from the annoyance of others—if he do not, it restrains him from annoying those who do so use it.”</p>
    <p id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.7",133,[116,1523,1155,695]]]'>There is no merit to the contention that Sunday closing laws impinge on the First Amendment to the U. S.

The founders of our government and the drafters of our laws always held high in their minds and close to their hearts the sanctity of the Sabbath as they enacted legislation with reference thereto. Thus, it would be a violation of the First Amendment to compel people, who accept Sunday as a religious day, to work on that day.</p>

Say what one will, man is more disposed to do good on Sunday than he is throughout the week. Less crimes are committed on the Sabbath Day than on week days. The whole body of the people seems to recognize on Sunday a general truce in the commercial, industrial and professional arena which might be regarded quite extraordinary during the week.

Upon no subject is there such a concurrence of opinion, among philosophers, moralists and statesmen of all nations, as on the necessity of periodical cessations from labor.

It is a truism, which can be attested to by anyone who has experienced the contrast, that the repose of Sunday is more restful and salubrious to him than inactivity on a weekday. The absence of work on a weekday means merely the shutting down of the human machine for a day, but the leisure of a Sunday carries with it the spirituality which has been gained through centuries of dedication to spirituality.</p>

It is common knowledge that, despite the ever-swelling dimensions of modern metropolises, a high percentage of the Commonwealth’s population still lives in small towns or semi-rural com.munities, where restaurants and hotels are not as plentiful as lamp posts. In the absence of those modern dining facilities, the non-urban people turn to what has, for the last century or two, been the all-provider, as a hen with her chicks, for the village, hamlet, and town, namely, the corner grocery store. Thus, the General Assembly legislated into permanent Sunday existehce this purely American institution. To prevent, however, that the little shop should take on a size and shape which would turn it into something more than the proverbial corner grocery store, the Legislature placed a limit of 9 persons on the number who could be employed in the store.</p>

Thus, although Mr. Clark knew that Mr. Bertera, as president of Bertera’s Hopewell Foodland, Inc., was actually involved in the case pending before the Supreme Court, he instituted criminal proceedings against Bertera.

On May 18, 1964, there was presented to the Supreme Court, Middle District (in Harrisburg), a motion for a temporary restraining order on behalf of a certain Stanton A. Berkowitz. In some manner not apparent in the record the petition got to Justice Cohen who lives in York, Pennsylvania. Justice Cohen entertained jurisdiction at once. He did not grant a rule to show cause, he did not consult a single member of <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>the Court, he did not give the respondent an opportunity to file an answer. Justice Cohen, without batting an eye or turning a page of the Rules of Civil Procedure, dipped his pen into the inkwell and, in a bold hand which would have done credit to the signature of John Hancock, signed the order attached to the petition. What did this order command? This was not a simple prohibition on a justice of the peace, who, minor though he may be, is still part of the State’s judiciary. Justice Cohen projected his authority into a wholly different department of the State, the Executive Department.</p>

Peremptorily he told the Secretary of Health that he could not fire one of his employees, the Stanton A. Berkowitz above mentioned. It was possible that the Secretary of Health wished to fire Berkowitz because he believed Berkowitz was incompetent to operate the Henry R. Landis State Hospital, of which he was institutional business manager. There was nothing in the motion for temporary restraining order which excluded the possibility that Berkowitz’s presence in the hospital was perilous to the well-being of the sick patients. Justice Cohen nevertheless imperiously ordered the Secretary of Health not to fire Berkowitz.</p>

Justice Cohen had no way of determining whether the dismissal was due to politics or a plague.</p>

Anyhow, in that awkwardly entitled Opinion Vacating Decree, Justice Cohen says in footnote No. 1.: “Rule 235 of the Pa. R. C. P. requires notice to the Attorney General when an Act of Assembly is alleged to be unconstitutional and the Commonwealth is not a Party. The record does not disclose that Rule 235 was complied with.

Why, we might ask, did the Legislature resort to an “overkill” statute, when it was concerned with an evil perpetrated only by the big-volume operators? To me the answer is clear. It is one thing to say, as the Supreme Court in <em>Two Guys </em>did say, that it is “within the power of the legislature to have concluded that these businesses [discount department stores] were particularly disrupting the intended atmosphere of the day because of the great volume of motor traffic attracted, the danger of their competitors also opening on Sunday and their large number of employees.” 366 U.S. at 591, <a href="/us/366/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="366 U.S. 582" data-case-ids="1285544" data-case-paths="/us/366/0582-01">81 S.

For the Legislature to decide that supermarkets, as well as discount stores, disrupt the desired Sunday atmosphere, is to legislate within the rationale of <em>Two Guys. </em>Yet, when the statute exempts the corner grocery store from its prohibition, we inject the element of economic discrimination into our Sunday closing law, and thus create an entirely different situation from that faced by the Supreme Court in <em>Two Guys.</em>

In sustaining this act, Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated: “Here again, it would seem that a legislature could reasonably find that these commodities, necessary for the health and recreation of its citizens, should only be sold on Sunday by those vendors at the locations where the commodities are most likely to be immediately put to use.” 366 IJ.S. at 427-28, 81 S.

But, the use of these facilities might be diminished if the public could not purchase, on the spot, the many and varied commodities needed to make the day of rest indeed restful. Furthermore, at best a minimal increase in traffic would result from the opening of a beachfront sundry store, since even the laziest of bathers would hardly use his car to travel from beach blanket to counter. On the other hand, if <em>all </em>stores could remain open to sell these supplies on Sunday, the traffic congestion could well exceed even the weekday flow, given the addition of beach traffic to the normal rush of shoppers.</p>

At best, the statute is silent on this question. It is therefore equally reasonable (if not more reasonable, since the statute is directed against Sunday sales) that any store may open on Sunday if it employs less than ten persons on that day. Thus, I find nothing in this closing law to prevent a large supermarket from opening on Sunday, staffed for that day only by a manager and eight checkout cashiers, or perhaps by a butcher, a manager and seven cashiers. The point is simply this. In the case of a supermarket which does not, even during the week, employ a traditional sales staff, it is not the number of employees which determines whether people will shop there on Sunday, but rather the availability of the merchandise itself which controls. I am not necessarily suggesting that supermarkets, for a <em>certainty, </em>will open on Sunday with skeletal staffs. I merely point out that the language in <em>McGowan </em>requires the very <em>clearest </em>showing that economic discrimination will <em>further </em>a legitimate state interest before this, or any other court, may countenance such discrimination in a Sunday closing law.

L. 872. If the Act of 1961 is not totally unconstitutional, but the exemption is an unconstitutional exemption, the Act would be in effect without the exemption, and there is no allegation on Bertera’s part that the Act without the exemption is unconstitutional. Consequently, he would be prohibited from engaging in business regardless of the constitutionality of the exemption in the 1961 Act; and the proposed enforcement of the Sunday Closing <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>Laws cannot under any circumstances be considered an unconstitutional interference with his business. Thus, Bertera’s position is unsound. Our Sunday laws generally have been upheld against constitutional attack. <em>Two Guys v.

Berkowitz instituted an action of mandamus to compel the Civil Service Commission to grant him a hearing. The Commonwealth Court issued an order directing the Commission to grant a hearing. The Commission complied and found the re-elassification improper and ordered Berkowitz to be reinstated with back pay. After appeal to our Court, on .January 6, 1967, our Court hnnded down an opinion affirming the Commission’s order. <em>Wilbar v.

    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.9",171,[137,369,1151,532]]]'>I cannot- subscribe to the conclusion reached by the majority of this court that the amendment to the Act of 1939, June <em>24, </em>P. L. 872 §699.4, 18 P.S. §4699.4, enacted by the General Assembly as the Act of 1961, September 27, P. L. 1695 §1, 18'P.S. §4699.15, is constitutional. In reaching my conclusion, I need only heed the admonition of the majority and apply “common sense in the construing of words according to rules of grammar and according to tlieir common and approved usage”.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.10",171,[136,912,1152,373]],["BL_172.1",172,[218,313,1158,374]]]'>Clearly, the mere fact that all of the judges of the highest appellate court of the Commonwealth are unable to agree on the meaning of the legislative enactment, even with the aid of the Statutory Construction Act and all their experience in the interpretation of statutes, does not indicate that the statute is unconstitutional for vagueness. The fact of this disagree<a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>ment does, however, indicate that the intendment of the statute is not so crystal-clear as the majority would have one believe. Even assuming, however, that the language of the statute admits of no interpretation other than that which the majority has reached, I conclude that the statute is void, since it is not based upon any reasonable or rational classification.</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[210,696,1164,1176]]]'>The statute involves attempts to do nothing other than prohibit the sale of fresh meats, produce and groceries on Sunday. At this point, there is nothing to be gained from any further discussion of the right of the Commonwealth to legislate in such fashion. The United States Supreme Court, as properly pointed out by the majority, in <em>Two Guys v. McGinley, </em><a href="/us/366/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="366 U.S. 582" data-case-ids="1285544" data-case-paths="/us/366/0582-01">366 U.S. 582</a> (1961), has foreclosed any such speculations. In that case, the Supreme Court of the United States held clearly that it is within the power of the state to conclude that retailers of certain items were particularly disrupting the intended atmosphere of the day because of the disturbances inherent in their operations. I would be remiss if I did not note in passing that this decision was based not upon any religious grounds, but wholly and solely upon the State’s right to legislate for the economic well-being of its citizenry. I therefore find it unnecessary to make any comments relative to the majority opinion’s preoccupation with the religious history of the Commonwealth and Nation. Such discussions are, in my view, irrelevant to the determination of the issues at hand.</p>
    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.6",172,[208,1892,1158,427]],["BL_173.1",173,[130,309,1151,749]]]'>The Act under attack says that: “Whoever engages in the business of selling or otherwise dealing at retail in fresh meats, produce and groceries on Sunday shall [be guilty of a violation and punished according to the Statute]. This section shall not apply to any retail establishment employing less than, ten persons or to any retail establishment where fresh meats, produce and groceries are offered or sold by the <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>proprietor or members of his immediate family or employing less than ten persons nor shall it apply to any retail establishment where food is prepared on the premises for human consumption.” I can readily accept the conclusion of the majority that a reasonable distinction can be made between establishments employing nine people and those employing ten or more. As aptly stated by the majority, the line must be drawn somewhere, and it requires no stretching of the rationale of <em>Two Guys </em>to reach the conclusion that the type of disturbances sought to be avoided justifies the classification. It is even arguable that where the proprietor or a member of his immediate family is engaged in the operation, an exception may be made.</p>
    <p id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[130,1070,1153,533]]]'>This would be on the sole basis of protection of small, family enterprises against the competition of huge, competing enterprises. There is, however, no reasonable justification for excepting a retail establishment where food is prepared on the premises for human consumption, nor is there any valid justification for permitting an establishment to operate with an unlimited number of employees if only the proprietor or a member of his immediate family is engaged in the sale of fresh meat, produce and groceries.</p>
    <p id="b173-5" data-blocks='[["BL_173.6",173,[132,1615,1152,695]],["BL_174.1",174,[207,302,1158,485]]]'>From what I have just said, it is apparent that I do not agree with what the majority has held the statute to mean. For example, although the statute is totally ambiguous as to whether the “less than ten” exception means less than ten employees any day of the week or only on Sunday, the majority is certain that it means the former. If one interpretation had to be chosen, I would think the latter to be more logical. Since the Act is specifically directed to Sunday, the number of persons employed at any retail store on any day of the week other than Sunday would seem irrelevant to an interpretation of the statute. The Sunday closing laws have always tried to secure a <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>respite from work, a day of rest and recreation. If a store with 1,000 employees during the week employs only nine on Sunday, then a major purpose of the law has been fulfilled in securing that respite from work for 991 employees. Regardless of which interpretation is more logical, the point is that either is maintainable. This is a criminal statute which is being interpreted; to require those potentially affected to guess at its meaning violates fundamental notions of due process.</p>
    <p id="b174-4" data-blocks='[["BL_174.5",174,[199,796,1165,1515]],["BL_175.1",175,[148,306,1150,370]]]'>Nor can I agree with the majority’s interpretation of the second exception of the Act, namely, that “This section shall not apply to any retail establishment . . . where fresh meats, produce and groceries are offered or sold by the proprietor or members of his immediate family or employing less than ten persons. . . The majority has come to the amazing conclusion that such an enterprise may not, in any event, employ more than nine persons. It is impossible for me to reach this conclusion except by ignoring completely the rules of grammar and the common and approved usage of the English language. The Act says that it shall not apply to a retail establishment where the items covered are offered or sold by certain people or to establishments employing less than ten persons. The language of the Statute is set out at length above, and it can be seen by a simple examination that the General Assembly saw fit to except from the provisions of the Act two separate and distinct types of retail grocery operations: those which employ fewer than ten persons and those where the proprietor or members of his immediate family are engaged in selling. The Act does not say that an exception is made for an establishment where the proprietor or a member of his family engages in selling and fewer than ten members are employed by the establishment; the Act says that an exception is made for any retail establishment which employs fewer than ten people, and a wholly separate <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>exception is made for any retail establishment where the proprietor or a member of his immediate family is engaged in selling. If these are not two separate and distinct classes of exceptions, there was no need for the Legislature to use the disjunctive “or” not once, but twice, to set off those establishments employing fewer than ten people.</p>
    <p id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[146,688,1153,1128]]]'>The majority says that the fact that “or” is used <em>twice </em>to set off establishments employing fewer than ten people malíes the second “or . . .” blatantly redundant unless we perform judicial alchemy to transform “or” into “and”. The redundancy is undeniable; it merely emphasizes the defects in draftsmanship in this statute. Certainly the majority’s reading of “or” as “and” does not remove the redundancy. If, as the majority concludes, family operated retail groceries are restricted to nine employees, then there is no need for the second exception of the statute. The first exception allowing the operation of establishments employing fewer than ten people would cover the field, and all of the subsequent language of the statute is mere surplusage. The family run store could employ help, so long as fewer than ten persons were working, under the first exception. Thus, reading “or” as “and” not only is a perversion of the English language, but one which ascribes to the General Assembly inclusion in a statute of language which is completely unnecessary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a>

    <p id="b175-5" data-blocks='[["BL_175.6",175,[147,1832,1150,205]],["BL_176.1",176,[187,311,1159,808]]]'>The very best that can be said for the second exception is that it is ambiguous. The majority states, by the tortuous alchemy we have referred to above, that the exception forbids the employment of more than <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>nine persons. It is just as reasonable to conclude that under this wording, an establishment could employ any number of employees, provided that the proprietor or members of his immediate family are engaged in selling, as it is to conclude that even where this condition exists, employees are limited to nine. It is just as reasonable to conclude that under this wording, an establishment could employ any number of persons, but only so long as they were the proprietor or members of his immediate family. It is not at all clear from the language of the Act which of the many interpretations advanced or advanceable was intended. What is clear is that the majority has seen fit to adopt the most restrictive of all the possible interpretations as the only one which the language of the Act permits.</p>
    <p id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.5",176,[179,1130,1163,1125]]]'>Similarly, the majority takes a restrictive view as to what constitutes an “immediate family”, asserting it to be husband, wife, and children. Should parents, or grandchildren, or perhaps nieces and nephews living in the household of the proprietor be included? No Pennsylvania case has defined “immediate family”, but those from other states indicate that it has a broader meaning than that ascribed to it by the majority. One ease has held that it includes a mother-in-law and father-in-law, <em>Grant-Morris Management Corp. v. Weaver, </em><a href="/misc2d/7/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="7 Misc. 2d 449" data-case-ids="1016546" data-case-paths="/misc2d/7/0449-01">7 Misc. 2d 449</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20N.Y.S.2d%20610" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="166 N.Y.S.2d 610">166 N.Y.S. 2d 610</a>, while another has indicated that a daughter-in-law, not even living with her husband’s parents, may well be included within the term. <em>Cincinnatti, N. &amp; C. Ry. Co. v. Peluso, </em><a href="/sw2d/293/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="293 S.W.2d 556" data-case-ids="10173134" data-case-paths="/sw2d/293/0556-01">293 S.W. 2d 556</a>. That case cited Ballentine’s Law Dictionary, defining immediate family as “those members of the same household who are bound together by ties of relationship”. The questions raised by this vague term can only be answered by the legislature. The ambiguity should be fatal in a criminal statute.</p>
    <p id="b177-3" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[153,305,1154,1022]]]'>
      <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>In its interpretation of the third exception, “where food is prepared on the premises for human consumption”, the majority repeats its error of assuming that its interpretation is the only plausible one. Such is surely not the case. “For human consumption”, says the majority, clearly means “more or less, immediate human consumption”. Disregarding the ambiguity in the majority’s own use of “more or less”, I ask what possible judicial omniscience can supply the word “immediate”? The legislature knew how to use that word when they wanted; in fact, they did so in referring to “immediate family” in the second exception. Although appellant raises the question whether “on the premises” modifies “prepared” or “consumption”, I am inclined to agree with the majority that the placement of the modifier indicates the former. But I can by no means accept the majority’s assertion that “slicing, cutting, dressing, trimming, cleaning, and packaging ... is not preparation in the sense of the statute.”</p>
    <p id="b177-4" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[151,1342,1154,913]]]'>Moreover, I cannot accept the majority’s interpretation that the food for sale must be prepared on the premises. The statute says that the section shall not apply <em>“to any retail establishment </em>where food is prepared on the premises for human consumption” (Emphasis added). Inasmuch as the statute by its title applies to grocery-type establishments—“Selling or otherwise dealing in fresh meats, produce and groceries on Sunday.” it would seem that a supermarket which barbecued chickens or operated a delicatessen counter could employ an unlimited number of persons while its counterpart without the added feature would be limited to nine. This is a classification which is supportable on no grounds that I can conceive. Yet it hardly is a proper answer to avoid the irrational classification by giving the statute an interpretation its words will not yield.</p>

      <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>I conclude that the Act is void for vagueness and I would therefore reverse the decree of the court below.</p>
    <p id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[208,423,1158,695]]]'>In view of the approach taken in some of the other opinions in this ease indicating the result that would obtain if the exceptions, were held to be void for vagueness, I would like to comment on that matter. I agree with the majority that the elimination of the exceptions would invalidate the entire section. They are so inextricably tied to the remainder of the statute that the statute is incomplete without them. However, this does not necessarily mean that all supermarkets could remain open on Sunday. It means that the validity of their opening must be tested under the provisions of the general Sunday closing law of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §699.4, 18 P.S. §4699.4.</p>
