    <p id="b569-6" data-blocks='[["BL_569.9",569,[136,1108,1156,1049]]]'>The Act of June 24, 1931, P. L. 1206, as amended, 53 P.S. §56502 provides in pertinent part as follows: “Complaint as to the legality of any ordinance or resolution may be made to the court of quarter sessions..., within thirty days after any ordinance or resolution takes effect. . . .” We have held on several occasions that the purpose of this section “is to provide a fast and efficient method to question the legality of the procedure involved in the adoption of a first class township ordinance. ... It is much more reasonable to believe that, in proceedings under §1502, the propriety of the method and the procedure that contributed to the ordinance’s enactment are the <em>only </em>questions which the court of quarter sessions can consider.” (Emphasis supplied.) <em>McArthur v.

While we do not express an opinion as to the merits of this position, it is clear that appellants in this respect are not challenging any procedural irregularities, but rather the substantive validity of such ordinance. Since the court of quarter sessions does not have jurisdiction to decide substantive issues concerning the validity of an ordinance, the only court which could have assumed jurisdiction was the court of common pleas. Furthermore, if we were to affirm the lower court’s dismissal, appellants would be effectively denied a forum in which to litigate the alleged abuses committed by the township and its officials. For this reason alone the court below erroneously dismissed appellants’ cause of action.</p>
    <p id="b570-4" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[220,1166,1161,773]]]'>There is an even more compelling reason why our Court must remand this case to the lower court for further proceedings. A proper resolution of the issues presented here might very well entail a discussion of the highly sensitive, controversial issues concerning the actual establishment and operation of community antenna. television systems (CATV). We are not unmindful of the fact that federal, state and local authorities are presently carefully analyzing and scrutinizing the feasibility and legality of promulgating rules and regulations administering such systems.

However, I am compelled to disassociate myself from the views expressed in the final paragraphs of the majority opinion because I find them completely unnecessary to a proper resolution of the merits of this case by the lower court.</p>
    <p id="b571-7" data-blocks='[["BL_571.10",571,[128,1261,1153,607]]]'>By reversing the lower court’s dismissal of the complaint in equity and remanding the case, this Court has merely instructed the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to decide whether Penn Hills Township actually passed an invalid ordinance because it failed to award the CATV franchise to the proper bidder, and whether equitable relief should be granted. In order for the court to resolve these issues it will not be necessary for it to undertake <em>any </em>of the technical explorations into the regulatory problems (mostly federal) of cable television that the majority suggests.</p>
