The alleged crimes occurred on April 1, 1966. At Hawthorne’s trial, Della Moultrie Morris, the appellant, was called to the stand by the Commonwealth. She was asked by the assistant district attorney whether she knew Arthur Hawthorne on April 1, 1966, and whether she saw him on that day, and, if so, at what time. She was also asked whether Hawthorne was alone, how he was dressed, <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>and whether she had any conversation with him. Although she invoked her privilege against self-incrimination, the trial Judge directed her to answer the aforesaid questions, which she did. She replied that she knew the defendant, that he was her boy friend, that she had seen him April 1, 1966 at about 9 :30 or 9:45 P.M., and that she had a conversation with him. The assistant district attorney then asked the following question: “What was the conversation?” <em>After consulting with her attorney, </em>the witness invoked her privilege against self-incrimination and refused to answer the question. Thereafter, First Assistant District Attorney Richard A. Sprague testified that he had had a conversation with Della Moultrie Morris, and that she had stated to him that she herself was not implicated in the crime. This testimony was offered to show that appellant’s assertion of her privilege against self-incrimination was unfounded and not credible. The trial Judge ordered the witness to answer the question, which she refused to do. She was thereafter adjudged in contempt of Court and sentenced to fifteen days in the county prison. From this contempt Order she appealed to this Court.</p>

The privi<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>lege, if properly invoked in a state proceeding, is governed by federal standards. In other words, the standards to be now used in determining whether or not the silence of one questioned about the commission of a crime is justified are the same in both state and federal proceedings. See, Malloy v. Hogan, <a href="/us/378/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="378 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6164855" data-case-paths="/us/378/0001-01">supra.</a> And, under the more recent and now controlling federal decisions, it is not necessary that a real danger of prosecution exist to justify the exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>It is sufficient if the person questioned has reasonable cause to apprehend such danger .</em>

When not under oath, and when unrepresented by counsel, she told Mr. Sprague (the assistant district attorney) that she was not implicated in the crime.
