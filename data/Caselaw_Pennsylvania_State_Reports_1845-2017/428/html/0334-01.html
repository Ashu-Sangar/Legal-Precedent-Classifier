Several hours after the accident, Gerald Forry, Forry’s brother, with the use of a tire iron, removed the tire from the rim; when he examined the tire after the explosion, the <em>outside </em>of the tire was “unseated” while the <em>inside </em>was “seated”.</p>

These “beads” hold tight and taut the mounted and finished tire along the circumference of the sidewalls which come in contact with the rim of the wheel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The function of the bead wire unit is highly important because upon it depends the retention of the tube in the tire (in tires which use tubes) and the retention of the tire itself within the circumference of the rim of the wheel.</p>

The case against Keller rests on several predicates: (1) on the sole of the bead wire unit opposite the area of the undersized “'overlaps” there was an observable dent or depression; (b) this dent or depression resulted from a mechanical force excessively applied at that point to the sole of the bead wire unit;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> (c) by reason of this dent or depression <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>created by the exertion of excessive mechanical force at that point, when Forry attempted to correct the “unseated” condition on the inside of the tire, the damaged bead wire unit allowed the inner tube at that point to escape from the tire, and, having thus lost its protective support, the tube sustained a 13 inch rupture and exploded; (d) that the excessive mechanical force was applied by Keller when the tire was mounted. Assuming, arguendo, the existence of sufficient evidence to support the first three predicates, was there any evidence that, when Keller mounted this tire, excessive force was used? Forry contends that the concatenation of proven events were such that the jury could <em>infer </em>that Keller employed excessive force in mounting the tire. With that conclusion we do not agree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

From the time of the purchase of the tire, three persons had performed some work on or handled this tire, i.e., Keller, Forry and Gerald Forry. Original mounting of the tire had been by Keller; Forry had “tried to reseat the tire onto the wheel”; Gerald Forry had removed the side of the tire casing from the rim of the wheel on a tire machine. There is not a scintilla of evidence that Keller used any excessive mechanical force in mounting the tire; on the contrary, the record is silent as to just what Keller did at all. True, the <em>opportunity </em>for improperly handling of the tire by Keller was shown but <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>both Forry and Gerald Forry had <em>equal opportunity. </em>There is no evidence, lay or expert, as to <em>when </em>this dent or depression was caused or <em>by whom </em>it was caused. Forry has simply failed to prove by any evidence, direct, circumstantial, or both, that Keller mishandled this tire. As was aptly said by the Superior Court in <em>Radies v. Reading L. G. S. &amp; S. Soc., </em><a href="/pa-super/197/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="197 Pa. Super. 509" data-case-ids="757209" data-case-paths="/pa-super/197/0509-01">197 Pa.

Viewed in the light most favorable to Forry, the record would show that <em>someone </em>by the use of excessive mechanical force caused the dent or depression in the sole of the bead of this tire; the record does not show that that person was Keller and the lack of such proof is fatal to Forry’s case.</p>

Assuming arguendo that there was no evidence of Keller’s negligence and that the nonsuit was properly granted as to him, appellant had produced sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of Goodrich and Gulf Tire to escape the nonsuit. To deprive a litigant of a jury trial by a reading of his complaint which would be worthy of a Blackstonian lawyer not only disregards the mandate of our rules but returns this Court to an era long since past.</p>

The section states that the <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>brand-placer “is subject to the same liability as though be were its manufacturer.” It does <em>not </em>state that non-reliance by the purchaser is a defense. Although the policy prompting the adoption of this section is the belief that a purchaser usually relies upon the brand name placed on the goods, there is no indication in the reporter’s notes that nonreliance is a defense.
