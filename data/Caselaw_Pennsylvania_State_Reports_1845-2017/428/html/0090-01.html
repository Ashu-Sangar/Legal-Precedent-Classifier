Subsequent to the rendition of the award, Gretz was adjudicated a bankrupt and the judgment was marked to the use of the trustee of the bankrupt estate. On February 2, 1965, the trustee as judgment creditor garnished one of appellant’s (Esslinger’s) bank accounts; the garnishee then paid the amount of the judgment plus interest and costs to date and the judgment creditor’s attorney ordered the judgment satisfied against the garnishee.</p>

      <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>Thereafter, appellant filed the present petition to have the main judgment satisfied of record. In his answer to the petition, the trustee in bankruptcy admitted receipt of payment of the amount of the judgment plus interest and costs; but asserted that because the funds were “tied up” as a result of further proceedings instituted after payment to him by appellant in the federal district court which enjoined trustee from distributing the money to creditors of the bankrupt estate, he would not satisfy the judgment until appellant paid interest to the bankrupt estate.

It is clear that when the trustee executed on the judgment against the garnishee and received full satisfaction thereof, the defendant-appellant on the original judgment had met his full obligation on that judgment to the plaintiff-appellee, and satisfaction of the original judgment is required by the plain intendment of either Act.</p>
    <p id="b197-3" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[130,846,1154,1020]]]'>The court below relied principally upon two cases: <em>Felt v.

Since, according to the lower court’s view, no competent evidence was produced, it concluded that defendant-appellant was not entitled to satisfaction of the judgment. However, unlike the two cases relied upon by the lower court, here the defendant-appellant has produced the requisite competent evidence to support a finding of actual payment in full. Since proof of actual payment is the only prerequisite necessary to establish an unqualified right to have a judgment marked satisfied, appellee’s answer admitting that the full amount of the judgment plus interest and costs had been paid clearly supplied the <em>quantum </em>of competent evidence required.</p>

Accordingly, it accepted as true the averment that appellant caused the proceeds of the judgment to be unavailable for distribution by the trustee. Admitting as true the averment that the trustee was denied the availability of the funds for distribution purposes, this should not and does not preclude a court from determining the legal consequences flowing from the admitted averment.</p>
    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[215,791,1157,466]]]'>The court below unwittingly foreclosed a consideration of the bankruptcy law when it asserted that because the funds were “unavailable for distribution” <em>a fortiori </em>appellee’s claim for interest owed must be sustained.

Even though there is a restraining order preventing the trustee from <em>distributing </em>the funds, the trustee is not at all precluded from <em>investing </em>such funds. Since the trustee in this case did not seek court approval to deposit the money in an account which would have generated interest, he should not now be permitted to obtain from appellant that which he himself could have secured for the bankrupt estate by proper management of its funds. In a situation such as the instant one, the fiduciary has the funds, can invest them with consent of the court, and thereby earn <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>interest for the creditors or beneficiaries. If the trustee could have earned interest on the funds in his possession, it cannot be said that he now has a claim for that interest against an appellant who in no way has prevented the trustee from realizing interest on such funds.</p>

It has been the: rule since <em>Miller v. Bank of New Orleans, </em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20502" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Whart. 502">5 Wharton 502</a> (1840), that only a bona fide tender of the amount due stops the running of interest. This rule flows directly from the function performed by the grant of interest. We said in <em>Kelsey v. Murphy, </em><a href="/pa/30/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="30 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="415551" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0340-01">30 Pa. 340</a>, 341 (1858), and reiterated in <em>Carbondale City School District v.

    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.6",200,[226,1831,1154,98]],["BL_201.1",201,[132,315,1151,739]]]'>Appellant’s sole contention is that the trial court, confronted with a petition under the Act of 1876, must <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>enter an order directing that the judgment be marked satisfied if it appears that the judgment has been “paid.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> In light of appellee’s allegation that the federal court litigation prevented distribution of the funds to the bankrupt’s creditors, I fail to see in what manner the judgment can be said to have been paid. Although the trustee did have possession of the funds, under the admitted state of facts the judgment was not paid until appellant relinquished its claim. To conclude, as does the majority, that the proceeds of the garnishment action constitute payment is to ignore both the admitted facts and appellant’s subsequent actions. The proverbial rabbit has never been better concealed.</p>

Of course, given the admitted set of facts, the trustee here has not been paid. Furthermore, the trustee’s position is not analogous to that of an ordinary exceptant to an account in the orphans’ court or other complainant to a fiduciary’s accounts. In such situations the usual rules that interest runs from the date a liquidated sum becomes due and from the date of judgment on an unliquidated sum would apply. gee, e.g., <em>Crawford’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/313/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="313 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1152629" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0127-01">313 Pa. 127</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.%20438" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="169 A. 438">169 Atl. 438</a> (1933). In the instant case, the crucial distinction <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>is that the federal court proceedings began after the rendition of judgment while exceptions would be filed prior to judgment and would thus not present a situation requiring the accrual of interest.</p>
    <p id="b202-5" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[224,529,1161,1555]]]'>The majority places substantial reliance upon the 1963 amendment to §47(a) (2) of the Bankruptcy Act permitting the trustee with court approval to deposit funds of the bankrupt in interest bearing accounts. The briefs and the opinion of the court below contain <em>not a hint </em>that federal bankruptcy law is here relevant. Our precedents are legion that a matter <em>not </em>asserted1 as either a theory of recovery or a matter of defense <em>cannot </em>be successfully asserted for the first time upon appeal. See cases cited and discussed in 2 P. L. E., Appeals §§81-85. Apparently the majority justifies its sua sponte treatment of §47(a) (2) on the theory that “the courts of Pennsylvania have no jurisdiction to im&gt; pose sanctions upon a disputant in a federal bankruptcy case.” Although I can agree with this general proposition, I can find no authority in the Bankruptcy Act, the federal cases or our decisions for the bald majority assertion that the lower court’s order would intrude upon the federal domain. Nor can I find a shred of support for the majority’s conclusion that appellee’s <em>sole </em>remedy is upon the bond posted in the federal courts. Even if §47(a) (2) were applicable, it would merely decrease the amount of interest recoverable for it is highly unlikely that any deposit approved by a federal court would have returned the legal rate of interest which appellee is, in my view, entitled to receive. Therefore, with interest still owing, the lower court properly refused to order the judgment satisfied of record.</p>

Prior to <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>the 1963 amendment the trustee was subject to surcharge if funds were not deposited in designated, non-interest bearing, depositories unless all creditors consented to an interest bearing deposit.

None of these cases support appellant’s theory that the lower court is confined merely to an examination of whether the garnishee actually paid the judgment. In <em>Atkinson </em>we held that the Act of 1876 is applicable only in clear cases of undisputed payment; in <em>Melan </em>that the trial court cannot investigate the original equities or apply cross demands; and in <em>Felt </em>that evidence which might be admitted to show payment in a pending adversary proceeding prior to verdict is not admissible under the act.</p>
