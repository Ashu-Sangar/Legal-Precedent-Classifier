It was adopted by the people in a solemn referendum, after the procedure had been authorized and mandated by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania under the aegis of the Constitution of the Commonwealth.

Justice Charles Alvin Jones, later Chief Justice, declared in the <em>Addison Case, </em><a href="/pa/385/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="385 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1267072" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0048-01">385 Pa. 48</a>, 57, that the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter “emanated from the relevant provision of the State Constitution, implemented for appropriate execution by the enabling Act of 1949, and was duly adopted (i.e., enacted) by the affirmative vote of the electors of the City as the organic law of the corporate municipal body. That the Charter constituted legislation no less than does a statute of the legislature to like end is too plain for even cavil. Whether a municipal charter comes into being by direct statutory grant of the legislature or by adoption by the constituent electorate in the exercise of power constitutionally reposed, it is as much legislative in the one instance as in the other and has equal legal force and standing in both. Indeed, a constitutionally permissible adoption of a municipal charter by the electorate is not one whit less in dignity than a statute of the legislature granting a charter. Where it is adopted by a constitutionally empowered electorate, it affords an example of pure democracy—the sovereign people legislating directly and not by representatives <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>in respect of the organization and administration of their local government. . .

This Court held that, because of this infraction of law, the men had to forfeit their office. The defendants in that case argued that the courts had no jurisdiction over the qualifications of city councilmen because they, like assemblymen, could only be denied office on a vote of their fellow-legislators, that is, their fellow-councilmen. This Court faced that argument and replied that here it was not a ques<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>tion of qualification for office but of forfeiture: . . It is said that councils have power in like manner as each branch of the legislature to judge and determine the qualification of their members. Granting that, it does not follow that the authority of the court is taken away to inquire into a forfeiture, which does not take place until the member has been admitted to his seat. . . <em>The error is in confounding disqualification with </em>forfeiture, <em>so far as to suppose they are equivalent expressions. </em>The fact that a man is a surety for a corporation officer is a cause of disqualification to take the seat, but when the seat is taken it becomes a cause of forfeiture.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

The people of England wrested from those despots that authority and placed it in the hands of the House of Commons. The appellants then show how the original American colonies wrote into their respective constitutions the fundamental prerogative, as well as duty, of the legislators to pass on the qualifications of its members and how this elementary proposition of trustworthy government is now written into the Constitution of the United States and, of course, the present Constitution of Pennsylvania. Then, in an astonishing non sequitur, the appellants say that the city legislature, that is, the City Council of Philadelphia, does not have the sole power to pass on qualifications of its members. This argument defies practically every jurisprudential pronouncement on the subject. The principle is succinctly stated in 18 Am. Jur., §288: “A constitutional provision that each house of the legislature shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its own members is an exclusive grant of power and constitutes each house the sole and ulti<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>mate tribunal to pass upon <em>the </em>qualifications of its own; members, which power cannot be granted away or transferred to any other tribunal or officer.”</p>

Allen </em>(decided before the 1874 Constitution), the appellants refer to some other old cases. A precedent hoary with age is not for that reason unauthoritative, especially when the principle therein asserted has been reaffirmed over the passing years. But when the old oaken bucket is replaced by a. modern drinking fountain which responds to a pedal push, and quenches the thirst of the drinker instantly and wholesomely, one does not insist on creaking a crank to bring to the surface the moss-covered bucket of yore.</p>

Daniel Auchenbach stood for election to the Select Council in the second ward of Reading, received the largest number of votes, and was declared elected as a member of the ■ Select • Council of Reading. A number of citizens and qualified electors in the second ward petitioned the Court of Quarter Sessions of Berks County to declare Auchenbach’s election illegal because, the petition asserted, Auchenbach did not live in the second ward and, therefore, was not qualified to take his seat as councilman. The court of quarter sessions assumed jurisdiction over the controversy, heard testimony and decided that Auchenbach did not live in the second ward. It then proceeded to disqualify him from the office to which he had been elected. Judge Ermentrotjt, who wrote the opinion for the court of quarter sessions, argued in the same manner as do the appellants in the case before us. He said: “Our jurisdiction of this case is questioned. It is asserted that, although the law rigidly demands that a candidate for office <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>shall have certain prescribed qualifications, the election of such candidate cannot be contested for the want of such qualifications; that the election of a person disqualified does not make the election either ‘undue or illegal,’ and that in a contested election the courts are simply to determine whether the machinery of holding the election has been put in proper motion, the election held at the proper time and place and in the manner and by the proper persons as required by law, without fraud or mistake, and a correct return thereof made; that in the present case, because §4 of the municipal act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 204, says: ‘Each branch of councils shall judge of the qualifications of its members, and contested elections shall be determined by the courts of law,’ the question of ‘qualifications’ belongs exclusively to councils to determine.” Judge Ermentrout said that this was all wrong, that the courts did have jurisdiction to pass on the qualifications of members of council, and he came to the conclusion: “And now having heard the case, and having tried and determined the controversy, we find that Daniel Auchenbach was not an inhabitant for one year of the Second ward, city of Reading, before his alleged election as member of select council from said ward, and adjudge that he was and is disqualified under the law from holding such office, and that his alleged election is undue and illegal.”</p>

It had no jurisdiction to pronounce upon the qualification of Daniel Auchenbach as a councilman. <em>The act of assembly vests that power not in the court, but in that branch of the municipal council to which the member may be elected. </em>It is only in contested election <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>cases that the court has jurisdiction, and <em>as this jurisdiction is not one of common law it cannot he extended hy implication heyond the prescriptions of the ■ act in which it originates. </em>Were the question before us, we might take issue with the court below on the fact of the respondent’s qualification, but, as what we have said fully disposes of the case in hand, we need not pass upon an issue which is foreign to the pending controversy.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.5",622,[209,802,1162,417]]]'>Echoing the language of Chief Justice Gordon, we would say here that the physical residence of John B.

It must be perceived by even half a glance through constitutional windows that the decision of the Supreme Court in the Bond case can have no application to the Kelly case where no constitutional question is involved and where the only issue to be decided is the residence of Kelly, which, let it be reiterated, is strictly and solely a matter for determination by City Council, as edicted by the City Charter.</p>

Thus do I feel compelled to note my disagreement with the manner in which these merits have been “resolved.” By holding, as the majority has done, that only City Council can rule on the right of John B.

As in the present case, the Court was urged to refrain from deciding the merits of this controversy on the sole ground that city council was charged with the duty of passing upon its own members’ qualifications. Nevertheless, the merits <em>were </em>reached on the theory that having <em>commenced </em>his duties as councilman, defendant’s violation of law became grounds for declaring his office <em>forfeited. </em>Thus, while admitting that, prior to being seated, council alone had the power to determine the councilman’s qualifications, once the defendant officially took office his lack of proper qualifications magically became a ground for forfeiture, over which the court did have jurisdiction. The Court frankly admitted that the very same defect could form the basis for either a disqualification or a forfeiture, the label seemingly dependent solely upon when the action to oust the councilman actually commenced. “The fact that a man is surety for a corporation officer is a cause of disqualification to take the seat, but when the seat is taken it becomes a cause of forfeiture.” <a href="/pa/70/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="70 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1028156" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0465-01">70 Pa. at 473</a>.</p>

I would thus read the Home Rule Charter as giving City Council the power to pass on the qualifications of its own members <em>so long as this power is not abused. </em>When, however, council abuses its discretion and chooses to seat a man in direct contravention of the mandatory charter requirements, the judiciary, in my view, has the power to prevent this municipal body of seventeen members (which, of course, can act even upon the vote of nine) from ignoring the absolute dictates of a document approved by the entire City of Philadelphia.</p>

In that case, Bond, a Negro, was three times elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, and three times excluded by that House from membership therein because of his statements criticizing the policy of the Federal Government in Vietnam.

      <em>Each Souse shall be the judge of the election . . . and qualifications of its members </em>. . . .” All parties, including the Supreme Court of the United States, agreed that no question of race was involved, but solely a question of the jurisdiction and the power of the Court to decide whether the Georgia House had the power under and because of its Constitution to exclude Bond from membership therein. Chief Justice Warren, speaking for a unanimous Court, pertinently said (page 118) : “The question presented in this case is whether the Georgia House of Representatives may constitutionally exclude appellant Bond, a duly elected Representative, from membership because of his statements, and statements to which he subscribed, criticizing the policy of the Federal Government in Vietnam and the operation of the Selective Service laws.”</p>

To permit a person who does not comply with all such requirements to become a member of the Legislative body in question and to represent the voters, without compliance with all the Constitutional and statutory requirements, is to deprive many voters of the right of representation to which they are statutorily and Constitutionally entitled, and of the Equal Protection of the Laws.</p>

They do not discuss what happens if no one has discovered or has the necessary knowledge within said seven-day time limit, or who under their theory would have any status or standing to bring the challenge. Of course, this further ignores all Constitutional questions which no Court or City Council can legally or Constitutionally ignore.</p>

However, it is clear and obvious that <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>there is a line of demarcation and that in certain eases the Courts have jurisdiction and in other cases only the Legislative body has jurisdiction. For example, it is a matter of common knowledge that Adam Clayton Powell was excluded by the House of Representatives from a seat therein after he had been twice elected by the voters in his Congressional District, because of his alleged misappropriation of someone else’s (his wife’s) money. It is likewise a matter of common knowledge that in prior years William C. Maybury was elected by the voters of Michigan to the Senate of the Uhited States; yet the Senate was permitted to and did exclude him from a seat. William S. Vare was elected by the voters of Pennsylvania to the Senate of the United States; yet the Senate excluded him from a seat. In the Maybury case, he was excluded because he had allegedly spent too much money in his campaign (although today the money he spent would have been a drop in the bucket!) ; and in the Vare case, he was excluded because of alleged election irregularities. These decisions were properly made by the respective Legislative body and not by the Courts, and serve to illustrate the line of distinction and demarcation that presently exists, although not yet clearly drawn.</p>
