[its] infraction can never be treated as harmless error,” it remains clear that one of the primary bases for both decisions is the degree of impact that the right involved has upon the fact-finding process. For example, the right to trial counsel under <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em><a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">372 U.S. 335</a>, <a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">83 S. Ct. 792</a> (1963), a right having perhaps the greatest impact upon fact-finding reliability, has been given both retroactive application and is one of those rights whose violation results in automatic reversal of a conviction. Similarly, changes governing the voluntariness of confessions are retroactive and admission of a coerced confession requires automatic reversal. When contrasted with the inherent unreliability of a conviction procured in the absence of counsel or on the basis of a coerced <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>confession, a conviction obtained through use of an <em>Escobedo </em>or <em>Miranda </em>violation does not go to the very roots of fact-finding reliability, for such a statement may well be voluntary. Given the similarity of the principles governing retroactivity and those governing automatic reversal, the Supreme Court’s decision that neither <em>Escobedo </em>nor <em>Miranda </em>are retroactive and its decision that a <em>Wade </em>violation does not require automatic reversal, we conclude that the United States Supreme Court would hold that <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda </em>violations are also subject to the <em>Chapman </em>rule, a conclusion we hereby follow.</p>

On four separate occasions mention was made at trial of the statement. To place these references in context, a brief discussion of appellant’s case is necessary. Other than several character witnesses testifying as to Padgett’s good reputation and as to the decedent’s reputation for violence, the defense consisted of appellant’s version of the shooting here involved. Padgett, a bartender, was working the night shift; as he was cleaning the counter, Donald Howard (the decedent) accused Padgett of taking his drink. Padgett denied this accusation and began to wash some glasses in a tub behind the bar. According to appellant, Howard then leaned over the bar and struck him in the mouth. Intending to eject Howard from the bar, Padgett then took a gun concealed in a cigar box under the bar and, holding the gun in his right hand, walked from behind the bar and confronted Howard. As Padgett reached for Howard with his left hand in an attempt to spin Howard in the direction of the exit, Padgett fired one shot into the side of the bar allegedly to frighten Howard. Howard immediately thereafter “moved in on” Padgett and, as Padgett subsequently testified, his gun accidentally discharged the fatal shot.</p>

Padgett testified that he told Howard that he had not served him a drink, but the statement, as pointed out by the prosecution, omitted any reference to this remark. Finally, Padgett testified that, at the instant the fatal shot was fired, Howard was “moving in” as if he was going to strike Padgett, while in the statement, as read to the jury, Padgett said “it was just as if he was going to leap on you.”</p>

The statement, never read in its entirety to the jury, was at one point marked for identification by the Commonwealth and a motion was made and granted for its admission. The record, however, gives no indication that this exhibit was taken into the jury room. At the post-conviction hearing, Detective John McGill testified that when he obtained the statement three copies were made. Two copies were at the time of hearing in his possession and he <em>assumed </em>that the third was given to the district attorney and then to the jury. It is not an invarient practice for the jury to be given all exhibits. Nor did post-conviction counsel question either trial counsel or the prosecuting district attorney as to whether the jury did in fact have the statement.
