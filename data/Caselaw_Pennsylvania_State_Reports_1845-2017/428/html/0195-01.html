He unsuccessfully fought extradition and was returned to Pennsylvania on February 1, 1962. He appeared before the court in Crawford County on February 5, 1962, without counsel and plead guilty to a district attorney’s bill of indictment charging him with being an accessory before the fact to armed robbery. At the same time he signed a standard printed form on the indictment, which included, inter alia, a waiver of the right to the assistance of counsel and presentment of the charge to the grand jury.</p>

Mullins was also informed by the court that he had the right to have his case presented to the grand jury and the right to trial at which he could be present with counsel. As to his right to have the assistance of counsel before entering a plea to the indictment, the transcribed record of the proceedings shows the following: <em>“Questions by </em>

The record is silent as to whether or not on this occasion he was informed of his right to have the assistance of counsel. No appeal was entered from the judgment of sentence.</p>

    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[205,1291,1159,307]]]'>However, the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel at the time of plea and sentence could be waived by Mullins if he did so intelligently and understandingly, <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[204,1618,1158,478]]]'>As we interpret relevant decisions of the United States Supreme Court, before there can be an effective and valid waiver of counsel the accused must be fully apprised of the extent of his rights in connection therewith. This necessitates that he be informed or know not only of his right to consult with an attorney, but also, if he is indigent that a lawyer will be appointed to represent him. In short, he cannot intelligently waive a right of which he is not fully aware.</p>

If such warning is required at the interrogation level, it follows logically that no less is required when the accused appears in court to plead to a criminal indictment.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[133,635,1153,581]]]'>The Superior Court, noting our decision in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Wright v.

With this we do not agree. In <em>Wright </em>the defendant was specifically asked if he wanted “the court to appoint an attorney” to represent him. This is not so in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[135,1236,1155,967]]]'>If the record clearly shows that a defendant is informed of, or is cognizant of, his right to the assistance of counsel at the time of plea or trial and expressly declines such assistance, the burden is upon him in any subsequent attack on the conviction to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his acquiescence was not sufficiently understanding and intelligent to constitute an effective waiver. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Wright v. Cavell, </em>supra; <em>Moore v. Michigan, </em><a href="/us/355/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="355 U.S. 155" data-case-ids="6163328" data-case-paths="/us/355/0155-01">355 U.S. 155</a>, <a href="/us/355/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="355 U.S. 155" data-case-ids="6163328" data-case-paths="/us/355/0155-01">78 S.

For this rule to, apply, however, the record must show in the case of an indigent defendant that he is informed of or fully understands that the court will provide him with counsel without charge if he so desires. Unless this appears in the record, the burden is upon the Commonwealth to establish that the defendant was fully aware of his rights at the time the alleged waiver occurred.</p>

Therefore, the burden of proof was upon the Commonwealth to establish this fact in the proceeding. This in our opinion it failed to do.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[223,524,1161,804]]]'>At the hearing in the habeas corpus proceedings, Mullins testified that he did not understand at the time of plea that he was entitled to a lawyer free of charge. It was also elicited that his formal education was limited to the fourth grade. To countermand this, the Commonwealth brought out that he was no stranger to the criminal courts but had suffered previous criminal convictions in the states of Ohio, California and Missouri, and that in one specific instance he had been provided with free counsel in the federal courts several years ago. Testimony was also offered to show that a Captain Holt, the prosecuting police officer, had informed Mullins after his arrest, “that if he couldn’t afford an attorney Judge Mook would appoint an attorney for him.”</p>
