We relied on the then predecessor statute to 38 U.S.O. §3101. The issue of inheritance taxation was not involved, and only in passing did we make an ambiguous reference that tax claims of the Commonwealth were also precluded from being paid out of the insurance proceeds by the federal act (citing <em>Wanzel’s Estate, </em>supra). No reference was made to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States Trust Company v.

VI, §2, which provides in essence that no state statute can take precedence over a contrary federal act. However, since we have a final ruling by the United States Supreme Court that the federal statute involved does not prevent the imposition of state inheritance taxes, <em>WanzeVs Estate </em>cannot now be permitted to remain as the law and is overruled. The proceeds of the insurance policy being payable to decedent’s estate, §304 of the Act of 1961 permits the imposition of the tax. Our Court must, therefore, sanction that legislative determination since there is no inconsistent federal act present.</p>
