Court, is directly in point and controlling. The facts and the law are well and aptly stated in the Opinion of the Court by Chief Justice Brown (pp. 100, 101, 102) : “The paper admitted to probate in the present ease is a printed form of- a will, <em>all the written portions of it being in the handwriting of P. Churchill, the decedent. . . What he did do was to write his name in three blank spaces in the paper—first at the top and then in the testimonium and attestation clauses. </em>In doing so he was merely acting as his own scrivener; but because he said to one of the two attesting witnesses, ‘This is my will, I have signed it,’ and to the other, ‘I wish you to witness my name to a paper,’ and subsequently handed it to a physician, saying, ‘This is my will, and I want you to keep it for me,’ the learned court below was of opinion that the ‘testamentary purpose was complete <em>and that the signature in the attestation clause meets every statutory requirement of being “at the end thereof.”’</em>

      <em>“The decedent may have thought he had made a will, hut the statute says he had not. </em>The question is not one of his intention, but of what he actually did, or rather what he failed to do. He failed to sign the paper at the end thereof, and this essential requirement of the statute is not met by the insertion of his name in his own handwriting in three blank spaces in the printed form of the paper which he may have intended to use in executing his will. ‘It may happen, even frequently, that genuine wills, namely, wills truly expressing the intentions of the testators, are made without observations of the required forms; and whenever that happens, the genuine intention is frustrated by the act of the legislature, of which the general object is to give effect to the intention. The courts must consider that the legislature, having regard to all probable circumstances, has thought it best, and has therefore determined, to run the risk of frustrating the intention sometimes, in preference to the risk of giving effect to or facilitating the formation of spurious wills, by the absence of forms. . . . ‘The legislature have laid down a rule so plain that it cannot be evaded without a clear violation of its terms. No room is left for judicial construction or interpretation. <em>It says a will must he signed at the end thereof, and that’s the end of it. </em>We are of opinion that this paper was not a will within the meaning of the Act of 1833, and that it was error to admit it to probate.’ ”</p>

The signature of the purported testator, “George Glace,” was <em>written hy George Glace </em>on the front page after the word “I,” <em>and again in the testimonium clause </em>after the words “In witness whereof, I.” The word “aider-man” was written by the alderman at the end of the testimonium clause.

Of course, if the language that follows the signature is <em>itself </em>testamentary in nature, then the post-signature bequests contained in that language will be <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>void. <em>Kretz Estate, </em><a href="/pa/410/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="410 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="1884569" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0590-01">410 Pa. 590</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=189%20A.2d%20239" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="189 A.2d 239">189 A. 2d 239</a> (1963). Therefore, the core question in the present appeal is whether the signature of Montana O. Knupp was made with <em>testamentary </em>intent, or was merely made to <em>identify </em>the testatrix in the attestation clause.</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[214,603,1163,417]]]'>I am completely convinced that this signature was made with testamentary intent. In the first place, the will was totally in the handwriting of the testatrix, unlike the documents in <em>Miller, Ohurchill, </em>or <em>Glace. </em>.Furthermore, both subscribing witnesses testified that the testatrix asked them, to use the language of witness Dorothy C. Allen, “if . . . [they] would witness her Will.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[219,1037,1157,753]]]'>Finally, the other subscribing witness, Ida Goal, testified that when she signed her name as witness, testatrix’s name had not yet been inserted in the attestation clause, but that Montana O. Knupp inserted her own signature <em>after </em>the rest of the attestation clause had been written out, and after one witness had signed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> To me, this is the most convincing indication that the signature was not merely part of the attestation clause, but was intended as a separate testamentary signing. In sum, when it is considered that the will in <em>Miller, </em>which this Court upheld, was a printed form containing a special blank line for a signature, and that this line was <em>never filled in,</em>

But, in each of these cases, we frustrate the testator’s intent today, because an identical document presented tomorrow, drawn by a different testator, could easily be forged. For example, in <em>Kretz, </em>supra, we invalidated the residuary clause appearing <em>after </em>the testator’s signature, not because we believed that <em>it </em>was forged, but because to allow probate would be to invite future persons to fraudulently insert similar clauses in other wills. I repeat that no such risk is present here.</p>
    <p id="b527-4" data-blocks='[["BL_527.5",527,[147,985,1153,1024]]]'>Assuming, as is the case here, there are no blank spaces in the body of the will, when a testator signs his name at the end of his testamentary disposition, it symbolically, as well as <em>physically, </em>prevents the addition of other provisions prior to the signature. There is simply no room for them. In a sense, the signature acts just as sealing wax on a letter. Not only did Montana O. Knupp’s signature at the end of the dis-positive provisions of this will insure that no one could have inserted additional terms, but furthermore, a similar signature in any subsequent, similar will would provide identical assurance there. If the majority is concerned with the possibility of some third person altering the document by <em>changing </em>provisions, rather than <em>adding </em>new ones, then 1 submit that the choice of pronouns in the attestation clause could have no effect whatsoever on this risk. In fact, such a possibility of fraud is present in every will, no matter how it is signed.</p>
