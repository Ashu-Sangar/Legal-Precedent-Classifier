Mrs. Gitman appealed to the Superior Court, claiming inadequacy in the order. The Superior Court affirmed, and, upon petition for allocatur, we allowed an appeal to this Court.</p>

      <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>Mrs. Gitman contends that the court below, in arriving at the amount of the support order, committed a manifest abuse of discretion in that it disregarded certain evidence which, if considered, would have dictated a much higher order. A reading of the record demonstrates quite convincingly that the court below failed to comprehend the extent of the husband’s earnings. The income tax returns introduced into evidence showed that Mr. Gitman’s net income, after taxes, amounted respectively, for the years, 1962, 1963, and 1964, to $32,489.29, $32,474.62, and $33,866.34. Much of this income derived from the Ashland Shirt Corporation, a closed family corporation of which Alfred Gitman was secretary-treasurer and one of its directors, in addition to being owner of 50% of its stock. The other half was owned by his twin brother. Another, and smaller portion of Gitman’s income was derived from the Salem Mountain Corporation, also a closed family corporation with a total of 100 outstanding shares, of which Gitman owned 5, his twin brother 5, their brother Leo 5, and the Ashland Shirt Corporation 40, the remaining 45 being owned by their deceased father’s estate, of which Gitman possessed a 3/10ths interest. Then, there was a third family corporation, the Fleetwood Shirt Corporation, of which Gitman was president and one of four directors, as well as owner of 10 of its 128 outstanding shares.</p>

The case of <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Gutzeit v. Gutzeit, </em><a href="/pa-super/200/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="200 Pa. Super. 401" data-case-ids="762912" data-case-paths="/pa-super/200/0401-01">200 Pa. Superior Ct. 401</a>, should have offered the lower court some guidance in determining the realities of Gitman’s income, in arriving at the amount the law compelled him to pay in discharging the obligation of supporting his wife and children. In that case the defaulting husband was an officer in a <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>corporation which provided him with a Cadillac automobile and a cabin cruiser, he traveled and entertained extensively, all of which luxuries he enjoyed at company expense. He lived with his 31-year-old son whose income emanated entirely from the defendant’s company, paying no board or room rent. He enjoyed, at company expense, trips to Nevada, Florida and Europe. The corporation paid premiums on a $25,000 life insurance policy for the defendant. After enumerating these perquisites to the defendant’s income, the Superior Court said: “What then is the defendant’s earning capacity? . . . The only fair inference which can be drawn from the evidence is that the charges made to the corporation by the defendant, even though they may be legal deductions for corporate income tax purposes, constitute substantial perquisites to the defendant. All these must be considered in determining the defendant’s earning capacity. It is evident that his salary, his corporate earnings, his life insurance, his direct perquisites from the corporation and his indirect perquisites obtained by living with his son in luxurious circumstances financed through his corporation would justify a finding that his earning capacity is at least $30,000 a year.”</p>

Like the exemptions he claimed for his four sons, these items may have been proper deductions under the income tax law, but consideration must be given in a support case to those deductible expenditures which improve the defendant’s standard of living and have the effect of perquisites.”</p>

This it failed to do. The court erred also in failing to make a study of the true worth and value of Gitman’s interests in the three family corporations. According to his own calculation, Gitman’s net worth amounted to at least $263,162.35, this based on the book value of his stock in the three family corporations. The market value is much higher than the book value. It was made clear in <em>Gutzeit v. </em>Gutzeit, <a href="/pa-super/200/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="200 Pa.

Superior Ct. 570</a>, the Court stated that “a wife is not necessarily concluded by the amount of her husband’s taxable income as computed in his Federal Income Tax return.” In that case, the husband deducted $8,926.07 for depreciation on real estate. The Court said: “Such deduction for annual depreciation of real estate by a taxpayer is proper in determining the amount of net income subject to the tax. But although the Internal Revenue Code sanctions deductions for depreciation of <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>income-producing real estate such depreciation does not reduce the actual dollar income of the taxpayer, and does not enter into a computation of a husband’s total income upon which a support order may be based. A man’s first duty is to his wife and only actual business expenses may be deducted to determine his income to which she may look for her support. . .

This reasoning is an erroneous one. If the husband-father can afford for himself a caviar-champagne standard of living, it is not justice, nor legal, that the wife should be content with a tent and bread-and-butter menu for herself and brood. Dignity of living, commensurate with income, is as much a necessity as the bare essentials for survival. The court should have considered the style of living to which Gitman had accustomed his family and the manner of his present living and compared it with the low standard of living to which he had reduced his wife and children because of his failure to meet his marital obligations. Gitman continues to live well and even luxuriously but his wife and three children must be content with a two-room hotel accommodation without kitchen or laundry facilities.

This assumption, however, fortunately for humanity, does not agree with the law. A man who elevates a girl, through marriage, to the plateau of a comfortable and even a richly elegant living, may not, when they separate, topple her into a base economic state on the theory that she is now no worse off than before she accompanied him to the marriage altar.

A support order must be based primarily (1) upon the income of the husband, and, under certain circumstances which it is impossible to define, upon his earning power, and (2) under certain circumstances upon the finances of the wife. Earning power is often so indefinite as to be realistically incapable of definition. Under the statute, a wife who has not been guilty of misconduct is entitled to an amount of support which is <em>“reasonable </em>and proper for her comfortable support and maintenance,” and of course also for the comfortable support and maintenance of their children when the children live with the wife, considering the above mentioned factors and especially both the income and the earning power of the husband. A husband cannot evade this duty of support by so investing his assets as to restrict his earnings or cheat his wife of what the law says she is entitled to. His earning power should be considered only when he deliberately employs his capital assets for the sole or paramount intent to deprive his wife of the amount of support to which the law says she is entitled; and also in the situation where he deliberately refuses to work in order to cheat her, or fraudulently conceals his assets.</p>
