Section 1 of the Act of 1901, supra, is not limited to the protection of holders of judgment notes who appraise the value of the debtor’s real property, estimate his equity in it and then file a judgment which is solid security for a loan. The protection of the statute extends generally to judgment and other lien creditors, many of whom file their judgments mechanically, without relying on anything other than an undefined hope of somehow, someday realizing something thereon. For instance, Westinghouse might have hoped for a compromise of the federal tax liens (which, in fact, very nearly occurred) or for an increase in the value of the property. However speculative the value of such hopes, they do prevent the judgment from being worthless. Since whatever speculative value such a judgment has, no less than the sure value of a banker’s judgment note, depends on title being in the record owner, the reason for the application of the statute is present.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In <em>Turtle Creek </em>that inference was solidly based on an express agreement that the attorney’s fee was to be contingent on his establishing the client’s title to the real estate and on the fact that the client was insolvent when the attorney took the case. Neither of these elements appear in the present case. The fact that the attorney’s services were rendered from 1953 to 1960 and that the judgment note was not given until 1959 indicates, in exact opposition to the lower court’s use of this fact, that the services were not rendered with an intent to look to the property for payment. Moreover, Attorney Resnick’s own pleading alleges that the note was given “as <em>security </em>for <em>partial </em>payment of his fees.” (Emphasis added.)

White, </em>supra, this Court has consistently held that creditors relying on record ownership are not protected by the Act of 1901 even if the debt creating transaction occurs when the resulting trust is unrecorded unless they also become judgment or lien creditors while there still is an unrecorded resulting trust. <em>Ehnes v. Yowell, <a href="/pa/374/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="374 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1241459" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0017-01">374 </a></em><a href="/pa/374/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="374 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1241459" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0017-01">Pa. 17</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.2d%2056" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="97 A.2d 56">97 A. 2d 56</a> (1953) ; <em>Malamed v.

Coyne, </em><a href="/pa/294/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="294 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1113412" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0512-01">294 Pa. 512</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20667" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="144 A. 667">144 A. 667</a> (1928). In view of our position in these cases, it would be incongruous for reliance on record ownership in the debt-creating transaction to be required as an additional element necessary for recovery under the statute where there is reliance on record ownership when the judgment is entered. Thus, Westinghouse’s offer is unnecessary.</p>
