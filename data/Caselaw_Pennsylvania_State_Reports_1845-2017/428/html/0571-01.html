If fault must be assessed against a party in this litigation, then the Commonwealth must bear the blame. The Act of May 1, 1907, P. L. 135, §7, 17 P.S. §1809, in language which is unmistakable, makes it mandatory for the court stenographer in a capital case to transcribe and file the notes of testimony: “[I]n any case ... of conviction of murder in the first degree, it <em>shall be the duty </em>of the official stenographer forthwith to make, certify, and file of record a typewritten copy of the stenographic notes of trial, <em>without any order of the court-, . . </em>.” (Emphasis supplied.) Furthermore, it cannot be said that appellant himself should have taken steps to insure that the stenographer performed his statutory duty. The opinion of the court below cites not only <em>Douglas </em>but our own cases of <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Newsome v.

I find it inconceivable that any court would expect an unrepresented, indigent defendant to have the knowledge necessary to avail himself of a procedure to compel transcription of the notes' of testimony when in the same breath it admits that he must have counsel to hurdle the intricacies of appeal.</p>

We are thus faced with the “different case” contemplated in <em>Norvell. </em>And with justice this case <em>should </em>be different. The grant of <em>Douglas </em>relief indicates that Banks was deprived of assistance of counsel for appeal ; this is the identical deprivation which prevented Banks from taking any action to compel the stenographer to transcribe his notes. Under the Constitution, this Court may not with one breath tell an indigent defendant that because of his indigency he was denied assistance of counsel for purposes of appeal and in the same breath insist that it will deprive him of the very means necessary to effectuate his unconstitutionally denied right, i.e., a trial transcript.</p>

The Fifth Circuit agreed. After noting that a hearing was necessary to determine whether <em>Douglas </em>had been violated, that court concluded that a finding of a <em>Douglas </em>denial (as was found in Banks’ post-conviction hearing) would rebut the presumption that counsel was available to protect the indigent’s appellate rights and that Pate’s appeal “would be the ‘different case’ Norvell cryptically noted but pretermitted.” Id. at 772.
