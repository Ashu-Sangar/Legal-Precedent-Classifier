Counsel was appointed and a hearing conducted. Giving appellant’s petition the most charitable reading, there are no facts alleged which m legal contemplation are sufficient to support the first three of his four allegations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Furthermore, only the last allegation was pressed at the hearing below and apparently forms the primary basis for this appeal.</p>

According to appellant, his attorneys early adopted a fixed view that the likelihood of a death sentence made a plea the only realistic alternative given the substantial evidence of appellant’s participation in a grievous felony-murder. Believing himself not guilty, appellant approximately five months prior to trial wrote to the Attorney General indicating that he was dissatisfied with counsel’s evaluation and requesting advice on available methods to compel counsel to withdraw. The Attorney General replied that this matter was not within his purview and that appellant should notify the trial court of his views when brought to trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Accordingly, appellant made no mention of this correspondence until trial day when he asked the court to appoint two new attorneys and continue his trial. After a noon recess, appellant’s request was denied<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and he entered a plea of guilty. Appellant now contends that trial counsel’s fixed intention to compel appellant to plead guilty combined with the trial court’s refusal to appoint new counsel placed him in the position of entering a plea of guilty or facing trial unrepresented and that his choice of the lesser of these two evils, i.e., entry of a plea with counsel, indicates that his plea was not voluntary.</p>

Furthermore, one attorney testified that during the noon recess appellant apologized for his request that new counsel be appointed, explaining his request in light of advice given to him by a fellow inmate that a request for new counsel would result in a postponement of the trial. The other attorney corroborated this incident and related that during the course of the degree of guilt proceeding appellant commented that he was satisfied with his representation and would recommend trial counsel for further business. Although, regrettably, the trial record contains no examination of appellant as to the consequences of his decision to plead guilty, the post-conviction hearing judge chose to believe trial counsel and appellant has therefore failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that his plea was involuntary.

The matter then came before Judge Gold who held a brief hearing without appointing counsel. Appellant raised three arguments in this petition: (1) the indictment was invalid because it lacked his signature; (2) he was denied the right to speedy trial; and (3) his guilty plea was coerced. Judge Gold’s denial was appealed to this Court as of January Term, 1964, No. 182 and a judgment of non pros entered on May 6, 1964. Arguments identical to those presented to Judge Gold formed the basis of a federal habeas corpus action. The federal district court denied relief on alternative grounds, i.e., it rejected <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>appellant’s claims on the merits and also found that he had not exhausted available state remedies.

Although the Commonwealth insists that appellant’s prior collateral efforts must result in a denial of his present petition on the theory that he has waived any constitutional infirmity in his plea, see Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, §4, 19 P.S. §1180-4 (Supp. 1966), we are loath to impose §4’s waiver provisions against an unrepresented defendant since the federal district court did not clearly deny relief on the merits of appellant’s habeas corpus action.
