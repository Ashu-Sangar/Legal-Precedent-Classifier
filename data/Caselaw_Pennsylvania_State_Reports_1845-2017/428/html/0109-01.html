Thus, we are again faced with a challenged guilty plea, a trial record which fails to demonstrate that the plea was entered knowingly and intelligently and testimony by appellant indicating that in fact neither counsel nor the court below explained the possible consequences attendant upon entry of a plea of guilty.</p>
    <p id="b214-6" data-blocks='[["BL_214.9",214,[232,1295,1157,476]]]'>Appellant Grays in 1954 pled guilty to murder generally and, after a finding by the court en banc that Grays’ acts constituted murder in the first degree, was sentenced to life imprisonment. An appeal to this Court resulted in an affirmance. See <em>Commonwealth v.

The substance of this conversation was <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>that the trial judge had informed counsel that a guilty plea would result in a conviction of voluntary manslaughter and a sentence of six years. Grays further testified that trial counsel assured him that if a higher sentence were imposed, a new trial could be obtained. Appellant’s wife testified that on the day of trial she was informed by counsel that “[i]f he pleads guilty and they find him guilty he can appeal for a new trial, but if he pleads not guilty and they find you guilty then he wouldn’t be entitled to a new trial.” The Commonwealth made an attempt to discredit appellant’s testimony on cross-examination but did not offer any evidence to rebut appellant’s version.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

A similar contention was rejected in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v.

As with other assertions of a denial of constitutional rights in post-conviction proceedings, the burden remains throughout with the prisoner to demonstrate any constitutional deprivation.” See also <em>Commonwealth v. Hill, </em><a href="/pa/427/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="427 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1910406" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0614-01">427 Pa. 614</a>, <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a><a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20347" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="235 A.2d 347">235 A. 2d 347</a> (1967). Since the court below obviously chose to disbelieve appellant’s testimony,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> this burden was not met and the denial of relief is accordingly affirmed.</p>

This can be best accomplished by an on the record inquiry sufficient to demonstrate “that the defendant understands the nature of the charges, his right to a jury trial, the acts sufficient to constitute the offenses for which he is charged and the permissible range of sentences.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Id. at 106, <a href="/citations/?q=237%20A.2d%20196" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="237 A.2d 196">237 A. 2d at 198</a>. In the absence <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>of such a recorded inquiry or testimony from trial counsel, the hearing court is forced to disbelieve the prisoner or grant the writ. Recognizing that the prisoner has a powerful incentive to forget at the post-conviction hearing what he may have been told before Ms trial, we cannot accept the proposition advanced by appellant. Yet it is equally true that not all prisoners are subject to memory lapses. A proper balance between continued validity of a guilty plea and the constitutional mandate that a plea be knowingly and intelligently entered can best be maintained by recorded indicia of the crucial event.</p>

However, a hearing would not have been granted unless the facts alleged in the post-conviction petition, if true, would have entitled appellant to relief. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Kern v.
