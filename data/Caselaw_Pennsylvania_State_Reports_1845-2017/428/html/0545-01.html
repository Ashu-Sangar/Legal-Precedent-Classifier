It was the taxpayer’s contractual obligation to fabricate steel bridge parts according to certain specifications, to cause such parts to be transported to Maryland and to incorporate such parts into new bridge structures in Maryland.</p>

L. (1955) 1228, 72 P.S. 3403-1 et seq., as amended. This act imposes a tax on the sale at retail of certain types of property. <em>Excluded </em>from the definition of sales at retail are transfers for the purpose of resale. 72 P.S. 3403-2(j). [Taxpayer] contends that its activities constituted a ‘resale’, that the tax was erroneously paid and that it is entitled to a refund. The section defining ‘resale’ with which we are here concerned is as follows: ‘(2) <em>The physical incorporation of personal property as an ingredient or constituent into other personal property, </em>which is to be sold in the regular course of business or the performance of those services described in subclauses (2), (3) and (4) of clause (j) of this section upon personal property which is to be sold in the regular course of business or <em>which the person incorporating such property has undertaken at the time of pur</em>

We are thus governed by the rule that a taxing statute must be construed most strongiy and strictly against the government, and if there is a reasonable doubt as to its construction or application to a particular case, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer, [citing authorities]. With this in mind we turn to the provisions of the act and the facts of this case. Under the interpretation given the statute by this court, the italicized portion of the above-quoted statute is a ‘resale’. [Taxpayer’s] fabricating of the steel at its Lancaster plant obviously falls within the initial provision of clause (h)(2) in that these activities involved the ‘physical incorporation of personal property as an ingredient or constituent into other personal property . . .’. The only question remaining is whether [taxpayer] has satisfied the requirement that ‘the person incorporating such property has undertaken at the time of purchase to cause (the property) to be transported in interstate commerce to a destination outside this Commonwealth.’. This requirement must necessarily be a matter of proof in each case. Uixder the facts as stipulated in this case it is clear that the specific steel in question ordered by [taxpayer] was at the time of purchase intended for use in Maryland and in fact was ultimately used in erection of bridges in Maryland. [Taxpayer] thus undertook at the time of purchase to cause and in fact did cause this steel to be transported in interstate commerce to a destination outside of Pennsylvania. [Taxpayer’s] activities constituted a ‘resale’ within the <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>meaning of clause (h)(2) and hence did not fall within the taxing provisions of the statute.”</p>

The instant situation constitutes a resale, says the majority, because it involves “the physical incorporation of personal property as an ingredient or constituent into other personal property . . . which the person incorporating such property has undertaken at the time of purchase to cause to be transported in interstate commerce to a destination outside this Commonwealth.” It is clear to me that appellee <em>cub the time of purchase </em>did not undertake to cause the steel it bought to be transported in interstate commerce to a destination outside this Commonwealth. The quoted language obviously refers to a situation where the purchaser orders the shipment to be shipped directly from the vendor to an out-of-state location.
