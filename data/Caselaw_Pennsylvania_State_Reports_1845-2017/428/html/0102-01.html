    <p id="b207-12" data-blocks='[["BL_207.21",207,[141,1721,1151,369]]]'>Once again we are faced with a type of case that has unfortunately become all too typical. After a 1958 plea of guilty to murder, appellant Sank West was sentenced to 10 to 20 years imprisonment. The record of this proceeding failed to show any examination by the trial court made in an attempt to determine whether West’s plea was intelligently and voluntarily made.</p>

    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[209,533,1167,1123]]]'>At the hearing below West testified that, although he had been twice interviewed by his two court appointed counsel, these discussions were confined to an exploration of the facts surrounding the offense and never touched upon the consequences of a guilty plea. According to West, when the court en banc asked him how he wished to plead, he answered guilty on the advice of counsel given at that instant. West’s version was completely contradicted by both of appellant’s trial counsel, who insisted that they explained, inter alia, the consequences of a plea of guilty, the possibility of a jury trial, the acts which constituted the crimes for which West had been indicted and the offenses included therein, and the permissible range of sentence for each offense. The hearing judge accepted counsel’s version, and thus found that West’s plea was intelligently and knowingly entered. Since the burden of demonstrating that his plea was constitutionally infirm rested upon West, see <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Hill, <a href="/pa/427/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="427 Pa. 614" data-case-ids="1910406" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0614-01">427 Pa. 614</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20347" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="235 A.2d 347">235 A. 2d 347</a> (1967), we affirm the decision below.</p>

Appellant advances for our consideration a prophylactic rule that failure of the trial judge to conduct an on the record colloquy with the prisoner sufficient to demonstrate that the prisoner has entered his plea with the con<a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>stitutionally required degree of voluntariness<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in and of itself must result in a holding that the plea does not meet constitutional requirements. His brief insists : “The instant case presents an excellent example of the wisdom of adopting the suggested rule. The only present alternative to the trial court’s undertaking to make the defendant aware of the consequences of his plea, and its making a record of such efforts, is the type of proceeding . . . [below], i.e., one involving directly contrary testimony by a prisoner convinced that he has served more time than would have resulted from a jury trial and by counsel, anxious to preserve their professional reputations, attempting to the best of their ability to recall what had occurred many, many years before.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The trial court, faced with a silent record, must either choose to disbelieve what appears to be credible and internally consistent testimony by the prisoner that he was never examined as to the consequences of his plea or grant the relief requested. The task of our trial courts would thus be immeasurably <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>eased if a sufficient on the record examination is available to refute the prisoner’s contentions.
