On the day of arrest he was questioned by police and a statement was obtained. Some time on the morning of the following day Dickerson was given a preliminary hearing before a magistrate and a commitment order was signed placing Dickerson in the hands of the prison authorities “there safely to keep to answer at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Apparently dissatisfied with Dickerson’s responses during the first interrogation, the district attorney obtained a “bring-up” order<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> on the afternoon of the 20th to have Dickerson taken from prison to police headquarters for further questioning. This second period of interrogation produced a statement which was substantially more in<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>criminating than that first obtained; this statement was admitted over strenuous objection at Dickerson’s trial.</p>

Dickerson strenuously contends, and I agree, that this procedure was a sufficient violation of his constitutional rights to warrant the grant of a new trial.</p>

Ct. 1050 (1963) clearly demonstrates that a preliminary hearing is a critical stage in the proceedings if the prisoner will be put at a substantial disadvantage in the absence of counsel. Our cases usually classify the preliminary hearing as noncritical because nothing, as a rule, there occurs to the detriment of the prisoner. However, if a preliminary hearing can be a critical stage when assistance of counsel is necessary to protect an indigent’s rights, would counsel’s services have not been equally efficacious in contesting what to me is an illegal bring-up order, an order issued after the preliminary hearing stage had been passed?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

I believe that this position is a distortion of the holding of <em>Massiah v. United States, </em><a href="/us/377/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="377 U.S. 201" data-case-ids="6166804" data-case-paths="/us/377/0333-01">377 U.S. 201</a>, <a href="/us/377/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="377 U.S. 201" data-case-ids="6166804" data-case-paths="/us/377/0333-01">84 S. Ct. 1199</a> (1964). In <em>Massiah, </em>defendant, after indictment and while released on bail, made incriminating statements which were overheard by police through use of a listening device. Holding that these statements could not be employed at Massiali’s trial because they were obtained in the absence of counsel, the Court adopted the position of the concurring Justices in <em>Spano v. New York, </em><a href="/us/360/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="360 U.S. 315" data-case-ids="8889" data-case-paths="/us/360/0315-01">360 U.S. 315</a>, <a href="/us/360/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="360 U.S. 315" data-case-ids="8889" data-case-paths="/us/360/0315-01">79 S. Ct. 1202</a> (1959). It thus insists (<a href="/us/377/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="377 U.S. 201" data-case-ids="6166804" data-case-paths="/us/377/0333-01">377 U.S. at 204</a>, 84 S. Ct. at 1202) : “[T]he Constitution require[s] reversal of the conviction upon the sole and specific ground that the confession had been deliberately elicited by the police after the defendant had been indicted, and therefore at a time when he was clearly entitled to a lawyer’s help. . . [A] Constitution which guarantees a defendant the aid of counsel at such a trial could surely vouchsafe no less to an indicted defendant under interrogation by the police in a completely extrajudicial proceeding.” This Court in <em>Mount </em>fastened upon the Supreme Court’s mention of the indictment to hold that only post-indictment questioning violates the retroactive command of <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em><a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">372 U.S. 335</a>, <a href="/us/372/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="372 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="1765333" data-case-paths="/us/372/0335-01">83 S. Ct. 792</a> (1963). I do not believe that such a distinction between post-preliminary hearing and post-indictment questioning is tenable nor do I believe that the Supreme Court in <em>Massiah </em>intended such a distinction. For me, the pro<a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>bative difference is that the prisoner has been placed in the charge of the prison authorities (or is on bail) ; that he is being held either under the authority of a preliminary hearing or under an indictment is a distinction for these purposes without a legally relevant difference. Post-preliminary hearing interrogation in the absence of counsel contravenes the basic dictates of fairness in the conduct of criminal litigation to the same extent as post-indictment interrogation. The essential inquiry is whether Dickerson had progressed sufficiently far into the criminal process that counsel became mandatory; certainly, if the preliminary hearing itself can be sufficiently far, post-preliminary hearing questioning must be as well. The police, having completed their investigation, should be disentitled from further contact with the prisoner unless this contact is effectuated by legal process-—and legal process, a fortiori, would here require counsel.</p>
    <p id="b674-4" data-blocks='[["BL_674.5",674,[216,1293,1159,916]]]'>Finally, I do not believe that either Dickerson’s direct appeal or his collateral attack without the aid of counsel can be deemed a waiver of his right to litigate on the basis of <em>White </em>and <em>Massiah </em>the validity of the bring-up order and the subsequent questioning. Both of these decisions followed Dickerson’s direct appeal and <em>Massiah </em>was announced after the collateral attack. The collateral proceeding, conducted in the absence of counsel, should not be considered a waiver of these claims. See <em>Commonwealth v. Kizer, </em><a href="/pa/428/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="428 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="1912382" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0099-01">428 Pa. 99</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20515" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="236 A.2d 515">236 A. 2d 515</a> (1967). Furthermore, the direct appeal cannot work a waiver for counsel cannot waive grounds for relief now retroactive but of which he had no knowledge at the time of appeal. The Constitution does not demand such prescience. See <em>O’Connor v. </em>Ohio, <a href="/us/385/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="385 U.S. 92" data-case-ids="11334480" data-case-paths="/us/385/0092-01">385 U.S. 92</a>, <a href="/us/385/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="385 U.S. 92" data-case-ids="11334480" data-case-paths="/us/385/0092-01">87 S.
