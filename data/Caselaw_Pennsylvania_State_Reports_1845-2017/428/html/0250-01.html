Bosses, member of the B’nai B’rith, executed an application form for certain insurance benefits under a Major Medical Plan offered by the Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company to members of B’nai B’rith, and, in due course, a certificate of insurance was issued to him. Within the two-year period provided under the policy, the insurance company filed an action in equity to rescind the insurance policy on the basis that Bosses had withheld from his answers on the application form certain medical history which indicated he had suffered in the past from a subtotal gastrectomy and a ventral hernia, also arthritis, fibrositis of the left arm, prostatic hypertrophy and disc trouble to his back, none of which medical information the Company alleged had been disclosed by Bosses in his application.</p>

The Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. The plaintiff appealed.</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[223,689,1157,319]]]'>Paragraph 2 of Part C of the policy states: “Sicknesses for which the Member has received medical treatment or advice prior to the date of application will not be covered unless full disclosure of such medical treatment or advice was made on the application, and the Company issued a Certificate.”</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.6",356,[225,1020,1159,749]]]'>If the applicant misrepresented himself in the application the most the insurance company can exact is refusal to pay benefit for the sicknesses in controversy, i.e., the arthritis, fibrositis, etc. The insurance company, however, does not stop with merely denying coverage for the indicated infirmities. It seeks to cancel the entire policy. For a broken finger it wishes to saw off an arm. This it cannot do because the clear language of the policy does not permit it. If failure to disclose certain medical information was to work a forfeiture of the entire policy, that contingency could have been, and should have been, so stated. The fact that it was not so declared is evidence that such a drastic termination of the policy was never intended.</p>

Nowhere in the policy is the phrase “evidence of individual insurability” defined. However, accepting the face meaning of the words, the only possible interpretation is that, should the company question insurability of the applicant, he will be required to demonstrate that he is insurable under the terms of the application. Should he fail to submit that proof, his application will be rejected <em>unless the insurance company waives evidence of insurability.</em>

Obviously, by notice from the company. But the company here directed no communication to the applicant after he had signed his application. But, the company argues, the application itself is “evidence of individual insurability” and, since that evidence was allegedly false, there was no insurability, and no waiver of the requirement. This argument ignores language, logic, and lucidity. The first sentence in paragraph 2, Part J of the master policy states: “The Company reserves the right to require each Member to furnish, at no expense to the Company, evidence of individual insurability satisfactory to the Company.”</p>

They should not he allowed, then, later on, to rescind their contract because they conclude that they have insured a bad risk. The company here was dealing not with an individual insurance policy, but with an international men’s service organization with a potential of tens of thousands of individual certificates of insurance, which involved the prospect of hundreds of thousands of dollars of insurance premiums. In order to obtain this lucrative business, the company made offers, it assured waivers, it cannot now throw off the ship of insurability those who cannot swim when they announced that swimming was not a requirement for insurability.</p>

Appellee Bosses filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer arguing that by the terms of the master policy under which the certificate was issued to the appellee, right of rescission for nondisclosure was excluded. The court below sustained the preliminary objections, on two grounds. The first was that appellant had elected the remedy of no coverage for nondisclosure, and that remedy precluded rescission for nondisclosure. The second was that the policy provided that no statement by the policyholder should avoid the policy if evidence of individual insurability is waived by the company, and that appellant, by failure to ask for evidence of individual insurability, had waived it. The majority opinion affirms the decree of the court below for the same reasons as those relied upon by the chancellor.</p>

The majority relies first on Paragraph 2 of Part C of the policy, which states: “Sicknesses for which the Member has received medical treatment or advice prior to the date of application will not be covered unless full disclosure of such medical treatment or advice was made on the application, and the Company issued a Certificate.” The majority holds that by providing this remedy for nondisclosure, the company, by the maxim, <em>expressio unius est exelusio alterius, </em>excludes all others. Yet that maxim has no application where, as here, the remedy expressed and the remedy allegedly excluded differ in tlieir scope. Under no circumstances could the company rescind after two years, since under Part J, Paragraph 8, the policy was incontestable after that period. However, Part C, Paragraph 2, excludes from coverage noudisclosed illnesses <em>even after the noneon</em>

The majority states that the company’s failure to question the insurability of appellant constituted a waiver of individual insurability. In my view, the majority’s starting point is all wrong. In the usual situation, evidence of individual insurability is required. Silence on the part of the company as to evidence of individual insurability, when there is no duty to speak, can hardly constitute waiver. Appellant provides a logical interpretation of “waiver of individual insurability”. Appellee was insured under a group policy. Under the terms of the group policy, if a certain percentage of participation by the group was reached, then for a period of time, an “open enrollment” period was allowed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Under open enroll-<a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>merit, any eligible member (a member of the group and under 70 years of age) must be issued unrestricted coverage.

The clauses quoted by the majority do not prove that the application is not evidence of individual insurability; they are perfectly' consistent with the application’s constituting evidence of individual insurability.
