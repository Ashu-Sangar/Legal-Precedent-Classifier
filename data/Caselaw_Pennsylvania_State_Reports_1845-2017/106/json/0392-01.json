Westmoreland Coal Company\u2019s Appeal, 4 Norris, 344, and cases there cited. The will of the testatrix, which we are called upon to construe, expressly authorized the trustees therein named if they deemed it proper, to \u201clease the Newport farm for coal mining purposes.\u201d In the exercise of that discretion the trustees did lease and are receiving the rents, income and profits therefrom. The testatrix devised to the trustees \u201c all the rest, residue and remainder of her estate, real, personal and mixed,\u201d which included the Newport farm, in trust for \u201cthe use, property and benefit\u201d of her grandson. The trustees to apply \u201cthe annual income and proceeds thereof\u201d to his support, maintenance and advancement until he should arrive at the age of twenty-two years, and thereafter to pay over to him \u201cthe hnnual income and proceeds of any accumulations thereof yearly during his natural life,\u201d remainder over. We think the authority to lease the land for coal mining purposes, indicates very clearly an intent of the testatrix to make the proceeds a part of the annual income to be paid over to her grandson as the life tenant. It follows the court was correct in the conclusion at which it arrived. The assignments are not sustained.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants, to be paid out of trust funds.",

    "head_matter": "Appeal of L. D. Shoemaker et al.\n1. A tenant for life when not expressly precluded may not only work \u2022 open mines, but may work them to exhaustion.\n2. A testatrix by her will devised land to a trustee for the use and benefit of her grandson for life and gave her trustee power to lease the land \u201cfor coal mining purposes.\u201d The trustee leased \u201call the coal and veins or strata of coal in, under and upon \u201d the land referred to \u201c for such term as may be necessary and required to mine and remove all the workable coal in and under said lands \u201d for a specified annual rent or royalty.\nHeld, that the rent or royalty paid to the trustee under this lease was income of the trust estate and payable as such to the testatrix\u2019s grandson as tenant for life.\nApril 18,1884.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.\nAppeal from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Luzerne County, in the matter of the estate of Nancy S. Drake, deceased: Of January Term, 1884, No. 382.\nThis case arose upon the petition of Willie Drake Loomis for a citation to L. D. Shoemaker, trustee under the will of said Nancy S. Drake,-deceased, and George K. Powell, guardian of the minor children of the petitioner, to show cause why certain coal rents received by L. D. Shoemaker as said trustee, should not be paid to the petitioner.. The facts as they appeared from the petition and the answer of Shoemaker and Powell were as follows-: Nancy S. Drake died on January 11, 1872, leaving a last will and codicil thereto dated January 13, 1865, and December 2, 1868, respectively, by which she gave and devised all her residuary estate to a trustee to be appointed by the proper court, in trust to apply the .annual income and proceeds thereof for the support of her grandson, Willie Drake Loomis, until he should attain the age of twenty-two years, and upon his arrival at said age to pay over to him the net annual income and proceeds of any accumulations thereof during his natural life and upon his death to pay, transfer and convey the said estate to the children of the said Willie Drake Loomis, with remainders over in default of children living at his death. Of this will, L. D. Shoemaker was duly appointed trustee by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Luzerne county. The testatrix died seised inter alia of a farm of 100 acres of land in Newport township as to which she directed: \u201c I order and direct that my farm of 100 acres in Newport township and likewise the place where I now live on Main street, shall under no circumstances be sold during the life of my said grandson, Willie Drake Loomis, but my trustees may if they deem it proper lease the Newport farm for coal mining purposes.\u201d Shoemaker, acting as said trustee, on October 19, 1881, \u201cgranted, leased and to mine let\u201d to the Alden Coal Company \u201c all the coal and vein or strata of coal in, under and upon all these two certain tracts or pieces of land \u201d referred to by the testatrix as her \u201cNewport farm,\u201d for such term \u201cas may be necessary and required to mine and remove all the workable coal in and under said lands,\u201d under and according to the terms and provisions of the lease, reserving a fixed rent or royalty for specified quantities of coal to be mined in each year.\nWillie Drake Loomis, the petitioner, attained the age of twenty-two in August, 1865, and at the date of his petition had two minor children whose guardian was George K. Powell, one of the respondents. It appeared that Shoemaker as trustee had received as rent under this lease the sum of $375 which he refused to pay over to the petitioner on the ground that it constituted either a part of the corpus or principal of the estate of Nancy S. Drake or the accumulation of income, to the annual income or proceeds of which only would the petitioner be entitled under the said will.\nAfter hearing on petition and answer the Orphans\u2019 Court ordered and decreed that the respondent account and pay over to the petitioner the amount admitted by his answer to be in his hands, to wit, the sum of three hundred and seventy-five dollars: Whereupon the respondents, L. D. Shoemaker, trustee, and George K. Powell, guardian aforesaid, took this appeal, assigning for error the entry of this decree by the court.\nGeorge K. Powell, for the appellants.\nThe lease of the exclusive right to mine and remove all the minerals in land without limitation as to quantity or time is a sale of the mineral in place, and therefore a sale of a part of the land : Caldwell v. Fulton, 7 Casey, 475; Harlan v. Lehigh Coal Co., 11 Casey, 287; Stoughton\u2019s Appeal, 7 Norris, 198; Scranton v. Phillips, 13 Norris, 22.\nJ. V. Darling, (with whom were George B. Kulp and E. P. Darling), for the appellee.\nThe authority of the trustee to execute the lease in the form in which it appears, cannot be questioned. He is specifically empowered to lease the \u201c Newport Farm \u201d property \u201c for coal mining purposes.\u201d This is not a mere power to lease land, which might not cover a lease of coal: Stoughton\u2019s Appeal, 7 Nor., 198. Here the testatrix contemplates an exhaustion of the coal by means of mining operations conducted under a lease, and directly authorizes a lease for that purpose. The rent or royalty paid under such a lease is income : Eley\u2019s Appeal, 7 Out., 300. The will, moreover, contains a trust for accumulation, which has always been regarded as one of the most certain indiaii of intention: Eley\u2019s Appeal, supra. Especially does this rule apply here, where the trust is expressly limited to endure for the minority of the cestui que trust. The rents of a coal mine have always been considered as income and belong to the tenant for life: Stoughton v. Leigh, 1 Taunton, 410; Neel v. Neel, 7 Harris, 323; Irwin v. Covode, 12 Harris, 162; Griffin v. Fellows, 32 P. F. S., 114; Westmoreland Coal Co.\u2019s Appeal, 4 Norris, 344.\nMay 12, 1884."
