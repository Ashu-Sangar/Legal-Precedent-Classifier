These points are much alike, and we answer them together, as follows: If the jury are clearly convinced from the evidence, beyond hesitation and doubt, that the note held by Mr. Phillips against the Forge Company, was transferred to Mr. Meily for collection only, and was not sold to him, and that in consequence thereof, and induced thereby, he gave the note in suit, the plaintiff cannot recover. If the jury are in doubt upon this subject, the note must stand, and be en<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>forced as it is written. We also refer the jury to the general charge for fuller instructions.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b554-6" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[203,583,1186,784]]]'>Now, you must decide, from all the evidence in the case, looking at it in whatever light the transactions throw upon it, which of all these allegations is true. If the allegation of the plaintiff is true, and the note was sold to Mr. Meily, under the circumstances detailed by the plaintiff, the fact that he was not able to collect anything upon it, is no defence; if he bought the paper he took the risk; if he failed to collect it, it is of no consequence here. If he bought the Forge note and paid for it, giving his note in payment for it, he must now pay his note. [On the other hand, if he did not buy the note, but if, as he says, it was simply transferred to him for collection, and the note in suit was given to Mr. Phillips as a memorandum, in the way and for the purpose detailed to you, then to allow a recovery on that note, as if it was an absolute transaction, would be such a fraud as the law would not tolerate, and as juries would not enforce.] So it is a question on the evidence, and a matter for you to determine; and as such we submit the case to you upon the evidence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b554-7" data-blocks='[["BL_554.6",554,[197,1368,1185,1082]],["BL_555.1",555,[182,415,1181,522]]]'>Now, the principles upon which you are to determine it, are well settled, as we understand it. When parties put their engagements in writing, the writing is not to be lightly set aside. It is the best evidence of the transaction, and in many instances, it is the only evidence which the law allows to be given ; it is the only evidence, except in cases of fraud, accident or mistake, speaking generally. [In such cases as the present, evidence by word of mouth is received to establish an allegation that the instrument is being used for a different purpose from that for which it was originally given.] But that evidence must be clear and positive. It must clearly convince the jury of its truth, and it must convince the jury beyond hesitation or doubt. If, after looking at all the evidence in the case — after taking into consideration the testimony of the parties, and the testimony of the note itself, which is an absolute promise to pay upon its face — if you have any hesitation or doubt as to the defence which has been set up, it will be your duty to find in favor of the plaintiff, for the burden of proof is upon the defendant, to show by clear and positive testimony that the note, which, upon its face, appears to be a positive promise to pay, is not to be enforced. If parties do not put their true engagements in writing, they must, of course, suffer the consequences. If they put in writing a transaction which they afterwards say was not the true transaction, they must be content to sustain 'the burden of showing <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>to the jury, under legal principles, what the true character of the transaction was. And the law has said, and has said very wisely, that where a contract is in writing, plain, and clear, and simple, upon its face, as this one is, that before it can be overturned, the evidence must be of the character described to you — clear, convincing and positive; clearly convincing the jury, beyond hesitation and doubt. Of course, that does not mean that there shall be no contradictory evidence in the case; it does not mean that all the witnesses shall testify in one way; it means that the evidence given in support of the defence, if believed by the jury, must be of the character that I have indicated — clear, positive, and clearly convincing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[183,937,1175,171]]]'>You must apply those principles to the determination of this case, in view of the evidence.

As was well observed by our brother Trunkey in the recent case of Juniata Building and Loan Association <em>v. </em>Hetzel, 7 Out., 507: “Now that parties are competent witnesses, each may oppose his oath to the others, and certainly when written contracts or obligations are sought to be impeached by defences purely equitable, the reason is stronger than formerly for enforcing the rules of evidence applicable to cases in equity.”</p>

To the latter class belong Renshaw <em>v. </em>Gans, 7 Barr, 117; Rearich <em>v. </em>Swinehart, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20233" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Jones 233">1 Jones, 233</a>, and Lippincott <em>v. </em>Whitman, 2 Norris, 244. The case last cited was a scire facias upon a mortgage, which by its terms was payable in one year. The defendant filed an affidavit of defence in which she set forth that she had agreed to give a mortgage payable in three years; that when she came to sign the papers she discovered that it had been made payable in one year; that she objected to signing it for this reason, and was only induced to do so upon the plaintiff’s assurance that he would not foreclose until the expiration of three years. Having sued it out at the expiration of one year, this court held that it was a fraud to attempt to enforce it at that time. Here there was an oral stipulation without which the paper would not have been signed. The same is true of Hoopes <em>v. </em>Beale, 9 Norris, 82, and nearly, if not quite, all of the cases cited for defendant. There is not a word to show that the <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>note in controversy was signed by the defendant upon the faith of any assurance or promise on the part of the plaintiff that he would not proceed to collect it, or use or treat it as a promissory note. On the contrary, the defendant, when he received the note of the Forge Company, of his own motion drew up, signed and delivered to the plaintiff the note in suit without anything being said by either party as to the use to which it was to be applied. The defendant’s testimony amounts to no more than that the note was not to be paid according to its terms, but only upon the contingency that he should be able to collect another note from the Union Forge Company, That such evidence is no defence was decided in Hill <em>v. </em>Gaw, 4 Barr, 493; Anspach <em>v. </em>Best, 2 P. F. S., 356; Hacker <em>v. </em>The National Oil Refining Company, 23 P. F. S., 92; Heist <em>v. </em>Hart, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20233" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Jones 233">Id., 286</a>.</p>
    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[202,1064,1178,819]]]'>There is, however, another and more serious difficulty, in the way of the defendant. The defence set up, if it amounts to anything, must be sufficient to reform the note, and the evidence must be strong enough to justify a chancellor in doing so. It is only where a chancellor would reform the instrument that parol evidence is admissible to contradict it. It is true, under our practice in Pennsylvania, it is accomplished through common law forms. But the fact remains that the defence set up is purely equitable, and the Judge ought not to submit the case to the jury unless the evidence is such that he would feel himself bound as a chancellor to reform the instrument. With our modification of the English rule, now too firmly embedded in our system to be disturbed, and our Act of Assembly which makes every defendant a competent witness, the principle above stated is about all there is left to preserve the sanctity and force of an instrument of writing, whether that instrument be a deed, which is the evidence of a man’s title to his home, or an obligation for the payment of money.</p>
    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[200,1884,1176,389]]]'>Here, in addition to the plaintiff’s oath, we have the persuasive evidence furnished by the note Itself. Both are brushed away by the oath of the defendant. No chancellor would reform a writing upon such testimony as is here presented. The rule is that a chancellor invariably refuses to decree on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness: Brawdy <em>v. </em>Brawdy, 7 Barr, 157. The learned Judge should have withdrawn the case from the jury by a binding instruction to find for the plaintiff.</p>
