Wright, Jr. The name of the lessee is A. J. Davis. The name of the person with whom the claimant made this contract is John F. Jones, but the labor done by the claimant was for the use and benefit of the said A. J. Davis. The sum of money claimed to be due is seventy-five and seven-liundreths ($75.07) dollars. The labor done was boring, drilling and mining a rock tunnel by the claimant in the capacity of minor, in the certain coal mine operated by the said lessee on the lands hereinafter described. Said tunnel commences about forty yards from the bottom of the new slope in said coal mine and runs in a southeasterly direction. The said labor was performed by claimant on thirty-two and one-half working days between the 1st day of March, 1883, and the 23d day of April, 1883. The agreed price for said labor was two and thirty one-hundredths ($2.31) dollars per day, making the total sum for such labor $75.07. The locality of the lands upon which the said labor was performed and held under lease by said A. J. Davis, is in the borough of Sugar Notch and township of Hanover, Luzerne county and state of Pennsylvania.

The difference between special and general laws exists in their application to persons and territory, irrespective of any natural conditions by which their effects are controlled. If the intention of the legislature is to confine the operation of the law to certain individuals of a class, represented in every county of the state, or to certain political divisions not unlike the political divisions to which it is made inapplicable, the method employed to effect that result, is of no consequence. The Supreme Court has decided that certain subjects , of legislation may be divided into classes, and that one class may have laws not applicable to other <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>classes. In other words that the legislature may recognize ■the distinction, which exists in the wants and necessities of different political divisions of the commonwealth, and in the various callings and professions of the people, when the people or such divisions are the subjects of legislation. This rule, however, has no application where the things classified are not the subjects of legislation, — but are used simply to effect the exclusion of some part or members of the class constituting the subjects of the legislation, from the operation of the law. Laws are not special because of the existence of conditions in nature, or of the peculiar relations of the people, which accidentally remove from its application certain territorial districts or individuals; they are obstacles to the uniform operation of human laws, which are not within the control of the legislature, and, therefore, are not to be considered in determining whether the law is general or special. The intention of the legislature and effect of the law considered without reference to causes which <em>accidentally </em>limit its application, are the elements which distinguish general from special laws.</p>
    <p id="b396-5" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[234,1245,1176,1073]]]'>Now, the Act in question has for its subject the creation or extension of liens in favor of certain persons, <em>distinguished </em>from all other persons in the commonwealth, by the <em>kind </em>of <em>labor </em>they must perform in order to be entitled to the benefits of the law. It is not applicable to every member of the class of.laborers upon whom the benefits are conferred, but every member of this class residing in counties having a population of 200,000 is by positive language excluded from its operation. As shown by the last census, there are at least two counties in the state having a population of over 200,000, viz : Philadelphia and Allegheny.

The “improvements ” specified in the Act — “ tanks, derricks, oil wells, boring, drilling, and mining ” — make it clearly evident that the provisions of this Act have no applicability, except to the oil and coal counties of the state. The limitation of their operation is geological, and not legislative. The official geological surveys of the state, and of which the courts will take judicial notice, determined long since the situation of our mineral deposits and petroleum springs. The legislature did not insert this proviso to prevent the mechanics of Philadelphia and Pittsburg from engaging in the “ construction or erection ” of these leasehold improvements; that proviso, obviously of no practical force, was inserted because, in 1878, an Act was passed similar in its general character to the Act now being considered, <em>but restricted in its operations to cities of the first class. </em>The class limitation is the same, but in the reverse order. No attempt has been made to have this Act of 1878 declared unconstitutional ; on the contrary, it is spoken of, in a leading text book as of “ unquestioned validity ”: 2 Troubat &amp; H. Prac., § 1996. If, however, the proviso is invalid, that alone will fail, and the rest will be valid. The authorities are numerous that an inapplicable and idle proviso to an Act must be set aside and declared invalid, rather than that the body of the text should be rejected, and the object of the statute fail.

That declares “all persons performing labor for or about the construction or erection of any engine, engine house, derrick, tank, buildings, machinery, wood or iron improvements, constructed or erected upon any leasehold, held’ either by written or verbal lease, or for boring, drilling, or mining, on any lease or lot as aforesaid, for the development or improvement of the same, whether such labor is or may be done by the day, month .or year, or by contract, for the tenant or tenants, lessee or lessees, of such lot, or lease, or parcel of land or for their use or benefit, shall have a lien upon such engine or engines, engine house, derrick, tank, building, machinery, wood or iron improvements, oil wells and fixtures on said lot or leasehold of ground, and upon such lot or leasehold itself, for the price and value of such work and labor: Provided that the lien hereby given, shall extend only as to such lease or lot, to the interest of the lessee or lessees, tenant or tenants therein.” By section sixth of the Act it is further “ Provided that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to counties having a population of over two hundred thousand inhabitants.”</p>
    <p id="b398-8" data-blocks='[["BL_398.8",398,[212,1569,1185,129]]]'>Art. III. section 7 of the Constitution declares “ the General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law, authorizing the creation, extension, or impairing of liens.”</p>
    <p id="b398-9" data-blocks='[["BL_398.9",398,[209,1699,1172,426]]]'>The main contention is whether the Act. of 1879 is in conflict with this clause of the Constitution? It shows on its face that it was not intended to apply, and does not apply to the whole State. It assumes what was a well known fact, that some of the counties had each a population greater than 200,000. In the counties of Philadelphia and Allegheny, that greater population had been legally found by the census of 1870. The constantly increasing population verified by the census of 1880, sufficiently shows that at the passage of the Act the one had a population of 800,000, and the other of over 340,000.</p>

It did apply to a great number of counties ; but there is no dividing line between a local, and a general, statute. It must be either the one or the other. If it apply to the whole state it is general. If to a part only, it is local. 'As a legal principle it is as effectually local when it applies to sixty-five counties out of the sixty-seven, as if it <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>applied to one county only. The exclusion of a single county from the operation of the Act makes it local.</p>
    <p id="b399-4" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[199,518,1174,515]]]'>By the terms of this Act, the laborers in the two most populous counties of the state, although they perform the same kind of labor, are as effectually debarred from its operation, as if those counties were designated by name, or were outside of the boundaries of the state. It gives to laborers in some counties rights, powers, and privileges, which it denies to the same class of laborers, performing the same kind of labor in other counties. It is not only local and special, but odious in its discrimination. It is in most clear and palpable violation of the constitution, which expressly withholds from the legislature all power to create or extend a lien by a local and special law.</p>
    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.5",399,[198,1033,1164,420]]]'>The difficulty here, is not that of classification only; within reasonable limits and for some purposes classification is allowable. It has been sustained on the basis of population of counties on the assumption that those having a small population, may ultimately have one much larger. Here the larger are excluded. We cannot assume that their population will ever be reduced to less than the number named. They are therefore practically and permanently excluded by the intent and purpose of this Act, which is special in its terms and local in its effect.</p>
    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.6",399,[195,1464,1167,289]]]'>It was contended on the argument that the validity of this Act was affirmed in Wilson <em>v. </em>Whitcomb, 4 Out., 547.
