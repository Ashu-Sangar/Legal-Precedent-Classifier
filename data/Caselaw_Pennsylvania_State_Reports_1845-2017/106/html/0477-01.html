Although this fact is not seriously denied, yet the Commonwealth has proved by the evidence of Dr. John G. Lee, the coroner’s physician, that he made a post mortem upon the body of a female on the 5th day of April, 1880, which body was identified by Joseph A. Souder as the body of Mrs. Elizabeth E. Goersen. If you believe those witnesses, we must proceed to consider (2) the evidence by which the vital fact is sought to be established that a deadly poison was found in the body. Dr. Lee testified that, with what appears to be reasonable caution, he took portions of the body of Mrs. Goersen and delivered them to an expert chemist, Dr. Henry Leffmau. This witness swears that he subjected the contents of the stomach and a portion of the liver to seven distinct tests, and produced and exhibited to you the result of his experiment. In each there appeared a drug commonly known as arsenic.</p>

Both of the physicians declare that the arsenic found was administered in sufficient quantities to produce death, and that it did so produce the death of Mrs. Goersen.</p>

I leave all this evidence for your consideration, with the remark that the commonwealth must establish the fact that Mrs. Goersen was poisoned and died from the effect of poison by arsenic..

In addition to this, evidence is produced to prove that, although the legal title is vested in Mrs. Goersen, under a family arrangement, her father had an equitable interest in the property. The will of the father is- then placed in evidence, dated 24th day of November, 1876, showing what disposition he made of any estate he might possess, and this is followed by the production of the will of Mrs. Souder, dated 8th day of March, 1880, and of Mrs. Goersen, the wife of the prisoner, dated 2d day of April, <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>3880.

The defendant’s counsel cross-examined these witnesses at great length, the object being to prove that other causes might have produced this death, especially as to Mrs. Souder’s ease, whose death, it is argued, might have been accidental, and that the tests applied to her remains had not exhausted the subject: and it was also argued that Mrs. Souder might have incautiously taken an imperfectly made dose of homoeopathic arsenic, not properly mixed; while I may as well state here as elsewhere that Dr. Korndoerfer was called by the prisoner to prove, first, that for a disease such as Mrs. Souder suffered from, she might be treated with <em>arsenieum, </em>and then described the character of that drug, its strength and course of manufacture, as practised by homoeopathic physicians.

Souder, and it is so important that I will read extracts from it for your information. (Reads from notes of evidence.) In so far as the testimony of this witness in relation to the tumbler of medicine is concerned, it is corroborated by the evidence of Mrs. Eliza, Wallace and her daughter, Susan L. McVaugh, who declare that the one observed two tumblers of medicine, and the other that one tumbler contained a clear liquid, and the other something mixed up like magnesia, and white. Dr. John R. Haynes testifies that he was called to see Mrs. Goersen on Friday, April 2, 1880. Dr. Goersen himself called at the house of a brother of this witness, and then met the witness; he accompanied him to his residence, and there saw the sick woman, Mrs. Goersen. The doctor inquired of the 'condition of the patient, when he was interrupted by the prisoner with the remark that “ two weeks before she had taken cold, and had had diarrhcea.” The statement was also made to Mrs. Lambson that Mrs. Goersen had taken cold at her mother’s funeral. The patient was ver3r ill, and her condition was fully described by the physician. A nurse was ordered, a certain prescription left, containing one grain of morphine, turpentine ordered, and other remedies.

      <em>a. </em>As to the direction to obtain a death certificate for Mrs. Souder, a witness, Nicholas Biesiegel declared that he heard Mrs. Goersen herself direct, “ Albert you had better go for a doctor; my mother is very sick, and in case she dies you cannot give a certificate.” This occurred early in March, you will remember, before, of course, the death of Mrs. Souder, and a length of time before Mrs. Goersen died.</p>

      <em>b. </em>While the evidence concerning the method by which Dr. Goersen obtained Dr. Haynes’ certificate of his wife’s death has not been disputed, a contest arises as to the method in which the commonwealth contends it was afterwards secreted, Sarah E. Souder stating that the doctor informed her he pretended to be asleep when the messenger came for it. And Mr. Buckner, that “ I think he told me it was in the sofa back; don’t recollect if he said he did do it or not.” The mother of the prisoner declares that, “ when the boy came for the certificate, Albert was asleep; I looked for the paper in his pocket, but could not find it; I did not wake up Albert, but told the boy to call again in the morning.” Nettie Miller also says, “yes, I remember the boy coming for certificate; he was lying-asleep ; we thought he was.”</p>

Again, a witness for the commonwealth having testified that, upon the delivery of the certificate of Mrs. Goer-sen’s death, the prisoner, with certain manifestations, exhibited by the witness, Mrs. Lambson, on the stand, by gestures declared, “ good; I can now put her away without any trouble, as I have two, one of my own and the other of Dr. Haynes.” The defence called the mother of the prisoner to prove that this was not the case. She says: I was present when R. Steinecke returned with the certificate; he said, here is the certificate ; he wrapped it up and put it in his pocket; lie did not say‘good;’ he did not say such a thing.” Raymond Steinecke, being also called, said that when he gave him the certificate he put it in his pocket, and did not say good; he made no remark at all.</p>

The prisoner’s mother had that afternoon said it was best to notify the coroner; I told him it was too late, and he said ‘all right.’” Mrs. Goersen, mother of the prisoner’, upon this point says: “Neighbors came and told me what was said; I told my son that if he was clear of that what they say, they should send for the coroner; he said ‘ all right, I should send for him.’ ” Dr. Lee, upon cross-examination, had said that the prisoner had remarked to him, “ I don’t wish it done.

Haynes did say that Dr. Goersen was in a semi-intoxicated condition when he saw him during the week of his wife’s death.

As a general principle, voluntary intoxication is no excuse for crime. In a case of this nature, it sometimes reduces the grade of the offence. Where one drinks until his condition is such that he is attacked with a disease called “ delirium tremens,” he is not a responsible being — he is truly insane. So where, by the long-continued use of liquor, a human being approaches a condition of idioey, with a mind so weakened as to be unable to form a design to take life, or to understand the nature and character of his own acts, and cannot distinguish between right and Avrong, he is not a responsible being. These are general conditions of the mind, produced by long-continued abuse, and ending in a practical overthrow of the reasoning powers. From whatever cause this condition of things exists, the law is that a human being reduced to a condition which renders him like an insane man or an idiot, is rather an object of pity than the subject for punishment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b502-6" data-blocks='[["BL_502.6",502,[215,2008,1170,209]]]'>But the law has never declared that a man may nerve himself by the Aroluntary use of liquor so that he may kill another, or that by the like voluntary use of liquor, Avithout a specific intent, he may put himself in a condition to do any reckless act, and then claim to be excused because of his intoxication.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b502-7" data-blocks='[["BL_502.7",502,[215,2222,1168,172]]]'>In the first instance above named the crime would be murder of the first degree, and in the second instance, murder of the second degree.

And although death by poison is declared to be murder in the first degree, yet it is evident that unless it is administered with an intent to kill, that is, with a wicked and malevolent purpose, the crime is not murder of the first degree. As where it is so administered by accident, mistake, or without what may be called an immediate criminal intent, but with a recklessness begotten of mental imbecility produced by liquor, and which deprives its victim of the power of forming a deliberate intent. “Where this ingredient is absent,where the mind, from intoxication or any other cause, is deprived of its power to form a design with deliberation and premeditation, the offence is stripped of the malignant feature required by the statute to place it on the list of capital crimes; ” and neither courts nor juries can dispense with what the statute plainly requires.</p>

L. Haynes said, “I did not smell his breath, but he walked naturally. I saw no indications of drunkenness, but I can’t swear he was sober.” I. Hampton Moore was afterwards called to contradict this witness, and said, “ that at the last trial, the doctor had said the prisoner was in a semi-intoxicated condition during the night of his wife’s death.”</p>

Hyde declares, when he saw him, “he seemed to have been drinking.” And so also does Kerbaugh declare, when he said, “ that when Goersen attempted to push them down stairs he was in liquor.” In addition to this evidence the prisoner produces a number of witnesses to prove his intoxicated condition. Among others may be mentioned his mother, who says, “ on Saturday I visited him in my son’s house; I saw him in the afternoon, and he looked like a crazy man.” Robert Adams declared, “ I saw him a week before his wife died; he was pretty much under the influence of liquor; remember him on Friday night in my place; he got one or two drinks, and I refused him any more, because I thought he had enough.” Bertha Goersen, the sister of the prisoner, said, “he was drinking during day and evening the week just before his wife’s death.” Nettie Miller says, “ I saw Albert at his mother’s occasionally. I did not know what to think of him, he acted so queer and noisy.” She added again, “ he drank a great deal,” and then described the unlocking of a closet door, and the taking out of a bottle, a scene which, I think, the prisoner’s mother had already described, or another very like it. Louisa Rotheimer also says, “ he was always drunk; ” while Louisa Ratzkey describes the occasion of his visit to her house on Friday before his wife died, when he prescribed medicine for her sick child, which, because of his condition, she refused to use and burned.
