The court charged as follows : “If that fact, standing by itself, was proved to your entire satisfaction, that the note was given under those circumstances and was to be returned again, .....then I say to you that tho plaintiff would have no right to use the note as evidence of indebtedness against the defendant. But the burden is upon the defendant.

In the above action on this note the court further instructed the jury, that the making of said agreement by the parties to the note, and the absence of any testimony that the maker then demanded that the note be returned to him, was a significant circumstance as bearing on the credibility of a witness who had testified that the payee of the note, five years before, had acknowledged that it was made under the circumstances referred to in paragraph 3 (supra). <em>Held, </em>to be error.</p>

Oyer, then, in such case, we say to you, that John J. Oyer became liable for his portion so paid from the moment the payments were made by William Ott. [If such payments, or any of them, were made more than six years prior to April 1879, and the debts thus made were not revived by an acknowledgment on the part of John J. Oyer, consistent with a promise to pay, made within the said six years prior to, then I say to you that all payments made more than six years prior to December 1879 are barred by the statute of limitation. According to the testimony, as I recollect it, there are but two items where the money was paid within six years, viz.: the tax of $16.80 and the Peter Frutchey judgment of $585. If you believe, according to the testimony of Bogardus, that this note was to be returned, then there can be no recovery by the plaintiff, but there may be a certificate in favor of the defendant. If you should reject the testimony of Bogardus, then you will determine the actual amount for which the note should stand as corrected, according to the intentions and declarations of the parties, and the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict for that amount, with interest on the same from April 1, 1873, up to the date when the payment was made by William Ott upon the judgment held by Frutchey, then deducting one-half of said payment and calculating interest on the balance up to date when tax was paid.

Our defence was that the note was without consideration, that there was no settlement between Wm, Ott and John J. Oyer, and no balance was ascertained between them; that the note was not intended to be retained as such, but having served a temporary purpose was to be returned. We were only bound to satisfy the jury of the facts constituting our defence by the weight of evidence. The court said to the jury that we must establish it to their entire satisfaction, and by evidence in which they had implicit confidence. In other words, we were required to demonstrate our defence to a certainty. The expression, entire satisfaction, excludes all doubt, and is even stronger than the proof implied in the phrase, “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Even if our defence should be considered as involving the element of fraud, this instruction was too strict: Young <em>v. </em>Edwards, 22 P. F. S., 257 ; Greenleaf on Ev., vol. 1, p. 18, § 18; Hiester <em>v. </em>Laird, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 245" data-case-ids="1852569" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0245-01">1 W. &amp; S., 245</a>. The error complained of in the second and third specifications is that the court misled the jury as to the proper test of the credibility of Dr. Bogardus. The impression conveyed by the court is that Bogardus was contradicted, and the jury were virtually told to consider the testimony of Ott and Phillips as if they had given different versions of the same conversation. The court further assumes that Oyer must always have been consistent with himself in his declarations on this subject on all occasions, and that he could not have made a declaration less favorable to himself on one occasion than another. The error complained of in the fifth and sixth assignments is that the court confined the whole of the defendant’s defence to the testimony of Bogardus, and made it dependent upon the jury’s belief in his testimony alone. The principal error complained of in the eighth and ninth assignments is that the court gave a peremptory and binding in<a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>struction that under the plea of payment as a set-off we were confined to but two items, to wit: One-hálf of the tax of $16.80 and the last Peter Frutchey judgment of $585. This was clear error. Our plea of payment, under which we were entitled to prove our counter-claim, was filed December 17, 1879. We were entitled to have the jury consider all payments of which there was any evidence whatever, made by Ott for Oyer, or moneys of Ott received by Oyer within six years prior to that date. At the conclusion of the charge the defendant proposed to send out with the jury the record of the judgments given for the purchase money of the property bought by Oyer'and Ott, and paid by the latter. The court, in the presence of the jury, refused to allow the judgments to go to the jury, except the last one, which was the one for $585. The court thus excluded from the jury material evidence, going to show the real state of the indebtedness between Oyer and Ott at the time of giving the note.</p>

No such claim, however, could be set off upon which a right of action accrued more than six years prior to the filing of the plea. This was practically the statement of law complained of in the eighth assignment, and was correct. Whether the statement of fact, wherein the court said, “ As I recollect it, there are but two items where the money was paid within six years,” was correct or not is not material.

On January 11, 1878, the parties to the note made a contract with Boyer and executed a deed to him, giving Boyer until March 15th, the right to purchase a tract of land, and upon paying the money on or before that date the deed to be delivered to him by Pearson — he refused to pay. In the contract was an agreement between Oyer and Ott that said note should be deposited with Pearson, and upon consummation of the sale of the land the note to be given to Ott for $300, but should Boyer refuse to take the land the note to be returned to Oyer. Wilson testified that there was a great controversy between Oyer and Ott about the note, one contending it was right and the other that it was wrong; that the agreement respecting it was negotiated by himself without the parties coming together, and was afterwards embodied in the contract they made with Boyer.</p>

Philips testifies that a short time after the note was given he was at Oyer’s house, that Mrs. Oyer remarked that Ott was mad about the note that was given when Daniel was home, and Oyer replied that he was willing to make the note right, it was not right, it was fixed to satisfy Daniel so there would be no bad feelings. Theodore Ott says that Oyer told him the note was not right, that Ott owed him about $300, but they had a settlement to make. This was a number of years after the note was given. Annie Ott testifies that at her father’s house, Oyer told Mrs. Ott she should take up that note, that he did not want to go to the workhouse.</p>

Daniel Oyer was a son and Ott a son-in-law of Ojmr. Whether Daniel was seriously afflicted at the time the note was given is immaterial; it is enough that his near relatives, the parties to the note, <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>.were alarmed by his conduct. The parties owned and worked a farm together, there is no evidence of a settlement of their transactions at any time — there is evidence tending to show that the note was given and received for the solace of Daniel, and not as evidence of the actual indebtedness of the maker to the payee. At first it seems the- payee admitted it was not right, but they did not settle and ascertain what, if anything, was due from Ott to Oyer, and at last they quarreled.</p>

Here there is no question of sufficiency; it is not gainsaid that there is testimony to warrant a finding that the note was given for a special and innocent purpose,- and either to be returned to the maker, or the true amount of indebtedness tobe fixed by a future settlement. With much that was proper to say of Bogardus and his testimony, the court charged: If the testimony of Bogardus is believed the note was given for a temporary purpose with a view of preventing some apprehended calamity in connection with Daniel Oyer, and was to be returned. “ If that fact, standing by itself, was proved to your entire satisfaction, that the note was given under those circumstances, and was to be returned again to William Ott after Daniel Oyer had gone away, then, I say to you that the plaintiff would have no right to use that note as evidence of indebtedness against the defendant.” “But the burden is upon the defendant. He must satisfy you by the weight of the evidence and by competent evidence, by testimony in which you have implicit confidence.” This was equivalent to an instruction that there must be no doubt resting on -the minds of the jury respecting the testimony they were to weigh or consider. True, the jury were told they were to determine the credibility of witnesses, but the fact remained that they were instructed that they must be entirely satisfied by testimony in which their confidence was implicit, that is, without doubt. Instead of the context showing that the testimony of a witness might have some weight, if they did not believe it wholly free of doubt, it intensified the force of the words. The strict measure of confidence was applied directly to Bogardus, if they believed him, the plaintiff could not recover; but if they disbelieved him they would pass to consideration of the testimony of other witnesses — if they rejected his testimony, they would determine from the testimony of the others whom the court named, whether there was a mistake in the amount of the note, and if so, what the sum should have been. In effect the jury were instructed that they must give his testimony implicit confidence, or reject it. The credit of a witness may be so shaken that a jury would not rely upon his testimony alone to establish a fact, and yet <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>justly consider it with other testimony. The degree of weight to be given the testimony of each witness is for the jury, not the court.</p>

It has sometimes been said that the evidence must be clear, precise and entirely satisfactory; or full, satisfactory and indubitable; but the context showed that such expressions did not mean that it is requisite that the evidence should lead to a certain conclusion. If used, it should be manifest that the jury understood them in the sense of the rule: “ Where written instruments are sought to be reformed, juries must not hesitate or doubt; they must have clear convictions; they must believe the witnesses and must find the facts in issue definitely and distinctly established.” Absolute certainty is out of the question, where facts are to be found from oral testimony and circumstances: Spencer <em>v. </em>Colt, <a href="/pa/89/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="89 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="1063215" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0314-01">89 Pa. St., 314</a>. The jury determine facts according to the weight of evidence, and not by its sufficiency to produce conviction of the absolute certainty of the conclusion arrived at. If the evidence produces a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise fact in issue, it is sufficient. The law does not require proof so convincing as to leave no doubt resting on the minds of the jurors ; it is enough if there be evidence to satisfy an unprejudiced mind, beyond reasonable doubt: Young <em>v. </em>Edwards, <a href="/pa/72/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="72 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="434737" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0257-01">72 Pa.

The circumstances of the agreement for sale of the laud to Boyer, and of the stipulation therein relative to the note, have already been noted. Why was the attention of'the jury called especially to the fact that at the time of making that contract, Ott did not claim that the note was to be returned to him; but if the sale of the land fell, agreed that the note should be returned to Oyer, with the assertion by the court that it was a significant circumstance bearing on the credibility of the testimony of Bogarclus ? Oyer and Ott were differing so hotly about the note that their agreement respecting its deposit with Pearson was effected by a go-between. Both wanted to sell the land, and if they could make the proposed sale, one would take and the other give $300 in satisfaction of the note; but if they could not, the note to be returned to Oyer. When the note was returned, the parties stood just as they did before the making of the contract. Nothing in that agreement, or in the negotiations <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>through Wilson, ought to prejudice or benefit either party. There was no reason why Ott should then claim to have the note returned to him. The only object of its deposit was its settlement. Oyer would not deposit it to be satisfied on paj’’inent of $300, except to get Ott’s consent to sell the land. But in any view, it was not for the court to charge that the omission of Ott to claim a return of the note was a significant circumstance against the credibility of the testimony of Bogardus respecting the admissions of Oyer made five years before. Nor was there anything in the testimony of' Philips, or of Theodore Ott, to discredit Bogardus. The conversations of Oyer with these three witnesses were at different times and places, and his declarations as proved by them are consistent, though not equally full'in each instance. To each, he said the note was not right; to two of them, that it was given to satisfy Daniel; to one, that he would return it; to one, that he was willing to make it right; and to one, that Ott owed him about $300. Surely there is nothing in the testimony of any of these witnesses affecting the credibility of another. No two of them heard the same conversation, and there is no difference in the sense of contradiction.</p>
    <p id="b32-5" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[237,1335,1176,1121]],["BL_33.1",33,[195,446,1168,216]]]'>Upon one line of defence the court charged, “If then, gentlemen of the jury, you are satisfied from the testimony of Philips and Theodore Ott, that when this note was given by William Ott to John J. Oyer, they only put down an amount in round numbers — $1,800—and did so without any balancing of their accounts, and it was understood between them that this note was afterwards to be corrected and the amount fixed at the correct sum, then your inquiry will be what that amount is, and whatever that corrected amount should be, if there was any correction to be made, for that amount the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict together with interest, less any legal set-off which the defendant has established that he is entitled to in this case.” Had this not excluded the testimony of all but two witnesses, it would be free of error. Upon this point the jury had a right to consider the testimony of Bogardus, unless they disbelieved him. They might have thought him entitled to some credit. And there was other evidence corroborative of these witnesses. All the evidence tending to establish the fact in issue was for consideration of the jury, and in so far as the court excluded it, there was error. Of course, if the jury found there was nothing due to the plaintiff, they would render a verdict for defendant. The instruction did not require a verdict for plaintiff, unless a balance was due. If the defendant wanted specific instructions upon any point, he could have asked them. In his argument he complains that the court omitted to say that the testimony <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>of Philips, Theodore Ott and others was corroborative of the testimony of Bogardus, but he presented no prayer for such instruction. In absence of request the court will not be reversed for what is left unsaid, if what was said was not misleading.</p>
    <p id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.4",33,[194,661,1169,775]]]'>The learned judge charged that all payments made more than six years prior to the date of filing the plea, if not revived by acknowledgment on the part of Oyer, are barred by the statute of limitations. And added, “According to the testimony as I recollect it, there are but two items where the money was paid within six years, viz., the tax of $16.80, and the Peter Frntchey judgment of $585.” This on its face, did not prevent the jury allowing other items of set-off if the evidence warranted. But point was given to the apparently correct language, by disallowing the defendant to send out a statement with the jury containing any items except those two, because all others are barred by the statute of limitations. There was evidence tending to show that other items had been paid within six years. Refusing the statement in the presence of the jury, upon the ground stated in the objection, was an interpretation of the instruction which forbade them to allow any set-off, save the said two items, and for that interpretation the eighth assignment must be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b33-7" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[194,1436,1170,809]]]'>Allowing or disallowing the sending out with the jury of documents and statements is generally discretionary with the court. If the defendant prepared a proper statement of his claim, it is exceedingly strange that there was denial that it go with the jury. In cases like this the practice is almost, if not altogether, uniform to permit the sending out of statements. It is more difficult to conceive a reason why there was denial that the records of the judgment which had been given iu evidence be sent out. There was evidence of payments on the judgments before the date of the note. If the jury found the note was a mere security for the sum actually owing upon a settlement, without a statement and without the record of the judgments, they were poorly equipped for ascertaining the sum. Were the statements which the defendant offered to send out printed, and the specific judgments set out in the offer, the records of which were in evidence, possibly the ruling could be reviewed: Riddlesburg Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Rogers, <a href="/pa/65/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="65 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="430621" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0416-01">65 Pa.
