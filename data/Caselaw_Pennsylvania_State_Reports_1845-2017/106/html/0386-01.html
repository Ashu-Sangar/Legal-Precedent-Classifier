On July 1,1882, the executors and trustees united with the other tenants in common with their testatrix in a lease to the Lehigh Valley Coal Company, by which the lessors did “ demise, lease and to mine-let ” to the lessees “ all the coal in, under and upon ” a certain tract of land, “ together with the right to mine and remove said coal until all tlio coal in, under and upon said tract of land shall have been exhausted.” <em>A </em>rent or royalty was reserved to the lessors proportioned to the number of tons removed, and the size of the coal, as set forth below in the opinion of the court.

In its popular meaning it is strictly applicable to the periodical payments in the nature of rent, which are usually made under coal leases: Eley’s Appeal, 7 Out., 300. The testatrix distinguishes between “ interest ” and “ income ” which she defines in her will as “yearly proceeds;” and the trust for accumulation during her daughter’s minority affords a sure indication of intention: Eley’s Appeal, supra. It is settled law that the rents of an opened mine are income, and go to the tenant for life: Stoughton <em>v. </em>Leigh, 1 Taunton, 410; Neel <em>v. </em>Neel, 7 Harris, 323; Irwin <em>v. </em>Covode, 12 Harris, 162; Griffin <em>v. </em>Fellows, 32 P. F. S., 114; Westmoreland Coal Co.’s Appeal, 4 Norris, 344. Moreover, the authority to lease places the property in the same position as after testatrix had leased them in her life time : Daly <em>v. </em>Beckett, 24 Beav., 114. The reservation of the title is sufficient to make the sum to be paid rent, incident to the reversion. The strongest and most familiar illustration of this is the common ground-rent deed. There the entire subject of the grant passes to the vendee, subject to the payment of an annual rent, which is incident to the reversion. The sum to be paid, or the consideration, is still <em>rent. </em>Such a grant, indeed, cannot be made under a power to sell; because that is not what is meant by selling, and because the price received is real estate : Cobb <em>v. </em>Biddle, 2 Har., 444. The exhaustion of the mine is not the test, because that might as well take place in one ]rear as in a thousand; but it has never been contended that a coal lease for one year was anything more than a lease. These instruments have always been recognized in the body of our statute laws as leases. By the Act of April 27,1855, P. L., 369, Purd., 486, and the supplementary Act of April 3, 1868, P. L., 57, Purd., 486, and May 13,1876, P.

The coal in place was to her valueless; the powers given to the trustees were for her benefit, and extended her right of enjoyment beyond that of a mere life tenant. Her interest was but an equitable one, and for life; <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>the mines were unopened, but her right was not as tenant for life, by the act of the law, but by the will of the owner, and that will provided the means by which an income might be realized.</p>
    <p id="b405-6" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[245,595,1165,1458]]]'>If tlie mine was opened and operated under the power to lease, it was, beyond doubt, the testatrix’s intention that her daughter should receive the profit of it, no matter with what force or energy the operations might be conducted ; if it was sold outright, then she should have the yearly interest upon the proceeds. Her income, therefore, from this coal was to be computed either upon the basis of the operation of the mine, or upon the proceeds of ah actual sale. By a sale, however, tlie testatrix doubtless intended a conveyance of the property for an ascertained sum, paid in hand or properly secured, in the form usually pursued in the sale of real property. She certainly never intended that her daughter should receive merely tlie interest upon installments representing the actual annual profit or yield of the mines ; if she was to participate upon mere profits or yield, she was entitled to these wholly; if in the sole value of tlie coal, then she was entitled to tlie interest only. The authority to lease or sell the coal, which was vested by the will in the trustees, and was exercised by them, so far as the present inquiry is concerned, places the rights of the <em>cestui que trust </em>upon the same footing as if that power had been exercised by the testatrix in her lifetime. What was done under the authority of the will is to be considered as if done by the testatrix herself. If tlie instrument of writing, hero styled a lease, had been executed by Sarah II. Woodbury in her lifetime, and the mines had been in operation under it at her death, her intention as expressed in her will could not be mistaken. The word “income” is defined as the gain which accrues from property, labor and business; in the language of the will it is more specifically defined, in this ease, as “ the yearly proceeds of the real estate.” In its ordinary and popular meaning, or as defined by the contract, it would be clearly applicable to the periodical payments accruing upon tlie contract with the Lehigh Valley Coal Company.</p>
