After reaching a depth of twelve feet he came to rock, which was blasted to an additional depth of two feet, when an abundant supply of water was obtained. Immediately thereupon the supply of <a id="p628" href="#p628" data-label="628" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*628</a>water at the plaintiffs’ house, from the spring, entirely ceased.

    <p class="summary" id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.4",642,[215,765,1184,821]]]'>The'-Master reported on this point as follows: — But notwithstanding all this, the Master is satisfied, from a careful examination of all the evidence, and finds as a fact that there is some communication between the well and the spring, that the taking of water from one affects the amount of water in the other; that the digging of the well has materially injured the spring, from which, since the digging, the flow of water has been seriously diminished, to the inconvenience and damage of the plaintiffs. Exactly how this result was produced it is difficult to say. The injury does not seem to hav.ebeen caused by an interruption of the supply furnished by percolation, for if this were the case, the filling up of the well, even partially, ought to restore the water. The Master believes that the injury has béen caused by some damage done to one of the subterranean sources of the spring, by the cutting or diversion of some stream flowing to it in the earth, but, if this be so, the source or stream so damaged, cut, or diverted, was one not perceptible by-the senses, and its existence could not be ascertained by any means in the command of ordinary men.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b642-5" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[210,1586,1181,866]]]'>The Master’s opinion upon the law was as follows: —That a serious injury has been done to the plaintiffs is unquestionable, but seems clear that, under the evidence as presented, they can have no redress in this proceeding. The case is one of the almost total destruction of a spring in which they have rights, by the action of the defendant on his own land. It seems; however, to be well settled that the owner of land is not entitled to recover for injuries to wells and springs situated thereon, if caused by the acts of an adjoining owner, if done in the exercise of his lawful rights on his own soil and if such rights are exercised without malice or negligence. The law with regard to surface streams is well established, and while there has been much discussion and some conflict of decision with regard to subterranean waters, the Master is satisfied that the great preponderance of authority supports the doctrine that an injury caused to a subterranean supply of water by the lawful acts of an owner of land is, unless the stream be well defined and its existence known or easily discernible, or unless the injury be caused by negligence or malice, <em>damnum absque injuria.</em>

      <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>In England the law seems to have been fixed by the decision in Acton <em>v. </em>Blundell, 12 M. &amp; W. 336. In that case the plaintiff, Acton, owned a mill which was operated by water flowing from a well dug in his own premises by a former owner of both the mill and the land in which the well was dug. This well the plaintiff had enlarged for the purpose of increasing his supply of water. The defendant subsequently opened and sunk a coal mine on bis own land, at a distance of three-quarters of a mile from the plaintiff’s well, the effect of which was to cut off the underground veins and currents of water which supplied the plaintiff’s well and to prevent his operating his mill. It was held that if the defendant in properly working a mine on his own premises caused a diversion of the water from the plaintiff's well and mill, he would not be liable therefor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[209,1080,1168,1124]]]'>In Pennsylvania the question was first discussed at any length in Wheatley <em>v. </em>Baugh, 1 Casey 528. Baugh carried on a tannery upon a piece of ground of about an acre in extent, upon which was a spring which was constantly used in the business. A copper mine having been discovered upon the adjoining farm a shaft was sunk. This shaft being flooded with water, a steam engine was used to pump out the water which interfered with the operations of the miners. Shortly after the engine was started the tan yard spring ceased to flow and remained dry during the running of the engine. When the pumping ceased, the spring resumed its usual flow after an interval of about two weeks. Baugh brought the action to recover damages caused by the loss of the water, lie obtained a verdict in the court below, but tlie judgment was reversed by the Supremo Court on the ground that the evidence showed the spring to have been supplied byr percolations only, and that the interruption of these formed no cause of action. The court say, however: “We have treated the spring as depending upon percolations alone at the point where the mining operations were carried oil; because the evidence does not show that any distinct watercourse leading to it has been diverted or cut off. If this should be shown and in should also appear that it could have been preserved without material detriment to the owner of the land through which it flowed, the destruction of it might be attributed to malice or negligence.”</p>

But the stream in that case was one of those, not uncommon in a limestone <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>region, which in its course entered a “sink,” followed a subterranean channel for some distance and then reappeared upon the surface, its identity throughout being unmistakable.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.4",644,[212,554,1186,1800]]]'>The question was again discussed in Haldeman <em>v. </em>Bruckhart, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20514" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Wright 514">9 Wright, 514</a>. Bruckhart was the owner of a tract of about sixteen acres of land, on which there was a large spring of water. Haldeman dug a pit to mine iron ore about three hundred and thirty feet from the spring. This pit was about forty feet deep, and whenever the steam pumps used to drain it were in full operation the spring entirely dried up. When the pumping ceased, the spring recovered its natural flow in about forty-eight hours. The pit was entered by three distinct streams. The action was brought by Bruckhart for destroying or diverting the spring. Under the ruling of the court below, there was a verdict for the plaintiff, but the judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court. The Court says: “ A proprietor of land may, in the proper use of his land for mining, quarrying, building, draining, or any other useful purpose, cut off or divert subterranean waters without any responsibility to that neighbor. Some of the grounds for the distinction are clearly pointed out in Acton <em>v. </em>Blundell, 12 M. W. 324, and others may be mentioned.......These appear to us very sufficient reasons for distinguishing between surface and subterranean streams, and denying to inferior proprietors any right to control the flow of water in unknown subterranean channels upon an adjoiner’s land. They are as applicable to unknown sub-surface streams as they are to filtrations and percolations through small interstices. Neither can be defined water courses, though they may be definable.......We think, therefore, that the learned judge in the Common Pleas misapprehended what has been ruled in Wheatly <em>v. </em>Baugh. The defined water courses there spoken of which a man may not divert to the hurt of an inferior proprietor, are not the hidden streams of which the owner of the soil through which they pass can have no knowledge until they have been discovered by excavations made in the exercise of his rights of property. They are known streams to which, if the lower proprietor has any rights, they are perceptible, and require no sub-surface exploration before their course can be defined. We are not, however, to be understood as intimating that an owner may maliciously or negligently divert even an unknown subterranean stream to the damage of a lower proprietor. But in the enjoyment of his land he may cut drains, or mine, or quarry, though in so doing he interfere with the flowage of water in hidden, unknown underground channels.</p>

Mining on their laud as they did, was no more than the exercise of their legal rights. If in so doing they interrupted an underground stream which supplied the plaintiff’s spring, it was <em>damnum absque </em>injuria, and there was no evidence of the existence of such a known well-defined watercourse under ground in the land of the defendants as will enable the plaintiff to maintain an action against them for diverting it by their mining operations and thus destroying the spring.</p>

Marfell sold a portion of his land to a railroad company, which made a tunnel through the premises and thereby destroyed the spring. For this injury Brain brought suit against Marfell, relying upon the terms of the agreement. It was held that while the action was perhaps not properly brought, as the company were not the assigns of Marfell, yet admitting that they were, the defendant had not, by conveying the spring in the manner set forth, deprived himself of the right to make improvements on his land, and that the agreement did not prevent him from interfering by means, of underground operations with the flow of water before it reached the spring head.

The facts here were proven that Herr purchased his land expressly subject to a well-defined easement described on the face of his deed; he knew distinctly what it was and where it was; that the waters of this spring came from uuder his land; and he thereby recognized, in the language of the court in Wheatley <em>v. </em>Baugh, “ the right of the plaintiffs to convert his farm to their own use for the purpose of a filter.” He had no right, therefore, to so injure the spring, for his own advantage, as to destroy the easement reserved and rid his property of the servitude.</p>

    <p id="b648-6" data-blocks='[["BL_648.7",648,[234,583,1193,772]]]'>In the deed of Peter Lightner’s executors to Rudolph S. Herr, the appellee and defendant below, there was nothing reserved but a right, in favor of the devisees of the tract of land adjoining, tract No. 1, on the west, “ to conduct water from the spring on No. 2 to the said premises, and to enter upon the said No. 2 for the purpose of laying and repairing pipes, and keeping the spring in proper condition for the conveyance of the water.” This is the limitation of the reserved easement, and beyond it there can be no presumption in favor of the grantors. We agree with the learned Master that in this spring of water the plaintiffs, by the reservation, acquired no greater rights than if it had embraced not only the water, but also the ground whence it flowed. In other words, the rights of the contestant parties are those of adjacent land owners, and none other. Such being the case, the proposition is rather startling that Herr cannot be permitted to dig a well in his own land because he may thereby, in some unknown manner, interfere with the flow of the water to the reserved spring.</p>
    <p id="b648-7" data-blocks='[["BL_648.8",648,[233,1357,1173,940]]]'>Than the doctrine of subterranean percolations and water courses no subject has been more fully discussed in our books. We would refer more especially to tire cases of Wheatley <em>v. </em>Baugh, 1 Ca., 528, and Haldeman <em>v. </em>Bruckhart, 9 Wr. 514, in which the matter has been fully considered and disposed of by Justices Lowrie and Strong. The latter case also successfully combats the idea advanced by the counsel for the appellants, that a distinction must be made between ordinary percolations and subterranean currents or streams. The rule is, that wherever the stream is so hidden in the earth that its course is not discoverable from the surface, there can be no such thing as a prescription in favor of an adjacent proprietor to have an uninterrupted flow of such stream through the land of his neighbor. One reason given for this conclusion is that, if the former can have such right, he can prevent the latter from the use of the water in his own soil, for a use and return of it, as in the .case of surface streams, is impossible. But we need not pursue this subject, for the very able report of the learned Master has relieved us from any such necessity, and we have nothing farther to say except that, with him and the court below, we agree in the propriety of the dismissal of the bill.</p>
