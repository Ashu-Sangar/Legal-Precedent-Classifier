A policy of fire insurance on the machinery of a mill provided, inter alia, that in the event of a loss, a written notice of such loss, signed and sworn to by the assured, should be sent forthwith to the insurer; that there should be no waiver of the conditions of said policy, unless “ clearly expressed and indorsed on the policy,” and that no suit should be brought upon said policy against the insurer unless brought within six months after the occurrence of the loss. A loss having occurred, and the formal proofs of .loss as prescribed never having been furnished, the insurer refused to pay the amount of the loss. In an action brought seven months after the occurrence of the loss by the assured against the insurer on said policy, the plaintiff, in order to establish a waiver of the above conditions, offered evidence to show that the president of the insuring company called upon the assured on the day after the fire, and was then informed that the mill containing the insured property had been destroyed by fire; that the president then told the assured that there was an assessment due upon the policy; that the assured had better piay it or he “would be counted out”; that Hie assured thereupon paid the assessment to the president, who received it, and then showed the president the ruins of the fire. One witness testified that he heard the president tell the assured, after the said payment of the assessment, that he (the president) would “ send him (the assured) a check for the loss.” The court below submitted this testimony to the jury to determine whether or not there had been a waiver by the insurer of the above conditions of the policy.</p>

The plaintiffs contended that compliance on their part with the above conditions had been waived by the defendant in the following manner: On the day after the fire, Crosse, the president of the defendant company, called at the house of the plaintiffs. According to the testimony of Reuben Weiss, one of the plaintiffs, Crosse was then informed by the plaintiffs that the mill had been destroyed by fire and that his company had- a policy of insurance upon the contents; that a dispute then arose between Crosse and the witness (Reuben Weiss) as to whether <em>the </em>machinery was included in the policy; that the policy was then produced and Crosse, on being satisfied that the machinery was so included, said that there was an unpaid assessment due upon the policy, that the assured had better pay it or the company “ would count us (the Weiss Brothers) out and we wouldn’t get it,” i. e., the insurance money; that Reuben Weiss then paid the assessment and then took Crosse down to the mill and showred him the ruins. George Weiss, the father of the plaintiffs, after corroborating Reuben Weiss, testified that during this interview Reuben Weiss told Crosse that the mill was “all burned; ” that after Reuben Weiss paid the assessment as aforesaid, <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>Crosse said to him: “ When I get home I’ll make out a check and send you a check for the loss between this and the time we hare, and we will make a check out and send it to you.” Crosse, in his testimony, denied making the remark attributed to him by George Weiss, but admitted the acceptance of the assessment. He also testified that he told Reuben Weiss at the close of the said interview, to make out his proof of loss and forward it to the company; that he viewed the ruins, as testified to by Reuben Weiss, but denied that he made any examination.</p>

The insurance company can only be made responsible for the alleged loss, under the policy, by a showing by the Weiss Brothers of the performance of the conditions of that instrument on their part. To hold otherwise would be a mere travesty of justice. The principle here stated is not, indeed, denied, but an attempt has been made to avoid its effect by the interposition of the doctrine of estoppel. It is said, and so the court below permitted the jury to find, that the defendant, through its chief officer, acted in such a manner as to induce the plaintiffs to believe that it had or would waive the conditions, the breaches of which are now set up as a defence, and that it was thus estopped from taking advantage of the alleged want of conformity to the contract an part of the plaintiffs.</p>

But when we come to look for the proofs by which the plaintiffs undertake to sustain their proposition, we are not able to discover them. The language of the sixth condition is as follows: “ The use of general terms, or anything less than a distinct, specific agreement, clearly expressed and indorsed on this policy, shall not be considered a waiver of any written or printed condition or restriction therein.” There is here no shadow of ambiguity; the language is plain, specific and positive; there shall be no waiver unless the agreement expressing it be indorsed on the policy. But we look in vain for anything like the waiver here prescribed. ■ How then were the plaintiffs released from their engagement to furnish to the company, within a reasonable time after the fire, a particular and sworn statement of loss ? And where is the proof, oral or written, by which the plaintiffs were released from the twelfth condition, which requires that suit should be brought, if at all, within six months from the date of the loss ? As to the first of these interrogatories, an answer is attempted in the allegation that A. T. Crosse, the president of 'the defendant, soon after the fire, made a promise to Reuben Weiss, one of the plaintiffs, that when he got home they would make out a check and send it to him. To this, however, it is objected, that the evidence here stated furnishes no intimation of even an oral waiver of proofs of loss; that Crosse, taking it for granted that the plaintiffs would not neglect to comply with the condition, might have made the alleged promise, without the slightest intention of binding the company, which.he represented, to what would in effect be a new contract. It is also objected, that a conversation of this kind is denied by Crosse, and that the chief design of the introduction of the stipulation requiring all waivers to be in writing, was for the purpose of avoiding just such disputes. Still another objection to this answer of the plaintiffs* as above stated, is, that whilst George Weiss, the father of those constituting the plaintiff firm, professes to have heard this conversation, yet as Reuben appears to have no recollection of the matter, he either could not have heard it, or having heard it, he gave it so little attention that it was neither impressed on his memory nor affected his action, and that in <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>either event no delay or damage resulted to the plaintiffs therefrom <em>; </em>hence, the defendant could not thereby be estopped from insisting upon tlie letter of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b41-4" data-blocks='[["BL_41.4",41,[258,565,1168,987]]]'>We think these objections to the plaintiffs’ effort to escape from the plain terms of their agreement are sound, and should have been so treated in the court below. For further answer to the interrogatory above proposed, it is said: The policy is a valued one, and for that reason an itemized statement of loss was not necessary. We, however, cannot regard this as a valued policy. We have in the case of buildings, where there was a total loss, held that the policies were of this nature, and this for the reason that when the assured had given notice of the total loss of the building covered by the policy, he could do no more; there are, in such case, no particulars to detail, hence, further notice cannot in reason be required. But we have never so held with reference to the contents of a building consisting, as in this case, of a variety of articles. And though this term “ valued policy ” has been used as above stated, yet it does not strictly apply, for its proper application is to such cases only where a valuation is fixed upon the underwritten property by way of liquidated damages, and for the purpose of avoiding a subsequent valuation of the property in case of loss: 2 Bouv. L. Diet., 845. Of course, where such is the contract of the parties they must be held to it, but that such is not the nature of the policy under consideration is obvious from the very terms of it.</p>
    <p id="b41-5" data-blocks='[["BL_41.5",41,[261,1553,1164,429]]]'>The second of our questions remains wholly unanswered; for there is not even the pretence of the waiver of that condition which required suit to be brought within six months after the loss.
