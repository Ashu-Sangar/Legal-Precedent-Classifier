We submit that the Act is in derogation of the Federal and State Constitutions guaranteeing the right of trial by jury: Ervine’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/16/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="16 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="410246" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0256-01">16 Pa.

The attachment may be regarded either as a common law remedy, ante-dating the Constitution, or as a special statutory remedy. The first view is presented in Drake on Attachment (5th ed., 1878), § 8. The legislative authority to enact such a remedy is supported in Rhines <em>v. </em>Clark, 1 P. F. S., 96; Haines <em>v. </em>Levin, Id., 412, and many other cases. Other analogous Acts, providing special statutory remedies, without the intervention of a jury, have been held constitutional.</p>

It works no denial of a trial by jury for the ascertainment of the alleged indebtedness. If the alleged fraud is not sustained the attachment may be dissolved. Yet if there has been a service on the defendant the suit goes on: Sharpless <em>v. </em>Ziegler, 11 Norris, <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>467; Biddle <em>v. </em>Black, 3 Out., 380. If just cause existed for the attachment of the property, it is because it would be liable to execution after the judgment is obtained. The debtor gets all the benefit of a trial by jury in determining the question of his indebtedness, and is not thereby deprived of the benefit of the laws exempting property from execution issued on the judgment.</p>
