And this custom or usage was accompanied with the other custom or usage, or rather, a part and parcel of this same custom or usage was that the county commissioners and their clerk were to be paid out of the county funds in addition to their daily pay their actual traveling expenses in holding the appeals. The commissioners might in 1799, and ever since, have held the triennial appeals in the commissioners’ office in the county town, and put the taxpayers of the county to the great expense and loss of time of traveling there.

Customs of long standing in the commissioners’ office make the law where there is no statute contravening, and when the custom is reasonable and for the public benefit: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Commissioners of Philadelphia, 2 S. <em>&amp; </em>R., 194. And a long-established practice or custom originating in a mistake of law is held good: Blythe <em>v. </em>Richards, 10 S. &amp; R., 264.

It is a custom which appears to have been introduced in many counties of the state to suit the convenience of the people. No statute prohibits it. The Act of 15th of April, 1834, expressly declares they shall keep their office and all public records and papers belonging thereto, at the seat of justice of the respective county and in such building as may be erected or appropriated for such purpose. We are not aware that it has ever been claimed, when a commissioner resides away from the county seat, that he is entitled to demand compensation, or reimbursement, for expenses incurred in traveling to and from the seat of justice, nor his boarding bills or the keeping of his horses, while there. We do not see why such claim might not be made with equal propriety. In either case they are the personal expenses of the commissioner necessarily incurred in going to and remaining at a place in the discharge of his official duties. The statute makes no provision for the payment of such items out of the county treasury. Whether he goes to the county seat or whether he goes out of it, to discharge his official duties, the law prescribes a daily pay only. This is not to be in addition to his expenses. They are matters for which the law does not provide, aqd for which the county is not liable. When a positive law clearly prescribes the manner and nature of the compensation to be paid to a public officer, the directions of that law should be the only rule and measure of the officer’s claim on the public moneys: Brown <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/rawle/2/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Rawle 40" data-case-ids="1820619" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0040-01">2 Rawle, 40</a>. No presumption arises either from the duties of his office or from previous custom or usage, enlarging his compensation. .Although different and other compensation may have long been recognized and sanctioned, yet when it comes in conflict with the later and positive law, it must yield to the latter. As was well said by <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>Mr. Justice Williams, in speaking of a public officer, in Godshalk <em>v. </em>Northampton county, 21 P.

We have given due weight to long established practice and custom. All these pressed by the able argument of the counsel have failed to convince us that the mandate of our Acts of Assembly, fixing the compensation of county commissioners, should either be set aside or disregarded.
