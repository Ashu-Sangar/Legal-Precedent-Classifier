Hood and Leonard Myers, three gentlemen learned in the law, were appointed to prepare “ a digest of the Acts of Assembly relating to the city of Philadelphia and the late incorporated districts of the county of Philadelphia, and of the ordinances of the said city and districts in force on the first day of January, 1856.” In their digest the Act in question is reported as <em>obsolete. </em>(Page 792.) To this, all justices and magistrates thereafter conformed until the proceeding taken, now under review. Under the belief that such Act was no longer in force, the manufacturers and venders of fireworks were established in all parts of the city, and engaged in their pursuits. This was first controlled by the Act of March 23, 1865, (P. L., 744,) which provided: “ That it shall not be lawful for any person or association, or <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>corporation, to manufacture any species of pyrotechnic or fireworks, cartridges, nor any kind of fixed ammunition in the built-up portions of the city of Philadelphia.”</p>
    <p id="b238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_238.4",238,[181,555,1179,1061]]]'>But it is believed, that Act has been superseded by harmonious legislation on the subject of the manufacture and sale of merchandise. The first is the Act of April 2, 1821, (P. L., 244,) which provides that “ every person who shall deal in the selling of any goods, wares and merchandise.....except such as are the growth, product or manufacture of the United States.....shall take out from the ti'easurer of the county a license for the vending such <em>foreign </em>merchandise ; .... in the following form.” The next relevant Act is that of April 30, 1841, (P. L., 310,) section 9, provides: “ That in lieu of the taxes imposed.....on persons, trades, occupations and professions, there shall be annually assessed and collected ” .....(certain named sums.) Section 10 provides : “ That from and after the passage of this Act, the several provisions now in force of the Act of.....shall be and the same are hereby extended and applied to all persons engaged in the selling of goods, wares, merchandise, commodities or effects <em>of whichsoever kind, or </em>nature, and all such sellers or venders shall be classed and required to pay annually, for the use of the Commonwealth, for their respective licenses.”..... Here follows a classification into fourteen classes for licenses. Section 5, of an Act of April 16, 1845, (P. L., 533,) provided a special system for Philadelphia, “ for the purpose of securing the tax now authorized by law to be assessed’ on wholesale dealers and retailers of merchandise.”</p>

Neither enactment has ever been repealed. These Acts are found in the Digest of the Acts of Assembly relating to the city of Philadelphia, and the late incorporated districts of the county of Philadelphia, and of the ordinances of said city and districts, in force on the first day of January, A. D. 1856. (Page 183.) This digest was compiled and edited under authority of Councils by William Duane, William B. Hood and Leonard Myers. The counsel for the plaintiff in error states in his book that in this compilation, the act in question is marked <em>obsolete, </em>but a reference to the book will show, that the statutes are given as existing laws, and it is only in the index on page 792 that the word obsolete is applied to portions of the Act. The reports of the commissioners, W. Rawle, T. J. Wharton and Joel Jones, appointed under the resolutions of March 23, 1830, <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>relative to a revised code of Pennsylvania, do not refer to this statute, but in a collation of the statutes of Pennsylvania by David Derrickson and W. M. Hall, commissioners appointed under joint resolutions of the Senate and House in 1868, we find an enactment recommended to regulate the sale of fireworks, the difference between the Act of 1721 and the proposed Act, being simply that Councils were to give the license, instead of the Governor, and that the penalty was made fifty dollars instead of five shillings. That bill, however, was not enacted. It is to be observed that the Act of 1721 is not prohibitory of the sale of fireworks, it is simply a wise regulation of the sale thereof. It is not an Act to provide'revenue to meet the demands on the treasury as the Acts of 1821 and 1841 are, but it is a police regulation. The five shillings penalty is not a tax, but a punishment for the non-compliance with the law regulating the sale of a dangerous commodity.</p>
    <p id="b239-6" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[198,1100,1168,466]]]'>Subsequent legislation has been passed regulating the manufacture of fireworks. The Act of March 23, 1865, P. L. 744, provides that “It shall not be lawful for any person, or association, or corporation to manufacture any species of pyrotechnic, or fireworks, cartridges, nor any kind of ammunition, in the built up portion of the city of Philadelphia.” By the Act of March 12, 1866, P. L., 160, it is provided “ That any violation of the Act of February 16, 1865, shall subject the offender or offenders to a fine of fifty dollars for each offence. There is also the Act of Assembly of June 10, 1881, P. L. Ill, relative to the sale of fire arms to minors.”</p>

The purpose of the Act is stated thus: — “Whereas much mischief may happen by shooting of guns, throwing, casting and firing of squibs, serpents, rockets, aud other fireworks, within the city of Philadelphia, if not speedily prevented: Be it therefore enacted, &amp;o.,” 1 Cary &amp; B. Laws, 157. By the Act of February 9, 1751, provisions similar to those in the Act of 1721, were enacted for all towns and boroughs, not provided for in prior <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>statutes, “To the end the provisions already made by our laws for preventing accidents which may happen by fire in the city of Philadelphia and several other boroughs and towns within this province, may be made more generally useful, and to prevent, as much as in us lies, the growing sins of idleness, drunkenness, and other debaucheries, too frequent among us, Be it enacted, &amp;e.,” Id., 311.</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[236,707,1170,514]]]'>These statutes for police regulations have not been repealed or supplied by legislation. It was long ago settled that an Act of Parliament cannot be repealed by <em>non user. </em>That this is also the rule in this state accords with reason and the absence of authority to the contrary. The settled rule is, that a statute can be repealed only by express provision of a subsequent law, or by necessary implication. To repeal by implication there must be such a positive repugnancy between the new law and the old, that they cannot stand together,- or be consistently reconciled. But the fact of <em>non user </em>is not in the case — the point is whether the Act has become obsolete or repealed by subsequent enactments.</p>

The Act of March 23,1865, P. L., 744, makes it unlawful for any person to manufacture any pyrotechnics, fireworks, cartridges or ammunition in the built up part of the city of Philadelphia. Therefore, the Act of 1721 is so far repealed that the license of the governor will not authorize the manufacture of squibs, rockets or other fireworks in the built up parts of the city. Only so far as the later statutes are positively repugnant to the prior do they operate as a repeal.</p>
