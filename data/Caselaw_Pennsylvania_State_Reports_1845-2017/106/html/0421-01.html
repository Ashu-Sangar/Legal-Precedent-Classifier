We contend that the words “ calls,” “ instalments ” <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>and “ assessments,” are used in said Act as synonymous terms, and in section 12, where it speaks o£ “ assessing upon each share of stock certain sums of money,” etc., it means making another call or instalment on the original stock. After payment of instalments or calls, as is provided by section 11 of said Act, debts may be created larger than anticipated, or losses may be sustained, or the business may increase and require more money; then at a legal meeting called for the purpose, the corporation, as provided in section 12, “may assess upon each share' of stock such sums as they may think proper.” But they cannot “ <em>exceed in the whole the amount at which each share was originally </em>limited.” The next sentence would seem to indicate that this construction is the correct and true one, because it says, “No note or obligation given by a stockholder whether secured by pledge or otherwise shall be considered as payment of any part of the capital stock,” thus showing that this is still the original capital stock, and it cannot be that money raised by assessments, as contemplated by the learned Judge, can be'called the capital stock. If so, and a corporation can make assessments after stock is fully paid up, there would be no limit to the capital stock, and sections 18,19 and 20, etc., of said Act providing for an increase of capital stock can be violated with impunity. Nowhere in said Act is any provision made to make a return in case of assessments over and above the par value of the stock, and all corporations could thus evade the payment of tax and bonus on one half of their capital stock, or one half of the money collected and used by them in their business as capital. Section 18 of said Act providing for the increase of the capital, restricts the corporation and says: “Such increase shall only be made for money, labor done or money or property actually received,” and yet under section 12, if these assessments are legal, as interpreted by the learned Judge, although it does really increase the capital stock, yet the corporation has unlimited power, and can make such assessments for any purpose whatever, not confined to money or property actually received or labor done. This power to assess the shares of stockholders is most strictly construed, and must be conferred in clear and explicit terms, either by express language or by necessary implication from the language employed: 1 Potter on Corp., sec. 252; Angelí &amp; Ames on Corp., sec. 544.</p>

Section 14 of said Act provides for the liability of stockholders, “that they shall be liable in their individual capacity to the amount of stock held by each of them,” and if these assessments are legal, the debts of said corporation may he increased, but creditors have no remedy against stockholders for the excess. Section 17 of said Act provides that any such corporation can take “such real and personal estate, mineral rights, patent rights and other property, and issue stock to the amount of the value thereof in payment thereof, and the stock so issued shall be declared and taken to be full paid stock, and <em>not liable to any further calls or assessments,” </em>etc. Is it just that the stockholder who furnishes cash, shall be liable to pay <em>additional assessments, </em>while the person who furnishes personal property, as above specified, is exempt therefrom.</p>

Sec. 12 must therefore either go beyond the original subscriptions to the capital stock and refer to and mean to confer the power this corporation claims it does, or it must refer to and mean the same power as is given by sec. 11. Contrast them, and how is it possible for them to stand together? In sec. 11, the <em>directors </em>have power to call in the subscriptions to the capital stock, and in sec. 12, if it referred to the same thing as sec. <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>11, this very power would be also in the <em>corporation </em>at a legal meeting called for the purpose, to call in the subscriptions to the capital stock. We would then have what is unknown to the law — one and the same power vested at one and the s$me time in two separate, independent bodies. Again, if sections 11 and 12 refer to the same power, how can they be reconciled when they so radically differ in liability? Under sec. 11 the liability of the stockholder is one'half of one per cent, per month greater for non-payment of assessments than under sec. 12. Again, the remedy for collection is radically different in the two sections. Sec. 11 is entire and complete in itself; suit may be brought by the directors, or the section itself refers to a remedy under clause 2 of sec. 39, above quoted, of this Act, while sec. 12 is incomplete and needs an additional clause to enforce its provisions. The legislature, seeing this incompleteness in sec. 12, framed clause 2 of sec. 39, above quoted, in order that the provisions of sec. 12 might be carried into effect. How, then, can these two sections, differing so radically in the three vital points named, to wit: method of laying assessments, liability of stockholders thereunder, and method of enforcement, mean one and the same thing? If they do mean the same thing, one must fall; but construe them by the old familiar rule so that both, if possible, may stand, and they are entirely natural and consistent, sec. 11 vesting in the directors the power to regulate calls to the subscriptions of the capital stock, and in the corporators themselves the power to assess the paid up capital stock. In the light of this clear, plain and explicit legislative grant, we need not look for any additional reasons in the Act, nor attempt to harmonize this grant with the provisions contained in other sections, as it conflicts with none, but stands out separate and alone, as a means provided for the corporation to raise money to carry out the object of its creation, being limited in its power to borrow money and secure the same by mortgage to so low a sum as one half its capital stock paid in.</p>

There is certainly no difficulty in understanding the intention of the legislature in the ' two sections — eleven and twelve — of the Act of 1874. The eleventh section relates entirely to the capital stock and the method of collecting the amounts subscribed thereto. It provides for payment of subscriptions in instalments as required by the directors, and fixes a penalty for delay in the payment, with a right to bring suit for the <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>recovery of both the instalments and the penalty. The twelfth section relates to an entirely different subject, and there is not the slightest inconsistency between the two. This section confers upon the corporation a right to assess upon each share of stock such sums of money as the corporation may think proper, but not to exceed in the whole the amount at which each share was originally limited.</p>
    <p id="b443-6" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[189,721,1162,298]]]'>It is too plain for argument, that the assessments thus authorized are burdens which may be imposed upon the perfected stock. They are no part of the price of the stock, and can in no sense be regarded as part of the subscription money to bo paid for the shares. They are in addition to, and independent of the capital raised by the sale of the shares, and do not constitute any part of the capital when paid in.</p>
    <p id="b443-7" data-blocks='[["BL_443.5",443,[189,1021,1161,214]]]'>The twelfth section would be totally unnecessary and useless upon the theory of the appellant. Without enlarging upon the reasons so well stated in the opinion of the court below, it is sufficient to say, that we approve of them entirely.</p>
    <p id="b443-8" data-blocks='[["BL_443.6",443,[447,1236,905,85]]]'>Decree affirmed and bill dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
