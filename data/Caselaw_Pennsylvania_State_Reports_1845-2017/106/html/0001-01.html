An attempt was made to prove that Ackerman was surety for the decedent, but it was not successful. The only evidence on this subject was the testimony of Mr. Ackerman himself, who was clearly incompetent as a witness, and of Dr. Buzzard, whose testimony is too vague to be of any value. Assuming then that both defendants were principal debtors, the single question is, whether Mr. Ackerman who paid off the judgment in full is entitled to subrogation.</p>

The doctrine of subrogation is not confined to cases of strict suretyship. It is a mode which equity adopts to compel the ultimate discharge of the debt by him who in good conscience ought to pay it, and relieve him whom none but the creditors could ask to pay: Bender <em>v. </em>George, 11 Norris, 86; Watson’s Appeal, 9 Norris, 426; Wright <em>v. </em>Grover, 1 Norris, 80; Cottrell’s Appeal, 11 Harris, 294; Hosier’s Appeal, 6 P.

F. S., 27; Ash <em>v. </em>Guie, 1 Out., 493. Subrogation is the right which a surety has against his principal, to use a judgment, after the former has either voluntarily, by contract, or by process, paid the debt of the latter, and equity sometimes, also, gives him the remedy to use the judgment to enforce contribution from his co-sureties. But no such right exists between two principal debtors: Mehaffy <em>v. </em>Share, <a href="/pen-w/2/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 361" data-case-ids="8878765" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0361-01">2 P. &amp; W., 361</a>; Greiner’s Est., <a href="/watts/2/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts 414" data-case-ids="1840144" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0414-01">2 Watts, 414</a>.

    <p id="b18-8" data-blocks='[["BL_18.7",18,[207,1670,1183,465]]]'>Contribution is entirely different. It is the right which one joint debtor paying the whole debt has to recover from the other his share of the debt paid. It is founded upon an assumpsit, and no right of action exists until the debt is paid. Here it was not paid until after death of decedent. “The reason why subrogation is not allowed to one partner as against his co-partner, or to one merely a joint debtor as against his co-debtor, is because that as between them there is no obligation to pay the debt resting upon one superior to that which rests upon the other.” Per Strong, J., 11 Cas., 117.</p>

This judgment was given by appellant and W. F. Moser, the decedent, for a portion of unpaid purchase money for certain real <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>estate purchased by the obligors jointly, and for which each was to pay one half. The balance due on this judgment at the time of the audit, was $1000 with interest from April 1, 1879. The balance the appellant, Ackerman, had been compelled to pay upon an execution issued against him. He took an assignment from Utt, the holder of the balance due on the judgment, and now claims to be subrogated to the rights of the plaintiff, and to be paid out of the proceeds of the real estate of his co-debtors upon which real estate the said judgment was a first lien at the time of the sale.</p>
    <p id="b19-6" data-blocks='[["BL_19.4",19,[209,853,1173,775]]]'>The learned judge refused the subrogation upon the ground that Ackerman and Moser were both principal debtors. This was so as between them and the plaintiff in the judgment. But as between themselves, Ackerman was surety for Moser, and paid his share of the joint liability. This clearly appears from the testimony of Ackerman and Dr. Buzzard. It is true the court say's of Ackerman’s testimony, that he was an incompetent witness, and that Buzzard’s testimony was “too vague to be of any value.” But Ackerman was examined not only without objection, but with the consent of appellee’s counsel, and in our view Dr. Buzzard’s testimony is as explicit as language can make it. He said: “I wras present and assisted in the transfer of judgment No. 216, April T., 1874, from the estate of John G. Miller to J. J. Utt, and heard William F. Moser say that the entire balance due on said judgment was for him (Moser) to pay; I also heard Moser say the same the year previous, when I). H. Ackerman paid the balance of his part of said judgment.”</p>
    <p id="b19-7" data-blocks='[["BL_19.5",19,[208,1628,1175,820]]]'>The learned judge was evidently misled by a dictum in Mehaffy <em>v. </em>Share, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pen.%20%26%20W.%20861" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 861">2 P. &amp; W., 861</a>, and felt constrained to adopt the view he did by reason of the absence of authority the other way. In McCormick <em>v. </em>Irwin, 11 Casey, 111, it was said by Justice Strong : “The doctrine (subrogation) docs not depend upon privity, nor is it confined to cases of strict suretyship;” and in Cottrell’s Appeal, 11 Harris, 294, by Justice Woodward: “Subrogation is founded on principles of equity and benevolence, and may be decreed when no contract or privity of any kind exists between the parties. Wherever one not a mere volunteer discharges the debt of another, ho is entitled to all the remedies which the creditor possesses against the debtor.” And in Mosier’s Appeal, 6 P. F. S., 76, where a junior judgment creditor, believing the land would be sacrificed, after the execution plaintiffs had refused to assign their judgment to him on payment, paid the executions to the sheriff, and satisfaction was entered; no other liens having intervened, he was subrogated to the rights of the execution plaintiffs, and the satisfaction cancelled.</p>

In this respect they are to be treated as the several estates of joint debtors, one being surety of the other; and if the purpart of one is called upon to pay more than its due proportion, the tenant, or his lien creditors, upon the principle settled in Fleming <em>v. </em>Beaver, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%2C%20128" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 R., 128">2 R., 128</a>; Croft <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/watts/9/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="9 Watts 451" data-case-ids="1850014" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0451-01">9 Watts, 451</a>, and Neff <em>v. </em>Miller, 8 Barr., 347, is entitled to stand in the place of the satisfied creditor, to the extent of the excess which ought to have been paid out of the other shares.” Gearhart <em>v. </em>Jordan was recognized in the late case of Watson’s Appeal, 9 Norris, 426, where it was said by Mercur, J.: “as between two mortgagors of land held by them as tenants in common, and third persons, each mortgagor is liable for the whole sum secured by the mortgage; but as between themselves each is liable for one half only.
