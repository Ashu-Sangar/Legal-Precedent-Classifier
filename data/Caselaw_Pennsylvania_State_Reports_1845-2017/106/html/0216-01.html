Subsequent to the death of the testatrix her husband died, and the said real estate was sold under proceedings on a mortgage, the lien of which antedated the title of the testatrix. The balance of the proceeds of the sale, after payment of the mortgage, was invested by the trustee in another mortgage.</p>

If he dies seised of real estate, she has her dower at common law, or her statutory dower, according to circumstances.

The amount of his interest, however, is immaterial, if the widow shall be held to be entitled under the gift to his heirs. Her eligibility to take in the character of heir was regarded in Clark <em>v. </em>Scott, <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>17 P. F. S., 446, as clouded with some doubt, but the doubt was so greatly in her favor, that until a release of her interest should be forthcoming, the purchaser’s title to the estate was held unmarketable. The reason of the thing seems'to incline to her heirship, and is found in the very definition of the word. The heirs of a decedent are such persons as would be entitled to represent him by the law of the country. Patterson <em>v. </em>Hawthorn, 12 S. &amp; R., 114. In this state when the word <em>heir </em>is used as a word of purchase, it means statutory heirs, those persons designated by the Intestate Act, to take the estate.’ Clark <em>v. </em>Scott, supra, p. 452. At common law neither the husband nor wife could be heir to the other. Our statute of distribution left the husband, as to the wife’s real estate, in the position he held at common law. But it took away from the wife her dower, and gave her as a substitute an interest which is so far superior to her common law dower that it has been held to attach to an estate in remainder which had vested in her husband, while the particular estate was still outstanding at his death: Cote’s Appeal, 29 P. F. S., 285. It is an estate and not a lien: Thomas <em>v. </em>Simpson, 3 Barr, 70; Schall’s Appeal, 4 Wr., 177, and it may be sold on execution for her debts: Shaupe <em>v. </em>Shaupe, 12 S. &amp; R., 13; Miller <em>v. </em>Leidig, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20458" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 458">3 W. &amp; S., 458</a>; Schall’s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>The wife’s interest, therefore, unlike the husband’s, is wholly a statutory interest, and she takes an estate of the same quality as that taken by the descendants. The question has been discussed in Potter’s estate, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Phila.%20318" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Phila. 318">13 Phila., 318</a>, and Abbey’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20W.N.C.%20535" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="13 W.N.C. 535">13 W.

No such intent is expressed here, but, on the contrary, the presumption is strengthened by the word “ forever.” What, then, is the technical meaning of the word “ heirs ” ? It certainly does not mean the widow to the exclusion of sisters of the decedent. The cases in which the widow has taken under a bequest to “heirs” were all cases where the word “heirs” was, by force of the context, construed to mean distributees,' and were all cases where personal property was the subject in <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>dispute. The intestate law, while it gives her the real estate, if the decedent “leave no heirs or other known kindred,” does not make her an “heir,” but sharply makes the distinction, between the status of a widow and that of the “ heirs.”</p>

F. S., 449; Walker <em>v. </em>Walker, 4 Casey, 40; Dodson <em>v. </em>Ball, 10 P. F. S., 500. The widow is within that designation. Under the intestate laws she may succeed in whole or in part to her husband's real estate. She is one of the “heirs” designated by law. Her interest is an estate, not a lien. The strict letter of the Intestate Act may not speak of her as “ heir,” but neither does it of “children,” “grandchildren,” “brothers,” “sisters,” etc., who are admittedly heirs. She is therefore entitled to one third of one third of the principal and income of the estate in fee. She takes such share as a purchaser under the will of the testatrix, and not by distribution under the Intestate Act.</p>

Ryan, who died in January, 1883, intestate and without issue, leaving a wife, Amelia Ryan, the appellee, surviving him. Letters of administration on his estate wore granted to her in the State of Oregon, and, as such administratrix, she received the arrears of income due <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>her husband up to the date of his decease.

After payment of the mortgage debt out of the proceeds of sale, the residue was paid to the trustee, and thus became the <em>corpus </em>of the trust from which the income for distribution was realized.

In other words, is the widow the “heir” of her husband, or are the appellants his “heirs,” according to the true intent and meaning of the will ? If the fund for distribution were personalty the widow would perhaps be entitled to participate therein; but inasmuch as it bears the impress of realty, the one third in which Edward had an equitable life interest was given by his mother’s will to his “ heirs forever.” In the devise over of the remainder in fee, to take effect immediately upon the expiration of the equitable life interests respectively, the testatrix used the technical word “ heirs,” which, in a will, is to be understood in its legal or technical, and not in its popular sense, unless the contrary intent is so plainly apparent that it cannot be misunderstood: Porter’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20201" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Wright 201">9 Wright, 201</a>; Eby’s Appeal, 14 <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20201" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 Wright 201">Id., 311</a>; Tillman <em>v. </em>Davis et al., <a href="/ny/95/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="95 N.Y. 17" data-case-ids="2193614" data-case-paths="/ny/95/0017-01">95 N. Y., 17</a>. <em>No </em>such intent is even suggested by the phraseology of the will in this case. There is nothing in the language of the testatrix to warrant the belief that she intended to use the word “ heirs ” in any other than its well settled legal signification, meaning those who, upon Edward’s decease intestate, would take immediately from him an heritable estate. The heirs of a decedent are those of his kindred upon whom the law, immediately upon his decease, casts the estate in real property, and the estate, so descending to the heir, is called the inheritance: 2 Minor’s Inst., 452; 2 Bl. Com., 201. It is conceded that at common law neither the husband nor the wife could be heir to the other; and, while our Intestate Act has made some changes in the interest to which a widow is entitled in the estate of her deceased husband, she is not in any proper sense of the word recognized as his heir, except, perhaps, in the case of his dying without “known heirs or kindred competent” to take, in which event <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>alone an estate of inheritance is vested in the widow under the tenth section of the Act. In all other contingencies her interest in her husband’s estate is unlike that of an heir. "While she acquires an interest or estate in the land, and not a mere lien thereon, that interest is of a special and peculiar nature, essentially different from the estate of inheritance which the law casts upon the heir.</p>
