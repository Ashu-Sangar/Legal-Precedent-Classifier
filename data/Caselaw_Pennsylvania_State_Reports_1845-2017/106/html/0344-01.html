Where, on the contrary, the facts developed on the trial show that the creditor had good reason to believe that the goods were the goods of the defendant in the execution, as, for example, when they are found in his possession, under circumstances which give rise to a presumption of ownership, costs are not awarded against the defendant. We refer, also, to the case of Dewees <em>v. </em>Evans, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.N.C.%20573" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 W.N.C. 573">7 W. N. C., 573</a>.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[218,1429,1181,861]]]'>In the present case, the fund in dispute was in the hands of third parties, who were made garnishees. These garnishees state under oath, that, up to the time of the service of the attachment, they supposed and believed that this money belonged to G. M. Black. And, upon the trial of the case in court, it was shown in behalf of the plaintiff, that G. M. Black had, at various times and to various parties, claimed to have been the real lessee of the premises, upon which the produce in question was grown, and that to one person he had said, that the lease was made in his son’s name for the reason that he himself could hold no property in his own name. It Was also proved, that to one witness he had stated that the particular sum of money in controversy belonged, and should be paid to himself. These facts, and many others to the same effect, were sworn to by the witnesses for the plaintiff, and while • they were controverted and denied by the defendant and his witnesses, they are recalled now, to show that the plaintiff was not without good reasons for supposing that the money upon which he laid his attachment belonged to G. M. Black, whose creditor he was.</p>

Black, the claimant. To relieve the unsuccessful party from the payment of the costs, because there was probable cause for believing, as he did, that this money was the property of his debtor, and to put them upon the successful party, whose theory of the case has been adopted and approved by the verdict of the jury, would seem to be anomalous and arbitrary.</p>

The issue was directed by the court, for the purpose of ascertaining the real ownership of the money in the hands of the garnishees. The witnesses who were sworn were called for the purpose of affording the necessary information on this question. A comprehensive view of all the testimony results in the conviction that, while the plaintiff had abundant reason for believing that the fund was the property of his debtor, it was, in point of fact, as legally ascertained by the jury, the money of another. Under these circumstances it seems to us equitable, that the costs and expenses should not be borne exclusively by either party, but should be divided equally between them.</p>

    <p id="b362-6" data-blocks='[["BL_362.7",362,[212,1083,1174,428]]]'>In the feigned issue to determine which of the two claimants was entitled to the fund in court, the verdict and judgment were in favor of the defendant, who thereupon filed his bill of costs amounting to $274.43. On application of plaintiff in the issue, the court ordered “ that one half of the costs, including witness fees on both sides, be paid by the plaintiff, and the other half by the defendant.” From that order the defendant appealed, and his contention is, that the costs being an incident of the judgment the court had no power to impose any part thereof on him.</p>
    <p id="b362-7" data-blocks='[["BL_362.8",362,[208,1511,1173,516]]]'>No question is raised as to the validity of the judgment or regularity of 'the proceedings leading thereto. If there was, a writ of error would be the appropriate remedy. The only subject of complaint is the order made after rendition of the judgment, and that is clearly reviewable, on this appeal: Snyder <em>v. </em>Kunkleman, <a href="/watts/2/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Watts 426" data-case-ids="1840082" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0426-01">2 Watts, 426</a>. It was there held that after verdict and judgment in a feigned issue to determine a contested right to proceeds of sheriff’s sale, a decree of court, as to payment of costs of the issue, is the subject of revision on appeal, but not on a writ of error to the judgment. There is nothing, therefore, in the suggestion that appellant has mistaken his remedy.</p>

Costs, <em>eo </em>nomine, were first given to plaintiffs by the Statute of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I., c. 1. Afterwards, by the Statutes 23 Hen. VIII., c. 15, 4 Jac. I., c. 3, 8 and 9 Wm. III., c. 12, and 4 and 5 Anne, c. 16, the successful defendant was allowed the same costs as the plaintiff would have been entitled to, if he had recovered: 4 Minor’s Institutes, 788; 3 Blackstone, 399. With some statu<a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>tory limitations and qualifications, which it is unnecessary to specially notice, the rule thus established in England has always been recognized and enforced here. In equity the practice is different, but in actions at law the general rule undoubtedly is that costs follow the judgment; and hence it is incumbent on an unsuccessful litigant, who claims either partial or entire relief from the costs of suit, to point to the statute that warrants exemption from the burden. The order complained of in this case appears to have been based on the special provisions of the Sheriff’s Interpleader Act, and decisions thereunder. That Act, it is true, declares “ the costs of all such proceedings shall be in the discretion of the court; ” but this clause refers solely to proceedings and issues under that Act, and has no application whatever to other feigned issues directed by the court for the purpose of determining disputed questions of fact according to the course of common law. When the issue in question was made up, it was like any other issue of fact presented by the pleadings in an action at law, and subject to the same rules of practice as to trial, judgment, and all the incidents thereof. The question was whether the money in court belonged to the plaintiff or to the defendant. The jury declared by their verdict that it belonged to the latter, and judgment was accordingly entered in liis favor on the verdict. Like ordinary judgments in actions at law, it carried costs, and the court erred in making an order, the effect of which was to prevent appellant from proceeding to collect full costs from the unsuccessful plaintiff in the issue.</p>
