In an action by the insured to recover for destruction of the barn by fire, the defendant was permitted to introduce evidence to show that at the time the policy was issued none of the farm operations were conducted by steam power, and that the tenant subsequently used a portable boiler and steam engine for threshing, which it was claimed, caused the fire.</p>

We cannot so instruct you, for our understanding of the law is just the reverse, and we instruct you, even though it was done without the consent or knowledge of the lessor, it still avoids the policy, if there was an increased risk by its use, and with this understanding of this point, we refuse to affirm it.”</p>

Now that' being a stipulation in the policy itself, it is a part; of the contract between the party assured and the company, and Mr. Long when he accepted the policy agreed to that condition contained in it. If under the terms of that policy he has so occupied and used his premises as to increase the risk of loss by fire, by carrying on or exercising therein any trade, business or vocation whatever, whereby the risk of loss by fire, was, without the consent of the company, increased, then this policy is void and would be of no effect.....Now, we propose to submit the question of fact to you to determine from all the evidence upon that subject, whether or not, the use of that steam threshing machine upon the premises of Mr. Long, did or did not increase the risk of loss by fire. If it did increase the risk under the clause of the policy we have read to you, then we instruct you that you must find for the defendant, for it was then á violation of the terms or expressed conditions of the policy, and the company would not be liable for any loss that occurred while it was being so used and the <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>plaintiff would not be entitled to recover the amount that he seeks to recover in this action.”</p>

There is only one question in our opinion in this case for you to determine, under all the evidence in it, which is the simple question as to whether or not the use of that steam engine or steam threshing machine did increase the risk from fire. If it did, then we say to you, under the terms of this policy which we have read to you, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover and you should render .a general verdict for the defendant.

The use of a portable engine in the vicinity of the barn, is not in terms forbidden in the policy, and if precluded the interdiction- must be found, if found at all, in the clause in question. In the first portion of this clause the words, “ occupied or used,” being employed disjunctively are synonymous and signify, not an exceptional or casual change or use increasing the risk, but as already stated, a permanent increase of risk. The court put the ability 8f the tenant to forfeit the plaintiff’s policy on the ground of a supposed agency arising from the tenancy — that the acts of the tenant in law, without regard to the period of their duration are taken to be <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>committed by his landlord; but such ground is untenable; for if it be true that all the acts of the tenant are taken as performed by his landlord, then it must result, if the tenant in possession willfully and maliciously burns bis landlord’s insured barn bis indemnity fails, which will not be pretended. So far from being the agent of his landlord, he is liable, at common law, to him for permissive waste, in case the demised premises are destroyed by fire through his negligence: 4 Kent Com. 81.</p>

Following a rule of this kind, it was held, in the case of McClure <em>v. </em>The Watertown Fire Insurance Company, 9 Nor., 277, that when a condition in a, policy is unambiguous, the insured cannot avoid a compliance with its terms, by showing an honest, though unsuccessful, effort to comply therewith. In the case in hand there can be no doubt that the condition, upon the breach of which the defence was rested, was both reasonable and unambiguous. The company, for a fixed price, insured the building as it was at the date of the policy; it took upon itself that hazard and none other, and to avoid all dispute as to what it did insure, the condition was introduced that if the risk was increased by the erection or occupation of neighboring buildings, or <em>by any means whatever, </em>without the assent of the company, the policy should be void, and, subject to this condition, the plaintiff accepted this policy. There is no doubt about the just and binding character of this contract, and if the insured did, in fact, without the assent of the insurer, either by himself or tenant, do anything to increase the risk, the contract was violated, and he must bear the consequences. Whether the risk of fire was increased by the temporary use of the steam thresher at the barn, was a question properly submitted to the jury, and of that submission there can be justly no complaint. The argument, however, is that, with the use and empio.yment of this steam engine, the plaintiff had nothing to do, but that it was hired and used, without his knowledge and assent, by Solomon Tyce, his tenant. JBut we do not understand that the indiscretion of Long’s tenant was one of the risks which <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>the defendant took upon itself, and if not, we cannot see how it can he made liable therefor. In this particular the case is very like that of Diehl <em>v. </em>Adams County Mutual Insurance Co., 8 P. F. S., 443. In that case the tenant, without the acquiescence or assent of his landlord, had increased the risk of the insured premises by the erection of steam works on a public alley adjacent thereto; held that the fact that the erection was by the tenant, was no excuse for an infringement of the covenants in the policy; that the possession of • the tenant was the possession of the lessor; that he continued to be the insured party, and that the covenants he entered into when his property was insured continued whether he occupied it personally or by his tenant.</p>
    <p id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[198,982,1176,724]]]'>This ease is so nearly like the one in hand that the one may be regarded as ruling the other. The principal difference is, that in the one the erection was permanent, but was not the cause of the fire which destroyed the insured building; in the other the erection was temporary, but caused the loss. Now, let it be that this temporary use only suspended the policy during the time the thresher was in operation, yet, as the loss occurred during that time, the effect is the same as though the objectionable structure had been permanent. Nor does the' landlord’s knowledge of the act of the tenant form a material element of the case; as we have seen from the case above cited, the violation by the tenant is legally a violation by the lessor. Furthermore, the condition is not limited to an act personal or permissive on part of the insured, but the provision is that the premises shall not be occupied or used so as to increase the risk, and it therefore became Long’s duty to see that they were not so used.</p>
