The husband’s right has ever been held to "be paramount to that of the heir. His “ affinity is a nearer kindred than blood: ” Lewis, C. J.," Gibbon’s Ex’r <em>v. </em>Fairlamb, 2 Cas., 219. The rule of construction which is applicable to a case such as this is that, where there is an antecedent gift, the law will adopt that construction which will devolve the succession upon those whom the law itself has, in its provisions for distribution in cases of intestacy, regarded with the highest favor. The law is astute to find, and courts to attribute to the testator, an intent to favor those who are the favorites of the law. Another canon of construction, which should be borne in mind in this case, is that the first taker in a will is presumed in law to be the favorite of the testator: <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>McFarland’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20800" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Wright 800">1 Wright, 800</a>; Rewalt <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 11 Harris, 388; and in such cases the gift is to be construed so as to make it as effectual to her as possible: Wilson, &amp;c., <em>v. </em>McKeehan, 8 P.

It was not intended to be a limitation to such daughter’s, “heirs and next of kin,” in any strict technical sense, but those words were used by the testator as indicative merely of the quantity of interest which he meant to give to her, viz: To her for life, and upon her death, to those who, under the law, would be entitled to succeed her. The case is the same as if the clause had been written thus: “ I give to my daughter for life, and, after her death, to those who would be entitled to take as her successors under the law; but subject to the condition that if she shall leave a child or issue of such child, it or they shall take after her death.” Surely, under a clause so worded, mere collaterals would not be permitted to prevail against the claim of a husband, entitled under the law, and yet, by the change indicated, the sense of the clause as actually written has not been altered: Womratli <em>v. </em>McCormick, 1 P.

That clause directs “the principle to go......as provided by the intestate law of Pennsylvania.” “ The principle <em>to go </em>” points to succession, rather than to direct gift.

The subject of the testamentary provision was an aggregate of personal and real estate. The objects of the testator’s bounty were his <em>heirs </em>and <em>next of kin. </em>By the will he had given all the residue of his estate to his three daughters absolutely and in fee simple. By the codicil he made a radical change, and gave the residue to a trustee, in trust to keep the real estate in repair and rented, and the personal estate securely invested, aud to pay the net income of the whole to the daughters, and to hold the principal in one third parts in trust for the uses and purposes declared by the last wills of his daughters respectively, and in default of wills, for the use of child or children of the daughters; “in default of such will, and child and children or issue of such, then the principal to go to the heirs and next of kin of the daughters so dying, as provided by the intestate law of Pennsylvania.” In this provision there are apt words which define with technical precision each of two classes of beneficiaries, to wit, <em>heirs </em>and <em>next of kin. </em>It has been so often held that when technical words are used in a will or other instrument they must, have their technical meaning, unless a contrary intent appear, that it would'be a mere affectation of learning to cite the authorities. On the question of intent, in this case, the will and codicil abound with evidence that the intention of the testator corresponded precisely with the strict legal meaning of the words used. The distinction between real and per<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>sonal estate is constantly preserved, both in the words which refer to them descriptively, and in those which relate to their disposition. Thus, the residue being composed of personalty and realty, ho <em>gives </em>and <em>devises </em>it, <em>absolutely </em>and <em>in fee simple. </em>lie gives the personalty absolutely, and he devises the realty in fee simple. This is the fifth clause of the will, and by the same species of concentrated and elliptical expression, he directs in the third clause of the codicil the same residue, <em>given </em>and <em>devised </em>to his daughters, to be <em>“given to, </em>and be <em>vested inf </em>the trustee <em>absolutely </em>and in <em>fee simple, </em>in trust to repair and rent the <em>real estate </em>and securely invest the <em>personal estate, </em>for the use of his daughters. Then when he provides for the contingency which has happened, to wit, the death of a daughter without a will, children or issue, he directs that the principal shall go to the <em>heirs </em>aud <em>next of kin </em>of the daughter so dying. It is impossible to doubt, from this language, that the distinction between real and personal estate was constantly in the - mind of the testator, and that he intended that the part of the principal which, consisted of realty should go to the heirs, and the part which consisted of personalty should go to the next of kin. We think we would be doing violence fo the manifest intention of the testator if we held to any other construction. There is no occasion here to give an untechnieab meaning to technical words, as was done in the cases referred to in the appellant’s argument, in which the word <em>heirs </em>was held to have the same meaning as next of kin, or distributees, or persons entitled under the intestate law. Such a course is sometimes necessary to effectuate a testamentary result, to prevent a will from becoming practically inoperative. Thus if a testator gives personalty to a class of persons whom he names as <em>heirs, </em>the law’ in aid of his intent will consider the word as descriptive of the persons who would take as the representatives by law of the deceased person. This doctrine is illustrated in various forms and circumstances in Patterson <em>v. </em>Hawthorn, 12 S. &amp; R., 112; Buckley <em>v. </em>Reed, 3 Harris, 83; Gibbons <em>v. </em>Fairlamb, 2 Casey, 217; Eby’s Appeal, 3 Norris, 241, and other cases. These cases, however, do not at all conflict with those of the other class which hold that where technical words are used, and there is a subject to which they may apply, the technical meaning must prevail. Thus in Clark <em>v. </em>Scott, 17 P. F. S., 446, where a testamentary disposition was made quite similar to the one we are considering, this rule was strictly applied. On p. 451 Sharswood, J., said: “The testator, Thomas P. Ash, after devising his residuary estate, real and personal, to several persons, declared that in case of the death of either of them before him, the devise or bequest should not lapse, ‘but shall go to, and be taken by the heirs, <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>executors or administrators of said legatees or devisees so dying, in the same manner as if the same had been specifically devised.’ He was evidently aware of the distinction between real and personal estate. He has used throughout his will the words legally appropriate to each. All his legacies of mere personalty are by the words ‘give and bequeath,’ but when he comes to the residuary clause in which he blends both his real and personal estate, he is careful to use the words ‘give, devise and bequeath,’ and adds a limitation to ‘ heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.’ We may infer then that in the substituted gift for the lapsed devise the word ‘heirs’ was used in none other than its legal technical meaning. Apart, however, from this very important assistance at arriving at the true intention of the author of the disposition, it is a canon of construction settled in many cases, that the word ‘ heirs ’ shall receive its appropriate technical sense, unless there is some language or expression which shows that it was used in the broader and more popular sense.” Other illustrations of this ruling are found in Ralston <em>v. </em>Waln, 8 Wr., 279; Porter’s Appeal, 9 Wr., 201, and Eby’s Appeal in Wisler’s Estate, 14 Wr., 311. It does not seem necessary to pursue the subject further. Whether we consider the strict meaning of technical words employed, or the clear intent of the testator, as the guide in the construction of this testament filie result is the same. The husband is neither the heir nor the next of kin of his wife in the technical sense of those words, and there being other persons in being who do fill that description we must hold that they, and not he, are the true beneficiaries under this codicil.</p>
