While the general rale is that an executor or administrator who sells on credit the goods and chattels of his decedent, in settling the estate, must take security therefor; yet this does not apply to a sale of goods, made in the ordinary course of a business, which die executor is carrying on, for the benefit of the decedent’s estate, in pursuance of an active trust created by the will.</p>

A., by his will, appointed B. his executor, and directed that lie should have a general supervision of his (A.’s) business for the benefit of the estate. In pursuance of this trust, in March, 1873, B. sold to G. &amp; Co., about §1300 worth of leather on credit, taking their note therefor in his own name, which he twice renewed without any payments having been made thereon. Shortly after the last renewal, C. <em>&amp; </em>Co. were found to be insolvent,and nothing was ever recovered on said note. The auditor reported, that in December, 1872, one K., who had been selling G. &amp; Co. on credit, discovered on inquiry diat “they were not responsible, that <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>their real estate was encumbered to its full value and that the firm was insolvent.” There was also evidence before the auditor that A. had sold to C. &amp; Co. on credit shortly before his death; the money for which sale B. had received about the time he sold them the bill of $1300. No suit was ever brought on the note, the parties being irresponsible. After B.’s death, A.’s heirs sought to surcharge his estate with said $1300 and interest on the ground that B. had been guilty of gross negligence in not making such inquiries as would have revealed C. &amp; Co.’s condition, and in not requiring security from them.</p>

This note was twice renewed without any payments being made on it, the last renewal being on July 1873. Immediately after the last renewal of the note, it became known that Les-cure &amp; Co. were insolvent and their real estate was sold by the sheriff, without realizing enough to pay the judgment liens against the same.

This final account included an account filed by Cline himself in 1877. The accountants denied such negligence on Cline’s part and claimed that Grove himself sold Lescure &amp; Co. on credit up to the time of his death.

    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[222,894,1165,688]]]'>The said Cline took upon himself the execution of this trust. He appears to have been an old man, and there is nothing to show that he had any knowledge of the tanning business. In 1877 lie filed an account in which was included the administration of his trust for the first five years. The present account was filed by his administrators after his death. This contention grows out of an attempt to surcharge his estate with the amount of a bill of leather, $1,304.52, which in 1873 he sold to the firm of J. W. Lescure &amp; Co. oil account of Samuel Grove’s estate. It was urged on behalf of the widow and children of Samuel Grove that the sale was improvident; that Lescure &amp; Co. were at that time insolvent, and that with reasonable diligence and proper inquiry on the part of the executor he would have ascertained that fact; and that he should have sold the leather for casli or taken security for the payment of the money.</p>
    <p id="b635-6" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[217,1583,1163,376]]]'>The auditor’s finding of facts was meagre and not entirely satisfactory. He finds, however, that the firm of J. W. Lescure &amp; Co. were insolvent in August, 1873, at which time the real estate of one member of the firm was sold by the sheriff. He finds further that “about December, 1872, Clinton Keister, a witness before the auditor, who had been selling leather to said firm, discovered on inquiry that they were not responsible, that their real estate was incumbered to its full value, and that the firm was insolvent.”</p>
    <p id="b635-7" data-blocks='[["BL_635.6",635,[216,1969,1162,473]],["BL_636.1",636,[226,420,1174,646]]]'>This bill was sold in March, 1873. There was no finding that at that time the credit of the firm of Lescure &amp; Co. was not as good as during the lifetime of the testator. It does not appear to have been at any time a firm doing a large business, or having a large capital and credit. Yet the testator, shortly before his death, appears to have dealt with it. Andrew Cline, the executor, charges himself in his first account with $544.35 received for leather from the firm. There is no direct proof that this leather was sold by the testator, yet, as it was not pretended that it had been sold by the executor, we have a right to assume, what all the probabilities of the case <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>indicate, that this sale was made by the testator. If the leather sold by the executor in March, 1878, had been manufactured by the testator, and had come into the hands of his executor for the purpose of closing up his estate, there would have been more reason for holding the estate of the executor responsible for the loss upon the sale. In such case it might have been his duty to take security. But the testator directed his business to be carried on for an indefinite period for the benefit of his estate. He may have thought he was acting wisely in doing so. As a general rule, such provisions in wills result disastrously, and this case is not an exception to the rule. It has certainly impaired the estate. But we must be careful not to throw the consequences of the testator’s folly upon the executor unless it clearly appears that he deserved to be so punished.</p>
    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[226,1065,1172,432]]]'>The position that the executor should have taken security for the leather is not worth discussing. With the sharp competition of business it would be unreasonable to require security from every customer. There would be no sales upon such terms. This executor was to carry on the business in the same way the testator had been carrying it on, and in no other manner., If it resulted in a gain the estate would have the benefit of it; if in a loss, such loss must fall upon the estate. It would be a harsh rule to put the losses Upon one who had no possible participation in the profits.</p>
    <p id="b636-6" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[225,1496,1171,388]]]'>This loss was a business loss. Looking at it from the light we now have the sale was unwise. Yet we cannot doubt that it was made in perfect good faith. The executor found that his testator had sold the firm leather, and, as before stated, he received the money for one bill of several hundred dollars which had been sold by him. This was about the time the executor sold the bill of March, 1873. Other tanners were then selling the firm, and its general credit and reputation had not been seriously impaired.</p>

It provides that John C. Danner, who appears to have been a brother-in-law of the testator, was to remain upon the premises and direct the business. Danner was there when testator died, and was to remain and manage the business. The testator no doubt had entire confidence in him, and it was this confidence in all probability which influenced the testator to make the provision for continuing the business. That he relied upon his executor, an old man, unacquainted with the tanning trade, to enter into the details thereof, is hardly among the possibilities. The executor had a general supervision, nothing more. And nothing more was possible under <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>the circumstances. Without the constant personal care of a practical tanner, no profit could be expected. This the executor could not give without relinquishing entirely his own affairs, and wore he disposed even to do that, there is nothing to show that he was competent.</p>

No attempt was made to cast this burden upon him until after his death, although there was abundant opportunity to do so before. It would be a harsh rule to charge his estate with the loss of this money now, and the law does not require us to do so.</p>
