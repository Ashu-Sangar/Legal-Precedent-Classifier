They owned in Lebanon county a rolling mill, forge, some houses and a farm, from the management and renting of which by the assignees after January, 1875, certain profits accrued, which they applied to the payment of a judgment against the assignors entered in 1867, and to the payment of interest on two other judgments, one entered to April Term, 1873, and the other to January Term, 1874. There was also some real estate in Dauphin county, which it does not appear was in any way connected with the business of the firm, and which the assignees sold to the holder of the first lien against it for a sum not equal to the encumbrance, paying him the full amount of the purchase money without any deduction for the expenses of its care or the management of the trust. These transactions were set out in their second and final account, filed in August, 1879, upon which a balance appeared to be due the accountants, and certain wage creditors of the firm excepted, alleging that the rents and profits accruing from the use of the assigned property since the assignment had been improperly applied to the judgments referred to, and also that the real estate in Dauphin county must bear a part of the expenses. The exceptions have been lost, but will be found at length in Trustee Docket vol. 3, 211, and it is also admitted that the only exceptants are wage creditors of the' firm.</p>

The recent case of Jones’s Appeal, 30 Pitts. Leg. Jour., 375, found also in 1 Chester Co. Pep., 582, and 4 York Leg. Kec., 25, [6 Out., 285], seems to be decisive of this point. There the real estate of a firm was partnership property and was assigned for the benefit of creditors. A mill upon the land was burned and its machinery so injured by the fire as to be sold for old iron. A crop of grass also was grown upon the land after the assignment, and the wage creditors claimed the proceeds of both crop and machinery. They were, however, awarded to lien creditors, and the Supreme Court expressly approves this part of the decree, although the opinion is mainly concerned about other questions. The principle of this decision seems to us to cover the case of rents. If the machinery which in that case helped to give value to the land, and the grass which grew upon it after the claims for wages had accrued, partook of its character to such an extent as, equitably at least, to belong to the lien creditors after severance, it would seem plain that the rents and farm profits here, which the land produced and which wholly accrued after these claims for wages had become due, ought to follow a similar course. The income or product of an assigned estate is held by the assignee in trust for all the creditors of the assignor according to their legal and equitable rights, Bailsman’s Appeal, 9 N., 180; and as all the judgments referred to were entered more than six months before the assignment was made, and therefore before the labor was performed, it is hard to see why the substantial- owners of the property have not at least an equitable right to the whole of what it produces. Burkholder’s Appeal, 13 N., 524, regards the lien creditors of an assignor in the same light, viz., as substantial owners of his real estate, and divides among them the interest on deferred, payments, even after the land has been sold by order of court.</p>

The liens thus referred to by the auditor are the same now in question, and <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>with others not reached much exceeded the value of the land. If then, as against these liens, the claim of the wage creditors could not be paid out of the “proceeds of sale” of the real estate, a subject expressly within the words of the Act of 1872, how, as against them, can it reach subsequently earned rents and profits, a subject not named in the Act and apparently not within its provisions? Such a claim upon these rents and profits cannot have preference without authority of law, which we do not find, and in our opinion cannot, for the reasons given, even stand upon the same footing as the liens in question here.</p>

Judgments are bare liens, and the holders can exercise no dominion over the land bound by them. They must first be satisfied out of the personal property of the debtor, if he has any. The plaintiff in the judgment is not interested in the land, as land, but only in his lien. He has neither <em>jus in re </em>nor <em>ad rem, </em>as regards the defendant’s property. He has a lien, and the law gives a right to satisfaction out of the property, and that is all; and a judgment creditor for balance of purchase money due has no insurable interest in the real estate sold: Grevemeyer <em>v. </em>The <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>Southern Mutual Eire Ins.

Rents accruing subsequently to the sheriff's sale and before acknowledgment of sheriff’s deed, belong to the defendant in the suit: Garrett <em>v. </em>Dewart, 7 Wr., 342. Rents are not assets for the payment of the debts of a decedent; if the administrator receives rent from the real estate of Ins decedent, he is but a trustee for the widow and heirs; and a mortgagee cannot enforce the payment of interest on his mortgage from the rents collected: Robb’s Appeal, 5 Wr., 40. Nothing can be more erroneous than the conclusion of. the court below that the judgment lien creditors are the substantial owners of the real estate, and therefore entitled, to these rents. Jones’s Appeal, upon which the judge below relied to sustain him in his ruling, decides no such question. It was there held that grass and old iron, the refuse of a mill that had burned down during the pendency of the trust, belonged to the judgment creditors, and that the proceeds thereof could not be applied to the payment of wage claimants. This doctrine is entirely sound. It seems to have escaped the notice of the court that both partook of the character of real estate, and as the labor claims accrued after the judgments had attached no wage claimants could be paid out of the proceeds of that real estate, because expressly forbidden by the statute under which they claimed their preference. Under the Act of'April, 9, 1872, and the general policy of the law of preferring labor claimants, the appellant was entitled to be paid in full out of the rents: Reed’s Appeal, 6 Harris, 287. But if not entitled as a preferred creditor, the rents, under the express trust in the assignment, should be distributed pro rata among all creditors, including the appellant.</p>

We think the mere rents of the land in the hands of assignees not being the product of business managed and carried on by them, but solely the product of the land, itself, should be applied on those prior liens which would be entitled to the proceeds of the lands, if sold. This we understand to be the ground on which the court ruled the case.
