It appears that a judgment was obtained on February 26,1873, against a certain John W. Middleton. On Dec. 1877, a sci. fa. was issued against him to revive it; to this defendant pleaded payment, and issue was joined, which, at the time of his death, Dec. 1878, was pending and undetermined. On February 26, 1879, a sci. fa. was issued against Sarah Middleton, administratrix, which was not in form a sci. fa. to bring in the personal representatives, but a soi. fa. to revive, and on this a money judgment was taken. As the only prior judg<a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>inent bore date in 1878, it was clearly too late for this process to revive it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[213,500,1186,986]]]'>“The most favorable construction on the proceeding is to regard it as intended to bring in the personal representatives, and to consider the judgment as valid against the administrator. This the plaintiff contends is all that can be required. That when there is a valid, unimpeached judgment existing at the death of the defendant, the bringing in of heirs by sci. fa. is not necessary: McMillan <em>v. </em>Red, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 237" data-case-ids="1856241" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0237-01">4 W. &amp; S., 237</a>. But can this judgment be so considered? Its revival was contested by the defendant, and his plea of payment on his death left undetermined. Was this not, in the words of the Act of 1834, “an action or legal proceeding depending” at the death of the defendant, and' was it not the duty of the plaintiff, if he wished to charge the lands, to bring in the heirs? They clearly have had no day in court. Their ancestor was resisting this claim in a proper legal forum to the day of his death, after which a judgment was entered against an administrator, and the only notice taken of the heirs was to sell their property under it. Certainly this is the'very evil the Act of 1834 was intended to prevent. Entertaining these views on the main objection to the title, we do not think it necessary to discuss the minor ones. The title, in oiir opinion, is not so free from doubt as to the rights of the heirs of John W. Middleton as to compel its acceptance.”</p>

The 33d section of that Act, providing that after the death of a judgment debtor no execution shall issue on the judgment, without a prior sci. fa. against his personal representatives, is prohibitory, not permissive, and it cannot apply to a case like the present, where the plaintiff, at the time of defendant’s death, could not have had execution himself, if living. For the same reason McMillan <em>v. </em>Red, and the other cases relied on by plaintiff in error, are inapplicable. Suppose that this judgment had been opened on the motion of the defendant, in his lifetime, showing <em>prima facie </em>a good defence to it, and he had died after issue joined and before his defence had been determined, will it be contended that the plaintiffs could then have ignored this defence and taken judgment by default against the administratrix? And yet that would not have been more entirely a “ proceeding depending ” than this case as it is.</p>

The result was, after a good deal of litigation, that with respect to the right to judgment upon two sheriff’s returns of “ nihil,” the action should be assimilated to a common law sci. fa., in which two returns were equivalent to garnishment (which even quite recently has not been free from doubt: See Taylor <em>v. </em>Toung, 21 P. F. S., 81), and that as to the form of the judgment, it should be.the same as in an action of debt “ quod recuperet,” which is entirely different from the judgment on a sci. fa. at common law. So that where the defendant is living, a judgment on a sci. fa. is a new judgment, and has a lien on all estate owned by defendant at the time of its entry, without regard to the lien of the original judgment: Duff <em>v. </em>Wynkoop, 24 P. F. S., 300; Fursht <em>v. </em>Overdeer, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 470" data-case-ids="1854621" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0470-01">3 W. &amp; S., 470</a>; Stewart <em>v. </em>Peterson, 13 P. F. S., 230. But the judgment “ quod recuperet,” is given only in cases where the defendant is living. When he is dead, and the sci. fa. is against his personal representatives, the judgment is prescribed in each case by the statute which directs and regulates the sci. fa. Under the 33d Section of the Act of 1834, by virtue of which the plaintiff claims to have proceeded, the judgment is an award of execution, inasmuch as that section requires that the executor or, administrator be warned “ to show cause against the issuing thereof.” Hence such a judgment has a lien only on the land bound by the lien of the original judgment which has been revived. The new judgment is but a continuation of the original lien, and not a new judgment, “ <em>quod </em>recuperet: ” Shaeffer <em>v. </em>Child, <a href="/watts/7/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="7 Watts 84" data-case-ids="1846875" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0084-01">7 Watts, 84</a>.</p>

Middleton, the then owner in fee of the real estate in question. Within five years thereafter, a <em>scire facias </em>to revive, &amp;c., was issued against the defendant in the judgment, to which he pleaded payment, and the issue joined thereon was pending and undetermined at the time of his decease in December, 1878. No further proceedings were had in that case; but, in February, 1879, a <em>scire </em>facias, to revive <em>et quare executionem non </em>was issued on the original judgment, served on Sarah Middleton, administratrix of John W. Middleton; and, in default of appearance, judgment was entered and amount liquidated at $&gt;49,282.23.

F.

It is virtually conceded by the learned counsel for defendant that this would be so, were it not for the fact that an issue on the former <em>scire facias </em>was pending and undetermined at the death of the defendant in the original judgment. We are of opinion, however, that this feature of the case can make no difference — that it is insufficient to distinguish the case in principle from those above cited. Notwithstanding the pendency of the issue in the first <em>scire facias </em>and the fact that more than five years had elapsed since the entry of the original judgment, as between the judgment creditor and his debtor, the judgment was a valid, subsisting lien on the land at the date of the defendant’s death in December, 1878: Brown’s Appeal, 10 Norris, 485. According to well settled principles it was therefore unnecessary to make his widow and heirs parties before proceeding to execution against the real estate of the intestate bound by the lien of the judgment recovered in his lifetime: Shearer <em>v. </em>Brindley, 26 P. F. Smith, 300, and cases there cited.
