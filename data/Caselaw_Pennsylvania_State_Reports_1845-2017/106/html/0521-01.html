If such were the law, the result would be, that the Commonwealth would get nothing. I deny that a man can hold on to the possession of his worldly goods until the eve of his dissolution draws nigh, and then call in a blood relative and just hand it over to him, and in that way deprive the Commonwealth of the right to collect her revenues — such is not the law. If this property was given by John Reish to Isaac Reish in good faith, and not for the purpose of the payment of the tax, then we instruct you that you ought to find for the defendant. But on the other hand, if you believe the contention on the part of the Commonwealth, that it was not a gift springing from pure affection, or that in the absence of its being a gift it was a sale and the consideration was only one dollar, and that, after all, the moving and inducing cause which prompted John Reish to make the transfer, was to escape the payment of the tax— then we instruct you that you ought to find a verdict in favor of the Commonwealth.”</p>

It is not a question of the intent with which the transfer was made, but of what interest was transferred. A man’s disposition of his property before his death, in order to prevent its becoming subject to collateral inheritance tax, is no more a fraud on the commonwealth, than his bequeathing his entire estate to strangers would be a fraud on his heirs. The liability of an estate to the payment of eollareral inheritance tax, depends upon whether the decedent was owner of it at the time of his death: Stinger <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 2 Casey, 423. In Wright’s Appeal, 2 Wr. 507, and Tritt <em>v. </em>Crotzer, 1 Harris 451, the estates were conveyed by deeds “ intended to take effect in possession after the grantor's death,” thus coming within the express provisions of the statute. John Reish conveyed his estate absolutely and presently, and the bonds executed at the same time by Isaac, show no intention of the <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>parties to reserve any interest in the grantor. Under the bond there was simply a personal charge created against Isaac Reish to pay John certain moneys during the latter’s life.

The Act contemplates three classes of cases, to wit: Death with a will; death without a will; transfer by deed made or intended to take effect after the death of the grantor. It is clear, under the statute, that where a deed absolute on its face, is accompanied by an agreement, that the enjoyment of the estate conveyed, shall be postponed until after the death of the grantor, said estate will be subject to the payment of the collateral inheritance tax. The bond executed by Isaac Reish, is such an agreement, and under it the covenantor was simply trustee of the legal title to John Reish’s estate until the latter’s death. This deed and bond were a mere contrivance to evade the payment of the collateral inheritance tax, and cannot be sustained for that purpose under the statute.</p>

The deed and the bond were contemporaneous, the execution and delivery of both constituted a single transaction ; the deed was absolute, it contained no condition, it was without reservation ; but the bond, although in the form of a mere personal .obligation, was in effect, we think, as regards the collateral inheritance tax, a postponement of the time of enjoyment, a reservation of <em>the </em>income and profits of <em>the </em>property, during the lifetime of the grantor. All property is <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>subject to the tax. which, in the language of the statute, is transferred by deed, &amp;c., <em>made or intended to take effect </em>in possession, <em>or enjoyment </em>after the death of the grantor. The commonwealth’s right to collateral inheritance tax is, therefore, not defeated by a conveyance of the title, nor by possession taken under it, if the enjoyment is intended to take effect at the death of the grantor. The enjoyment of real estate is not the exact equivalent of possession, nor is it so used in this statute; in no case could the distinction be more clearly made, than in the case under consideration. Under his deed, Isaac Reish was the undoubted owner of the lands in fee, and of the personalty absolutely, and the title drew to it the right of possession; but by the express contemporaneous agreement of the parties, the ownership took effect <em>in enjoyment </em>at the death of the grantor. John Reish, was entitled to receive the same income and profits from the property, during his life, as if the transfer had not been made. One certainly cannot be considered, as in the actual enjoyment of an estate, who has no right to the profits or incomes arising or accruing therefrom.</p>
    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.4",540,[213,1279,1170,514]]]'>It is true, the obligation of the bond was not inserted as a condition or reservation in the deed, it was in form a mere personal obligation; but this contention does not involve a technical question of title nor of lien, the whole matter depends upon the single fact, whether or not the transfer was made or intended to take effect, in enjoyment at the death of the grantor. The policy of the law will not permit the owner of an estate, to defeat the plain provisions of the collateral inheritance law, by any device which secures to him, for life, the income, profits, and enjoyment thereof; it must be by such a conveyance as parts with the possession, the title, and the enjoyment in the grantor’s life time.</p>

The vice of the argument, on part of the plaintiff in error, is in assuming that in order to charge an estate, transferred by deed, with an inheritance tax, the grantor must, at the time of his death, have some title or estate remaining, and that such title or estate only as the grantor actually owns, at death, is subject to the tax. Avery labored and ingenious argument is made to show that John Reish did not die seised or possessed of any estate, excepting the bond and the right it secured; that these only, should have been appraised. The learned counsel contend that “the part of such'estate or <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>interest therein” transferred by the death of John Reish, and which then took effect in enjoyment and possession, and these only are subject to the tax. The letter as well as the spirit ancl meaning of the act, however, is clear. When an estate is transferred by deed to any other than those exempted from the operation of the statute, intended, however, to take effect in enjoyment at the death of the grantor, it is the value of the lands so transferred which is liable to the duty, not the value of the interest or part remaining.</p>

If such ail intention is not expressed in the deed, it may otherwise appear; in this (¡ase it is shown by the bond, which was part and parcel of the transaction which involved the conveyance.</p>
