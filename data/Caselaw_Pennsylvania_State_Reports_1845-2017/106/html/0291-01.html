That on June 19, 1883, without the knowledge or consent of said defendant, the record was amended by striking out the name of Mary Jane Haekett. That said Joseph Haekett afterwards departed this life, and the writ in the present suit is sued out by her as the administratrix of said Joseph Haekett, deceased, as sole plaintiff, when, as it is submitted on bebalf of defendant, said Joseph Haekett, as sole plaintiff, had no right to recover in said suit or on said recognizance.

Haekett ” as co-plaintiff, the court, under the statute, amended the suit by striking out her name from the record wherever it stood as co-plaintiff. The cause of action, and the parties essential to the action, remained the same. Otherwise the court would not have permitted the amendment, which is allowed only if the cause of action be not changed : Kaylorv. Shaffner, <a href="/pa/24/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="24 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="9505148" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0489-01">24 Pa. St. 489</a>. Mary J. Hackett was not a party to the cause of action, and naming her as co-plaintiff was a clerical mistake, surplusage, and not a material part of the record nor of the recognizance. So far back as Welch <em>v. </em>Chambers, <a href="/yeates/4/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Yeates 559" data-case-ids="6776686" data-case-paths="/yeates/4/0559-01">4 Yeates, </a><a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a><a href="/yeates/4/0559-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Yeates 559" data-case-ids="6776686" data-case-paths="/yeates/4/0559-01">559</a>, it was held that a recognizance of bail in error may be amended by striking out the name of the obligee and inserting another, to reach the merits. The Supreme Court will allow an amendment by introducing a new name, or striking out a name as plaintiff, after writ of error, in furtherance of the justice of the case, and yet no case is reported wherit was claimed that such amendment discharged the bail in error. Especially on appeals from justices amendments are allowable. Yet if the bail on appeal is thereby discharged, the statutes of amendment are illusory.</p>

    <p id="b308-7" data-blocks='[["BL_308.8",308,[243,1130,1178,548]]]'>It cannot be doubted that the recognizance in suit is such an instrument as entitles plaintiff to judgment for want of an affidavit of defence, and hence there is no merit in the first suggestion contained in defendant’s affidavit; nor is there any merit in the averment that, pending the original proceeding in court, payments were made on account of the claim for rent. In the absence of any allegation to the contrary, the presumption is that the payments were duly credited and the verdict rendered for the residue. The record of the original proceeding shows a verdict and judgment thereon in favor of plaintiff for possession of the demised premises and $200 rent in arrear. No writ of error having been taken to that judgment, it is final and conclusive as to the amount of rent.</p>
    <p id="b308-8" data-blocks='[["BL_308.9",308,[234,1685,1178,729]]]'>The only remaining ground of defence set up in the affidavit is, that defendant was released from liability as bail by the amendment allowed on trial of the original landlord and tenant proceeding commenced by Joseph and Mary J. Haekett against the parties for whom defendant in this suit became bail. After the case was removed by appeal to the Common Pleas, it was discovered that by mistake Mary J. Plackett had been improperly joined as co-plaintiff, and by leave of court the record was amended bjr striking out her name. The amendment was clearly authorized and properly allowed: Kaylor <em>v. </em>Shafiher, 12 Harris, 489; Schollenberger <em>v. </em>Seldonridge, 13 Wright, S3; Cochran <em>v. </em>Arnold, 8 P. E. Smith, 399; Wescott <em>v. </em>Edmunds, 18 Id., 34. Whenever it appears that a mistake has occurred, it is the duty of the court to correct it, taking care that the. amendment be not used for the purpose of introducing a cause of action substantially different from that on which the suit was actually though informally brought.</p>

When a person becomes surety for another in a judicial proceeding, there is at least an implied understanding that it shall be conducted according to the established course of practice in such cases. The statutes regulating amendments, as well as other incidents of trial, are as much a part of the contract, in the contemplation of the parties thereto, as if they were embodied in the condition of the bond or recognizance: Jamieson <em>v. </em>Capron, 14 Norris, 15.</p>
