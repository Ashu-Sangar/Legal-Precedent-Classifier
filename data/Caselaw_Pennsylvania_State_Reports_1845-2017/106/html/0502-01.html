As to this, the auditor 1 reported that the proceedings in partition in 1851 had been duly recorded and indexed in the Orphans’ Court docket of Union county; that there was no such book as a judgment index book in the office of the clerk of said court, so there could be no entry therein; that the record did not show that <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>tlie recognizance was ever certified from Union to Snyder county prior to 1879, nor was it ever entered on the judgment index or lien docket of Snyder county as a recognizance, but only as a judgment on the recognizance, and this only on October 81, 1879; that § 8 of the Act of April 22, 1856 (P. L., 532), provides as follows: “That the lien of no judgment, recognizance, execution levied on real estate in the same or another county, or of writs of scire facias to revive or have executions of judgments, shall commence or be continued as against any purchaser or mortgagee, unless the same be indexed in the county where the real estate is situated, in a book to be called the judgment index, and it shall be the duty of the prothonotaryor clerk forthwith to index the same according to priority of date, and the plaintiff shall furnish the proper information to enable him to perform said duty.”</p>

The court, therefore, entered a decree overruling the exceptions filed to the administrator’s special return as to tract Ho, 1, sustaining the exceptions to the auditor’s second report, and directing the fund to be distributed in accordance with the first report.

L., 551). The Act of 1856 changed the rule that a purchaser is affected with <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>notice of everything which lies in the line of his title, so that he is no longer compelled to search for liens by judgments or recognizances existing in any court outside of the county where the real estate lies, nor is he to be affected by any judgment or recognizance unless it is indexed in a judgment index book. Unless this Act includes Orphans’ Court recognizances, it is practically meaningless, or, rather, a snare to purchasers. That it was intended to embrace such recognizances is manifest from the fact that a failure to index them in the county where the real estate lies does not defeat their lien as to judgment creditors, but as to purchasers and mortgagees only, thus clearly indicating that the'lien, in the view of the lawmaker, was of a kind not then requiring to be indexed, and in no other form than by recognizance in the Orphans’ Court did such a lien exist — the latter is the only form of record lien which at the time of the passage of the Act was good as against a purchaser or mortgagee, without being indexed.</p>

It is almost thirty years since this Act was passed. It is admitted by the learned counsel for the appellant, that the present question has never before been raised. It is certain that to hold such a doctrine now would disturb, if not destroy, a vast number of titles, would impair the value of liens of this character to an unknown extent, and would practically revolutionize the law upon this subject as commonly understood by the bench and the bar throughout the commonwealth. Nothing short of extreme necessity would justify a court of last resort in taking such a step. Fortunately, no such necessity exists in this case.</p>
    <p id="b520-7" data-blocks='[["BL_520.6",520,[226,1874,1166,257]]]'>The literal terms of the section in question, prohibit lien as against purchasers and mortgagees, to four species of judicial acts or proceedings, viz: (1) judgments, (2) recognizances, (3) executions levied on real estate, and (4) writs of <em>scire facias </em>to revive or have execution of judgments, unless the same are indexed as prescribed.</p>

The recognizance is known in the Orphans’ Court as it is in the Criminal Courts, but the others are not. But recognizance is also a form of obligation known to the practice of the Common Pleas, and therefore, where it is coupled with other acts <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>and proceedings of that court, the whole being subject to a regulation common to all, it is not necessary to infer that it is used in any other than Its natural, associated sense. The plain and apparent reading of the section is to prohibit lien to certain judgments and proceedings in the Common Pleas except upon certain conditions which also are peculiar to that court. For there is no such book either created by law or established or maintained by practice, as the “ judgment index,” in any other court than the Common Pleas; and it is in a book of that name that the acts and proceedings mentioned in the section are to be indexed.</p>

This Act of 1856, contains no provision specifically directing such a book to be opened or kept In the Orphans’ Court, and we can not declare that such a duty to keep such a book in that court arises under the third section, except by inferring it. But there is no ground for such an inference unless we also infer that the word “ recognizance ” used in the section, <em>necessarily </em>includes recognizance in the Orphans’ Court. We do not feel able or willing to draw either of these inferences, as all the words of the section, including this one, can be satisfied without doing so.</p>

But in cases of this kind, such notice is amply furnished by -the ordinary investigation of title, which all such persons are bound to make in any event. Orphans’ Court recognizances, such as this, are directly in the line of the title. They are a part of the very proceedings by means of which title is derived, and cannot be overlooked if the title is really examined. We have said on three distinct occasions, that there is a radical difference be<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>tween these liens and those that appear on the record of the Common Pleas, that the former are in the line of the title, while-the latter are outside.

An Act of Assembly has declared that a judgment docket shall be kept in the Common Pleas. This is for the information of subsequent lien creditors and purchasers. No such requirement exists respecting liens in the Orphans’ Court.” The same sentiment was repeated in Bailey <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20478" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Wright 478">5 Wright, 478</a>; and McCandless’ Appeal 2 Out., 494.
