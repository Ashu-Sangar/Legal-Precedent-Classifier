It was consummated in that way.” The force of his testimony is broken by that of Mrs. Earnest, who testified to conversations with him in which he said: “ All he had in it was a life estate, and when it came into my hands it should be clean and clear......He always stuck to it that the house belonged to my sister......He always said that he had nothing more than a life estate in it.” Again Mrs.. Earnest says: “Mr. Hill said: ‘Sis, I have bought this Louse for Liz, and gave it to her as her own.’ I said, ‘Liz, is that so ? ’ She said, ‘ Yes.’ I said, ‘ Won’t you show me the deeds ? ’ and she did.</p>

The Master, does not believe that interest influenced them in any appreciable degree, but as one testified to conversations as old as 1867, and therefore to be received with caution, and the other was not very clear in his recollection of the exact words used in 1876, they in effect neutralize each other; and they also may be stricken from the list of witnesses.</p>

White was objected to as a witness to conversations with Mrs. Hill under the exception to the Act of 1869, the assignor of the thing or contract in action being dead. The Master rules that the Act onfy applies to parties in interest or to those claiming through the deceased party.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b326-7" data-blocks='[["BL_326.7",326,[217,1511,1176,765]]]'>As Mr. White does not occupy either relation, he is competent; the same ruling applies to Mr. Fuller. Mr. White testified to a conversation with Mrs. Hill in 1870, or ’71 at the time Mr. Hill was lying dangerously ill. She expressed uneasiness about the property, and was assured by White that she need not feel troubled, as she held the title and the position would not be changed. “ As near as I can recollect she said, ‘This is Mr. Hill’s property, and I didn’t know but what it might go to some of his heirs.’ She spoke of a brother of Mr. Hill towards whom she did not seem to have a kindly feeling. I assured her there would be no difSculty about that, as the title was in her and would be safe enough. That seemed to satisfy her, and she was more calm and contented.” This is evidence of an uneasy mental condition, possibly arising from a knowledge that the property was not absolutely hers, but it is not very clear or conclusive upon the point in dispute. On this conversation the witness was not cross-examined.</p>

The Master is not satisfied that her peculiarities amounted to such a degree of insanity as to disable her from executing a legal instrument. .....The question is not important, however, for, if a trust be established, equity would not permit it to fail through the insanity or recalcitrancy of the trustee.</p>

He neither collected the rents, nor made any effort, except on one occasion, to lease the property, which he knew was standing idle. He did not pay the taxes, but permitted his wife to do so. Subsequent to the purchase of the house, and during the short period that he lived with his wife at the house as a home, he gave her large sums of money. When they separated they remained apart for years, she at boarding, he at Mrs. Clifton’s, the house of her mother. His conduct may be explained in part by these circumstances. After his wife’s death, in October, 1875, he entered into possession, paid three years’ arrears of taxes, rented the property, took the title papers and is now receiving the rents. He did not communicate his claim to the defendants, and did not file his bill until December II,, 1879.</p>

The Master cannot overlook the fact that, though all objections to the competency of John Hill were withdrawn on the condition of the admission of Mrs. Earnest as a witness, yet under the <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>grave view of such a case taken by the court in Buchanan <em>v. </em>Streeper, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20W.N.C.%20434" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="11 W.N.C. 434">11 W. N. C., 434</a>, his testimony is to be weighed with the utmost care. It is not clear, in point of time, when the conversations testified to by Hill occurred. It would seem that for some time he had had a certain house in view that he wished to buy, and on a certain day, having drawn from White about ($&gt;6,000) six thousand dollars, he sent for Mr. Callan, the owner, and, after some little talk, “bought the house.” “I paid forty-three hundred dollars. I left the money in his presence with my wife, to pay him......I ordered the deed to be made in my name.” This evidently was all on the same day when the bargain was closed. After dinner, presumably on that day, he bought a horse and wagon, and took his friends, Fuller and White, to drive, who gave him the advice already considered. A change of intention was the result, for he subsequently states “the title was put in my wife’s name, by my consent, after explanations from my conveyancer, who said she could not convey without my signature.” When did this take place? There is nothing to guide us in determining whether it was a day or a month previous to the day of settlement and delivery of the deed; but it is clear that it did not occur on the day of settlement, for on cross-examination he says, “I gave my wife the money she paid for it; I was not at home at the time of payment.” Mr. Hill then testified to conversations with his wife about the property, in which it was understood that the property was to be his at her death. These conversations took place at or about the time of the purchase. There was one conversation previous to the purchase. At the time of making the purchase, I said, “ I am going to put the property in your name, with the understanding that it would revert to me after your death. She agreed to that.” This is far from being’ clear, satisfactory, or consistent. The word “purchase ” is doubtful in meaning. It does not mark the time. It cannot mean day of settlement, for he says he was not at home at that time. It cannot mean the day of execution of the deed, for there is no intimation that the deed was prepared and held for examination, or that the conversation with Mrs. Hill took place in the presence of the conveyancer. If it means, as is most probable, the day on which the bargain was struck with Callan, when he says, “I bought the house,” then it contradicts his previous testimony that he ordered the deed to be made in his own name, and that it was not until after conversation -with his friends, and subsequently with his conveyancer, that his change of mind took place. This conflict or obscurity of statement may be explained by referring all these conversations to different days and times; nor is it to be wondered at that Mr. Hill’s recollection should be confused, <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>as lie is detailing conversations which occurred about eighteen years before, but it certainly does not meet the requirements of proof indicated by Rearick’s Exrs. <em>v. </em>Rearick, nt supra, nor is it, in the language of Buchanan <em>v. </em>Streeper, “ full, clear, and convincing.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[223,648,1184,1774]]]'>Mrs. Earnest’s testimony to admissions made by Hill, contrary to his own interest, still further shake confidence in it, and the Master has already ruled that both witnesses may, for the practical purposes of decision, be considered as destructive of each other. What other testimony is there in the causo ? The only conversation that Mr. White ever had with Mrs. Hill was ten years after the deed had been put in her name, and this would be admissible only in corroboration of prior arrangements at the time of the execution of the deed previously established by proof. The same is true of Brennan’s testimony, even if its force were not neutralized by that of Mr. Richards. In order then to ascertain what took place at the time the deed was executed and delivered we are limited to tlio testimony of Fuller. There is “ the pinch of the case.” Mr. Fuller said he had had three conversations with Mrs. Hill, all of them were before the “ purchase ” of the house. One was some months before, and one was “just as they were closing the bargain.” These words do not fix the time; they may mean the day of settlement, or they may mean, as is most probable, the day when Hill closed with Callan. This was the day on which Fuller went to see the house, and came back with Hill and had a conversation with Mrs. Hill, in which Fuller, not Mrs. Hill, said, “It would be a saving fund for him.” It does not appear that in any of the three conversations she said anything that could be relied on with safety, nor does the aggregate of what she said at all times weigh heavily on the scale. Fuller says: “I don’t think she expressed herself except to say that it would be a good thing for John to buy it as lie would have something to support himself when lie got out of employment or became disabled.” Then followed a question of doubtful propriety: “Was it your impression from what she said that she regarded herself as the absolute owner of the property?” <em>A. </em>“No, as a sort of trustee, though she did not use that word.” This answer may mean much or little, but as long as Mrs. Hill’s words are not given, and as all the conversations recalled are eighteen years old, the Master cannot rely upon this evidence as of value. The residuum of the analysis is the impression of a witness which is undoubtedly insufficient to sustain a resulting trust. How can it be said that the testimony is “full, clear and convincing? ”</p>

The presumption of a gift under the circumstances is merely a presumption of fact, which is to prevail in the absence of evidence, or when the transaction is altogether unexplained. It raises a legal intent in the absence of evidence, but the actual intention may be gathered from the circumstances, and when it can be so gathered it must prevail. “Although a purchase in the name of a wife or child, if altogether unexplained, will be deemed a 'gift, yet you may take surrounding circumstances into consideration, so as to say that it is a trust, not a gift: ” Jessel, M. R., in Marshal <em>v. </em>Crutwell, L. R., 20 Equity Cases, 329. The presumption merely determines the burden of proof, and though, of course, the evidence must be .satisfactory, yet this case does not differ from any other in that respect. “Taking into view all the circumstances, as I understand I am bound to-do, as a juryman, I think,” etc.: Jessel, M.

Thus, in McGinity <em>v. </em>McGinity, 13 P. F. S., 38, it was the cardinal fact whether or not the plaintiff’s money paid for the land that was in dispute, and it was in reference to that that Sharswood, J., says “ the evidence ought to be clear, explicit, and unequivocal.” So, in Buchanan <em>v. </em>Streeper, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20W.N.C.%20434" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 W.N.C. 434">11 <em>W. </em>N.

Tried by this standard, we think complainant has established liis case. At the time of the purchase he has earned the money in his business, and proposes to buy himself a house. In view of his habits, the suggestion was made by his friend, and for his sake, that the title should be put in his wife’s name as a security for a provision for the future, to him as well as to her. In this suggestion he acquiesced, and it was carried out. Had the contingency, which has now arisen, been pointed out to him at the time, there is not the slightest doubt, on the evidence, that he would have expressed his real intention by providing for his own right as against any claims from his wife’s relatives. The conveyance to his wife was the means, not the end desired, and the wife having enjoyed the property during her life, it should now go to him freed from all claims by mere strangers.</p>

The presumption of trust does not arise, where, from the relation of the parties, we may fairly assume that the purchase was made in the discharge of duty, or from motives of natural love and affection ; a husband owes to his wife not only affection, but maintenance and support, and from such a transaction as this the law primarily presumes that the husband intended to settle so much of his estate upon his wife, rather than that she should become a trustee for his use. It is certainly true that, as in other cases, the trust, if any exists, results solely from the payment of the purchase money; no express trust can be established by parol, jmt that payment must appear to have been made with the clear understanding and intention that a trust shall exist. This may appear from the attending circumstances, or from the acts or declarations of the parties at the time of the purchase, but it must be shown by evidence which is clear, explicit, and unequivocal. The presumption Of gift, it is true, is but a presumption of fact, which determines the burden of proof. Yet, as the effect of the rebutting evidence may be to fasten a trust upon, the legal title, it must, for that reason, conform to the measure stated; every element essential to the existence or creation of a resulting trust, in any given case, must be clearly shown. This rule grows out of the policy pursued under the statute of frauds, and its enforcement is,essential to the secure enjoyment of real property. We cannot distinguish between the measure of proof required to rebut the ordinary presumption arising from the face of the deed to Elizabeth Hill, and the presump<a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>tion of gift arising from the relation of the parties, where the purpose is to set up a resulting trust against the legal title. Resulting trusts, although reserved out of the statute of frauds, are in conflict with the sound principles upon which that statute is based [Strimpfler <em>v. </em>Roberts, 6 Harris, 298], and when one voluntarily places his rights to real property in such a plight that he can only establish them by an attack upon the written legal title, through the instrumentality of merely oral evidence, lie cannot complain if he is held to that uniform measure of proof which will secure adequate protection against the effects of fraud and perjury, and especially so if ho choose as the custodian of the title his wife or child, to whom he occupies a relation of especial duty and obligation, and in whose favor presumptions of peculiar force must necessarily arise.</p>
    <p id="b333-6" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[192,1057,1175,817]]]'>In Roberts’ Appeal, 4 Norris, 87, which was affirmed upon the opinion of the court below, Judge Thayer, in speaking of trusts which arise from the payment of purchase money, said: “ The presumption of such a resulting trust is always rebutted where, to use the language of the books, ‘ the purchase may be fairly deemed to be made for another from motives of natural love and affection.’ Thus a purchase in the name of a wife or of a child, is uniformly held by the unaided force of the relationship alone, to rebut the presumption, unless there be clear evidence to show the donee was intended to he a mere trustee.” In a long line of cases it has been held that to establish a resulting trust the evidence must be clear, explicit and unequivocal; the rule is so well established that a citation of the authorities, in extenso, seems unnecessary. We may refer, however, to McGinity <em>v. </em>McGinity, 13 P. F. S., 38; Nixon’s Appeal, Id., 279; Lingenfelter <em>v. </em>Richey, 12 P. F. S., 123; Kistler's Appeal, 23 P. F.

Does the evidence in the case at bar conform to this standard? We think it does not. It must be observed, upon a full examination of the testimony taken in support of this alleged trust, that it is not only vague, inconsistent and conflicting in its details, but also involved and inconclusive in its effect. Besides, it is seriously contradicted and shaken by the testimony taken on the other side. If we were to conclude, as matter of fact, that a trust was intended, <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>it would be most difficult to determine its terms. If the testimony of White, Fuller and Brennan establishes or tends to establish anything it is that Elizabeth Hill was the mere trustee for her husband, that she had no beneficial interest whatever in the property, and that she was the mere custodian of the legal title for his benefit. Their testimony is meagre in details, loose, and unsatisfactory as to time, but it tends to show this or it shows nothing.</p>

He repudiates this theory of the case in emphatic language. Pie says: “ The title was put in my wife’s name by my consent, after explanations from my conveyancer, who said she could not convey without my signature. In every conversation I ever had with Mrs. Hill about the property it was understood that it was to be mine at her death. She agreed to that; she always said, ‘ Who else ? ’ These conversations took place at or about the time of the purchase. There was one conversation previous to the purchase. At the time of making the purchase I said, ‘ I am going to put the property in your name with the understanding that it Avould revert to me after your death.’ She agreed to that; it was consummated in that way.”</p>
