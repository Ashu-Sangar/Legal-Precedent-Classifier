This is the principal question in the case, and I am not without doubt about it. [It is true, a bond and mortgage are two secu<a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>rities for the same debt, and payment of one is payment of both, but where the bond is void, and the alleged payment is not in money or other valuable tiling, 1 am inclined to hold it is no payment on the mortgage.] It has been determined in the distribution of the $4,000,. that Charles Wells had no interest in, or title to, the land, and hence VanDyke got nothing by his bid, and it seems to me against conscience to compel him to apply his bid on the mortgage.

That fund was awarded and paid to him, on account of the bond and mortgage debt, against the contest of other lien creditors. When plaintiff below afterwards proceeded to enforce his cumulative remedy, by scire facias on the mortgage, he was bound to allow credit for the $4,000 he had already received; in other words, having been paid $4,000 on account of the mortgage debt, he could only enforce his mortgage for the balance due. But the court below held otherwise, upon the ground that because he did not obtain Mrs. Wells’ title by his purchase at the sheriff’s sale under the void judgment against her, he was not bound to account for the purchase money which he paid, and which was afterwards 0awarded to him. We submit that such reasoning is illogical and unsound in law. If a stranger had purchased at that sheriff’s sale and paid the purchase money, and it had been awarded to Van-Dyke on account of his judgment (which was for the same debt secured by the mortgage), he would not claim to recover that sum again, under proceedings on the mortgage. But the fact that VanDyke purchased under his own execution was an accident, and that does not affect the question of his liability to give credit. He exercised his option in selling under his judgment on the bond, and if he made a mistake of law in supposing the sale would pass Mrs. Wells’ title, he alone is responsible for the result. The maxim <em>caveat emptur </em>applied to the sheriff’s sale, and if he made a bad bargain by reason of his mistake his remedy, if any, was to move to set the sale aside. But he cannot hold the sheriff’s title, and the purchase <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>money distributed to him, and again recover the full amount of the debt, without credit for said purchase money, in this proceeding on the mortgage: Clarke <em>v. </em>Stanley, 10 Barr, 478; Ridgway <em>v. </em>Longaher, 6 Harris, 215; Pierce <em>v. </em>Potter, <a href="/watts/7/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 475" data-case-ids="1846874" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0475-01">7 Watts, 475</a>; McGrrew <em>v. </em>McLanahan, 1 Penrose &amp; Watts, 48; Wentz <em>v. </em>Dehaven, 1 Sergeant &amp; Rawle, 317; McCall <em>v. </em>Lenox, 9 Sergeant &amp; Rawle, 312; Commonwealth v.

It only determined that Mason had no interest, and that VanDyke’s claim was valid. The defendants in the execution had no interest whatever in that controversy: Shaw’s Appeal, 10 Wr., 407. But the plaintiffs in error claim that the receipt itself precludes VanDyke from demanding the amount of it. A void bond, a void confession, a void judgment, a void execution, a void sale, a void deed, but nevertheless, it is claimed a valid receipt, based on all these nullities. The defendant in a scire facias sur mortgage is in the position of a plaintiff in equity in a bill to redeem where as in this case the mortgagee is in possession. All his equities can be enforced in the scire facias. The proceeding itself is a substitute for a bill to redeem. The maxim that he who would have equity must do equity is applicable as well in the common law forum as in chancery. But in this case the mortgagor seeks to redeem without payment of the mortgage debt.</p>

The execution issued upon the bond was a valid execution against the husband, and the sale thereunder passed any title there may have been in him. It may be he had no interest in the property; we do not know, and therefore cannot say so. The plaintiff may have supposed lie had an interest, and he had the right to sell it in the way he did. And though the fact be that he had no interest whatever, it does not help the plaintiff in this proceeding. A man who buys a worthless title at a sheriff’s sale, and pays for it, or is allowed a credit on his lien, which is substantially the same thing, has no standing to repudiate the transaction subsequently. The facts now set up by the plaintiff might have afforded a ground of relief had an application been made to the court below at a proper time and in a proper manner.
