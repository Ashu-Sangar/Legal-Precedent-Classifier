He informed the bank of his claim and notified it not to pay out the money, but he subsequently procured the appointment of one Hughes, as administrator of his wife’s estate, to whom the bank paid the fund. Said administrator, however, declined to pay it over to him, whereupon he brought suit against the bank, but failed to recover. See McDermott <em>v. </em>Miners’ Savings Bank, 4 Out., 285. In that case Mr. Justice Paxson, delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ The money was paid to the administrator with the consent of the plaintiff and by his procurement. It is too plain for argument, that after such payment he had no claim against the bank. He was turned round to the position of a creditor of his wife’s estate, and as such creditor he had a right to pursue his claim in the Orphans’ Court.”</p>

It was thought when letters of administration were granted that the ownership of the fund could be most expeditiously and economically determined on the distribution of it in the Orphans’ Court, and so it has been accounted for by the administrator as the wife’s estate. A bill of review by the administrator is now pending for leave to withdraw the fund from his account owing to a mutual error of law. It is a rule founded on elementary principles that no one can claim the fund on distribution of a decedent’s estate, unless he be’a creditor, heir or legatee of the decedent (McBride’s Appeal, 22 Smith, 480; Braman’s Appeal, 8 Norris, 78), but at the request of all the parties interested, we have concluded to follow the suggestion of the Supreme Court in McDermott <em>v. </em>Miners’ Savings Bank, 4 Out.. 285, and dispose of the question of ownership on distribution of the fund rather than on the proceedings for review.</p>

It must be remembered that he had a private bank account of the money which he had at his marriage; that he had another, called a “business account,” on which his wife drew his checks; while a third was the savings bank account in her name with no checks drawn against it.

The merits of the case seem certainly with the presumption of a gift, for it was, as we have said in our report, chiefly through the wife’s skill, experience and labor that the fund was accumulated, and to give him the whole fund would be to enrich him and to deprive her children of a share of the inheritance. Besides, as he had no knowledge of the business, he may have thought it “ hazardous,” and hence proper for him to compensate his wife before any -misfortune might overtake him. These considerations have no weight, of course, in the legal scales, for the fruits of her labor and skill belonged to him, but they show no lack of motive to make the gift. As to the question of the admission of the husband as a witness we refer to McCauley <em>v. </em>Cook, 5 Out., 209, and cases there discussed, showing that the Act of 1865 did not apply to his case, and hence that his testimony is not to be considered further than already allowed.</p>

    <p id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.7",380,[220,1501,1174,336]]]'>The money in controversy was the money of the husband, and the fact that his wife helped him to earn it does not make any difference. It is settled by authority that the earnings of the wife belong to the husband save in certain exceptional eases specified in various Acts of Assembly. Unless, therefore, it can be shown that there was a gift of the money by the appellant to his wife, the decree of the court below cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b380-7" data-blocks='[["BL_380.8",380,[217,1847,1174,292]]]'>In the report of audit the learned Judge came to the conclusion that it was a gift, and in his opinion upon the exception says: “Was it a gift? Why not conclude that it was? What is there unreasonable about it?” We answer that we cannot conclude it was a gift because there was no evidence of it and money which confessedly belongs to a man cannot be taken from him without evidence.</p>
    <p id="b380-8" data-blocks='[["BL_380.9",380,[216,2147,1171,303]],["BL_381.1",381,[207,405,1166,343]]]'>We do not differ from the learned Judge as to any of the facts found, but we cannot concur in his deductions from those facts. The reasons upon which he based his conclusions may be summarized as follows: That the business was carried on at the old place of business of the wife ; that it was chiefly through her skill, industry, and economy, aided by her friends, that the money was acquired; that he had a special deposit <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>of his own, and that she did not conceal from him the fact that she was keeping the particular deposit in question in her own name ; that immediately after her death he inquired for the savings bank book and said to the daughter something about the money of right should belong to him ; and lastty, assuming that he knew the fact of deposit in her own name, he could not have placed the fund more completely under her control and exclusive possession.</p>
    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[204,750,1171,1248]]]'>Upon such weak and inconclusive facts as these, we are asked to hold that the appellant intended that the amount of this deposit, $4,840.73, by far the larger part of his estate, should become the absolute property of his wife, so as to be entirely beyond liis control, and go to her next of kin in case of her death. There is no evidence that he knew of this deposit in his wife’s name until after her death; there is evidence that lie was an ignorant man and could neither read nor write; that his wife was an active business woman; that she attended to the shop, kept the books, and did most of the bank business. Even had the fact been that the proceeds of the business were kept by his wife in lier own name with his knowledge, it would afford no presumption under the circumstances that he intended an irrevocable gift to her of the money. Her possession of it was his possession, as much so as if she had kept the money in a safe or a bureau instead of in the bank. It is a common thing in every-day experience for a woman to have the possession and control of her husband’s money and <em>the </em>husband of the wife’s, and <em>if </em>from such fact we were to draw the conclusion that the custodian was the owner of the money, it would lead to unexpected results. But in this case there is no satisfactory evidence that he even knew the deposit was in his wife’s ñamo; on the contrary, the presumptions are all the other way. And, as before observed, no matter how much the wife’s aid may have contributed to make the money, that circumstance did not change the fact of its ownership, nor does it raise any presumption of a gift, while the claim he made when inquiring for the bank book tends to negative such presumption.</p>
    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[204,1997,1166,433]],["BL_382.1",382,[218,405,1171,88]]]'>That the mere possession of money by the wife is not sufficient evidence of .her ownership was settled by Parvin <em>v. </em>Capewell, 9 Wr., 89, where it was said: “A mere gift of money to a wife is not a settlement of it as her separate estate, for it may be for safe keeping and deposit, without any intention to divest the husband’s title. And her possession of funds ordinarily implies no more than that she is holding them for her husband.” This is settled law, and is peculiarly applicable to this case. There is nob a scintilla of proof of any intention of the appellant to make a gift of this money; nothing can be <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>implied from the facts bejmnd a mere custody thereof on the part of the wife.</p>
    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[209,492,1179,1114]]]'>The cases cited by the learned Judge do not sustain his conclusions. Herr’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 494" data-case-ids="478467" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0494-01">5 W. &amp; S., 494</a>, was a case in which there was strong evidence of a gift and this court said: “But such gift must be established by clear and convincing proof, not only of the act of donation and deliver}r, but of her separate custody of it.” The same doctrine is held in Tripner <em>v. </em>Abrahams, 11 Wr., 220. In Bachman <em>v. </em>Killinger, 5 P. F. S., 414, it was held that the possession by the wife of the husband's moneys, security, and property is very slight evidence of the transfer of the ownership, and his possession of her chattels ought to be considered still less evidence of title in him. In Crawford’s Appeal, 11 P. F. S., 52, the husband informed his wife that he had added $3,000 to her money; he directed his clerk to credit her in his books with the $3,000 as cash received from her, and it was done. He credited her regularly with the interest of that sum in connection with the other sums belonging to her until his death. Held that this was an executed gift followed by an express trust for his wife and payable to her from his estate, but that it could not be supported as a debt. In addition, it appeared that the husband had that amount of his wife’s money in his possession. Here, there was a plain intent to make a gift followed by a positive unequivocal act. But where there is a mere permissive act, such as to allow the wife to be a custodian of his money, I know of no case in which it has been held that a gift can be implied from such act.</p>
    <p id="b382-6" data-blocks='[["BL_382.5",382,[209,1607,1170,128]]]'>We need not pursue the subject further. We can see nothing in the case from which a gift of this money by the husband to the wife can be reasonably implied.</p>
    <p id="b382-7" data-blocks='[["BL_382.6",382,[208,1737,1170,384]]]'>The money appears to have been received by the administrator from the cashier with the understanding that the question of ownership should be settled in the Orphans’ Court upon distribution. There also appears to be a proceeding pending in the Orphans’ Court to strike this item from the administration account. As the money has actually gone into the estate of the wife, we may treat the appellant as her creditor, and to prevent circuity of action we have concluded to dispose of the main question upon this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b382-8" data-blocks='[["BL_382.7",382,[468,2122,909,170]]]'>The decree is reversed at the costs of the appellees, and it is ordered that the deposit less the amount’ due the attaching creditors be paid to appellant.</p>
