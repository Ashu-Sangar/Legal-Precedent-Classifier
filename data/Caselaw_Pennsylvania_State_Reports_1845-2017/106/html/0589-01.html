A bill in equity prayed for an account, and for an injunction to restrain the defendants from manufacturing and selling certain machinery, in alleged violation of an agreement with the plaintiffs, who were owners of letters patent thereon. The bill also contained a prayer for the appointment of a master, to examine the defendants, their officers and agents, and their books a.nd papers ; in order to discover the data for a correct statement of account between the parties. Several years after the bill was filed, a,n injunction having meanwhile been granted, and a master appointed, the defendants moved to dismiss the bill on the ground that plaintiff’s counsel had not certified, as required by the Act of October 13, 1840, that the cause was of such a nature that no adequate remedy could be had at law. The court below held, that the bill presented a case which came under said Act, and dismissed the same, refusing the plaintiff’s request to be allowed to amend by adding the certificate of counsel. Plaintiffs appealed, on the ground, that the case was not within the said Act of 1840, because the bill, was not primarily for an account, but for an injunction and for discovery.</p>

This Act was not intended to include actions of this hind. Its language is : “ Partnership accounts, and such other accounts and claims as by the common law and usages of this Commonwealth have heretofore been settled by the action of account render.” The court had jurisdiction of the bill under the Acts of June 13, 1840 (Purd., 591), and of February 14, 1857 (Purd., 592), granting full chancery powers and jurisdiction to the Courts of Common Pleas and others, on the grounds of fraud, accident, mistake and account. Again, the bill is for discovery based upon an allegation of fraud. It is substantially prayed for in the bill, and the allegation for discovery is sought to be answered by the defendants in their answer filed. The action of account render would hardly answer this feature of the plaintiffs’ bill. For the purposes of discovery and the restraining of the defendant by the writ of injunction, a court of equity could and would take jurisdiction of the cause of action set out in the plaintiffs’ bill, and that, too, independently of the Act of October 13, 1840. For when a court of equity has legitimately assumed jurisdiction for the purposes of discovery, or for the purpose of issuing an injunction, or for any other purpose purely within the chancery jurisdiction of the court, a court of equity will retain the bill and dispose of every connected topic of dispute: Brightly’s Equity, § 124; Gloninger <em>v. </em>Hazard, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20401" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Wright 401">6 Wright, 401</a>; McGowin <em>v. </em>Remington, <a href="/nc/47/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Jones 63" data-case-ids="8681243" data-case-paths="/nc/47/0063-01">2 Jones, 63</a>.</p>

Such fraud as is therein alleged is not that of which equity takes cognizance: Hardwick <em>v. </em>Forbes, 1 Bibb. (Ky.), 212; Story’s Eq., 8th ed., p. 186 n. The case is one upon which either assumpsit or account render should have been brought. The difference between the Act of June 13, 1840, and October 13, 1840, is that the former gave jurisdiction in cases of account where no action at law could be maintained, while the latter gave the plaintiff the option of proceeding “either by bill in chancery or at common law.” But the counsel’s certificate is, under <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>■ the latter Act, a condition precedent to entertaining the bill; and the want of such certificate cannot be supplied by amendment, because without it the court has no jurisdiction: Ever-hart <em>v. </em>Everhart, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Luz.%20L.R.%2059" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Luz.

The Act of June 13,1840, was local when the Act of October 13, 1840, was enacted. The latter applied to particular accounts, and had no relation to others. Its scope was limited to cases suable in account-render, but did not give equity jurisdiction in every case-where that action would lie. Before the court can rightfully entertain the bill, the counsel shall file the prescribed certifi-<a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>cate, but that certificate is not conclusive of his client’s right to avoid a suit at law by proceeding in equity. Should the court be of opinion that the ease is one wherein an adequate remedy can he obtained at law, or that such remedy would not he attended with great additional trouble or delay, the bill would be dismissed notwithstanding the certificate. The court shall not proceed without the certificate being filed ; when filed with the hill the case shall be disposed of upon like principles as other proceedings in equity, and if it appear that there is nothing requiring the peculiar aid of equity, the bill will be dismissed. The Act of 1857, which gives all the Courts of Common Pleas jurisdiction of eases over which Courts of Chancery entertain jurisdiction on the grounds of fraud, accident, mistake or account, though broad enough to include all eases of account, may well be understood as relating to accounts not within the General Act of 3840. It only applies to tiio Courts of Common Pleas, and it could hardly have been the legislative intent to give these courts a larger jurisdiction than was then vested in the Supreme Court by the prior statute. Nor is there such inconsistency or repugnancy as implies a repeal. Both are affirmative statutes; one gives equity jurisdiction of certain accounts, upon conditions, to the Supreme Court, the District Courts and the Courts of Common Pleas, and the other gives jurisdiction to the Common Pleas of several classes of cases, including accounts, and the accounts are such as could not be settled in an action of account render.</p>

If it was their object to make the defendants disclose in their answer matters essential to the plaintiff’s case, it is dimly expressed. There is no prayer for discovery, and none is made in the answer. If no discovery is asked or required by the frame of the bill, the jurisdiction will not be maintainable. The general rule is that where a court of equity has jurisdiction for discovery, and the discovery is effectual, the court may proceed to grant full relief. But it would be no ground for <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>jurisdiction if the discovery failed: Story Eq. Jur.,' §§ 455, 456, 458.

    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[229,642,1175,1505]]]'>The learned Judge of the Common Pleas rightly ruled that the bill set out a case suable in account render, and therefore within the general statute of 1840, Before the bill was dismissed the appellants’ counsel asked leave to amend by filing the certificate, which was denied, and the bill dismissed for the sole reason that the certificate had not been filed, as required by the statute. The motion to amend did not relate to the pleadings or any matter of evidence, but only to the filing of a certificate by counsel. That the court had power to permit the amendment and direct the filing to be as of date of filing the bill, we think is clear. It was so ruled by an able judge in Thomas <em>v. </em>Hall, 2 Pear., 64. The Act of 1864, P. L., 775, authorizes the courts to permit, at their discretion, when in their opinion the same will affect the merits and expedite justice, amendments to the pleadings or other matters in the same manner as now obtains in common law cases and practice. If it be true that the proposed amendment did not affect the merits of the questions in controversy, yet its denial terminated the-proceeding to the delay and costs of the plaintiffs without just advantage to the defendants. Their tardiness in bringing the omission to the notice of the court should be treated as acquiescence by them in the plaintiffs’ default. The discretion vested in the courts to permit amendments is to speed the cause to determination on its merits, and should be liberally exercised where the amendment will do no injustice to the opposite party. The defendants claim that the decision of the court below on a question of amendment is final. We are of opinion that it is the intendment of the statute to secure to parties the same right to make amendments in equity proceedings as in actions at law. In either, generally, the amendment must be made with leave and under the control of the court. It is settled that the decision of a law court upon most questions of amendment is subject to review. The ruling of a court of equity upon a motion to amend will not be reversed save for plain and hurtful error.</p>

The defendants filed their answer on July 6, 1881, and it contains no <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>suggestion that the case presented in the bill does not require the peculiar aid of a court of equity for adequate remedy; nor did the defendants in any way inform the court that the requisite certificate was not filed till August, 1882. The cause was referred to a Master in March, 1882. Though the naked facts show serious default in the plaintiffs’ counsel, the court entertained the bill without scrutiny and acted thereon, as did all parties, as if no requisite had been omitted. There is no pretence that the omission was by design. A plainer case for amendment is not likely to arise in practice, nor one where denial would likely cause greater injury to one party and less to the other.</p>
