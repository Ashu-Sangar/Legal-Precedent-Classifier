After argument these exceptions were dismissed by the court, Futhey, P. J., delivering the opinion which was inter alia as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b446-7" data-blocks='[["BL_446.6",446,[206,1135,1173,1285]],["BL_447.1",447,[192,429,1164,1462]]]'>“ The question arises, whether by virtue of the agreement of 1.875, the defendant has the right to practice generally, without restriction as to place, by having his residence and office, or in other words, his location as a physician within the city and county of Philadelphia, or whether he is restricted so far as the five mile circuit from Jenkintown is concerned, to that portion of it within the said city and county...... What was the agreement of the parties as evidenced by this writing? We are of opinion that the Master has given it the proper construction......By the agreement the defendant was given permission to reside and locate himself anywhere within the limits of Philadelphia, for the purpose of practising medicine without any limitation or restriction whatever, all preceding contracts to the contrary notwithstanding. Thus far the agreement is clear, that the defendant might establish himself at any point in Philadelphia, and practice from that as a centre or location in any direction without regard to the five mile restriction. The agreement proceeds, that if on the first day of April, 1876, the defendant should desire to continue the practice of medicine within five miles of the present residence of the plaintiff, he should pay plaintiff five hundred dollars, and that nothing therein contained should refer to or include any place without the limits of the city and county of Philadelphia. From this language it is obvious that the defendant was in the meantime, between the date of the agreement and the first day of April following, to practice, if he desired, as an experiment, from any residence and location in Philadelphia, and then determine at the latter date whether he desired to continue such practice within the five miles, and if he did, he should pay the sum named for the <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>privilege. The clause, that nothing therein contained should refer or include any place without the limits of the city and county of Philadelphia, obviously refers to the place of residence or location. The defendant was at liberty to reside and locate anywhere in Philadelphia; he might from there practice his profession without regard to the limitation or restriction contained in the previous agreement. The plaintiff was satisfied to allow this for the consideration of five hundred dollars, but the defendant was not to locate at any place without the limits of Philadelphia, and practice within the restricted limits. The word ‘place’ evidently was used in reference to the location or residence from which the defendant was to practise. .....The agreement proceeds that the defendant on his part agrees that if he shall on the first day of April decide to continue and pursue the practise of medicine within the limits above mentioned, he will pay the $500 without delay or further demand. This clause is in a sense a repetition of a preceding one, which says that if the defendant ‘ shall desire to continue the practice of medicine within five miles from the present residence of the plaintiff’ he shall pay the plaintiff five hundred dollars. The defendant then agrees, in the clause we are considering, to pay the five hundred dollars, if he decides ‘ to continue and pursue such practice within the limits above mentioned,’ that is, within the five miles referred to in the preceding clause, but such practice to be from a location within the limits of the city and county of Philadelphia. The one part of the agreement provides that if he desires thus to practice within the five miles he shall pay five hundred dollars, and the other, that if he decides thus to practice, he will pay that sum. By the construction we have thus given the agreement, all parts of it are harmonized, while any other construction would render the clause ‘without any limitation or restriction whatever, all or any preceding contracts to the contrary notwithstanding,’ a meaningless one.</p>

The court below ruled against the appellant wholly upon its construction of the agreement of 1875. All the agreements and full affidavits were before the supreme court; and the agreement of 1875 must have been construed by them, because upon that alone the appellee claimed his right. This agreement can bear no other interpretation than that then placed upon it. The appellee wrote it himself and is estopped by it: under it he was allowed to “reside and locate himself within the limits of Philadelphia” “for the purpose of practising the profession of medicine,” etc., that “ not to include any place without the limits of Philadelphia ” — for what ? Plainly for the -purpose of practising within those limits, and this is conclusively settled by the last clause of the agreement. “If he shall,” etc., “decide to continue and pursue the practice of medicine within the limits above mentioned he shall pay ” $500. The limits above mentioned are “ within the limits of Philadelphia.” He was allowed to try to get the practice within those limits before he paid his money. The agreements of 1877 (afterwards cancelled) entered into for the purpose of restoring the appellee to his right of practising — are evidence that until that time he possessed no such right.

In this court the validity of the contracts dated respectively February 2, 1871, and May 22, 1875, has not been questioned, and the construction of the latter by the learned judge of the common pleas, harmonizes with the understanding thereof by the parties at the time of its execution as shown by their acts immediately following. No difference has arisen respecting the meaning of the first. Dr. Betts agreed never to locate again in Jenkintown for the purpose of resuming the practice of medicine, and that he would never in any way practise medicine within a radius of five miles of Jenkintown.</p>
    <p id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.8",449,[214,1473,1166,989]],["BL_450.1",450,[237,433,1189,813]]]'>By the second contract Dr. Paxson agreed that Dr. Betts might locate anywhere within the limits of the city and county of Philadelphia for the purpose of practising medicine, without limitation or restriction, on condition that if on April 1, 1876, said Betts should desire and decide to continue the practice of medicine within five miles of Jenkintown, he should pay to said Paxson five hundred dollars without delay or further demand. After said date Betts paid and Paxson received the money. The contract contains the following clause: “Nothing herein contained shall refer or include any place without the limits of the city and county of Philadelphia.'’ From the ability of the parties to express their meaning, as shown in all other parts of their contracts, it might be inferred that they purposely inserted this clause to create future contention. Now, one claims that it left the first contract in force as to the circuit around Jenkintown, except the part in Philadelphia; the other, that it only applies to the residence and location of Betts. Upon the face of the agreement, the point is not easily determined. Betts was granted the right to practise medicine without any limitation or restriction whatever, and after exercising that right until April 1, 1876, if he desired to continue said practice within five miles of Paxson’s residence, Jenkintown, he should pay a stipulated <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>sum : but he could, not locate within five miles of Jenkintown,, without the limits of Philadelphia. The unrestricted right to practise was granted upon payment of the price agreed upon —the right to reside or locate was restricted. Obviously the right to practise in Jenkintown and vicinity would have been' of greater value accompanied with an unrestricted right of location and residence. For this reason the clause may have,: been inserted for greater certainty of preventing Betts locating in Jenkintown. Had the parties intended to limit the. practice to that part of the circuit where Betts was permitted to locate, nothing could have been easier than to have said so. ‘ Having so clearly-granted the right to practise within the entire circuit and limited location as to part, it would seem that the clause of doubtful meaning referred to location as that is more advantageous to the purchaser. The contemporaneous acts of the parties may well be invoked as indicating' their intention, where the meaning of a clause is doubtful. Ambiguities in a written instrument may be explained by parol evidence: Caley <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/80/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="80 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1042388" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0363-01">80 Pa.

They met in attendance — in consultation and on the road, and yet we have no word of remonstrance or objection. On the contrary, when negotiations were attempted to be opened for purchase by defendant of'further privileges, Dr. Paxson inva-" riably replied that Dr. Betts already had an unrestricted right' to practise, but would not grant him the right to. locate.” This finding was warranted by the testimony.</p>
