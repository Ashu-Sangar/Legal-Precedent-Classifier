Hancock was the owner of premises No. 1728 Girard Avenue, in the city of Philadelphia, subject to a mortgage thereon, held by <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>the Mount Vernon Building Association. On June 14. 1879, said. Joseph B. Hancock by deed of that date, recorded two days later, conveyed said premises, inter alia, to Miles King, for the nominal consideration of $1,000. The real consideration was stated by Hancock to be indebtedness due by him to King. Shortly prior to said conveyance, the said mortgagee entered judgment against Hancock on the bond accompanying said mortgage. King testified that he knew nothing of the conveyance to him until after it was made, and finding the property was encumbered to an amount exceeding its value, he told Hancock he did not want it, whéreupon Hancock caused a deed of re-conveyance to be prepared, from King to Joel C. Hancock, a son of Joseph B. Hancock, which King executed on June 17, 1879, three days after the conveyance to him. This deed was not recorded, and did not pass out of the possession of the conveyancer, by whom it was produced on the- trial. There was no evidence of its delivery to the grantee.</p>

At that time the taxes on said property for the years 1879, 1881, and 1882, were due and unpaid, amounting to $482.93, which taxes said association paid July 11, 1882, to recover which this suit was brought. The taxes for 1879 were assessed in 1878, in the name of Joseph B. Hancock, and the taxes for 1881 and 1882 were also assessed in the same name.</p>

If, at the time the defendant <em>owned </em>this property, there were taxes due and unpaid, which were liens, though assessed the year before, in my judgment, he is responsible for the taxes. I think that in any event he would be responsible for taxes due in June, 1879, for he held the property undoubtedly for three days, from the 14th of June, 1879, to the 17th of June, 1879.” (First assignment of error).</p>

That depends on who was the real owner after June, 1879. There is some evidence that a deed was executed to Joel C. Hancock three days after the deed to him of 14th June, 1879. In other words, after June 17, 1879, a deed was executed, and never recorded, which remained with Haines till this morning. In determining the question of <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>ownership, I say to you that if that deed was executed with an intent to cover up this property so that the creditors of Joseph B. Hancock could not reach it, and that the deed so executed was left unrecorded in possession of Haines, the title never changed. The jury in finding such a state of facts as that would have a right to find the whole object of that conveyance was in point of fact, fraudulent, and, if so, the <em>title </em>was never divested and remained in King. If so, he becomes responsible for the tax liens existing at the time of the sale by the sheriff, which were paid by the plaintiff.” (Second assignment of error).</p>

One who purchases the land subsequently, whether during the year for which the taxes were duo or not, and is compelled to pay the taxes, may recover them back in a personal action against his grantor. The mere purchase of lands on which taxes have previously been assessed, and which remain unpaid, imposes no personal liability on the purchaser, <em>to </em>reimburse a subsequent jnirchaser from him who afterwards is obliged to pay such taxes in relief of the land. This doctrine is consistent with the decision in Hogg <em>v. </em>Longstreth, 1 Out., 255. Here the taxes for 1879 were assessed during Hancock’s admitted ownership, and he therefore became personally liable <em>to </em>pay them. There are not several personal liabilities, one incident to the ownership at the time of the assessment, and others, indefinite in number, incident to any subsequent ownership while the taxes remain due and unpaid. Nor is there any apportionment of such liability: Shaw <em>v. </em>Quinn, 12 S. &amp; R., 299. Upon what principle then does the plaintiff seek to hold King personally liable for the taxes of 1879, which were assessed and became due prior to his ownership ? As to the taxes for subsequent years, he cannot be personally' liable, as he re-conveyed the property in June 1879, three dayus after he took title. It is said the conveyance <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>and re-conveyance were made with intent to defraud Hancock’s creditors. There is no evidence of that, or of King’s knowledge of a participation in such alleged fraud, but, if that were otherwise, it would be wholly irrelevant to the question in this case. Equally irrelevant was the question as to the actual delivery of the deed from King to Joel C. Hancock; delivery is presumed and there was no evidence sufficient to rebut that presumption.</p>

In that case there was a recovery, inter alia, for the taxes of 1874 which were assessed in 187S against the previous owner, and Trunkey, J., said: “ By force of law the taxes were a <em>personal </em>charge against the defendant, as well as a lien on the real estate.” So also in Caldwell <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%2058" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Jones 58">1 Jones, 58</a>.</p>

Hancock, who was at that time the owner of the premises No. 1728 Girard Avenue. Planeock conveyed to Miles King on the fourteenth of June 1879, and on the seventeenth of the same month King executed a deed for the same premises in favor of Joel C. Hancock. The latter deed was not recorded and does not appear to have been delivered. It remained in the hands of Henry Haines the conveyancer, and was by him produced upon the trial below.</p>
    <p id="b182-8" data-blocks='[["BL_182.11",182,[201,1875,1168,426]]]'>The court below held that King was personally responsible for the taxes of 1879, though he held the title but for three da]rs. This we think was error. It is undoubtedly true that an owner of real estate against whom taxes have been assessed is personally responsible for such taxes. But it was held in Shaw <em>v. </em>Quinn, 12 S. &amp; R., 299, that “ Taxes on real estate cannot be apportioned among the different persons who may become owners of it during the year; the person charged at the beginning of the year, is liable for the taxes of the whole year, though he alien before the day of appeal.”</p>

We do not so dnderstand that case. No question was there raised that Longstreth was not <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>•personally liable for a portion of the taxes because the same was assessed against a previous owner. On the contrary it distinctly appeared, as wo learn from the report of the case that taxes had been assessed against the property in the name of John Longstreth, registered owner, for the years 1874 to 1878 inclusive. Not only so but claims had been filed by the city and judgments recovered against Longstreth for the taxes ,of 1874, 1875, and 1876; writs of alias levari facias were issued upon their judgments and were in the hands of the sheriff when Hogg paid the amount thereof in order to prevent a sale of the properties. Such were the facts upon which the opinion in Hogg <em>v. </em>Longstreth was predicated and it is needless to say that the question of Longstreth’s personal liability was not an open question. Hence it must be understood that when our brother Tbotkey says in his opinion that “ By force of law the taxes were a personal charge against the defendant, as well as a lien on the real estate,” he was speaking of taxes which had been assessed against Longstreth, who was at the time the owner of the property. Neither his opinion nor the judgment rendered in that case conflicts in any degree with Shaw <em>v. </em>Quinn.</p>
    <p id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[196,1323,1161,727]]]'>This view sustains the first assignment of error. The second and third assignments relate to the taxes for the years 1881 and 1882. These taxes were likewise assessed against Hancock. If however King was the owner during those years he would be personally liable for the taxes, by virtue of such ownership. We do not think a mistake of the assessor would relieve him of such liability. The whole policy of our tax laws is to make the owner of land at the time taxes are assessed, liable for the payment thereof. No better illustration of this could be given than the Act of 1804 which made the tenant liable, with the right to defalk the taxes paid by him against the landlord’s claim for rent. And Caldwell <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%2058" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Jones 58">1 Jones, 58</a>, is authority for the principle that where taxes are assessed against the lessee of land, the lessor who is the owner is liable to his vendee for such taxes, in the absence of any contract between the lessor and lessee, by which the latter was bound to pay them.</p>
