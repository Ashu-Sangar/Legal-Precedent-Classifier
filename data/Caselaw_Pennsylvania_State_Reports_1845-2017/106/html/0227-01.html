That while the parties might, if they chosej make a perpetual rent by so expressing it in unmistakable words, they would not permit the court to do so by the construction of any condition which would produce that result. This rent at its creation was clearly not marketable as an irredeemable ground-rent.

This purpose, as to extinguishment of ground-rents, was defeated by the decision of Palairet’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20Pa.%20488" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="67 Pa. 488">67 Pa.

It was so considered by some at that time, and attention was at once called to it in an able article in 2 American Law Register, 589. But whether it <em>has </em>done so, is another question. The rules of construction of statutes which merely give or increase a remedy, are different from the rules applicable to those which affect a right, or, still more, an estate; ‘ an estate whose market value is taken from one to be given to another.

The option was not obligatory upon him. He did not covenant to pay the lump sum. On the contrary, lie declined to exercise this option, and it expired over twenty-two years ago. The plaintiffs below who were not the original vendees, now demand that this unilateral option shall bo indefinitely extended for their benefit, and that the defendants shall be deprived of their estate in the rent against their consent, and that they shall convey such estate to the said plaintiffs. The vendor and his assigns have an estate in the rent, and the vendee and his assigns have an estate in the land subject to the rent. Each estate is of the same dignify iu the law as the other, and of neither can the <em>owner </em>be deprived against his assent, and each estate is, as was said in Palairet’s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith, 487, “ an estate in fee simple, descendible, devisable, alienable.” Apart from certain rules of law which have no application to this case, there is none which dictates or prescribes the duration or quantify of estate which one man may sell to another. No rule of law exists which prohibits a vendor from parting with his property in consideration of an annual rent. Thus, leasehold estates for long term of years are very common in England, in New York, and are not unknown here. Cadwalader <em>v. </em>App, 31 P. F. Smith, 194, was a case of a lease for ten thousand years at an annual rent of thirteen dollars and thirty-three cents. And no legal distinction can be suggested between a lease for one or ten thousand years with a <em>reddendum, </em>and the grant of an estate in fee with a <em>reddendum. </em>And the insertion of a provision whereby the <em>reddendum </em>can be capitalized and paid off is, like a clause of re-entry or the like, merely one of the incidents of the contract. It may bo <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>altogether omitted, and if so the duration of the estate granted and the duration of the <em>reddendum </em>will be co-existent. They will begin and end at the same time. Hence, where the vendor has given the vendee a mere option to extinguish the rent within a given time by the payment of a lump sum, there is no rule which compels him to indefinite!]’ extend that option to the assigns of the vendee, against the vendor’s will. An owner may impose any lawful condition as the consideration of parting with his property.</p>

The market value of a <em>reddendum </em>which cannot be compulsorily paid off at all is, equally, enormously greater than one which can. Hence the effect contended to be given to the statute is to take the market value of the rent away from its owner and give it to the owner of the land. No plea of convenience or even of public policy can justify this, as was decided by this court in Palairet’s Appeal, 17 P. F. Smith, 479, where an Act of the legislature having declared that it was “ necessary for the public use to provide a method of extinguishing irredeemable ground-rents, having a due regard for private rights,” it was held that this could not be done — that it was a taking of private property for private use, and that no legislative declaration could make that public <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>which was simply private, irrespective of general public convenience.</p>

The plaintiffs in error admit that the legislature intended to effect the result we contend for, but found, technical arguments upon the literal term “ fallen due,” “ incumbrance,” etc., as applicable to a lien merely, whereas they are equally applicable to a rent reserved, subject to extinguish1 ment by payment of the redemption money. There are, practically no ground-rents in existence such as plaintiffs in error describe in their third classification, and to confine the Act to such theoretical rents will render it wholly illusory.

    <p id="b249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_249.7",249,[238,697,1164,642]]]'>It may Ido that the twenty-first section of the Act of April 22, 1850, was intended to apply to ground-rent deeds such as that under consideration; but, in our opinion, the language employed will not admit of that construction. The Act declares, “Whenever a deed or other instrument of writing conveying real estate shall be made, wherein shall be contained a reservation of ground-rent to become perpetual, upon the failure of the purchaser to comply with the conditions therein contained, no such covenant or condition shall be so construed as to make the said ground-rent a perpetual incumbrance upon the said real estate; but it shall and may be lawful for the purchaser thereof, at any time after said ground-rent shall have fallen due, to pay the full amount of the same, and such payment shall be a complete discharge of such real estate from the incumbrance aforesaid: ” Purd., 748, pl. 2.</p>
    <p id="b249-6" data-blocks='[["BL_249.8",249,[238,1341,1165,1118]],["BL_250.1",250,[202,431,1184,1673]]]'>The deed, recited in the ease stated, after reserving a yearly ground-rent of forty-five dollars, payable in half yearly instalments of twenty-seven dollars each “ in every year hereafter forever,” contains a provision that if the grantee “his heirs or assigns shall and do at any time, within, ten years from the date hereof, pay or cause to be paid to the grantors, or survivors or survivor of them, their or his heirs or assigns the sum of seven hundred and fifty dollars and the arrearages of such yearly rent to the time of such payment, then the same shall forever thereafter cease and be extinguished, and the covenant for payment thereof shall become void; ” and the grantors shall then execute and deliver to the grantee, his heirs and assigns, a sufficient release and discharge of the said 3'early rent. It will be observed that this instrument differs from an ordinary irredeemable ground-rent deed only in this, that it secures to the grantee an option which he may or may not, according to his own pleasure, exercise within the time specified in the deed. It contains no covenant on his part to pay the capitalized sum, within the time named, or at any time. In this respect it differs widely from the deed under consideration in Springer <em>v. </em>Phillips, 21 P. E. Smith, 60. The ground rent reserved is in terms perpetual, subject only to the unilateral privilege given to the grantee which must be exercised by him, if at all, during the ten years and not thereafter. It contains no condition, upon the failure to comply with which by the grantee, the ground-rent becomes perpetual, and hence <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>it does not possess tlie distinguishing feature that appears to have been contemplated by the framers of the statute. If the language they employed means anything, they must have had in view an instrument containing, as the Act itself expresses it, a reservation of ground-rent, not perpetual in its inception, but to become perpetual upon the failure' of the vendee to comply with a covenant or condition, to that effect, contained in the instrument; and, hence it is provided that no such covenant or condition shall be so construed as to make such ground-rent a perpetual incumbrance, and it shall be lawful for the purchaser, at any time after the ground-rent shall have fallen due, to pay the full amount thereof, etc. In the deed before us there is no provision, express or implied, that the ground-rent therein reserved shall become perpetual upon the failure of the vendee to comply with any covenant or condition therein contained. On the contrary, it contains an express covenant for the payment, perpetually, of the rent reserved. It is to be paid semi-annually, “in every year hereafter forever; ” and this is the very essence of the contract. To this is superadded a naked, unilateral option, limited as to time long since expired, wholly permissive, and in no sense whatever obligatory on the grantee, his heirs or assigns ; and ■hence there is no covenant or condition to be broken, or so construed as to make the rent a perpetual incumbrance. In its very inception the rent reserved was perpetual and continued to be so. We are therefore of opinion that the Act does not apply to ground-rent deeds of the class to which the one before us belongs. But there is a class of ground-rents to which it is perhaps applicable, viz: those in which the annual rent is not perpetual, but the capitalized rent, like the principal of a mortgage debt, falls due and is demandable by the grantor, at or within a certain time, and in default of payment, the rent thereafter becomes perpetual. The only question with which we are now concerned, howevei’, is whether upon a fair and reasonable construction of the Act, the deed before us is within its provisions. For reasons that have been briefly suggested and others that might be added, we think it •is not; and hence the defendants in the case stated were entitled to judgment for costs.</p>
