Tlie regular Spring Term of the Courts of Quarter Sessions, Oyer anil^ Terminer and General Jail Delivery in Tioga county begins on the first Monday of May and continues for two weeks. The first week is usually devoted to criminal business, and the second to civil causes. For May Term, 1883, writs of venire were duly issued, and the jurors, grand and petit, drawn and summoned. For accommodation of counsel engaged in the Supremo Court, the court made an order on the first day of the term detaining tlie grand and petit jurors for service during the following week, to which the trial of causes was postponed. In obedience to this order, the jurors appeared on the second Monday of May, to which time the said several courts had been regularly adjourned. During- this sifting of the grand jury an indictment for murder was found against A. At the trial his counsel moved to quash the indictment on the ground that the court had no power to detain the grand jury under the circumstances stated.</p>

She lived about three miles and a half from the village, and alone. She was seen going home, after having entered upon the road which led directly toward her house. The next morning her house was found locked, and she was not there. The clock was running, but the bed appeared not to have been used during the night, and there was no fire in the stove. She was never seen or heard of afterwards alive. Upon the road along which she had to pass stood a barn, which was found to be on fire about the time she would naturally have passed it, and was wholly consumed. After the fire had somewhat abated there was discovered in the ashes an object which was supposed at the time to be the remains of. some animal; but on the following morning a physician pronounced it to be the trunk of an adult woman. Upon further search in the ashes a door key was found, also a bunch of keys, a little locket, a few hairpins and buttons, and the remains of an ear-ring. It was afterwards discovered that the door key would fit the door of Martha Sylvia’s house, that one of the keys on the bunch would fit her satchel and another her trunk. A small picture was also found in the house which apparently belonged in the locket.</p>

He walked along the road with her part way from her house to Wellsboro, when some one took her the rest of the way in his wagon. They were seen together in Wellsboro by several persons. Traviss called for her at a store about six o’clock in the evening. There was evidence that they were afterwards seen together in various streets and finally on the road leading toward the barn. One witness, who lived well up the road toward the barn,, testified that some time after dark a man came and rapped at his door; that on opening the door he was attracted by the strange appearance and manner of the man standing there. One of them said “ good evening,” to which the other replied, and then the <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>stranger asked for some matches, which the witness gave him, whereupon he went away in the darkness. The witness identified Traviss as the man. Nothing was afterwards seen of Traviss until he arrived at the house of his brother-in-law, Mr. Reese — with whom he lived — a mile or more beyond the barn, some time between eight and ten o’clock in the evening. It further appeared that Traviss had agreed to buy some cattle from Martha Sylvia for $58, and when he left home in the morning he said he was going to Stokesdale to get some money which was due him from one Constant Bailey, to pay Martha for the cattle. Young Freddie Reese testified that after Traviss reached home, in the evening at supper, he said he had been to Stokesdale, and obtained the money from Bailey and paid it toMartlnv Sylvia. Other witnesses testified that he afterwards told them different stories about the money, and that he did not see Bailey, but had part of the money in his pocket and got the rest out of a field where ho had buried it. Theré was evidence, however, as above set out, that he did not go to Stokesdale, but went with Martha Sylvia from her house to Wellsboro. When called upon to explain when he last saw Martha, he said he last saw her on her way to the depot; that lie had paid her the money and she was going to Indiana to see her husband, from whom she had separated. The evidence, however, showed that she did not go to the train, but, on the contrary, she told certain witnesses that she was going to marry Traviss and go west with him. Although on his way home from W'ellsboro he had to pass Martha’s farm, where the cattle were, he did not drive them with him, but, upon a suggestion from Reese that Martha, having sold the cattle, would probably not feed them that night, Traviss, Reese and a boy went back after them.' They went to Martha’s house, and Traviss rapped on the door, but receiving no answer, turned to Reese and said he thought Martha had not come home.

On behalf of the Commonwealth, competent evidence tending to prove each of these essential facts was adduced and with proper instructions submitted to the jury. Upon them rested the responsibility of carefully considering all the testimony and ascertaining therefrom what the facts were.

Tlie indictment was found and returned into the Quarter Sessions on the eighth day of the term, and was duly certified by that court into tlie Oyer and Terminer for trial. The grand jury was regularly drawn and summoned for the May sessions of said courts, and ordinarily they would have transacted their business during the first week of the term, but the court, for the reason stated in its special order, determined that the business of the grand jury should be transacted during the last instead of the first week of the term, and accordingly, in the exercise of its discretion, postponed the attendance of the jury until Monday of the second week, at which time they were duly organized and proceeded with the business. Being regularly drawn and summoned for the term, the grand jury were thus properly in attendance during the second week thereof, and the indictment acted on and returned during that time is neither irregular nor illegal. For the summarized reasons given by the learned president of the court in the conclusion of his opinion refusing the motion to quash, we think there was no error committed by tlie court in that regard, and hence the first to fourth assignments, inclusive, are not sustained.</p>

As was said in Allison <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 3 Out., 17, it is only when it appears the juror has formed a fixed opinion of the prisoner’s guilt that he is disqualified. Mere impressions do not disqualify. The object of an examination on <em>voire dire </em>is to test the qualification of the juror by ascertaining from his own lips whether he has formed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, and if so, whether the opinion he has formed is of such a character as to disqualify him as a juror in the case. The question that was propounded to the juror and excluded by the court was clearly <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>improper in this,, that it was not calculated to elicit such information as would be a proper test of his qualification. The question suggested by the court was the usual and proper one. In answer to the question whether he had formed any opinion of the prisoner’s guilt or innocence, the reply of the' juror was,' “No, sir; I have probably expressed myself, as probably most every man has, as saying that the circumstances were strong; but I have formed no opinion that it was so.” This fairly expresses the substance of what was elicited by examination of the juror on his <em>voire dire; </em>and, tested by the principles recognized in Staup <em>v. </em>Com., <em>24 </em>P. F. S., 458; O’Mara et al. <em>v. </em>Com., 25 Id. 424; Ortwein <em>v. </em>Com., 26 Id., 415; Curley v. Com., 3 Norris, 151, and Allison <em>v. </em>Com., supra, the examination failed to disclose any legal disqualification.</p>

They do not affect the merits of the case; and it is a sufficient answer to say, the 11th Section of the Act of 1860 requires that objections to an indictment for formal defects, apparent on the face thereof, shall be taken by demurrer or on motion to quash, before the jury is sworn, and not afterwards: Phillips <em>v. </em>Com., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20197" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Wright 197">8 Wright, 197</a>; Com. <em>v. </em>Frey, 14 <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20197" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Wright 197">Id., 245</a>.</p>
    <p id="b620-8" data-blocks='[["BL_620.7",620,[211,1573,1171,299]]]'>The subject of complaint in the thirteenth specification is substantially the same as that involved in the first four spech fications which have been already noticed. The record shows that the indictment was duly found and returned by the grand jury, and that thejr were duly sworn as such in the county of Tioga at May sessions, 1883. Moreover, it is too late to take advantage' of a merely formal defect.</p>

It appears one of the jurors by whom the verdict was rendered was related to the person who is alleged in the indictment to have been murdered, and the fact of such relationship was not known to the prisoner or his counsel until after rendition of the verdict. While it was shown to the satisfaction of the "court below that the juror’s mother and the.mother of the murdered woman were cousins, and the fact was unknown to the prisoner or his counsel at the time of trial, it was shown with equal clearness that the juror had never seen the murdered woman or heard of her except in connection with the alleged murder,, and was absolutely ignorant of any relation<a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>ship until several days after the verdict was rendered. If the fact of relationship had been known and brought to the attention of the court before the juror was sworn, he doubtless would have been excused or successfully challenged for cause; but it was unknown to the court as well as the counsel on both sides, and the juror, after being examined in the usual manner, was accepted and sworn. The time to challenge is before the juror is sworn; if not exercised then, the right is waived. That waiver may be relieved against when the party affected has been intentionally misled or deceived by the juror or the opposite party; but it is not even pretended there was anything of the kind in this case. Neither the fairness nor the impartiality of the verdict is assailed on any ground connected with the relationship of the juror to the murdered woman. It is not and cannot be pretended that he or any of his fellows were in any manner influenced thereby. As the learned president of the court below well remarked, “His judgment could not have been affected, even insensibly, by a circumstance of which he had not the slightest knowledge.” The newly-discovered relationship was, therefore, no reason for setting aside the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b621-6" data-blocks='[["BL_621.4",621,[223,1330,1166,850]]]'>The remaining specifications — -fifteenth to twenty-second, inclusive — relate to the charge of the court. There is nothing in either of them that requires special notice. Viewed as a whole, the charge was a full, clear and adequate presentation of the case to the jury. The case was properly submitted on all the testimony before them, without binding instructions as to the facts, and the prisoner has no just reason to complain that he has not had a fair and impartial trial. It is true the evidence relied on by the Commonwealth was mainly circumstantial, but it was nevertheless competent and proper for <em>the </em>consideration of the jury. If they believed, as they doubtless did, that the facts and circumstances of the case, as they found them from the evidence, pointed clearly and satisfactorily to his guilt, and were, at the same time, irreconcilable with any other reasonable hypothesis, they were warranted in finding as they did. With them was the responsibility. The court below, being satisfied with the verdict, refused to disturb it; and there appears to be nothing on the face of the record before us that would justify us in reversing the judgment pronounced thereon.</p>
