The petition purported to be signed by an uncle, and, if the child had been legitimate, he would have borne this relation; it negatived the existence of a father by stating that the child ‘has no guardian to take care of her person and estate,’ and is the child, not of Dr. S. S. Brumbaugh, but of Harriet L. Pote, deceased. The counsel of Dr. S. S. Brumbaugh, themselves, show that he is the putative father and does not live within the jurisdiction of the court.

Brumbaugh was intended for Mary Margaret Irene Pote, and that the name was inadvertently used by the putative father, and that, in point of fact, D. S. Brumbaugh had been appointed her guardian on the petition of her putative father; but the petition on which the court acted indicated no such thing. The court might, even if it had knowledge of the appointment of a guardian for Harriet L. Pote’s daughter, Mary Margaret Irene Pote, have readily supposed that M. Brumbaugh was another daughter of Harriet L. Pote. Possibly close scrutiny might have led the court, in the one case, tp, have inferred illegitimacy ; but, surely, counsel did not even hint so much, at the time the appointments were made.</p>

The commission of one must be revoked. It is not simply a contest between two guardians, but the mother’s father and the putative father of the child become the real actors. Andrew C. Pote, on whose petition John B. Pote was appointed guardian, was not legally related to the child, although he was her mother’s brother; nor is the guardian, John B. Pote, though her mother’s father, legally related to the child. Yet we should hold as a rule, when no good reason appeared for holding the contrary, that the putative father, as against the near relations of the mother, had no standing in court to urge the revocation of the appointment of a guardian made on their petition. As the case now stands, as to the question of allowing the amendment as prayed for by D. S. Brumbaugh, who was appointed guardian for the person and estate of this same child on the petition of the putative father, and was duly commissioned before the petition of Andrew C. Pote was presented, and if nothing else appeared, we should not hold that the mere fact of a first appointment would make Brumbaugh’s commission irrevocable. But the question is fairly raised as to which of the two guardians’ commissions should stand, in the light of the highest and best interests of the child. Both appointees are honest, worthy and responsible persons; and either would, doubtless, safely hold and manage the estate but the one appointed on petition of the putative father, by writings presented to the court which he prays leave to file and which leave is now <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>granted, offers, apparently in good faith, that he will become responsible in a sufficient bond conditioned that the child shall be, in all respects, well cared for during its minority, sliall bo clothed, boarded, lodged and maintained comfortably, and well educated until it arrives at full age, free of all expense to its own estate, so that its own entire estate may be safely invested to the best advantage for its benefit.</p>

The putative father claims the custody in order that he may train it morally and intellectually, and represents that his circumstances in life and his location and surroundings arc of such a character as, when taken in connection with his professed honest and sincere purpose to do well for his child, should warrant the court in confirming the appointment of the guardian made on his petition, as against the mother’s relatives, who cannot be supposed to have the same affection for the child that he has. They are farmers, residing in the country, where the same liberal school facilities do not exist as are in reach and command of the putative father; and their habits of life and religious convictions lead them to undervalue that higher education which he is so desirous it should have. The guardian appointed on his petition is favorable to the claim of the putative father.</p>

S. Brumbaugh a Lutheran, all protestants. If the religious faith of parents be considered, this child having in law a mother and only a putative father, and that mother having been a Baptist, would literally fulfill the statute; but, after an appointment has been made, and fitly made, a commission will not be revoked because the guardian is of a different religious faith, unless he would unduly influence the child, or other good cause be shown.</p>

To the same effect, are the English cases of Richards <em>v. </em>Hodges, 2 Saunders, 83; Burwell’s case, Ventris, 48; Sherman’s case, Ventris, 210, and Newland <em>v. </em>Osmer referred to in Burn’s Justice, 234. In Moritz <em>v. </em>Garnhart, <a href="/watts/7/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 Watts 302" data-case-ids="1846826" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0302-01">7 Watts, 302</a>, it was said, that although a bastard may not be looked upon as a child for any civil purpose, the ties of nature are respected in regard to its maintenance; the putative father, though not legally related to it, is so far considered its natural guardian, as to be entitled to the custody of it. The learned Chief Justice Lewis delivering the opinion of the court, after a full discussion of all the cases, concludes as follows: “It majr be safely said, then, that the law recognizes the rights of putative paternity, for purposes of nurture and education.” We may allow large abatements, perhaps, from the estimate which the law makes in respect of the natural tenderness of parents for their own offspring, in cases like this, but it is certain that the rule referred to is grounded in that consideration. If, then, Dr. Brumbaugh, at the death of Harriet L. Pote, was legally entitled to the custody of this child, he was <em>41 </em>proper person to petition the court for the appointment of a guardian, and no other person held such a legal relation to the child, as under our practice, entitled him to notice of the application. The petition contained a misnomer of the minor, but she was otherwise accurately described, as the minor daughter of Harriet L. Pote, deceased, of whom S. S. Brumbaugh was the father, and it is not alleged that such language could apply to any other. A petition was subsequently presented to the court, stating that the misnomer was the result of mistake or inadvertence, and praying for leave to amend; the power of the court to permit the amendment was undoubted, the misnomer was corrected, and the record amended.</p>

It would certainly not be pretended that Brumbaugh was not the guardian, merely because of the misnomer; if the estate of the minor had come into his hands, not only would he have been held for it, but his responsibility could have been <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>visited, upon his sureties. The identity of the person of the minor was fixed by the terms of the petition, and the subsequent amendment was an adjudication that the misnomer was a blunder. If it had appeared on the hearing of the application to amend, that the name, “ M. Brumbaugh,” had been intentionally and fraudulently used, the amendment would have been refused; and as there is a power vested in every court to protect and vindicate itself against, and to correct, its own mistakes,-occasioned by the artifice and fraud of suitors practiced upon it, the appointment might have been revoked. But the court found no facts to justify such a conclusion, and we are not prepared to say the court was <em>wrong; </em>the amendment was allowed, and upon a re-argument, in which the whole ease was considered, and the claims and qualifications of the several applicants for the guardianship were canvassed, the court confirmed the appointment of Brumbaugh. The discretion of the court was exercised, when the record was right, and when the several persons suggested for guardian were in court.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[222,1193,1182,172]]]'>No rule of law has been violated in this proceeding, the record is formal and <em>regular; </em>we cannot review the discretion of the court in the selection made, and we must allow the appointment to stand.</p>
    <p id="b596-6" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[221,1366,1182,171]]]'>It follows, of course, that the appointment of John B. Pote is null and void, and must be revoked. The petitions were several and adverse, not joint, and the two appointments cannot stand together: Estler <em>v. </em>Estler, 1 Browne, 322.</p>
