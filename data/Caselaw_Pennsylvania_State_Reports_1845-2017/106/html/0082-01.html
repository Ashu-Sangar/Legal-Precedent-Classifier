L., 532. It was not so indexed, and hence the burden was on the plaintiffs in the executions to show actual notice. This they failed to do. The most the evidence shows is that Job Morley was apprehensive of an execution lien. He knew the executions were out — knew the return day had passed. But these facts might exist and he have no knowledge that a levy had been made......It was in the absence of notice, therefore, that he took the mortgage. It was taken to better secure the payment of a judgment that had been revived four days previous, and for no other consideration. From the evidence and finding of the Auditor it had no other effect than if taken in the name of A. &amp; J. Morley. The debt was <em>Iona fide </em>and actual. The mortgage was a higher and better security. It gave to the creditors additional rights. The consideration was sufficient, and the parties were bound. The object, no doubt, was to obtain a lien prior to any lien that might be obtained on the executions. This they had the same right to do as to take a judgment in advance of another, or place an execution in the hands of the sheriff in advance of one previously issued. It was a statutory right, and I see no legal objection to such vigilance where the transaction is honest. But it is claimed the mortgage was defectively acknowledged, and the record gave no lien. There is no county mentioned either in the caption or body of the acknowledgment. It was taken, however, before a justice of the peace. The land is in this county. The certificate is — “the above-named Reuben Morley appeared before me, a justice of the peace, and acknowledged,” etc. On the face of the mortgage it is— “ Reuben Morley of Burlington Boro,’ Bradford county, Pennsylvania, of the second part.” It is precisely the case of Fuhrman <em>v. </em>Loudon, 13 S. &amp; R., 386, except there the certificate showed the party appeared ‘ before me a justice of the peace in and for said county,’ and it was held it referred to the county mentioned in the deed......It is not to be presumed that J. S. Williston was a justice of the peace of some other state, but on the contrary the certificate is prima facie he was a justice of the peace of some county in the state of Pennsylvania, and hence the acknowledgment was good and sufficient.”</p>

The executions wore indexed. They were notice to Putnam, and he had other knowledge of them, because knowledge by Morley was knowledge by Putnam, and Job Morley knew they were issued before the mortgage was executed, as found by the auditor. The levy in executions was made the same day they were issued, which was before he knew the executions were issued. He must then have had knowledge of the levy. The mortgage was given to secure a judgment, the consideration for which was a pre-existing debt. Putnam was therefore not entitled to protection as mortgagee against prior equities, even if he had no notice of them when he took the mortgage: 1 Jones on Mtg’s, § 458; Dickerson <em>v. </em>Tilling-hast, 4 Paige, 215; Weaver <em>v. </em>Barden, <a href="/ny/49/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="49 N.Y. 286" data-case-ids="2057540" data-case-paths="/ny/49/0286-01">49 N.

The Act of May 2, 1715, § 2, provides for the acknowledgment of deeds, inter alia, before “ one of the justices of the peace of the proper county or city where the lauds lie,” and § 8 provides that no deed or mortgage shall be valid “ unless such deed he acknowledged or proved and recorded, as herein-before directed.” The acknowledgment to Putnam’s mortgage has no caption. It does not state that the officer is a justice of the peace of any county or state, and the auditor did not find that at the time the officer took the acknowledgment he acted within his jurisdiction. The defective acknowledgment of a deed or mortgage is a nullity: Myers <em>v. </em>Boyd, 15 Norris, 427. If the record of a mortgage be defective for any cause, it does not amount to constructive notice. Every statutory requirement in relation to the execution and acknowledgment or proof of the mortgage must he complied with in order to gain priority by the record of it: 1 Jones on Mortgages, § 550; Heister <em>v. </em>Fortner, 2 Binney, 40; Simon <em>v. </em>Brown, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Yeates%20186" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Yeates 186">8 Yeates, 186</a>.

Upon such property an independent lien may be created by an execution issued from such judgment; but in order to accomplish that result it must be accompanied by a levy: Stauffer <em>v. </em>The Commissioners, <a href="/watts/1/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Watts 300" data-case-ids="1838046" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0300-01">1 Watts, 300</a>; Packer’s Appeal, 6 Barr, 277. It is, therefore, clear that the Ross <em>&amp; </em>Co. and Elsbree fi. fas., by virtue of their levies upon the land from the sale of, which the money in dispute was raised, were liens at common law; and that, in point of date, these liens outranked the Putnam mortgage, is not disputed. But as these executions, with their levies, were not docketed as prescribed by the Act of the 22d of April, 1856, they were not, as to purchasers and mortgagees, statutory liens. “ The lien of no execution,” reads the statute, “ <em>levied </em>on real estate, shall commence or be continued, as against any purchaser or mortgagee, unless the same be indexed in the county where the real estate is situated.” Now it is idle to say that the docketing of the fi. fa. alone was either a compliance with the Act, or constructive notice to the mortgagee. It is the execution <em>levied </em>that is the lien both under the Act and at common law. Hence, if the levy does not appear of record, there is, and can be, no statutory lien. So the question of constructive notice is put out of the case from the fact, that had the mortgagee looked just where he was bound to look he would have found an execution without a levy. It is said, however, that the Putnam mortgage was void for want of consideration. We cannot see the matter in this light. This mortgage was given to secure the Morley judgment, which had been marked to the use of Putnam. The consideration, therefore, moving <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>Reuben Morley to the execution of the mortgage was valid and lawful, and further than this we need not go. It may be that the assignment of the H. &amp; J. Morley judgment may not, as between them and Putnam, have been good for the want of consideration, but that is a matter between themselves, and with which the appellants had nothing to do. It is further urged that the execution of the mortgage is worthless as notice, in that it does not appear, in the certificate of acknowledgment, that the officer taking it was a justice of the peace for the county of Bradford. The person thus certifying, however, subscribes himself as a justice of the peace, and, as was said in Fuhrman <em>v. </em>Loudon, 13 S. &amp; R., 386, it cannot be supposed that he would have received the acknowledgment of a deed or mortgage for or on lands in Pennsylvania, unless he had been a justice of the peace for some county in the state : see also Angier <em>v. </em>Schieffelin, 22 P. F. S., 106. Notwithstanding, therefore, the able and ingenious argument of the counsel for the appellants, we cannot see our way clear to reverse the court below.</p>
