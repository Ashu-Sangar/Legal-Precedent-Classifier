In liis will, after reciting said lease of coal lands, A. provided as follows: “I direct that after my death my executors shall take charge of the same and from the proceeds thereof first give to my wife, Lydia Gearhart, aforesaid, an ample and sufficient support while she may survive my death, and then they shall divide the remainder equally among my children, share and share alike.” The lease was afterwards conveyed to B. and then to C. The widow and certain of the heirs by separate deeds also conveyed their respective shares of the royalties to C. All of C.’s interests, both in tire lease and tlie royalties, were afterwards acquired by D. The trustee under A.’s will filed a bill in equity against B. G. and D. to compel a discovery of the amount of coal mined by them, and an account for the royalties due. The respondents filed an answer denying liability to account, on the . ground that the right to receive the royalties was vested in C. The Master to whom the cause was referred, reported that under the will there was a continuing trust both for the widow and children, and that the conveyances of the widow and heirs were therefore void. Exceptions to this report were dismissed and a decree entered that the trustee collect the moneys accrued under the lease, and, after first providing for the support of the widow, that he retain the balance subject to the further order of the court. The royalties accruing from E. were accordingly paid to Hie trustee. Subsequently the widow died, and an auditor was appointed to distribute the balance remaining in the trustee’s hands; the same being claimed by A.’s heirs, and by D.’s executors under the deeds to G.</p>

But he allowed Perks a credit for the amount paid by him for said deeds.

The Master, in short, decided that the widow and heirs of John Gearhart, deceased, were entitled to receive the royalty on said coal lease, and that Edmund Perks did not acquire the title to said royalty by any purchase he may have made from said heirs and widow. So it follows that, since James T. Leonard’s estate owns nothing but Perks’ interest in said lease and royalty, Leonard’s executors cannot be entitled to receive the money now for distribution, for this is money arising from the same royalty, the parties are the same in interest, and stand in the same position as when they contested their right to this royalty by said bill in equity......Your auditor is of the opinion that the rights of these parties were fixed and finally determined by said bill in equity, and that by the finding of the Master, and under the decree of the court, the heirs of John Gearhart, deceased, have the right to receive the money now for distribution.</p>

The question involved in the present proceeding was only incidentally before the court in the former one. There the rights of the heirs could only be passed upon incidentally. The precise point was the liability of the respondents for coal taken, and the relief prayed was for the benefit of the widow. The question of the right of the heirs to convey, and whether the trust extended to them, was not at issue. We do not contend here that the widow’s share should, when she was alive, come to us, but we maintain that the shares of the heirs are •legally ours, and that, on the distribution arising out of the original transaction we have a right to be heard, and are not estopped by the Master’s report.

The Master found that the trust vested the property in the executors and that the widow and heirs had no title which they could convey, but only a beneficial interest which could be enforced in equity. The <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>attempted sale by the beneficiaries and the consequent destruction of the trust, were all declared a nullity. The question was distinctly raised and decided by final decree, and the records show that Leonard paid the trustee for coal mined, in pursuance of said decree. The trustee in said proceeding stood in the place of the heirs. A judgment concludes not merely as to the point decided, but as to a matter which it was necessary to decide, and which was actually decided as the groundwork of the decision itself, though not then directly the point at issue: Reg. <em>v. </em>Hartington M. Q., 4 El. &amp; Bl., 780; 1 Jur., N. S., 586; 24 L. J., M. C., 98; 3 C. L. R., 554. The fair and reasonable construction of the will is, that the trust was created for both widow and children. It does not say that the children shall receive nothing until the death of the widow, but they are to receive the surplus after her reasonable support is deducted. The trust is an active one, which continues until the coal mentioned in the Williams lease is mined out. The Master was therefore clearly right in deciding that the heirs could not Convey their shares: Barnett’s Appeal, 10 Wr., 392; Ogden’s Appeal, 20 P. F. S., 507; Earp’s Appeal, 25 P. F.

The bill was filed by the trustee, acting under the will of said deceased, for an account of the royalty of ton cents a ton for all coal mined by the respondents on a particular leasehold. Neither bill nor answer mentioned the deeds, but the respondents denied the complainant’s right to recover said royalty, and averred the same was vested in themselves. The decree required Perks and Parker to pay to the complainant $1,082, Parker and Leonard to pay $948.20, and Leonard to pay $90.31; also that Leonard should render an account for all coal mined since May 11, 1877, and pay the royalty on the same to date of the decree, and thereafter account and pay in like manner. Subsequently, a reference was made to the Master to state an account of the coal mined since <em>Maj </em>11, 1877, and the value thereof, which he did. Following this report the only decree of record is dated October 26, 1881, which directs the trustee “ to collect the moneys arising under the lease mentioned in the will of John Gearhart, deceased, <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>and after first providing for support of Lydia Gearhart, according to the will of John Gearhart, deceased, retain the balance in his hands, subject to the further order of the court, in that behalf to be made hereafter.” On the date of that decree the court awarded execution for the amount of royalty stated in the report.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[233,682,1177,949]]]'>The pleadings and decrees of the court contain no reference to the deeds, but show a claim by the trustee and recovery based on the will of John Gearhart, deceased. After recital of the lease to Williams, the testator provides thus: “I direct that after my death my executors shall take charge of the same, and from the proceeds thereof first give to my wife, Lydia Gearhart, aforesaid, an ample and sufficient support while she may survive my death, and then the}' shall divide the remainder equally among my children, share and share alike.” The decree recognized an active trust. It was active during the life of Lydia Gearhart. The trustee was entitled to receive the proceeds of the leased coal land during her life, and use the whole, if necessary, for her support. While she lived he had a duty to perform. At her death the remainder was to be divided among the testator’s children. Then the duties of the executor or trustee ceased; the children became entitled to possession and enjoyment. There is nothing from Avhich it can be inferred that the testator intended the trust to continue after the death of his wife. Where no duties and powers are conferred there is no active trust. By conferring duties and powers upon his executors for the benefit of his wife during her life, the testator declared the limit of the trust.</p>
    <p id="b528-6" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[230,1630,1199,734]]]'>From the Master’s opinion it appears that said deeds were adduced before him as evidence, and also the deed from Lydia Gearhart to Perks and Cassanova. He held that the trust was active for both widow and children, and that all the deeds , were void. Although the suit was- by the trustee who was entitled to recover all unpaid royalty, the Master ruled that the sum of the considerations of the deeds, $1,600, should be deducted from the amount of royalty owing by Perks and Parker; but as they were insolvent nobody was actually benefited or hurt by the deduction. Leonard was not interested in the amount owing by Perks and Parker; it mattered not to him whether the decree against them was for payment of the sum they owed, $2,682, or for only $1,082. And the alleged receiving back of the money paid to the grantors has no other foundation than a paper deduction against an uncollectible debt, without procurement or assent of the grantors. The grantors in the deeds were not parties to the bill in equity.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.6",528,[233,2363,1171,86]],["BL_529.1",529,[196,431,1178,949]]]'>. The. trust being active during the life of Lydia Gearhart, there was no error in the decrees. If the deed made by her <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>was Invalid, it followed that Leonard was bound to pay the royalty to the trustee precisely according to the decrees. And were it otherwise, the decree would be binding upon the parties until reversed or set aside. “ A judgment concludes not merely as to the point decided, but as to the matter which it was necessary to decide, and which was actually decided as the groundwork of the decision itself, though not then directly the point at issue.” It was unnecessary to decide anything as to the rights of the appellees, nor does the record show an issue and decree respecting the matter now in controversy. The issue involved the existence of the trust and the validity of the deed by Lydia Gearhart to Perks and Cassanova. It was necessary to decide that the trust was active, and that she had no power to defeat it to entitle the trustee to recover. But it was unnecessary to decide that the trust was created for an indefinite time, to be measured by the duration of the lease which was to continue until all the coal should be mined, unless the lease should be forfeited for a specified cause. Nor was it necessary to decide that persons entitled to the property at the termination of the trust could not convey their interest. These unnecessary rulings appear in the opinion, not in the pleadings and decree.</p>

The trustee set forth the lease and will as the foundation of his right to recover the royalty, and averred that the widow and children of the testator were all living. Had the widow been dead, that fact would have defeated his action, unless for unpaid royalty accrued within her lifetime. Had the respondents obtained releases or grants from all the children, such fact would not have barred the trustee’s right to recover the royalty while the widow lived. Then, whether the deeds were pleaded, or averred in answer, or offered in evidence, they were immaterial.</p>

Where the defendants pleaded a release to a declaration for a legacy, upon replication and rejoinder, it appeared that the Orphans’ Court had decided that the release was valid, and a bar to exceptions by the maker to the account of the executors. It was held that the question of the validity of the release came before the Orphans’ Court, not directly but incidentally, the immediate object was not to ascertain if the release was valid. Also, like exceptions being filed by another party, the question had to be decided on the merits, and the point as to the validity of the lease was not actual^, or at least neces<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>sarily decided. Therefore, the action was not barred by the judgment of the Orphans’ Court: Hibshman <em>v. </em>Dulleban, 4. Watts, 183.

    <p id="b530-6" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[235,691,1175,130]]]'>No cause was attempted to be shown before the auditor for setting aside the deeds other than the alleged former recovery. The assignments of error must be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b530-7" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[494,820,916,259]]]'>Decree reversed, at the cost of the appellees, and it is now considered and decreed that the sums appropriated to David Gearhart, Catharine Goss, Hannah M. Haberacker, and Susan Millward’s children be paid to the appellants. Record remitted for further proceeding.</p>
