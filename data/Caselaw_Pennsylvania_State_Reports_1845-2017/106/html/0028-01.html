This was a case of double insurance, and in such ease the rule of apportionment applies. The case of Sloat <em>v. </em>Ins.

The language of the policy in the case is different from the language of the policy construed in Sloat <em>v. </em>Ins. Co., <em>supra, </em>in this respect that our policy provides for additional insurance “ on the property hereby insured, <em>or any part </em>thereof..” This language expressly excludes the idea of identity as to subject, its extent or quantity, and therefore admits of concurrent insurance upon part of the property included in either policy.</p>

E.

The defendant contends that there is a double insurance, and that not more than two-thirds of the loss shall be paid in any event.

If there be double insurance, either simultaneously or by successive policies, in which priority of insurance is not provided for, all are insurers and liable pro rata. All the policies are considered as making but one policy, and therefore any one insurer who pays more than his proportion, may claim a contribution from others who are liable.”</p>

But the language of condition 17 of the policy in suit is broader in its terms than the clause of the policy in the case referred to. It says, speaking of additional insurance, that if it is “ on the property hereby insured, or any part thereof.” Without deciding this point therefore, we will treat this as a <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>case of double insurance to the extent that the Kreidersville policy covered the same property as was insured by the defendant company. The result is as follows:</p>
    <p id="b50-5" data-blocks='[["BL_50.4",50,[232,544,1170,216]]]'>The defendant’s policy was for $4,000, based on a valuation of $8,000, and the Kreidersville company’s policy was for $2,250, based on a valuation of $3,000. The Kreidersville policy covered property admittedly worth $336 not covered by the other policy. It may be stated thus:</p>
    <p id="b50-6" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[233,802,1167,44]]]'>The Kreidersville policy is on property valued at.. $3,000 00</p>

    <p id="b50-10" data-blocks='[["BL_50.9",50,[222,1147,1176,898]]]'>The,two policies therefore cover identical property to the amount of $5,998, which is the total insurance. The jury have found that the total loss exceeds the total insurance, and it would seem clear that the defendant company must pay the full amount of its policy, viz.: $4,000. But the latter contends that, admitting the loss to be $6,000, their liability under their policy is not only limited to $4,000 — say two thirds of the loss, but that the Kreidersville company must pro-rate with them as to the $4,000. In-other words, they estimate the liability of both companies at two thirds of the loss sustained, to be divided between them pro rata. There is no warrant for this in the contract. The clauses, in which the words “ two thirds of the actual cash value of the property ” destroyed are inserted, are used to define the maximum extent of the liability assumed by the company. Thus the defendant company may reasonably claim that its liability extends only to two thirds of the actual cash value of the property destroyed. But their claim goes beyond this, and they say that under their policy their liability is limited to two thirds of two thirds of the actual loss. We can see no reason in such a proposition.</p>
    <p id="b50-11" data-blocks='[["BL_50.10",50,[222,2047,1170,384]],["BL_51.1",51,[209,433,1165,378]]]'>It is easy to see why, in the case of over-insurance, the pro rata principle should apply. If the loss is $10,000 and the insurance $15,000, it is just that each policy should contribute its proportion only. But where the loss is $15,000 and the insurance $10,000 there is no room to apply such a principle. Hor does this work any hardship to the defendant company. Had there been no other policy on this property it is conceded they would have been liable to its full amount. The plaintiff would then have carried one third of the risk. He <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>took out another policy, perhaps for the very purpose of covering this one third. Yet if the defendant’s contention be sustained he has obtained no additional protection by doing so, and the money paid in premiums has been expended to no purpose. We do not think the clause in the policy referred to can be extended to work such manifest injustice as this. It was intended to compel contribution in case of a partial loss, thus preventing circuity of action. It applies only where the double insurance exceeds the loss sustained.</p>
    <p id="b51-4" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[208,820,1164,632]]]'>We are not without authority to sustain this position. In the Royal Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Roedel, 28 P. F. S., 19, there was a double insurance, and the policy contained a clause similar to this. It was held that the loss having been greater than the total amount insured, the policies must be paid iu full. And in Sloat <em>v. </em>Royal. Insurance Company, supra, it was said by Justice Read : “ In the case before us there is no over-insurance; all the policies, if paid, will not pay the loss sustained by the assured. A calculation therefore which will cut down the payments must be based on erroneous principles.” The eases of Richmondville Union Seminary, 14 Gray (Mass.), 459; Haley <em>v. </em>Dorchester Ins. Co., 1 Allen (Mass.), 536; Ætna Fire Ins.
