Several parties, who were owners of bonds of a railroad company about to be sold under foreclosure of a mortgage securing the same, entered into an agreement that in case of the purchase of the railroad in their interest as bondholders they would not claim their proportion of the proceeds of the sale, but would take in lieu thereof bonds to be issued irj. a re-organization of the company. There was no stipulation in the agreement as to which of the bondholders should purchase the property, nor as to contribution towards the expenses of the sale and of the re-organization of Hie railroad. A., one of the bondholders, undertook to buy at the sale, but the property was bid above A.’s limit and sold to B., another party, who subsequently transferred the title to A., for advances made by A. to him, and for prior indebtedness. A. began to re-organize Hie railroad and requested the other parties to the agreement to join in the payment of the expenses, which they refused to do, <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>and they afterwards filed a hill in equity against A. for an account of the proceeds in Ms hands :</p>

An additional sum of $10,000 was estimated to be necessary for repairs and improvements, making the total amount needed $30,960. The proposition was accordingly made to the plaintiffs to contribute ratably to this fund, either on the basis of their whole claims or upon the basis of their claims less their dividends from the proceeds of sale. A schedule was prepared and submitted to them, but they refused to contribute as requested. Meantime on August 9, 1879, the defendant Caldwell took title to the railroad, and on October 31, 1879, conveyed it and its franchises to a new company organized under the name of The Delaware River Railroad Company. On November 1, 1879, the new company issued bonds secured by a mortgage of the road, franchises, &amp;e., for $65,000, which bonds were delivered to the corporation defendant to secure the purchase money advanced, the amount expended for im<a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>provements, and the former indebtedness of Ogden. Ogden died soon afterwards, and the road was operated by his executor, who succeeded him as President, but it never earned enough to pay the interest on the money advanced. Early in 1881 the corporation defendant sold its claim against Ogden, together with the bonds held as collateral, to Messrs. Dupont for $61,750.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[223,731,1184,858]]]'>Upon the question of the liability of the defendants to account to the plaintiffs, the Master reported inter alia as follows : “ If we assume for a moment that Ogden’s bid had been allowed to stand, and that the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company had not negotiated with him, the conclusion is inevitable that the terms of the sale could not have been complied with, and that a re-sale would have been ordered of which the plaintiffs would have had notice, and at which they could have protected their interests by bidding. It seems to the Master that the defendants could not thus take away any rights of the plaintiffs. To hold under these circumstances that the adoption of Ogden’s bid by the defen-0 dants was a purchase totally disconnected from the agreement, and free from any of its obligations or trusts, would be to encourage quibbles and technical devices, to fritter away solemn compacts. The Master, therefore, finds that the purchase by the defendants of the railroad, franchises, and property of the Delaware Shore Railroad Company was a purchase under the terms and within the meaning of the agreement of July 25th, 1879.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b162-7" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[222,1589,1167,558]]]'>“ This leaves for consideration only one question, viz.: whether the plaintiffs’ refusal to contribute ratably for the payment of the outlays, as demanded by the defendants, constituted a waiver or forfeiture of the plaintiffs’ rights under the agreement. The plaintiffs earnestly denjr that they were liable to contribute anything. They point to the agreement, and find in it only one duty imposed on them, viz., that they shall not claim their cash dividends out of the proceeds of the foreclosure sale. A performance of this duty entitles them, according to their contention, to receive first mortgage bonds of the reorganized company, in the same ratio that their bonds, held as collaterals, bore to the whole amount of the foreclosed mortgage......</p>

It would seem to follow, therefore, that the plaintiffs and the defendants stood on an equal footing. If money was required to carry out the provisions of the agreement there was no valid reason why the plain<a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>tiffs should not ratably contribute. If they expected to share in the profits of the bargain, they were equally bound to bear their part of its burdens.</p>

There were, however, other circumstances to complicate the matter. After the purchase by the defendants, they dealt with the property as their own, without the leave, assistance, or advice of the plaintiffs, or any of them. They did more. They gave away, as a gratuity to Ogden, an integral part of the property purchased for the joint benefit of the plaintiffs and defendants, to wit: that part of the value of the road represented by the shares of stock issued by the re-organized railroad company, being all over $65,000, the amount of the mortgage bonds issued by the company. If, for the sake of tlie argument, we assume that this conduct was a fair compliance with the terms of the agreement, it is still difficult to see how the defendants could he entitled arbitrarily, and against the wishes of the plaintiffs, to spend $10,000 for improvements, and then to demand a contribution including such expenditure on pain of a forfeiture of the plaintiffs’ rights under the agreement. The very foundation of the plaintiffs’ duty to contribute was the fact of their being jointly interested with the defendant, and the least right conferred by such joint interest was to be consulted as to the propriety of spending money in improvements.</p>

The only agreement for a purchase by the Fidelity Company of which there <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>is any evidence is that admitted, i. e., an agreement with Ogden that if the Fidelity Company became the purchasers they would permit the plaintiffs, who were Ogden’s creditors, to come in with them upon equal terms. The Fidelity Company did not bind themselves to bid the property up to any particular sum, but were left to act in the matter as their own interest dictated. In the exercise of a fair business discretion, Mr. Caldwell fixed $30,000 as the limit of his bid, and the property having been subsequently bid up to $35,500 and at that figure taken by Ogden, the matter might have been permitted to rest there, in which case both the plaintiffs and defendants would have taken their dividend from the fund, and no one could have maintained a claim against the Fidelity Company for failure to become the purchasers of the property. The contingency not having occurred upon which the plaintiffs’ rights were to take effect, as expressed in the paper of July 25, 1879, the utmost claim that they can assert as against the Fidelity Company is, that in the new and independent arrangement, which was subsequently made between the Fidelity Company and Ogden, the plaintiffs should be permitted to share the advantages which were thereby secured by the Fidelity Company; but this could only be upon the condition of assuming an equal share of its burdens.

    <p id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.7",166,[205,853,1175,175]]]'>The learned court below dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the Master’s report without filing an opinion. "We are left, therefore without the aid which the discussion of the case by that court would have given us.</p>
    <p id="b166-7" data-blocks='[["BL_166.8",166,[201,1027,1180,1242]]]'>We find no fault with the Master’s findings of fact, nor up to a certain point, with his conclusions. Assuming that the agreement embodied in “Exhibit A” was participated in by the defendants below, and was binding upon them as found by the Master, we are of opinion that he was clearly right in holding that the plaintiffs below were bound to contribute their pro rata share of the purchase money and the expenses. The most that can be claimed for “ Exhibit A ” is that it was a contract that in case the defendants should purchase the road, it should be for the joint benefit of the parties to the agreement. This implied necessarily that the purchase was to be at their joint expense; that is, that the purchase money and expenses should be contributed by all the parties in proportion to their respective interests. The present contention that the defendants were bound to advance the plaintiffs’ share of purchase money and expenses is without merit. There is nothing in “ Exhibit A ” from which such an agreement can be reasonably inferred. The property was sold to Ogden for $85,000. The defendants paid the purchase money, of which the sum of $10,001.40 was applicable to the expenses of the foreclosure proceedings, and the payment of prior liens, and the sum of $10,958.60 was applicable to the payment of the dividends of bondholders other than the plaintiffs and the defendant corporation. Uo portion of this purchase money was contributed by the plaintiffs, or by. either of them. On the contrary, when applied to shortly after the sale to contribute their, respective shares, they flatly refused. As one of the witnesses remarked: “ They hooted the idea of the thing, and would not have entertained it for a moment.”</p>
    <p id="b166-8" data-blocks='[["BL_166.9",166,[201,2276,1177,175]],["BL_167.1",167,[201,432,1171,390]]]'>Up to this point we agree with the Master’. But in discussing the liability of the plaintiffs to contribute, he says: “ If the case turned upon this simple question, it would doubtless be necessary to dismiss the bill. There were, however, other <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>circumstances to complicate the matter. After the purchase by the defendants, they dealt with the property as their own, without the leave, assistance, or advice of the plaintiffs, or any of them. They did more. They gave away, as a gratuity to Ogden, an integral part of the property purchased for the joint benefit of the plaintiffs and defendants, to wit: That part of the value of the road represented by the shares of stock issued by the re-organized railroad company, being all over $65,000, the amount of the mortgage bonds issued by the company.”</p>
    <p id="AvW" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[193,821,1186,1639]],["BL_168.1",168,[238,427,1185,730]]]'>Just here we think the Master fell into error. It was contended by the defendants that they did not purchase the property under “ Exhibit A; ” that they fixed $30,000 as the limit which they authorized their agent to bid; that he refused to exceed his limit although urged by others to do so; that the property was finally knocked down to Mr. Ogden for $35,000; that they subsequently advanced him the money to pay for the property and merely took the title as collateral to secure their advances. AVe need not discuss this view of the case, for conceding the purchase to enure to the benefit of the plaintiffs, all the defendants could be called upon to do was to permit the plaintiffs to como in under the new arrangement. The defendants were not required by “ Exhibit A ” to purchase the property in any event and without any regard to price. If they gave the plaintiffs an opportunity of coining in and sharing the benefits of the purchase they did all that in equity they could be called upon to do. That they did this appears, clearly in the case. The plaintiffs refused to contribute a dol-i lar of the purchase money. With such refusal thoir right to ■' participate in the direction of the affair, or in the proceeds of the re-sale ceased, and the defendants had the right to deal with, the property as their own. The claim of the plaintiffs to share the benefits of the transaction, and yet leave the burden and risk to the defendants, cannot be sustained. Such mode of dealing was pointedly condemned in Yeager and Grim’s Appeal, 4 Outerbridge, 88. The appellees contend, however, that Yeager and Grim’s Appeal differs from the present case for the reason that in that case it was agreed that the purchase money should be paid by the three parties who had agreed to buy at the assignee’s sale, and the appellee refused to pay his proportion; whereas in the case in hand, the plaintiffs agreed to accept new bonds for those which they then held, in the re-organization. We are unable to perceive this distinction. AVe regard “Exhibit A” as an agreement between certain of the bondholders of the Delaware Shore Railroad Company, that one of their number, to wit, the defendant company, should buy in the said railroad for their joint account and benefit, and that in the proposed plan of re-organization the <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>parties thereto would accept new bonds in lieu of the old bonds held by them. This is a very common proceeding in such cases, and necessarily involved an outlay of money. The sum of $10,001.40 was required to pay the costs of foreclosure, ¡expenses and prior liens; and the further sum of $10,958.60 jjpo pay other bondholders not parties to the agreement. By whom was this money to be paid ? Manifestly by the parties interested, unless it was expressly agreed to the contrary. The plaintiffs contend that they were not to pay anything; they sajr such was their understanding. Their understanding, however, is a matter of no consequence unless' it amounted to an agreement with the defendant company, and of this there is no evidence. On the contrary, “ Exhibit A,” which we must accept as the final understanding of the parties contains nothing from which we can reasonably infer that the defendants were to advance the plaintiffs’ share of the purchase money.</p>
    <p id="b168-5" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[216,1158,1205,342]]]'>Under the view we take of the case the plaintiffs stand in , the same position as the other bondholders not parties to Exhibit A.” This entitles them to a dividend out of the I [¡purchase money paid by the defendants, but not to participate yin the proceeds of the sale made by them. The plaintiff, George W. Hall, appears to have received his share. This is a matter, however, with which we have no concern in this proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b168-7" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[218,1502,1201,347]]]'>We need not discuss the matter of the $10,000 claimed by the defendants for moneys expended by them in the improvement of the road. Had the plaintiffs contributed their quota of the purchase money they would have been in a position to question such outlay. But until such payment they had no interest in the purchase. They declined to pay any part of the assessment upon the ground that they were not obliged to contribute anything, either as purchase mone3r or otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b168-8" data-blocks='[["BL_168.6",168,[237,1847,1178,172]]]'>The plaintiffs also appealed from this decree, and have filed numerous assignments of error. What has been said renders a discussion of them unnecessary. The plaintiffs’ appeal is dismissed at their respective costs.-</p>
