In 1869 Mrs. Coats became insane and a charge upon the Danville and Mahoning district, and was by the directors, with the knowledge-and consent of her husband, removed to the State hospital for the insane at Harrisburg, and from that time until the 16th day of September, 1882, she was relieved, maintained and kept by the Danville and Mahoning district.</p>

In 1875 Coats abandoned his family, left Danville and took up his residence in Scranton, and has continued to reside there from that time until now. Before he left Danville the directors of the poor endeavored to obtain from him some portion of the expenses of supporting his wife, but were not successful. After he left they had no knowledge of his whereabouts until some time in 1880. Application was made to him then to do something for her. Nothing was obtained but a promise, which was not fulfilled.</p>

M. T. Lavelle, the city clerk of the city of Scranton, produced before the commissioner assessment books for the years 1877 and 1878, and stated that Jerry Coats was assessed as a laborer, valuation thirty dollars for each year, and the same for 1879. The board of revision raised the valuation to fifty dollars, and the tax was levied on that sum. W. W. Williams, one of the county commissioners of Lackawanna county, was sworn and produced before the examiner of the county assessments, for the years 1879, 1880, 1881, showing that Jerry Coats was in those three years assessed as a laborer, valuation <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>fifty dollars. No objection'was made before the examiner to this mode of proving the assessments. If objected to at the time, certified or sworn copies might have been obtained.

    <p class="summary" id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[212,762,1174,728]]]'>In respect to the payment of taxes, evidence was given by B. R. Wade, collector of delinquent city and school taxes for Scranton for 1879 to 1882. He produced the books from the office of the city treasurer, showing the school and city taxes from the years 1879 to 1881, inclusive, by which it appeared that Jerry Coats was charged with seventy-seven' cents city taxes and one dollar and ten cents school tax for each of these years. These taxes were not paid personally by Coats to the witness, but they were paid by the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company out of the wages of Coats, he being engaged at labor for them. The witness does not remember the particulars of the payments, but finding on the margin of the books marked “paid” by himself with the date, according to his usual practice, the proof is deemed sufficient to establish the fact of payment. The tax of 1879 was paid on the 7th January, 1880. That of 1880 was paid December 4th of that year, and that of 1881 was paid July 3d, 1882.</p>

It does not appear that there was any other Jerry Coats in Scranton at any time. The Jerry Coats in question had resided there for six years. He was assessed with taxes from 1877. Inasmuch as but one person of that name could be found by the collector and the tax of that one was paid by the company where this Jerry Coats worked, the presumption is strong that he was the person who was assessed and paid the taxes.</p>

The entry of the word “.paid” by a collector opposite a-charge of tax, is evidence against him. It is, in fact, official evidence of payment, made <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>by the proper officer, and by him placed as a charge against himself in the hands of the official to whom he must render account. Every presumption is in favor of the correctness of the return. In the case of Coxe <em>v. </em>Deringer, 28 P. F. S., 291, it was held that the words “ paid before sale ” on the treasurer’s books was not evidence of such payment, being evidently an entry by the treasurer after sale. In Aukeny <em>v. </em>Albright, 8 Harris, 157, the letters “ pd ” on the treasurer’s book were held not to be evidence of themselves of payment of the taxes before sale, the treasurer having testified that the practice of his office was to mark them after sale.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b464-5" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[219,1026,1178,550]]]'>The case of the Queen <em>v. </em>Shavington, 17 Adolph, and Ellis, N. S., 48, cited by counsel for the appellant, is based upon an Act of Parliament which provides that relief given to children shall be considered as relief to the parents. In this State there is no statute upon the subject. Our Act of 1836, P. <em>D., </em>1154, enacts that “A settlement may- be gained, in any district, by any person who shall come to inhabit the same, and who shall be charged with and pay his proportion of any public taxes or levies for two years successively.” I think it better to adhere to the plain words of the statute than to interpolate qualifications and provisos, to make it accord with what is held to be law elsewhere, or even with our own ideas ■of what should have been inserted in the Act.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[220,1584,1178,859]],["BL_465.1",465,[217,427,1163,429]]]'>It is said that the reason why a settlement may be gained by performing the conditions named in the statute is that the district receives the benefits of the labor, the renting of premises, the payment of taxes or the fulfilling of the duties of a public office, and therefore should support the citizen who does these acts, if he afterwards becomes disabled. If this reason is to be allowed any force in giving construction to the statute, it should operate against the appellant district. For seven years Jerry Coats has been a citizen of Scranton. He has borne his share of the public taxes, and has employed none of his earnings to support the wife and family residing elsewhere, whom he had during all that time abandoned. His unfortunate wife was provided for in a charitable institution, under a statute of the State which enacts that the constituted authorities having charge of the poor shall have authority to send to the asylum insane paupers under their charge. If the fact of her being there at the expense of the district, where the husband had a settlement, rendered him a pauper or likely to become chargeable upon the district where he had taken up a new residence, the remedy for that district was by an <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>order of removal to tlie district where he had a settlement. By permitting him to remain and to perform all that the statute required to gain a new settlement, it is too late now for Scranton to object that such settlement was not gained. No fraud or collusion on the part of the authorities of Dan-ville is alleged or proved. The case is simply that of a total and continued abandonment by a husband and father, of his wife and family for seven years, during which time he resided in another and distant district, where he performed all acts necessary to acquire a settlement there.</p>

Did Jerry Goats reside in Scranton during the years when he paid taxes there ? He was personally there. He had no home elsewhere.
