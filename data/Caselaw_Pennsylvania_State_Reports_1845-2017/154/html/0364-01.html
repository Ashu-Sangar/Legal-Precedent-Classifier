The coach in which she was riding was the only passenger coach on the train, and was preceded by four flat cars. At the time of the accident, deep piles of snow were on both sides of the track. When the train reached the terminal station, the brakeman beat down the snow by the side of the car to make a place for plaintiff to alight and stand until an engine removed the flat cars, which obstructed her passage along the track. After remaining in that position for some time she objected to staying there longer. The brakeman then suggested that, if she would pass over the four flat cars, she could leave the train that way, and that there was no other way for her to go. She thereupon proceeded over the cars successfully until she came to the place for alighting, and in attempting to get down from the car her clothes caught in the coupling pin, and she fell and sustained her injuries. <em>Held, </em>that the question of defendant’s negligence and plaintiff’s contributory negligence was for the jury.</p>

The train consisted Of a passenger coach preceded by four flat freight cars loaded with lumber, the ends of which were racked for bark, and covered with ice. When the train arrived at Ricketts station, the terminus of the road, snow to a considerable depth was on both sides of the track.

She testified that the brakeman then suggested that, if she could pass over the four loaded cars which were a part of the train, she could leave the train and go on her way.

The brakeman, without denying this testimony, says he carried her packages for her while she was going over the cars and assisted her to alight.
