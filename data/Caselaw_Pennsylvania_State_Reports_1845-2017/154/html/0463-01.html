It further appeared that the firm of John Baird &amp; Sons consisted of John Baird, the owner of the real estate, and his two sons, Thomas E. Baird and John E. Baird. The firm occupied the property in question without any lease from the owner, and merely at his sufferance. No evidence was offered of the market value of any leasehold interest, or of any special injury to the business of the firm. There was evidence however that the contracts were made by the firm for repairs to the property, and that payments for such repairs were made out of firm assets, and these bills were given in evidence, although it would seem that these items were considered in connection with the preceding case.</p>

The. learned judge below instructed the jury to render a verdict in favor of the defendant for the reason, as stated by him, that the plaintiffs had not offered any evidence showing the value of the alleged interference with their business. If the learned judge below was right in his view of the evidence, and it has not been made to appear that he was wrong, we see no error in instructing the jury that they had no right to base their verdict upon a mere guess.</p>
