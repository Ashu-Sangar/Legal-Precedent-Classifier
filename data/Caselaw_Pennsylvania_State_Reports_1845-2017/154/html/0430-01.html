It follows the principle that the franchise is an inseparable incident of the ownership of stock. We are so far from combating the doctrine that we would give to it in every instance the largest and freest play. In acquiring its stock, the shareholder in every corporation assumes a double duty; to the public, in seeing that the corporate acts shall conform to law, and to other investors, in seeing that the corporate acts shall work them no' injustice. Any contract, therefore, by which he retains the legal title, and yet seeks to denude himself of the legal responsibilities which should attend it, offends equally against the welfare of the community and the interests of individuals. This position was elaborately discussed in Shepaug Voting Trust Cases, 60 Con. 553, where a power, indefinite as to duration, given by a syndicate to a trust company to vote upon the syndicate’s stock, had been used at one annual meeting, and was held to be a mere power of attorney, and hence subject to the state law, which prohibited such a power from operating for a longer period than one year.</p>

It is tbe policy of our law that ownership of stock shall control the property and the management of the corporation, and this cannot be accomplished, and this good policy is defeated, if stockholders are permitted to surrender all their discretion and will, in the important <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>matter of voting, and to suffer themselves to be mere passive instruments in the hands of some agent who has no interest in the stock, equitable or legal, and no interest in the general prosperity of the corporation.’</p>

It does not present the case of an owner who has parted with an incident of ownership, the franchise, to a person who has no beneficial interest therein; on the contrary, it is the case of three joint owners, each holding an undivided interest in all of the stock. It is very manifest that these trustees cannot cast separate votes ; they must all unite as to every share, and if one of them dissents from the choice of his fellows, the opportunity of exercising the franchise is lost to them all. The testator endeavored to provide against such an emergency, and, while he vested the title to the stock in three persons, he delegated the vote which it authorized to one whom he selected out of the three. Whether his selection of that person was a tribute to the fitness of the voter, or was the the arbitrary utterance of his own will, is of little consequence; he had at least this warrant for his action, that divided councils would not disfranchise the stock, and that the party who should cast the vote would he an owner, and would have an equal interest with the other owners in voting wisely. The device by which the testator sought to carry out his plan was clumsy, in this : that by prescribing a formal proxy, where the proxy had in fact been already given in the will, he put it in the power of either of the respondents to prevent the stock from being voted at all. The cases which were cited in the argument are cases where the absolute owners have abandoned an incident of ownership; but these trustees are not absolute owners, and they cannot, if they would, wield the powers of an absolute ownership. They cannot sell, nor invest, nor borrow, except as they are authorized by the will. If the testator had said that they should sell only in case one of their number, whom he designated, should deem it expedient to sell, what right of the trustees, or of the cestuis que trusts, would be infringed; and has he done more in saying that they shall vote as the petitioner, to whom he has intrusted the duty, shall decide ?'</p>

The real base of their complaint, and upon that foundation they have certainly built a gloomy superstructure, is that the petitioner used the voting capacity of the proxy to enhance his own interests at the expense of the trust; and that the grand contrivance by which he effected this fraud was his election to the presidency, to which that vote contributed. They mean by this to invoke the rule that a trustee shall not make a profit for himself out of the trust. But this rule is not to be interpreted with a literalness so absolute as to exclude a trustee from reaping the incidental advantages which may spring from his office. For example, his management of a fund of a few hundreds may be so efficient that it shall secure for him a post whose emoluments amount to thousands. Is he to surrender these fees because, except for the accident of his trustship, he might never have earned them ? A doctrine like that would stifle ambition where it is most needed. The act of the petitioner in procuring his election to the head of the company, by his own vote, admitting that fact to have been proved, was not, in itself, a wrong to the trust, even if it added to his power; the increased power would enure to the advantage of the trust, and through it the trust would rule the company.</p>

We do, not propose to catalogue the alleged offences. The gravest were that he caused his salary to be doubled; had formed a board of directors who were his tools ; had occupied for his own purposes a farm of which the rent was paid by the company, and had used for his own horses feed which had been bought for its stables; and by his general mismanagement had so depressed the price of the company’s stock that the estate was unable to dispose of its holdings. If these charges had been made out, we should still doubt our power to refuse the relief which had been demanded by the petitioner. Upon the ground that be was imperiling the estate, we might dismiss him from the trust, but so long as we suffered him to remain a trustee, we could not well abridge the authority which, in that capacity, has been given him by the will.</p>

And if the answer of the respondents, so far as it is responsive to the petition, must be accepted as true until overcome by adequate evidence, we must enter upon an inquiry affecting a corporate body which is not before us, and which cannot be affected by our decree. We are doing this, too, at the instance, not of shareholders, as such, but of cestuis que trusts. It is, perhaps, the first time in which a court of our limited jurisdiction has sat in judgment upon the internal management of a corporation, which was not at the same time a trustee.

Assuming, then, the duty which the corporators must have neglected, we find in the answer this averment: ‘ The said petitioner caused the affairs of said company to be corruptly and dishonestly mismanaged; caused his own salary to be doubled in amount, and the stock to be so <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>depressed in the market that it was impossible for the estate to make sales thereof.’ Yet the evidence is that when the petitioner entered the service of the company as its president, its stock was selling at 16.00 per share, and when he left it at 131.00 per share, an advance of 500 per cent. The evidence also is that, in spite of their declared inability to sell, the executors did sell 7000 shares at a large profit to the estate. It shows further that the petitioner was president of the railway company at the time of his father’s death and for seven years before that time ; a circumstance which may naturally have led the testator to intrust him with the voting power. It is charged that he intends to use the proxy to secure his election. But as the proxy covers only 6900 shares, while the total issue of stock numbers 40,000 shares, it is evident that his canvass, to be successful, must receive a very substantial support from the shareholders, and this in turn implies their acquiescence in his methods.</p>

To justify this refusal to obey a mandatory order of the testator, the conduct of the voting trustee must be such as would warrant his dismissal from the trust. It will not be justified by the belief of the cotrustees that his management of the business of the corporation is faulty in method, or even ruinous in policy; the testator took the risk of that contingency, and gave them no discretion; and the petitioner is responsible only to the corporation.

The holder of the proxy is the servant, not the master; and it would be a gross breach of duty on his part if, taking advantage of the trust confided in him, he should vote contrary to the instructions or against .the interest of his master. In the case before us, while the testator has said that the stock which he has bequeathed to the petitioner and his coexecutors in trust for the purposes set forth in the will, shall always be voted on by the petitioner, to whom the coexecutors, in order to enable him so to do, are directed to give the necessary proxies, it is far from clear that the givers of the proxies were intended to be absolutely without voice as to how the power thus conferred should be exercised.

That a trustee, or one having a naked power, cannot avail himself of his position to obtain any personal benefit is a principle which requires no citation of authority. His sole object must be the promotion of the interest of his beneficiaries. As was said by Lord Hatherly, in Duke of Portland v. Topham, 11 H. L. C. 32, one having such a power ‘ must fairly and honestly execute it, without having any ulterior object to be accomplished. He cannot carry into execution any indirect object, or acquire any benefit for himself, either directly or indirectly. .. .
