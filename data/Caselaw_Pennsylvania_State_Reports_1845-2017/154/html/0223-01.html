Rogers committed suicide Sept, 6,1887, in his room, and the above paper was found lying on the top of a closed trunk in an unsealed envelope addressed to John Jackson, Sr. Plaintiff asked the court to charge the jury that if they believed James Rogers “ intended the paper, offered as his will, to take effect only after his death, the verdict must be for the plaintiff.” This was affirmed, and the jury ' were also told that if they believed under the evidence the paper was intended as a present gift at the time of its date, their verdict should be for the defendant. The jury returned a verdict as follows: “We agree that the document written by James Rogers was his wish that it should take effect at the time it was written.” The court amended the verdict so as to read, “verdict for defendant,”and upon this verdict judgment was entered. <em>Held, </em>that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>

A will has been variously defined, but the definitions all amount to about the same thing, and that is that it is, when in writing, an instrument in which a person makes a disposition of his property to take effect after his death. This is what distinguishes a will from an ordinary gift. A gift takes effect at once if it takes effect at all, that is, the ordinary gift does. But if it is a gift in a will it is then a gift limited to take effect after the death of the party who made the will.</p>

I do not want you to mistake the effect of the ruling of the court. We simply say that this evidence is competent. But it is a question for you, and for you exclusively, to determine whether the evidence, after it has been admitted, satisfies you that James Rogers, while he does not say so upon the face of the paper, intended that this paper should take effect after his death.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[178,932,1168,1472]]]'>“ The facts upon which the plaintiff relies as establishing the affirmative of this question are very few and very simple. The paper, as you will remember, is dated August 14,1887. About three weeks after that date James Rogers was found dead in his bed, having committed suicide by shooting himself. Shortly after his dead body was discovered this paper, inclosed in an envelope addressed to John Jackson, Sr., was found on a trunk at the bottom of the bed. So far as the evidence is concerned we know nothing about the paper from the time it was written until the time it was discovered upon this trunk; there is no direct evidence as to who placed the paper there. You have heard the argument of the counsel for the plaintiff upon that branch of the case; the claim is that the house was locked and that it was impossible for anyone else to have placed the paper where it was found. You are to give that evidence such weight as you think it is entitled to. Of course, if that paper was placed there by some one else and not by James Rogers, there would be no significance in the fact that it was found upon the trunk in the way testified to. That is all the evidence there is in the case bearing upon this question, whether James Rogers intended this paper to be his last will and testament, or that it should take effect after his death. It is a question which I have concluded, after a great deal of thought, to submit to you for your finding. If you find from the evidence, and if the evidence is clear on that point, that James Rogers did intend that this paper should take effect after his death, then you will return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. If, however, you are not satisfied by the weight of the evidence of that fact, then you will return a verdict in favor of the defendant.”</p>

Upon the trial the further objection was taken that the paper was not testamentary in its character, and the issue turned upon this question. The plaintiff asked the court to charge the jury that if they believed James Rogers “ Intended the paper, offered as his will, to take effect only after his death, the verdict must be for the plaintiff.” This was affirmed and the jury were also told that if they believed under the evidence the paper was intended as a present gift at the time of its date, their verdict should be for the defendant. The jury returned a verdict as follows: “We agree that the document written by James Rogers was his wish that it should take effect at the time that it was written.” This distinctly negatived the fact upon which the plaintiff’s point was predicated, that Rogers intended the paper to take effect as his will after his death, and found that it was intended to take effect at its date which was some two weeks before his death. The court did no violence to the letter or spirit of this verdict when it was amended so as to read, “Verdict for defendant,” for it is an affirmance of the defendant’s position in regard to the nature and purpose of the paper. Whether it was not the duty of the court to determine the character of this paper is a question we need not discuss, for both parties treated the question on the trial as one of fact for the jury, rather than one of law for the court. The meaning of a written instrument and its legal effect are, as a general rule, to be determined by the court, and its construction ought not to be turned over to a jury. ' But as we have already pointed out, this point is not presented on this record. Assuming that this was a question for the jury, we see no error in the manner of its submission or in the amendment of the verdict.</p>

On the other hand, the legal effect of the alleged testamentary paper was submitted to the jury with the assent of both parties, and as a consequence they have found that a paper, aptly disposing of the entire estate of James Rogers and found exposed conspicuously in the room in which he committed suicide, was intended to take effect two weeks prior to its exhibition as an absolute gift; notwithstanding the fact that he had kept it in his own possession until the hour of his death, and then for the first time placed it <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>where those who discovered his dead body could not fail to discover his written declaration of his wishes in regard to his property.</p>
