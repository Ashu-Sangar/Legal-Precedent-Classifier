The nature of his claim is founded upon an alleged agency, which he said was created by him in virtue of a writing here, whereby he created Mr. Winslow, the defendant here, his agent for the sale of his interest, being the one fourth undivided interest in a certain tract of land in McCalmont township, the tract containing eleven hundred and twelve acres. He says that the land was sold for the sum of $44,497.60, and that the defendant as his agent only accounted to him for the sum of $7,500, with interest, and that he claims to recover in this suit the balance of what his one fourth interest sold for in addition to what he actually received from his alleged agent, Mr. Winslow, namely, the difference between about $11,000 and $7,500, or something near that. That the parties were tenants in common of this land, and that the plaintiff here was the owner of the undivided one fourth interest is not questioned; that there was a purchase money mortgage on the premises; that there were deferred payments (which were afterwards paid); that the plaintiff’s interest in this land was incumbered by judgment liens and that it was agreed that in order to divest those liens a judicial sale of his interest in the lands was made. The sheriff’s deed was made to E. H. Wilson and was duly acknowledged; Wilson represented the Mahoning Bank, a lien creditor, and although the property was knocked down for about the sum of $3,000 the sum of $7,000 was applied on the indebtedness of record against the plaintiff in favor of the Mahoning Bank, and the further sum of $500 was paid to him individually.</p>

That writing was simply a power of attorney authorizing Winslow to sell the plaintiff’s interest in that land, and that was about all that amounted to. The second writing was dated Jan. 24, 1880. It reads as follows: ‘Whereas, R. C. Winslow is negotiating with Eastern parties for the sale of the 1112 acre tract of land in McCalmont township, known as the Winslow and Hastings land, in which I have an undivided one fourth interest largely incumbered with judgment-s, therefore I hereby agree with the said R. C. Winslow as follows: For the purpose of enabling him to make a good title for said land I authorize him to sell my interest in the same at sheriff’s sale and to purchase the same in his own name at a sum not exceeding say three thousand dollars. After which I promise to make him a quitclaim deed for any remaining interest that I might have, upon the following terms and consideration : The said R. C. Winslow agrees to pay for the same, as soon as the said sale is made and deed received, the sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars, as follows : One third in hand (providing that amount is not consumed in purchasing the land at sheriff’s sale) and balance in two equal annual payments from date of deed, with interest on both payments for one year, by assignment of so much of the mortgage taken from the purchasers as will pay said George Kramer the balance of the seven thousand five hundred dollars.

Second: Did he sell the interest while acting as such agent, and did he account and pay over to the plaintiff all that he should have done? It was the duty of Winslow to keep Kramer advised of all the material facts, or inform him if he knew who the purchasers were and the amount of purchase money he was receiving. Did he do so ? The plaintiff says he did not, and that there was no arrangement or agreement by the terms of which Winslow was to retain anjr portion of the purchase money as compensation for his services, expenses, etc. [The defendant <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>asks you to find upon this question that prior to the execution of the power of attorney in December, 1879, all of the parties interested, including Kramer, knew that efforts were being made to sell the land, and that before the execution of the paper of January 24, 1880, it was understood and agreed that Winslow was to sell the land so that it should net the parties not less than $80,000, and that they were to be relieved from all charges and expenses, and that, any amount exceeding the $30,000 Winslow was to have in payment for his services and the expenses which he necessarily incurred in making that sale.] [3] That is narrowed down to a very simple issue, gentlemen.</p>
