It must be presumed, then, that he did not mean either of them.</p>

If he had said for such free library as ‘ is established ’ or ‘ has been established,’ then, if these claimants are free libraries, they might perhaps be in the position to take this legacy, but the testator evidently contemplated a new institution, something to be established, and this bequest was intended as the nucleus of a fund for that purpose. The same bequest was contained in a previous will executed by him in which he used exactly the same language with reference to this legacy, excepting that he added the word ‘hereafter,’ making the sentence read, ‘ Such'free library as may be hereafter established.’ The intention of the testator in this respect was made clearer still by the evidence offered. For while, as a rule, every will must be interpreted from what appears in the four corners of it, yet where there is an alleged ambiguity as to the person who is to take, evidence , may be admitted to ascertain whom the testator meant. The evidence in this case shows that the testator had been interested in the subject of a free library in Philadelphia for some time previous to his death ; he wanted something entirely different from any library then in existence, something that would be free to all. He had in his lifetime, in connection with other gentlemen, subscribed a considerable sum of money for the establishment of such an institution, but the scheme then failed, and he had expressed the intention of leaving something in his will for this purpose in the hope that others would be thereby induced to subscribe, and a sufficient sum be thus raised.</p>

At the same time, by article Y. of the by-laws, ‘ Persons of both sexes may be admitted to the use of the library and reading room free, and may be allowed to take out books without charge upon the recommendation of any manager, or giving a guarantee for the safe return of the books loaned.’ It will thus be seen that this institution has a free library as a part of its system for the moral and intellectual improvement of young persons, but this free library is jnade such by a by-law which can be altered and changed or repealed entirely at any time by the board of managers. Besides, the free library is not the object of the organization, it is only an incident thereof, along with lectures, class instruction, or any other means of education that the managers may adopt; but the benefit intended to be conferred by them all is limited to ‘ young persons.’ This is not the kind of a free library the testator had in view. It was one that would be a library in the strict sense of that word and meet the wants of all, young and old, without restriction as to age or sex, and absolutely free.</p>

Besides, as the testator gave this institution a separate legacy of $10,000, it is not possible that he meant it as the legatee of the legacy now under consideration, or he would have said so.</p>

He, in the opinion of the auditing judge, meant it for a free library to be established. This disposes of the argument that the recipient of this legacy is not an established library in the sense of having a building, books, etc. And the question whether the sum given is sufficient for the purpose of establishing a library or not, does not enter into the consideration; that is the purpose for which it is to be applied. Even though the gift were indefinite, the charitable purpose of the donor would be carried into effect: 1 Jarman on Wills, 216; Magill v. Brown, Brightly’s E. 347.</p>

The same objection was made against the will of Mr. Girard, and if it had succeeded, the greatest charity that exists in the world to-day would be stricken down. The tendency of the courts of this state has been to sustain gifts of this kind. As was said by Judge Strong in Foreign Missionary Society’s Appeal, ‘ Legacies for a religious or charitable use ■ have always been pre-eminently favored in Pennsylvania: ’ 6 Casejr, 425. Certainly such a gift should not be wantonly set aside, but the as<a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>tuteness of the court exercised, if necessary, to maintain and uphold it4</p>

The objection to this bequest therefore is that it 'is too remote. The corporation or person who is to take this legacy had no existence at the death of the testator and might not have during a life or lives in being and twenty-one years afterwards. This is true; but there are exceptions to every rule, and one of the exceptions to this one is the case of a gift to a charity. In such cases the court will allow the fund to be transferred to a corporation not in existence at the time of the gift, if such corporation is constituted in a reasonable time afterwards. The cases where charitable gifts to nonexistent corporations or societies have been sustained are numerous: Gray on Perpetuities, page 369, and the numerous cases there cited.</p>

But this he has not done, and there is nothing in the will, or in the evidence, showing the slightest reference to a library alread3r in existence, at the date of the will. The true interpretation of the language employed by testator we think is that adopted by the auditing judge. And as shown by him, if testator intended to benefit a library already in existence, he would naturally bestow his gift, by the use of the expressions ‘ such free library already established’ or ‘now established’ or ‘is established’ or ‘has been established ’ or other synonyms. But such was not his meaning. On the contrary, he evidently contemplated the establishment of a free library in the future. And it is in effect as if he had said ‘ to the trustees of such free library as shall be hereafter established.’ It therefore seems so clear to us that further discussion is unnecessary.</p>

But upon this point we think the solution of the question is presented by the provisions of the act of May 9, 1889, Purdon, 2450, pi. 1, which seems to have been enacted to meet a case like the present, and, as shown by Sterketj, Justice, in the recent case of Hendrix’s Account, <a href="/pa/146/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="146 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="827912" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0285-01">146 Pa. 285</a>, should be construed ‘ to be auxiliary to and in aid of the purposes ’» of the former act upon the same subject, viz., the act of April 26, 1855, Purdon, 250, pi. 22.

Both involve the construction of the following bequest in the will of the late George Pepper, deceased: “ To the Trustees of such Free Library which may be established in the City of Philadelphia, east of the River Schuylkill, and south of Market Street, $150,000.”</p>
    <p id="b363-7" data-blocks='[["BL_363.14",363,[167,1396,1164,440]]]'>The executors have paid over this legacy to the trustees of the corporation, known as the “ Free Library of Philadelphia.” It is not pretended that this corporation is the owner of a library at the present time, but it was contended that its purpose is to establish a library Of the character contemplated by the testator and within the prescribed bounds. This payment has been sanctioned by the orphans’ court, and from its decree the respective appellant corporations have taken these appeals to this court.</p>
    <p id="b363-8" data-blocks='[["BL_363.15",363,[166,1855,1161,144]]]'>The ground of their contention, briefly stated, is that they come within the description contained in the will, and being libraries already established are entitled to the fund.</p>
    <p id="b363-9" data-blocks='[["BL_363.16",363,[165,2007,1162,348]]]'>If we concede that the payment of the fund in controversy to either of these corporations would have met the requirements of the will, it does not advance either of the appellants a single step in the way of getting this money, unless it first be shown that the Free Library of Philadelphia, to whom the legacy was awarded by the orphans’ court, does not come wifLin the description.</p>
    <p id="b363-10" data-blocks='[["BL_363.17",363,[207,2365,1115,44]],["BL_364.1",364,[272,372,1161,603]]]'>We quite agree with the learned judge of the orphans’ court <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>that the testator contemplated the creation of a new library in the future. He must have known, from the interest which he evidently took in the subject of libraries, all about the two corporations appellants, and if he had intended the fund to go to either of them he would have so declared in his will. As to one of them at least he left a pecuniary legacy of $10,000, which excludes the idea that he intended that it should also take the bequest aforesaid. We think the fair construction of the testator’s will to be that he intended this sum to aid in the formation of a new free library within the prescribed limits. The subject is so fully discussed by the learned court below that we need not pursue it further.</p>
