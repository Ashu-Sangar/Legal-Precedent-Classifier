By another contract plaintiff agreed to deliver to defendants an additional quantity of cream tartar, all to be taken within three months from date, and in three monthly installments. In each sale the price was f. o. b. Nothing was said about insurance in the contracts. Subsequent correspondence between the parties showed that it was understood that defendants were to designate the mode of carriage as well as the carrier. Defendants directed that the goods should be carried by water, and designated the vessel and the voyage. In their first order they direct<a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>ed plaintiff to insure, and this was done. In the second order nothing was said about insurance, and plaintiffs did not insure. In the third order they directed plaintiffs to insure, and this was done. In the fourth order they directed plaintiffs to insure, but plaintiffs neglected it for twenty-five days, and when they attempted to do so, found that they could not, because the vessel had gone ashore: <em>Eeld, </em>that plaintiffs could not recover from defendants the price of the goods. The course of dealing here shows that plaintiff was to insure whenever ordered by defendants and was iwt to insure unless ordered. This inference is not a custom of merchants reading into the contract a trade obligation, but the interpretation of the contract which the parties themselves, by their conduct, put upon it.</p>

Under the settled rule, that a delivery to the common carrier designated by the purchaser is a delivery to him, if nothing further appeared, the plaintiff had a right to recover. But the defendants deny plaintiff’s right to judgment, alleging that the fair construction of the contracts was, that plaintiff was to deliver the goods on board the vessel as ordered, and as the order of December 4,1889, under which this shipment was made, also directed insurance, which plaintiff did not effect, and did not notify defendants of a refusal to insure, therefore there was no delivery under the contract.</p>

But he holds that, as to insurance, plaintiff was a mere mandatory without compensation, who wholly neglected to comply with the mandate; that in such case the rule of the common law is different from that of the civil law, and however meritorious may be the defence in morals, it is not sufficient in law, and judgment is accordingly entered for plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[254,830,1160,197]]]'>Undoubtedly, the rule of the common law is as stated; a distinction is drawn between the misfeasance and nonfeasance of a mere mandatory, one not owing the duty of performance, and with whom it is wholly gratuitous.</p>
    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[254,1035,1160,452]]]'>The distinction is, that if such an one undertakes to carry out the order, and does it so negligently that damage results, he is liable; if he do not undertake to carry it out at all, he is not liable. The reason is, that when the mandatory begins to act he gives undeniable evidence that he considers himself bound, and thus may induce the mandant to neglect acting for himself ’; but where he only promises to act, and does not act, there being no consideration, it is a mere nudum pactum, a promise without consideration, which imposes no legal liability.</p>
    <p id="b304-6" data-blocks='[["BL_304.6",304,[254,1494,1161,605]]]'>So far as concerns the distinction, the rule is not always satisfactory, obviously, because, if the reason on which it is founded be made the test of its application, it Avill reach many cases of nonfeasance as well as all cases of misfeasance. The reason for the rule consists wholly of a moral obligation ; that is, he who has misled another to his hurt should make good the loss. Seemingly, therefore, wherever, from the facts, the obligation exists, the mandatory should be held liable; but the common law stops short of this, and declares, the reason for the rule being present in all eases of misfeasance, the rule, shall apply, but not being present in all cases of nonfeasance, it shall not apply to any.</p>

Hence, apparently contradictory decisions of courts, and difference of opinion betAveen such eminent law writers as Sir William Jones and Judge Hare. The first, in <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>his Law of Bailments, says that anyone might refuse to accept a commission, but if he agreed to execute it it must be fulfilled, or the person who gave it notified in time to enable him to look for another agent. Judge Harb, in his work oh Contracts, thinks this doctrine is wholly one of the civil law, and has no authority for it in the common law. He adopts to the full extent the rule of the common law as laid down by Chancellor Kent in Thorne v. Deas, <a href="/johns/4/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="4 Johns. 84" data-case-ids="2001825" data-case-paths="/johns/4/0084-01">4 Johns. 84</a>, the case cited and relied on by the appellee here. In that case Thorne and another, plaintiffs, owned one half a brig; Deas, the defendant, owned the other half. On the day the vessel sailed from New York for West Indies, Thorne, who was going on board, asked Deas to insure her. Deas promised he would do so at once, but did not do so. Ten days afterwards the other owner, on discovering it, said to Deas if he did not at once take out a policy he would do so himself. Deas told him to make himself easy, that he would insure the vessel that very day. He did not do so, and the vessel was lost. Thorne and his co-owner of the one moiety, brought suit against Deas to recover damages for his neglect. Chancellor Kent, in deciding the case, held that Deas’s neglect was only a case of nonfeasance; that what he promised to do was purely voluntary and gratuitous, and there could be no recovery, and says : “ There is, then, no just reason to infer from the ancient authorities that such a promise as the one before us is good without showing a consideration.” Thorne v. Deas, since the judgment rendered in it, has been cited as ruling this class of cases ; it has come down to us with all the weight of authority attached to the name of the eminent lawyer who promulgated it.</p>

We are not inclined to dispute it, for, while it majr not wholly commend itself to approval, nevertheless, that stability of the law, which comes from adherence to a settled rule, ought not to be shaken, merely because either conscience or reason, quickened by the hardship of a particular case, suggests a departure. The only question here then is, does Thorne v. Deas rule this case ? The learned judge of the court below thought it did; we are of a different opinion. It is conceded, in that case, as well as in the <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>ancient authorities on which it is grounded, that even at common law a merchant was bound to insure for his correspondent, if, from the course of dealing between them, the one has been used to send orders for insurance and the other to obey them. Assume, that this is a case not strictly within the law merchant, and that there is no custom of merchants affecting the rights and liabilities of the parties ; that it is a case growing out of a contract between the vendor of goods in New York and the purchaser of goods in Philadelphia, and that their rights and liabilities are to be determined wholly by their contract. Then, the case turns on a reasonable interpretation of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.4",306,[269,932,1160,1461]],["BL_307.1",307,[184,382,1161,143]]]'>The first contract, January 11, 1889, was for 20 casks of cream tartar, deliverable as wanted within six months- from date. The second contract, July 15, 1889, was for 10 casks, deliverable during balance of year as wanted. The third contract, November 1, 1889, was for 6000 pounds, all to be taken within three months from date and in three monthly installments. In each sale the price was f. o. b., that is, free on board, a trade term as fixed in its signification as the C. O. D., with which most persons are familiar. The first two contracts expressly provide that deliveries are to be made as wanted by the purchasers. The third one stipulates the 6000 pounds are to be taken within three months in three monthly installments of equal size; this, of course, was 2000 pounds monthly, but date of shipment within each month to be designated by purchaser. From the extreme brevity of these contracts, certain things not in them yet within the contemplation of the parties, necessarily, were to form the subject of future decision. The mode of shipment, whether by water or railroad, was not named; nothing was said about insurance, if by water. The subsequent correspondence shows, it was understood the purchasers were to designate the mode of carriage as well as the earner. Do the contracts themselves and the subsequent conduct of the parties warrant the inference that the consignor was bound to insure the shipment of the 28th of December, not received because of foundering of vessel ? The court below says: “ The two occasions upon which the plaintiff complied with the request of the defendants to have the goods insured, taken in connection with the two occasions in which they were sent without insurance, are insufficient to establish such a course of <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>dealing between the parties as would make it obligatory upon the plaintiff to provide for having the goods insured.” To our minds the inference from all the facts is the other way.</p>
    <p id="b307-3" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[184,534,1164,903]]]'>The point of shipment was New York; the defendants under the contract designated not only the quantity of goods shipped from time to time, but also that they were to be carried by water, by what vessel and the voyage. The course of dealing between the parties warrants, undeni ably,‘that plaintiff was bound to do just what it did do in these particulars. As to course of dealing with reference to insurance, in order for shipment July 18th, they say, “ insure,” and plaintiff did insure. In order of August 17th, they say nothing about insurance, and plaintiffs did not insure. In order of November 12th, they say “ insure,” and plaintiff did insure. Then comes the order of December 5th, saying “ insure,” and plaintiff in twenty days thereafter made the shipment, but did not insure, and did not notify defendants that they would not do so, but did notify them of an ineffectual attempt to obey the order when too late. The course of dealing here shows that plaintiff was to insure whenever ordered by defendants, and was not to insure unless ordered.</p>
    <p id="b307-4" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[187,1454,1162,556]]]'>This inference is not a custom of merchants reading into a contract a trade obligation, but the interpretation of -this contract, which the parties themselves by their conduct put upon it. The very fact that plaintiff did not insure the order of the 17th of August, instead of showing the absence of obligation on the order in dispute, shows the reverse; for that order did not direct insurance, therefore none was taken; if plaintiff had disregarded either the order of July 18th, to insure, or that of November 12th, to same effect, that would have been a fact of some significance, as tending to show, effecting insurance was wholly gratuitous-on its part.</p>

In plaintiff’s telegram of the 80th of December, they say the agents declined to insure because “ vessel ashore. Please see what you can do at your end.” It is somewhat difficult to understand just what plaintiff expected in way of honest insurance at this “ end, ” with the vessel ashore at that “ end.” The defendants, too, in their reply do not seem to have thought it incapable of accomplish<a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>ment because of the fact that the vessel was already wrecked, but because it was known to be ; for they say as it “ was published in our papers this morning, it was too late for us to do anything here.” But whatever reflections this correspondence may cause as to the course of dealing between merchants and underwriters, it shows that, up to the wreck of the vessel, plaintiff acted as if bound to insure according to the order.</p>
    <p id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.4",308,[262,742,1163,704]]]'>Thorne v. Deas did not turn upon the interpretation of a contract between the vendor and purchaser of goods to be shipped as “ wanted.” It was the promise of one owner of part of a vessel to his co-owners to have her insured; and it was held there could be no recovery because the promise was wholly without consideration. Here, insurance when ordered, under the interpretation put by the parties upon their contract, was as binding as any other part of it, and there is an adequate consideration. Frauenthal v. Derr, 13 W. N. 485, also cited by appellee, was between a property owner and a fire insurance agent; it was a simple neglected promise on part of agent to renew insurance for the house owner; there was no consideration. On the undisputed facts it was declared to be only a ease of nonfeasance and that there could be no recovery.</p>
    <p id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[260,1454,1162,450]]]'>Counsel for appellant “ merely ask that defendants be not made to pay for that which they never received.” We decide, they ought not to pay the $2,762.17, value of goods shipped December 28, 1889, on board the “ Commonwealth.” But there is due plaintiff from defendants a balance of $509.81 for goods sold and delivered in January, 1890. For this they ought to recover. Therefore the judgment of the court below is reversed, and it is ordered that judgment for plaintiff for sum of $509.81, with interest from January 20, 1890, be entered.</p>
