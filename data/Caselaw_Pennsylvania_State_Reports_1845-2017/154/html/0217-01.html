    <p class="summary" id="b242-14" data-blocks='[["BL_242.14",242,[260,1887,1160,501]],["BL_243.1",243,[192,372,1159,298]]]'>“ This controversy comes before us on an appeal from the decision of the register admitting to probate as the last will and testament of the decedent a certain paper writing of which the following is a copy: ‘Pen Argyl, August 14, 1887. High James Rogers do give to John Jackson Sr. my property known as the Pen argyl Hotel and the land ajoining in Pen argyl Northampton Co. P. A. (Signed) James Rogers.’ We are now asked to direct a precept for an issue to the common pleas to try two questions, first, whether at the time said paper was executed by the decedent he was of a sound and disposing <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>mind, and, second, whether said paper is the last will of the decedent. As to the first question we think the evidence is not up to the required standard to entitle the appellant to an issue. <em>We </em>so hold on the authority of Keating’s Appeal, <a href="/monaghan/2/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Monag. 4" data-case-ids="257894" data-case-paths="/monaghan/2/0004-01">2 Mona. 4</a>, a case in many of its features wonderfully like the present.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b243-5" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[184,677,1167,1115]]]'>“ Whether or not the probated paper is the last will of the decedent is a more serious question. On its face it certainly presents none of the characteristics of a will. ‘ It is true that no formal words are necessary in order to make a valid will; the form of the instrument is immaterial if its substance is testamentary:’ Patterson v. English, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20Pa.%20458" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="71 Pa. 458">71 Pa. 458</a>. But here the substance is not testamentary. ‘ A gift or bequest after death is of the very essence of a will, and determines a writing, whatever its form, to be testamentary: ’ lb. Here we have no gift or bequest after death, but a present gift. It is claimed by the appellee, however, that the surrounding circumstances show that the gift was not to take effect until after the death of the decedent. We are by no means clear that the paper can be helped in this way, but, conceding that it may be, the inference from these surrounding circumstances, although the facts may be undisputed, must unquestionably be drawn by a jury. In questions of negligence certain facts when established amount to negligence per se, that is, where the precise duty is determinate and the same under all circumstances, and in such cases the court must determine the question; but intent is always a question for the jury, except where it is to be gathered from the terms of an unambiguous writing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[180,1800,1162,399]]]'>“ In Patterson v. English, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20Pa.%20458" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="71 Pa. 458">supra,</a> an issue was granted to try the question whether a paper, not testamentary on its face, was a last will and testament; so in Murry v.

We think it best to follow these precedents, although when the time comes it may be the duty of the court to direct the verdict, on the theory that the question whether the writing in controversy is the last will of the decedent must be decided on the contents of the writing alone.</p>

It appears from the petition and answer that James Rogers, a resident and property owner in Pen Argyl, Northampton county, committed suicide in his own house on the sixth day. of September, 1887. At the time his body was discovered an envelope was found in the same room directed to John Jackson, Sr. Inclosed in this envelope was a paper in the handwriting of Rogers which was presented by Mr. Jackson to the register for probate as the will of the decedent. Letters of administration cum testamento annexo were issued to Richard Jackson, who proceeded to settle the estate and file his administration account. John Jackson claimed to be the owner of the property of which Rogers died seized, as the sole devisee named in the paper' which had been probated. A little less than five-years after the death of Rogers, one John Tozer came from his home in England to Northampton county and appealed from the decree of probate. He presented his petition in the orphans’ court, in which he alleged that the true name of James Rogers was James Tozer; that he came from England some years before, leaving his fami- ^ ly behind him; that the petitioner was a son and heir of James <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>Tozer, known in Pen Argyl as James Rogers; that the paper under which John Jackson claimed was not the will of his father, as its execution had been procured by undug and improper influence; and asked that an issue devisavit vel non be directed to determine the validity of the alleged will. Jackson replied in an answer denying the facts set out in the petition, and putting them fairly in issue. He then asked the court to direct an issue to determine the question so raised, ’viz.: the identity of James Rogers with James Tozer, and the relationship of the petitioner to the deceased. The learned judge refused to direct this issue but at once directed the issue devisavit vel non. This is the ground of the present appeal. We have no doubt that the proper practice requires an issue to determine the relationship or interest of the proposed contestant, in the first instance, where the relationship or interest is denied, and where as in this case the prima facies are- against the petitioner. If John Tozer was the legitimate son and heir of James Rogers he had a right to be heard on the validity of the paper that had been admitted to probate, and operated to disinherit him. If he was not, then he had no standing, and his petition for an issue should have been dismissed as an impertinent attempt to interfere in what was no concern of his. It was proper therefore for Jackson to insist upon a determination of this question in limine. Both issues might have been directed, but that which was to determine the contestant’s right to be heard should have been tried first, and if the result was adverse to the contestant the other should have been dismissed. This question was determined in Cullen’s Estate, 12 W. N. 34, affirmed by this court in Taylor v. The Commonwealth, 13 W. N. 378.</p>

It is before us. After an examination of it we are persuaded that it sustains the allegations made in the petition and. would justify if not require a jury to find in favor of the contestant’s right to be heard as the son and heir at law of the decedent, known in Pen Argyl as James Rogers. It would tend therefore to protract litigation for no useful purpose, if we should reverse the learned judge for his refusal to award the issue asked for by the appellant. We have often held that we would not reverse for an error which did no real <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>harm to the party complaining. We recognize however the rule contended for by the appellant as the correct one, and have no doubt that he was entitled to the preliminary issue he asked for. The reason why we do not reverse is that which wé have already stated. It would be of no service to the appellant in view of the evidence before us, and would involve delay and expense to the parties to no real purpose.</p>
