The widow took out letters of administration; Charles Folk, her brother, was appointed guardian of all the children.</p>
    <p id="b313-6" data-blocks='[["BL_313.7",313,[189,774,1160,338]]]'>The intestate’s personal estate, principally farm stock, was valued at $1,072.54. He owned the farm of sixty acres on which he lived; this was worth at the date of his death about $14,000. He owned no other property. His debts were about $14,000, so that if all his property had at once been turned into money for purpose of paying the debts, the estate was but little more than solvent.</p>
    <p id="b313-7" data-blocks='[["BL_313.8",313,[189,1129,1159,450]]]'>But the land contained iron ore, and just before his death Merkel had executed a lease to one Zeigler to mine it at a royalty ; it appeared, then, that this contract, if carried out, would probably yield a very considerable income, and if the creditors did not press for immediate payment the farm might be saved, and remain as a home for the widow and minor children. The guardian, Mr. Folk, at once proceeded to placate importunate creditors, and succeeded in persuading most of them to suspend demand for immediate payment.</p>
    <p id="b313-8" data-blocks='[["BL_313.9",313,[188,1587,1168,400]]]'>It was then agreed between him and the administratrix, under the advice of reputable counsel, that she should remain in the occupancy of the farm, and rear the family until the youngest attained majority. In the meantime the income of the farm, both from crops and ore royalties, not necessary to the maintenance of the family, was to be applied to the payment of debts, with the hope that the farm itself would eventually be altogether freed from debts.</p>

The money received by the administratrix from ore royalties and farm products during this period amounted to $19,117.40. As no exceptions were filed to the account in this particular, and as the court below has found this was the amount received, it must be taken as true, that this was every dollar that came into her hands. She honestly charged herself with all the money received from farm products and ore royalties during this seventeen years, and with all she ought to have received.</p>

The accountant was appointed trustee to sell, and thus received the purchase money, which, in addition to the crops and royalties, made altogether money received $26,239.40. This pays all the debts, but nothing is left. The administratrix filed four accounts ; the first, October 23, 1877 ; in this the balance due the accountant is $6,889.59. It is made up of two items, $1,360 advanced bj’herself to pay debts of her husband, and $5,479.59 advanced by Charles Folk, the guardian, for the same purpose. The accountant advanced the $1,360 in this way: Her father, Daniel Folk, was one of the largest creditors of her husband, there being due to him over $4,000 ; before filing the account he had died, and she, as a distributee of his estate, was entitled to $1,360. This she permitted to be credited as a payment on the debt due from her husband. Charles Folk, the guardian, had advanced money of his own to pay creditors who could not longer wait, to the amount of $5,479.59. This account was confirmed absolutely, no exceptions being filed to it.</p>

In this she charges herself with rents and royalties received since filing her third account, $4,465.37, and the amount of purchase money on real estate, $7,122; altogether $11,587.37; then she takes credit for a number of small payments, and also for balance including interest due her on the third account, $7,984.13. To this account the administratrix of Harvey Merkel, one of the sons, who had also died since the previous account, filed exceptions in which she was joined by the administratrix of Peter Merkel. The exceptants objected to all credits claimed by accountant for payments of debts out of rents and royalties of the land, alleging that these belonged to the heirs ; and further objected to the credit taken by accountant for balance of $7,984.13 on third account; and especially objected to accountant applying any portion of the proceeds of sale of the real estate to the payment of debts of decedent, which had long before lost their lien upon his lands.</p>

It was the right of the creditors to insist that it be sold to satisfy their claims; if it had been sold, the guardian' would have been entitled to any surplus over and above the debts; this it would have been his duty to expend in their maintenance and education. But he in his discretion adopts another course; by an arrangement with the administratrix, their mother, he provides a home for them on the farm, where they shall be under the same roof in one family, clothed, fed, and taught, until the .youngest has attained majority. To accomplish this purpose, he advances from time to time out of his own pocket over $5,000 to creditors. The representatives of two of these wards object to repaying him out of this fund; they do not deny the guardian paid the debts of the father, but they argue that such payment at best gave him <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>only a right of subrogation to the creditor’s claim, and this at the expiration of five years ceased to be a lien on the land, and therefore cannot come in on this fund.</p>

This is, in substance, just what the guardian did do; or, to state it differently, if in 1872 he had gone into the orphans’ court with a petition, setting out the facts just as it now is established they existed then: the desirability of preserving the farm as a home for his wards under the care of the mother during minority; the imperative necessity of advancing money to pay pressing debts; his willingness to advance and take on himself the risk of the venture, that court would, without doubt, have made a cautionary order authorizing him to do just as he has done. Such an order would not have prevented the wards from investigating his accounts, but it would have precluded them from questioning the nature of the transaction; would have fixed any payments made by the guardian to their father’s creditors as payments for the wards. What the court could have authorized, it can subsequently ratify. The only question is, was the money honestly advanced by the guardian for the purpose of rearing his wards ? If so, it was their debt and not their father’s.</p>

He says: “ On the 30th of January, 1873, I paid the biggest portion of the small debts, there being of course a good many large ones among them. I used the money of the estate, royalties and products, and my qwn money. All the money that I could spare of my own arid from the proceeds of sales of royalties and products, I used to pay the debts, and charged myself with every dollar that I ever received. Not one dollar do I have in my possession that .1 am not charged with in the accounts that are filed. In the meantime the family was supported out of the income of the farm and royalty, and what was not there I bought.

State a suggestion from the same facts in another form, and it sounds certainly as plausible: By some mysterious management, a widow with five minor children was able to maintain herself and them during minority for seventeen years on a little farm yielding less than $1,200 a year, and besides pay off, including interest, debts of her husband of over $9,000.</p>

Such a fact would have warranted the imposition of a fine upon this guardian of $5,479.59. But there is no evidence of any such fact. True, the gross receipts in seventeen years were $5,000 more than the $14,000 of debts existing at John Merkel’s death. The observation, however, of those who administer estates so nearly .insolvent as this one, is, that interest and expenses rapidly accumulate. If the final winding up be delayed that debts may be paid out of income, necessarily, the amount paid will largely exceed the amount at death of the debtor. Simple interest on this $14,000 would have nearly doubled it in sixteen years; if the debts remained unpaid for an average period of onty five years, they would have increased to over $18,000. There was paid on Hettie Merkel’s claim alone $1,293.28 of interest, much of it accruing after death of her brother. If to the interest charges, certain as doom, there be added the expenses incident to management and administration, maintenance of the family during minority of the children, taxes and repairs, the inference is, that without capable, vigilant management the end in view at the start, payment of all decedent’s debts and rearing of his children, would never have been accomplished.</p>
