After <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>making this clear distribution of his property, and after formally executing his will, the testator added the following additional paragraph to it: “ In order to prevent any strife or contention and make more definite the division of my property on the demise of my widow, the aforesaid Louisa, it is my desire and I do hereby bequeath the whole of the estate to the said Daniel Seitz, and George Seitz (both real and personal) and each to have and possess one half, and said Daniel Seitz’s share to be equally divided among his, the said Daniel’s children, and the other or George Seitz’s share, to be equally divided between them, his, the said George’s children.</p>

He has himself created the “ strife or contention ” which, by this codicil, he sought to prevent. The only rational ground upon which we can account for his action in making the codicil was the fear on his part that after the death of Daniel and George the property might go to their heirs per capita instead of per stirpes. He therefore provides that Daniel’s share should go to Daniel’s children, and that the share' of George shall go to the children of George. There is nothing in the codicil which shows that he intended to cut down the fee, before given to his sons, to a life estate. When he desired to give a life estate, he knew how to do so in appropriate language, as the devise to his wife clearly shows.</p>
