Lockhart in the sixth clause of the will, are synonymous with the word issue ; that the limitation over was upon an indefinite failure of issue, and therefore bad; that the legacy vested absolutely in her and should be distributed to her administrator. The words used are the equivalent of issue, and no doubt in construing the will the word issue should be substituted for them.</p>

In the latter case the testator gave to his grandson, Albert, an equal share of his estate, real and personal, with the testator’s children, and <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>provided, ‘ But if said Albert should die before he has any heirs, then his share shall revert back among my other heirs.’ Albert survived the testator, but died intestate, unmarried and without issue, leaving his father to survive him.

In Snyder’s Appeal, supra, the bequest was to H, and if he should 6 at any time die without issue, I then give and bequeath ’ over to all testator’s children, and it was held that a definite failure was intended and that the bequest over was good.</p>

In those cases the devises and bequests were absolute, followed by an attempt to create coverture trusts and to set-aside the statutory order of descent, without.providing a different order; and it was held that the devises and bequests were vested and absolute. Whilst here, by the eighth clause of the will following the bequests and devises to his daughter, testator-makes them contingent, sets aside the statutory order of descent and provides a different order by directing that if either or both of his daughters should die before their respective husbands, the property given to them should at once descend to and be vested in their children. The bequests to testator’s daughters seem to be contingent upon their surviving their husbands.

As such they are subject to the jurisdiction and supervision of this court, and could be removed for any breach of duty. Having given them custody as trustees of the proceeds of the sales of realty without requiring security, it is to be presumed that he intended them also to have in the same capacity and without security the custody of the personalty.

Lockhart, his deceased wife, from the decree of the orphans’ court, distributing a fund in the hands of James T. Gormley, executor of the last will and testament of James Gormley, deceased. In No. 250, Oct T., 1892, he appeals as administrator of Mary E. Lockhart, his deceased daughter, from the same decree.</p>

The only error specified is, that the court below made distribution to Mrs. Anna B. Wettengell, subject to the trusts and limitations contained in the eighth clause of the will, without requiring security.</p>

He appears to have been under the impression that the decree of the orphans’ court was no protection. In this we think he was mistaken: See Stewart’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/86/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="86 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="1056624" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0149-01">86 Pa. 149</a>, and Charlton’s Appeal, 88 Id. 476.
