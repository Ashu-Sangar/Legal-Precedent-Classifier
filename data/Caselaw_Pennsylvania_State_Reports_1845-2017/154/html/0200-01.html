I.) 487, that since the express terms of the procedure act of May 25, 1887, require the defendant to reply by affidavit to the plaintiff’s statement, all averments therein not denied by the affidavit must, upon a rule for judgment, be taken as admitted. The statement avers that the assessment was ‘ duly ’ made, i. e., properly, fitly, regularly, in a suitable or becoming manner: Beale v. Com., <a href="/pa/25/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="25 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="975775" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0011-01">25 Pa. 11</a>, 21; according to law: Gibson v. People, 5 Hun (N. Y.), 543; in compliance with the requirements of the law: Dunning v. Coleman, 27 La. An. 48. There being in the affidavit no denial of this averment, it must be taken as admitted. If, however, the assessment, at the time when it <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>was made, was lawful, then the fact that the company does not require the assessment sought to be collected in this suit can be no defence; for the liability of the defendant was complete at the time of the making of the assessment, and he cannot, in equity and fairness towards his fellows, be permitted to evade it now.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[285,697,1160,898]]]'>“ But assuming that the affidavit is to be understood as declaring that, at the date of the assessment it was greater than what was required by the company for the payment of the losses and necessary expenses, it is still in no better case. As a member of the company the defendant has submitted himself to the acts of the managers, as his representatives, in making assessments to meet losses, etc.: Hummel’s Ap., <a href="/pa/78/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="78 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1040391" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0320-01">78 Pa. 320</a>, 325.

The presumption is in favor of the propriety of the assessment: Hummel’s Ap., ubi supra. Liability upon it can be avoided only by showing fraud or gross mistake: Rosenberger v. Ins. Co., supra, page 212; and it can only be where something is shown to ground an inference of the one or the other that the burden of proving the contrary can be imposed upon the company: Co. v.

There is neither an inference of fraud or of mistake; nothing but a naked allegation of excess, which is not even stated to be gross, much less shown by a specification of amounts from which the court might judge as to its reasonableness. The condition of the company six or seven months later, when presumably a large part of the liabilities that called for this assessment had been paid off, and other insurance not bound to contribute towards them had been written, throws no light upon this' question. Nor is it ah answer to say it would be difficult to specify with exactness. If such were required, it is to be remembered that defendant is a member of the company, with right of access to its books. There is no pretence that this was denied him, therefore the contrary, is to be assumed: Kaufman v. Iron M.
