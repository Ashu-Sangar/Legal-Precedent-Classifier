    <p class="summary" id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[270,645,1159,451]]]'>“ Freight is the price to be paid for the actual transportation of goods by sea from one place to another. The delivery of the goods at the place of destination, according to the charter party, is a condition precedent to entitle the owner to freight; hence if any accident befalls the ship, so that the goods are never delivered, no freight is demandable. This has been from the remotest times the maritime law of the world. ‘ Most certain it is,’ says Molloy, in his treatise De Jure Maratimo, ‘if a ship be cast away the freight vanishes.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b268-5" data-blocks='[["BL_268.5",268,[270,1104,1161,348]]]'>“ If, therefore, this were an action by the owners of the ‘ Moro Castle ’ for the recovery of the freight, nothing can be plainer than that the action could not <em>succeed; </em>for the ship having been cast away in the Delaware Breakwater at the very outset of her voyage, and the cargo never having been delivered at Mare Island, her port of destination, the owners could have no claim for freight.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b268-6" data-blocks='[["BL_268.6",268,[269,1459,1162,960]],["BL_269.1",269,[204,376,1163,2032]],["BL_270.1",270,[251,386,1157,246]]]'>“ But this is not a suit by the owners for the freight, but an action by the ship brokers, Hager <em>&amp; </em>Co., for their commissions —the reward to which they are entitled for their services as ship brokers in procuring for the defendants the contract of affreightment of the lost vessel. These services were rendered to the defendants at their request by the plaintiffs, who were not owners, and had no interest in the vessel, but as ship brokers they obtained from the vessel-owners the required space wanted by the defendants for their cargo, and the defendants knew perfectly well when they agreed to pay the brokers for the same at the rate of twelve dollars per ton that they would be subsequently called upon to sign a charter party with the owners, and that the difference between the price per ton put into the charter party for the owners and that put into the agreement with the brokers would represent the commissions of the latter, viz., fifty cents per ton. That was what was sued for in this case, fifty cents per ton on sis hundred and ten tons, making $305. However inartificially stated, that was what the controversy was about, and the defendants ought not to be permitted <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>to escape from their just obligation to the plaintiffs by any lack of precision in the statement after the merits have been tried, and the defendants have demonstrated, by their neglect to call any witnesses, that they have no defense to the plaintiff’s claim. The form of the contract matters little when its purpose, its essence, and its consideration are so apparent. The character of the plaintiffs’ claim for commissions as ship brokers in procuring the charter party for the defendants from the owners of the ‘ Moro Castle,’ is not, perhaps, as clearly set forth in the statement of their claim filed by the plaintiffs as it might have been. Nevertheless, that was the true character of the claim presented by the plaintiffs’ evidence and tried by the jury; and the verdict, after a fair trial, ought not now to be interfered with because of any technical want of accuracy in the manner of stating the claim. The plaintiffs, in their statement, set forth the facts of the case, and claimed the difference between the sum agreed upon for freight between the freighter and the plaintiffs and the sum agreed upon in the charter party between the freighter and the owners, viz., fifty cents per ton. The plaintiffs, not being owners, could not have sued for the freight, even if it had been earned by the delivery of the goods —that is, the eleven dollars and fifty cents per ton which the defendants in their charter party had agreed to pay the owners. What they sued for was the difference between what the defendants agreed to pay the vessel-owners in the charter party and what the defendants had agreed to pay them, the plaintiffs. The difference represented their commissions as ship brokers. It would have been more accurate if they had specifically claimed this difference as their commissions for having effected the charter party for the defendants, but it must have been well known to the defendants that the plaintiffs were ship brokers, and that their claim of fifty cents per ton represented really their commissions as ship brokers, and nothing else. Mr. Thompson, one of the plaintiffs, testified distinctly that he talked over the matter with the defendants, and that it was perfectly well understood that the fifty cents per ton which the plaintiffs were to receive represented their brokerage, and that the defendants had agreed to pay it, and this testimony was uncontradicted, the defendants offering no testimony whatever. Now, although any claim for freight on the part of the owners <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>was clearly lost by the loss of the ship, no such consequence attached to the claim of the plaintiffs for their just commissions. That was a claim for compensation for a personal service rendered to the defendants by the plaintiffs, which it cannot be pretended was in any way affected by the loss of the ship.</p>
