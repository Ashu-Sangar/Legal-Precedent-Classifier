The person searching the record would find the name of J. H. Harden, one of the original defendants, entered on the judgment docket, and John Harden not one of the original defendants entered immediately following, same number and term and same nature of case, viz.: am. sci. fa. A reference back to the. appearance docket would furnish all the facts necessary to give actual notice to the continuance of the lien. John Harden’s deed was recorded, whereby notice was given that he was in fact a terre tenant of the land bound by the lien of the judgment.] [1] [An amicable action of revival had been entered which in its caption designated him as terre tenant and he had signed said am. sci. fa. True he had not added ‘ terre tenant ’ or 4 T. T. ’ after his name, but he was in fact a terre tenant and the record of his deed, as well as the designation in the caption of the am. sci. fa. and the caption also of the appearance docket entry disclosed this fact. The judgment docket entries are for notice but they are.not the only means of acquiring notice.] [2] All the facts relating to a judgment are not and as a matter of necessity cannot be disclosed by the judgment docket. Releases, assignments, partial payments, rules and motions pending to open, strike off or satisfy judgment are not noted on the judgment docket. The entry on the judgment docket points to the appearance docket, where is found the formal entry of the judgment, with all the conditions or limitations as to the time of payment, stay of execution, etc., and all subsequent proceedings. [It seems to the <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>auditor idle to say that parties interested as purchasers, mortgagors or subsequent incumbrancers are to look to the judgment docket alone for all facts that may pertain to the judgment and stand arbitrarily on what that docket discloses.] [3] A judgment for $10,000, as shown by the judgment docket, may be all paid but $10.00 as shown by the appearance docket, and so with other facts relating or that might relate to any given case. [Surely the entry of the judgment No. 249, Sept. T., 1886, on the judgment docket against John Harden as well as against S. B. Harden and J. H. Harden, was constructive notice to all lien creditors of the existence of this judgment and its revival against John Harden, who in fact was a ‘ terte tenant.’ It seems to the auditor that this view is borne out by the decision in Mellon’s Ap., <a href="/pa/96/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="96 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="494615" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0475-01">96 Pa. 475</a>.] [4] [When John Holmes entered judgment No. 40, Feb. T., 1885, the judgment of C. E. White, No. 326 Sept T., 1881, against S. B. Harden and J. H. Harden appeared properly upon the records ; before any other judgments were entered against John Harden, this judgment appears properly revived against them, with John Harden’s name added as a defendant therein, and was indexed in the judgment docket and noted at the entries of the original judgment. The judgment was therefore revived within five years ‘ by agreement of the parties and terre tenant filed in writing and entered on the proper docket ’ as provided for by act of March 26,1827, Purdon’s Digest, 946, section 5.] [5] [If now it can be maintained that there was an omission of a material nature in the revival of Mr. White’s judgment, Mr. Holmes and other junior lien creditors may gain something, not by their diligence, but by the failure of John Harden to write ‘ terre tenant’ or ‘ T. T.’ after his name and to have the same so noted on the judgment docket. Until some imperative mandate of the law is disclosed commanding this to be done, the auditor would be unwilling to decree that Mr. White must lose his debt or any portion of it.] [6]</p>

Harden was preserved by the revival as against them and John Harden, terre tenant. The amicable scire facias described exactly the names of the parties, the term and number of the case, and the date and amount of the judgment as revived, and this is all that is required by the act. The entry on the judgment docket sets out the names of all three of the defendants, one following the other and all being defendants in the same judgment, No. 249, Sept. T., 1886, the same date of entry and the same amount for each, together with the fact that the proceeding was an am. sci. fa.</p>

By referring to the amicable sci. fa. upon which the judgment was revived, it appears that John Harden is there described as “terre tenant” in the captiop of the case which names the parties, and the amicable sci. fa., with confession of judgment contained therein, is signed and sealed by the plaintiff, by both of the original defendants and by John Harden. The necessary legal meaning of all this is that John Harden confesses judgment for $526.15, <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>in favor of C.
