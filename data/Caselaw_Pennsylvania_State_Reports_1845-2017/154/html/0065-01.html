Immediately after the gift was a reference to the property devised to the grandsons in the second clause. Following this reference was the following: “ I hereby forbid that the property shall be sold out of the family, but leaving them to dispose of their respective parts by will. In case of the death of either one of them intestate without direct heirs, I direct that such intestate part shall be held by his sister.

Hall, the testator, owning real and personal estate, gave it by will to his son and to the heirs of his body, and if he should die leaving no heirs, then he gave so much of the real and personal estate as his son should be possessed of at his death to the Goldsmith’s Company at London for charitable purposes. A limitation over for such a purpose had strong claims upon the protection of a court of chancery; and I hope that I may be excused for making, as a passing remark, that the will awakens interesting associations from another circumstance,' which is, that Sir Isaac Newton was one of the executors. The son alienated the real estate by a common recovery, and bequeathed the personal estate by will to his wife, and died without issue. The question arose between the wife, claiming under the will, and the Goldsmith’s Company, claiming by virtue of the limitation over on the event of the son dying without issue. The case was fully and ably argued, and there was no distinction made between the real and the personal estate as to the validity of the limitation over. The court were unanimously of the opinion that the Goldsmith’s CoraPany had no valid claim and that the limitation over was void, because the absolute ownership had been given to the son; for the property yras given to him and the heirs of his body, the company were to have no more than he should leave unspent, and therefore he had a power to dispose of the whole.

The son did die without leaving heirs, and the question arose between those claiming the real estate under the limitation over, and those claiming it under a conveyance from the son. The opinion of the court was delivered by the late Chief Justice Parsons, whose character, as a lawyer and a judge, is held in universal reverence. He cited and relied upon the case of The Attorney-General v. Hall, and said that “ whenever it is the clear intention of the testator that the devisee should have an absolute property in the estate devised, a limitation must be void, because it is inconsistent with the absolute property supposed in the first devisee. And a right in the first devisee to dispose of the estate devised at his pleasure, and not a mere power of specifying who may take, amounts to an unqualified gift.” He then applied the rule to the case before him, and observed that “ the absolute unqualified interest in the estate devised was given to the son, which was inconsistent with the limitation over, and, consequently, the limitation was void.”</p>

Bull, said the learned counsel, was in applying the English case to the real estate, when it was applicable only to chattels. But the Supreme Court of Massachusetts were then in the same error, for they equally so applied it. “ The limitation over,” said Chief Justice Parsons, “ makes no distinction between the real and personal estate, operating only on such part of either as the first devisee should leave.” In both of these cases the devise was of real and personal estate in the same sentence, and the same limitation over was created as to each; and neither the English nor the Massachusetts court admitted any difference in the rule of construction or in the operation of the power of alienation, whether applied to the limitation of the real or of the personal estate.</p>

That was the case of a devise to B. and his heirs, and if he die without having settled, or otherwise disposed of his estate, or without leaving issue of his body, then the devise over. B. sold the premises in fee, and died without issue, and the question was, whether the purchaser took an estate in fee, and the K. B. held clearly that he did. The decision is entirely conformable to the doctrine in the Attorney-General v. Hall, and Ide v. Ide, and Jackson v. Bull; but a single expression of Lord Kenyon is seized upon, and a great reliance was placed upon it by the counsel for the plaintiff in this cause. Lord Kenyon said (and it must have been in loose conversation on the bench) that if the case had turned on the question whether that was an estate tail in B., he should have thought it extremely clear that on failure of the first limitation the second ought to have taken effect as an executory devise.

As a consequence of this characteristic of executory devises, when the testator’s intention to place the limitation over under the power of disposition of the first taker appears, the executory devise is gone. The absolute power of disposal which defeats the limitation over is a power to destroy it by alienation, and not merely a power to alien the estate vested in the first taker. The citation of these cases and the reasoning upon which they proceed are abundantly sufficient to show that the absolute power of disposal in the first taker to which a limitation over is void for repugnancy is a power to dispose of the whole estate, including the limitation over, and in destruction of the limitation. Such power of disposition seems to be called absolute in contradistinction to the power of disposing of a limited fee vested in the first taker.”</p>
