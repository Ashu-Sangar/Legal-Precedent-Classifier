In an action for damages against a railroad company, the defence was (1) that the action should have been against the township, inasmuch as the accident occurred within the lines of a public highway, and (2) that plaintiff’s contributory negligence was a bar to his recovery. The court submitted the second question to the jury and reserved the first. The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff, but the court entered judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto. Upon appeal by plaintiff the judgment was reversed, and judgment was entered upon the verdict. Subsequently defendant appealed, assigning as error the submission of the question of plaintiff’s contributory negligence to the jury. <em>Held, </em>that defendant was entitled to an appeal. There is nothing in the acts of May 9, 1889, P. L. 158, and May 20, 1891, P. L. 101, to prevent such appeal.</p>

I lit my pipe and started, took my dinner bucket and as I got out in the public road I thought I heard the train whistling; thinking that perhaps may be my watch might be slow or something, I started and ran till I got up to where I turned off to go on to the bridge and slacked up; the road, that is the road I came up on to turn off is descending down and then rising up.

Yes, sir; I slacked up and after I got about down on to where the ground begins to rise to go on to the approach of the bridge I could see a mile and a half fully up the railroad ; I saw no headlight in view and I walked on rapidly, thinking I would strike the bridge near about its centre, in the middle, and ran against something on the left side, and falling at the same time, was the last that I knew till I was carried into the station. Q. Did you ever make any complaint to the township officers or to the railroad company that this place was unsafe ? A. No, sir, I never paid any attention to it; I didn’t know that there was any complaint to be laid in; I didn’t pay any attention that there was no railing there; passing back and forward I was always in a hurry to get home and always in a hurry to get away to make the train to go to work.”</p>

    <p id="b595-3" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[167,583,1173,1013]]]'>The court having refused to withdraw the case from the jury on the ground of contributory negligence, submitted that question to them, and they found in plaintiff’s favor, and assessed his damages, subject to the opinion of the court on the reserved question, raised by the first mentioned ground of de-. fence. Afterwards the question of law thus reserved was decided in favor of defendant, and thereupon judgment was entered against the plaintiff non obstante veredicto. From that he appealed, and the only question that was dr could be before us then was the validity of that judgment. In an opinion by our brother Mitchele, reported in <a href="/pa/150/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="150 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="834421" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0050-01">150 Pa. 50</a>, we held that it was erroneous and entered judgment on the verdict, in favor of plaintiff, for the amount found by the jury. The record was remitted, and the effect of our reversal, etc., was to place the parties just where they would have been, if-the court below had, in the first place, entered the proper judgment. It therefore follows that defendant was entitled to appeal from the rulings of the court below on its second ground of defence, viz.: plaintiff’s alleged contributory negligence. On those rulings, defendant had not theretofore had a hearing in this court.</p>

Ihmsen, <a href="/pa/34/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="34 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="418001" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0462-01">34 Pa. 462</a>. In Rand v. King, <a href="/pa/134/0641-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="134 Pa. 641" data-case-ids="814968" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0641-01">134 Pa. 641</a>, it was held that the modes of reviewing cases in this court by writ of error, certiorari and appeal which were in use prior to the act to May 9,1889, P. L. 158, still remain applicable to same kinds of cases, within same limits and with same effect as before; the only change made by that act is that now they are all called by the same name. As was well said in that case, “ the act does not profess to extend the right of review, to change its extent in cases already provided for, or to modify in any manner its exercise. It simply provides that dissimilar proceedings shall be called by the same <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>name. An appeal, in name, may therefore be a writ of error or certiorari in legal effect, and it is necessary, in every case, to look into the record and determine at the outset of our examination whether what is ‘ called an appeal ’ is such in fact, or is a writ of error or a certiorari. The practical effect of calling proceedings so essentially unlike by the same name, is to obscure and divert attention from the peculiar characteristics of each. This increases the sense of uncertainty on the part of the practitioner, and the labor on the part of the appellate court.”</p>

    <p id="b596-6" data-blocks='[["BL_596.6",596,[259,1240,1166,1162]]]'>An examination of the evidence convinces us that the action of the court was not erroneous. While there is some testimony tending to show that plaintiff was perhaps not as careful as he might have been, it is not of such a character as would have warranted the court in saying, as matter of law, that he was guilty of contributory negligence, and hence there was no error in submitting it, under proper instructions, to the constitutional triers of fact. Comprehensively defined, “ negligence is the absence of care according to the circumstances ; ” and it is always a question for the jury where there is a reasonable doubt, either as to the facts, or inferences of fact to be drawn from the testimony. When the measure of duty is ordinary and reasonable care, and when the degree of care varies according to the circumstances, the question of negligence is always for the jury; but, when facts constituting negligence are either admitted or conclusively established by undisputed evidence, it is of course the duty of the court to declare the law applicable thereto.
