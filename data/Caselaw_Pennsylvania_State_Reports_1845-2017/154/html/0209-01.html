The primary purpose of the accumulation resulting from the addition of one third of the surplus income in each year to the residuary estate was the creation of a fund large enough to secure payment of the $700,000, given to the University of Pennsylvania; and the limitation to the descendants of the testator then living is only of the excess, if any, beyond that amount. The act of 1853 expressly excludes from its operation ‘ any donation, bequest, or devise for any literary, scientific, charitable, or religious purpose; ’ and it provides also that an accumulation shall be void [only] ‘ so far as it shall exceed the limits of ’ the act. In this respect there is a wide difference between the gift infringing the rule against perpetuities, which is void in toto, and a trust for accumulation, which is good to the extent that it does not transgress the statute: Brown v. Williamson, 12 Casey, 338. Hence, so long as the accumulation does not swell the residue to an amount larger than the sum required for the charity, it is not forbidden: the act will only apply to a continuance of the accumulation after this purpose has been accomplished; and such excess will then go ‘ to and be received by such person or persons as would be entitled thereto if such accumulations had not been directed.’ It is not alleged that the limit has yet been reached.</p>

McNamara, 22 Smith, 280, ‘language could not be broader, and no exception or qualification is to be found in the act.’ What authority is there, therefore, for saying that a donation to a charity which permits the intermediate participation by individuals in a merely temporary incident of the accumulation does come within the prohibition in spite of these words of exclusion ?</p>

The fallacy of this lies both in the premises and in the conclusion. The residuary personal estate, after all deductions have been made, will amount to not less than $275,000, and as this, at even one per cent, would yield $2,700 per annum, not more than eight years would be <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>required for the payment of the $20,000.
