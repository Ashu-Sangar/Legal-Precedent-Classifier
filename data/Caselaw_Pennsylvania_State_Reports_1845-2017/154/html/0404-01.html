How long ago was that; before the gutters were put in? A. Long before the gutters were put in, yes, sir. Q. Whether or not the same territory now drained by reason of the grading of the streets was not drained formerly by this ravine, channel through there? A. Yes,sir; that carried the water from considerably below Hawthorn street. It run up toward that ditch. I have lived on that corner for six years, and I ought to know it pretty well. Q. What is that about Hawthorn street ? A. The water from below ran but little that way from Hawthorn street and below Hawthorn street, before they graded the streets; that formed a summit there when they graded the street, so part would go one way and the other part the other way, so as to divide up the force of the water. Q. Whether or not more water goes through and over Bohan’s property since the guttering of the street than formerly went over it ? A. I don’t think there is half as much. The water is not in the land there was them days. The land is perfectly dry; there was an additional stream of water running there years ago.' Q. Whether this gutter or culvert does not drain other territory than Main street? A. Why, it drains all from towards the head of No. 3 plane, that comes down on that slope down by property the back end of King’s lot, and from-’s dwelling down along that way towards Grove, down alleys and down through Michael Early’s lot, and part of it goes to the corner and down the other way. Q. For how long a period of time ? A. Since I have been living there. Q. Whether or not the paving of the gutters has increased the flow or volume of water there ? A. It has decreased it. I have explained that. There is a summit formed there at Corlis’s property or-and part of this water runs down the Stegmaier property and the other part goes on from that street to the ditch. Q. Whether or not sidewalks are built in the borough of Avoca? A. Yes,sir. Q. Along on <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>the western side of Main street whether or not there are sidewalks erected, and were before this gutter was paved? A. There was a little temporary sidewalk, but we never had what you might call sidewalks. Q. Well, sidewalks of any kind? A. Until the street was properly graded, then, of course, the town council forced the property holders to put down sidewalks. We never had what you might call a sidewalk until that time. Q. Whether or not during the time you lived there, and before this grading spoken of — what was the formation of the road and the gutters previous to the time the street was graded there? A. Well, there was not much formation to that right along that neighborhood. There was a kind of a hole that in the spring and fall teams could hardly get out. I have seen teams, wagons with four horses, could not pull them out; and there was considerable filling done in that particular part of the town, stone packed down there by the hundred loads, right along there, kind of a swampy place. Q. Whether in your judgment Mr. Bohan’s property has decreased in market valué since the street was guttered or since the guttering was put there? A. I didn’t think it ever had any value until the ditching and guttering was fixed up.”</p>

Defendant’s counsel states the objection as follows: (1) Because it is not cross-examination. (2) It is a part of plaintiff’s case in chief and can be proved only by the records of the council whether it was done by the borough or not. Objections overruled, and bill sealed for defendant. “ Q. Do you swear that it was not done by the borough, that the borough did not emplo3r Mr. Westfield to do the work ? A. It was done under the jurisdiction of the borough, but the people paid the money.

What we understand is meant by this is, that a comparison is to be made between the flow of water in the present condition of the gutter, with the flow of water ordinarily, prior to the placing of the gutters there. In other words, the comparison is not to be made between the present flow of water in the gutter and through the culverts, with the flow of water when the street or water courses, prior to the placing of the gutters there, were temporarily obstructed.”</p>

The objections were, <em>(a) </em>that the questions were not proper cross-examination, and (5) that the fact sought to be proved was part of plaintiff’s case in chief, and could be proved only by the records of the borough council. The court having over<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>ruled said objections, the witness testified in substance that the work of constructing said gutters was done under the supervision of the borough authorities and paid for by the property owners. In his examination in chief the witness was not asked, nor did he expressly say, by whom the grading and guttering in question were done, but he testified as to the physical nature of the street, along which the gutters were made, the effect of their construction on plaintiff’s property, etc., and such was the general character and scope of his testimony in chief that it might be fairly inferred that the work was done by or under the direction of the municipal authorities.

In Jackson v. Litch, <a href="/pa/62/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="62 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1017249" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0451-01">62 Pa. 451</a>, it was held that, in order to reverse for this cause, it must be an extreme case, in which the discretion has been abused, and in which it is apparent the party has been injured; and also, where a witness has stated a fact, be may be asked by the other party to detail all the circumstances, within his knowledge, which qualify it, though they may be new matter and form part of his own case. As was said in Bank v. Fordyce, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Pa.%20277" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Pa. 277">9 Pa. 277</a>, “ a party is entitled to bring out every circumstance relating to a fact which an adverse witness is called to prove.” In this case, there was no abuse of the discretion with which the trial judge was invested; nor do we think the defendant was prejudiced by the fact elicited on the cross-examination. An examination of plaintiff’s testimony shows that fact was either recognized or assumed by witnesses as well as the parties. One of plaintiff’s witnesses was asked, if he remembered “ when Main street was graded by the borough,” and “ when they paved the gutters along there?” and his answer was, “ Yes, sir.” Even if the plaintiff had closed his case without introducing any testimony from which the jury would have been warranted in finding the fact, the court, in order to prevent a <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>miscarriage of justice, would not have refused to permit the plaintiff to call witnesses out of order and prove it.</p>

In view of the evidence, it was for the jury to say whether the proper borough authorities did or did not construct or superintend their construction, etc. It is well settled that the acts of a municipal corporation may be proved otherwise than by its records or some written document : Dillon on Mun.

On the other hand, by the affirmance of defendant’s first, second, third, fifth, and sixth points, every necessary precaution was taken to properly indicate the limits within which the jury should act. An examination of the record discloses no error that would warrant us in disturbing the judgment.</p>
