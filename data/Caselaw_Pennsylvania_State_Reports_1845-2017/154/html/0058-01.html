It has been the practice in this county, for upwards of forty years, for the prothonotary to receive from parties, and from the sheriff, costs and fees, belonging to the officers — ex-sheriffs and ex-prothonotaries — and also fees of the acting sheriff, and pay them to the persons entitled thereto, on demand. He also frequently receives the fees of witnesses named in the bills of cost, taxed to the parties litigant, and pays them to the witnesses or to the parties. This practice has grown up with the sanction of members of the har, because of the convenience to officers and parties; and generally a book has been kept by the prothonotary, in which he enters the fees and costs so received, and the parties to whom páid receipt therefor; but the practice has heretofore been that the prothonotary, on going out of office, at the expiration of his term, has taken this book, considering it his property, and would pay the money when called upon. This practice must hereafter cease. The act of assembly of April 14,1870, P. L. 1178, requires the prothonotaries and clerks of the court of quarter sessions and orphans’ court of Carbon and Monroe counties to keep a docket, in which shall be entered all costs received by them, in their official capacity, on judgments, decrees, sentences or otherwise, which shall be free to inspection, at all times, of the attorneys, witnesses, justices, or other parties who may consider themselves interested therein. This act makes the docket so kept a public record; and it should remain in the office as such.</p>
