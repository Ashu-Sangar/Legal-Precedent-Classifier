Suit was brought to September term, 1892, and the alias summons was served June 18,1892, “by handing to and leaving with Joseph N. DuBarry, a director of said defendant corporation, a true and attested copy of the within writ and informing him of the <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>contents of the same, .... at his office and the office of said corporation in the city and county of Philadelphia.”</p>

Service outside the county in which the action is commenced is not authorized unless property of the “ corporation was wholly or in part situated ” in the county, in which the suit was brought, at the time the action was commenced. It is not enough that property of the corporation was situated in the county at the time the cause of action arose. It must appear that it was situated there when the action was commenced.</p>
