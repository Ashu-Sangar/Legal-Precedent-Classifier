At the annual election held in 1887, a contest arose between two factions of the corporation which resulted in a writ of quo warranto being issued to determine the validity of the title of certain directors who claimed to be directors of the corporation. In January, 1888, pending the decision of this controversy, another corporate election was held at which there was a second contest and a second writ of quo warranto was issued to test the right of the parties claiming to have been elected at this election. On Aug. 16, 1888, the court of common pleas entered a decree in the first suit deciding that the defendants in the quo warranto proceedings had no valid title to their seats as claimed. In October, 1888, the second writ was tried and a similar result followed, both cases being subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court, as Com. v.

In that we think he was clearly right. Contracts entered into by a corporation de facto are binding after having been executed bjr either party: 2 Morawetz on Corp., secs. 750, 752. The act of an officer de facto is good whenever it concerns a third person who had a previous right or had paid a valuable consideration for it: Angelí &amp; Ames on Corp., 11th ed., secs. 287, 286, 299. An officer de facto is one whose acts, though not those of a lawful officer, the law, upon principles of policy and justice, will hold valid, so far as they involve the interests of the public and third persons: State v. Carroll, 38 Con .449. Our own cases are to the same effect: Riddle v. Bedford, 7 S. &amp; R. 392; McGargell v. Hazleton Coal Co., <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20425" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 425">4 W. &amp; S. 425</a>.

    <p id="b478-5" data-blocks='[["BL_478.5",478,[278,1613,1159,602]]]'>The learned counsel for defendant, in a very able and ingenious argument, contended that there is a distinction between de facto officers of public corporations and de facto officers of private corporations. While such a distinction appears to be recognized. in some of the cases cited and relied on by him, we are not convinced that it is sound. The weight of authority, in this country especially, is decidedly against it. In the case of public corporations, the reasons for holding the acts of de facto officers binding on the corporations they represent are doubtless stronger than in the ease of,private corporations; but, to some extent at least, they are the same in both, differing only in degree.</p>

The nature of the claim, etc., is somewhat different. In this case, the claim is for lumber delivered to defendant corporation, on its own premises, and used in the construction of buildings thereon. The lumber was delivered on the order of Mr. Edelman, one of the members of the de facto, or acting, board. Part of it was furnished prior to the organization of the legal board and before the decree of court ousting any of the members of the de facto board, and part of it after-wards. Prior to furnishing any part of the lumber, plaintiffs had notice of pending litigation for the purpose of determining the right of the de facto board to act as directors of the corporation.
