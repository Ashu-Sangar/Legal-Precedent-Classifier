About the year 1865 her father moved with his family into Eldred township, where he continued to reside until April 1, 1888, when he went into Loyalsock township and lived there until his death, which occurred in April, 1891. It is admitted that he had acquired a settlement in Eldred township prior to his removal therefrom, and it is a fact clearly established by the <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>evidence, that he had leased a farm in Eldred township, on which he resided for at least nine years, preceding the time of his removal to Loyalsock township. There is therefore no doubt that he had a legal settlement in said township of Eldred as early as 1880. Sarah Holmes, the pauper, arrived at the age of twenty-one years on the 17th day of October, 1882. At this time she had no mental or physical infirmity which rendered her incapable of taking care of herself. From the time she was nineteen years of age she worked out a great part of the time among strangers, and received her own wages, which she applied as she pleased. She continued healthy and able to work until about two years after attaining her majority, when she became afflicted with a spinal disease from which she has never recovered. Since her sickness, and up to the time of her father’s death, she lived with him, and was maintained and provided for by him. Before taken sick, although she was working for other people the greater portion of the time, she still continued to call her father’s house her home. At the time she took sick she was in the employment of a stranger, but was immediately taken to her father’s house, where she remained until his death.</p>

It seems to me, however, that it ought not to require any ruling. As soon as a child becomes of the age of twenty-one years, if it is not incapacitated by reason of any physical or mental infirmity from taking proper care of itself, as we have seen, it is emancipated by the law. It is then competent to acquire a settlement in its own right, because competent to do any act which any other person is lawfully permitted to do. When that age is reached, the parents have no longer any right to impose any legal restraint upon that child, and its remaining under the roof of the parent would be a voluntary act on the child’s part, and could not be considered as giving the child a right to acquire derivatively any new settlement acquired by the parents.</p>

In the case before us, Sarah Holmes was competent mentally and physically when she attained to the age aforesaid, and for two years thereafter, to take care of herself, and to have acquired by her own act a settlement; and hence I can see no reason why her subsequent illness, which caused her to be taken back to her father’s house and maintained by him, should enable her settlement to follow that of her. father. She is, therefore, in my opinion, settled in Eldred township.</p>
