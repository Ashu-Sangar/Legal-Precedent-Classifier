(The race conveying the water to drive the mills passed, for a part of its course, over the tract devised to John.) The will further provides: ‘My son John shall receive a deed free of all incumbrances ; it is reserved that he is not to take any water out of the race or creek excepting for the purpose of running his tannery ; if the water should be low, and should not flow through the pipes, he must - dip it out of the race, for which water, my son John shall tan, yearly, for my son Joseph, one calf skin and one beef hide, the same to be done free of charge, and fit for use. My son Joseph is to furnish the hides. I empower my executors to give my son Joseph a deed or deed poll for the land and the appurtenances thereunto belonging; such deed or deed poll shall be as lawful as if I myself had signed, sealed and delivered the same. In the same way my other executor shall give a deed or deed poll to my son John, for the land which I have bequeathed to him.’ Deeds, as aforesaid, were given and accepted by the devisees ; that to John contained the following : ‘ With the right and privilege of using and taking water out of the mill-race, to supply his tan-yard, according to the provisions of the said last will and testament of said deceased, and subject to a certain mill-race which leads through a part of the land for the use of Joseph Mosser, with the right to hold and keep in repair the same from time to time, but with as little damage as conveniently can be done.’ The deed to Joseph contained the following: ‘ With the right and privilege of holding and maintaining the mill-race over and through a part of the land which was left unto John Mosser, where the same now is located, but with the least damage as can conveniently be done.’ John Mosser died about the year 1853, and in proceedings in partition a tract embracing that above devised to him, was accepted by and the title in fee simple thereto vested in David J. Mosser, a son of John; said David J. owned and occupied it at the time of the bringing of this suit. (He died while the action was pending.) Said Joseph, by deed of April 24, 1879, conveyed the premises devised to him, (and all the ways, waters, water courses, rights, liberties, privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging, and the reversions, remainders, rents, issues and profits thereof and all <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>his estate, right, title, interest, property, claim and demand in the same) to his son, Lewis F.

That Lewis F. Mosser, the plaintiff, on May 23, 1891, before .the bringing of this suit, tendered a calf and a beef hide to David J., demanding the tanning thereof, and that the latter refused to tan. Upon the trial the facts appeared to be as averred in the statement, and it was further shown that the value of tanning such two skins was five dollars. Also, that the premises of defendant, up to the time this suit was brought, continued to be used as a tannery, and water therefor taken from the race, continuously, as provided in said will. The court was of the opinion that the facts did not warrant a recovery by Lewis against David J., and directed a verdict for defendant, which instruction is the error complained of under this rule for a new trial.</p>
