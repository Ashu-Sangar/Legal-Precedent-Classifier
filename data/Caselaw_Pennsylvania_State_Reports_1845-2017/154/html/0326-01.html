In the' former case, Mr. Chief Justice Paxson, after noting the fact that the only error assigned was refusal to take off the nonsuit, says: “ Unfortunately for the plaintiff there is no exception to this refusal. This may seem unimportant, but in point of fact it is vital. The plain reason is that without such exception the evidence is not and cannot come before us. Without the evidence, it is impossible for us to say whether the nonsuit was properly entered. The office of an exception, as we have repeatedly said, is to bring upon the record something which, without an exception, forms no part of it.

Where there is a nonsuit, an exception to the refusal of the court to take it off brings up the whole of the evidence, for the reason that we must consider all the plaintiff’s evidence to determine whether the nonsuit was properly entered. Hence the value of a bill of exceptions. It determines precisely what the evidence was. . . . Where the^e is no bill of exceptions, we are not at liberty to look at the evidence: Tasker v.

Nor have we before us the plaintiff’s statement of claim, or the pleadings, as required by rules of court.

After being furnished by the latter with lowest price and terms on which he would sell, etc., he communicated the same to Mr. Cleaver, and entered into an agreement with him by which they were to purchase the property jointly. Part of that agreement was that plaintiff should apply his commissions, for procuring a purchaser, to part payment of the interest he was to have in the purchase, and should after-wards operate the stone quarries for joint account of Cleaver and himself. It is not at all surprising that plaintiff’s employer, upon being informed of the arrangement, manifested displeasure, accused him of bad faith, etc., and refused to convey. As Conrade’s agent, specially employed by him to procure a purchaser for the property, the undisputed evidence shows that plaintiff acted in bad faith to his employer; and, in the circumstances, the latter was not bound to carry out the agreement between him and Cleaver. It is a fundamental rule, applicable to both sales and purchases, that an agent employed to sell cannot make himself' the purchaser; nor, if employed to purchase, can he become the seller. This familiar principle is recognized in many cases, among which are Everhart v. Searle, <a href="/pa/71/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="71 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1031234" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0256-01">71 Pa. 256</a>; Railroad Co. v.

In the latter it was said: “ The principle .... that an agent for the sale of property cannot at the same time act as agent for the purchase thereof, or interest himself therein, and thus entitle himself to compensation from both vendor and vendee, is grounded on the infallible declaration that ‘ no man can serve two masters.’ As a rule of public policy it is distinctly recognized in our text books on agency and numerous adjudicated cases.....It forbids that any one intrusted with the interests of others shall in any manner make the business <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>an object of personal interest to himself, because, from a frailty of nature, one who has the power will be too readily seized with the inclination to use the opportunity for serving Ms own interests at the expense of the principal.....It matters not that no fraud was meditated, and no injury done. The rule was not intended to be remedial of actual wrong, but preventive of the possibility of it.” Such rules of public policy should be rigidly .enforced unless it clearly appears that the parties for whose protection they were intended, have, with full knowledge of all the circumstances, agreed to waive their rights thereunder.</p>
