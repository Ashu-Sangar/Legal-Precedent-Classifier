Owing to heavy rains the train was detained by a washout. At four o’clock in the afternoon of the same day the dam above Conemaugh broke, resulting in the Johnstown flood. About half of the cars of the train bearing the whisky were swept away, but the car containing the whisky was left uninjured standing upon the track. About six o’clock in the evening the waters subsided, and the crew of the train returned. What then occurred is described by the conductor as follows :</p>

They were there with some axes, hammering away. I said, ‘ Hello, boys, what is the trouble ? ’ He said, ‘Look here, young fellow, by God, there are five hundred people starving, and with nothing to eat, and if there is anything in the train they will have it.’ I said, ‘ I have no use for you.’ I walked about my business. In the meantime they had bursted open the car, loaded with hams and flour. I don’t know whether they had just this particular car bursted open or not; I think probably they had; we left and walked to Johnstown, and we could not do anything better; everything was washed out; we started to walk to Johnstown; that was in the neighborhood of 6 o’clock when we left there.”</p>

There was a few had been'broken open, but we got them away. They kept on coming thicker and thicker, and we could not protect it; we nailed the cars shut. They found this whisky, and we nailed the ears, I think, three or four times, where the whisky was in. Two cars had whisky in. There was the one car had about two or three barrels in it, probably more. They broke <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>that open first. We nailed it shut, but they broke it open the second time. I told them to stay out, and I got in the car myself, me and another party. I ordered them out. They swore they would not go. I throwed one fellow out, and he turned and drew a revolver on me. The rest pushed him away from the car on one side of the car. We closed it again. That is about the third time. Then by that time they had broken open this other car of whisky in front. The first car they had broken open on the right hand, as you go in this direction, and the other car they broke open on the left, on the north side. When we came round on that side they mashed this one open, and were going for it red hot. There was a good many come over from Conemaugh town, and they consulted most of them that come down, and we did not believe we could do anything any longer; they were getting too many. There was about a hundred people there. Q. What sort of people were they ? A. People I never saw who came there. I don’t know how they got there or where they came from; they were the toughest class of people I ever saw. I never knew them and I have been raised in that neighborhood, but I don’t know where they came from. They swore they would have the whisky. We told them they could not have the whisky, that we would empty it first; but we would not leave them have it, for we could not protect it in any other way. Q. Why did you tell them that ? A. They were raising a fuss then. We were in danger at that time. We had enough to look after in the way of dead people lying around, and relieving the suffering of those left. We had no time to lose with the whisky, and they began to get so bad on our hands at the time we could not control them any longer, and we came to the conclusion, I and about a dozen of the citizens, the best thing to do would be to destroy the whisky. We done so as quick as we could destroy it. In an hour’s time it was quite a different place. It was all quiet.”</p>

The defence set up is that the whisky was lost in the Johnstown flood. The train was overtaken by the flood but it was not swept away. After the avalanche of water caused by the breaking of the South Fork dam had passed, the train was left upon the track, and the cars were uninjured. The track above and below it was injured so that the train could not resume its <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>journey at once, but remained in the same place until the necessary repairs were made. The whisky claimed for in this action was not destroyed by a flood. Part of it was stolen by thieves after the flood subsided, and the rest of it was destroyed by a volunteer guard of citizens who had watched and protected the train during the night following the flood and part of the next day, as the easiest way of keeping it from falling into the hands of the same dangerous class of men who had gotten a taste of it on the previous afternoon. The flood was therefore not the cause of the loss, but the occasion, the opportunity for its plunder by bad men. The thieves came in the wake of the flood to pick up and appropriate what the more merciful waters had spared. They came to this train and began to force open the doors of some of the cars. The conductor and part, if not all, of his crew came upon the ground at about the same time. They saw an ax being used to open one or more of the cars but they made no effort to defend the train or drive away the thieves. They did not so much as remonstrate with them, or order them away; but turning their backs they surrendered the train and its freight to the tender mercies of the vagabonds who had attacked it, .and went away from the neighborhood. Private citizens came soon after, drove the thieves out of, and away from, the train and stood guard over it all night and until the middle of the next day; but the train men seem to have had neither part nor lot in the effort to save the property of their employer. The reason was given by one of them while on the witness stand with a cool, deliberate heartlessness not often met with in the most hardened criminals. He said he did not try to help the citizens save the cars and their contents because he “ had no orders to do so.” He stood and looked on. He saw the peril of his employer’s property. He saw citizens, with no personal interest involved, trying to save it, but he did not help because he “ had no orders.” Whether he and others like him were cowards shivering with fear in the presence of a few thieves whom unarmed citizens drove away, or were thieves at heart and in full sympathy with those who were trying to loot the cars that they should have defended, is a matter of no consequence. In either case they neglected •their obvious duty. The railroad company was represented in the carriage and safe-keeping of the freight on the train by the men to whom the train had been committed. If they desert<a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>ed their posts and left the goods uncared for, and they were stolen or destroyed, their employer must suffer for their inefficiency. Under the facts of this case the loss sued for did not arise from inevitable accident, or the act of God. It did not result from insurrection or the public enemy. It was not the work of a mob. It was due in part to plain stealing, done in daylight, in the presence of the train men and without the slightest resistance or remonstrance on their part. For the rest, it was due to the action of citizens who, after having guarded what remained for nearly twenty-four hours, destroyed it, when they could no longer keep up their watch over it, rather than see it consumed by the human brutes to whom it had been abandoned by the train men.</p>
