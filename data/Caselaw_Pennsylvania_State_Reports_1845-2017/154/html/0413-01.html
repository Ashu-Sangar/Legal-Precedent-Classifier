    <p class="summary" id="b438-7" data-blocks='[["BL_438.12",438,[246,833,1163,1108]]]'>“ The real defence here is that the defendant is released from liability on the bill and that the plaintiffs agreed to look to Thomas Imler for the payment of it. And that arrangement, it is alleged on the part of the defendant, was made by the agent of the plaintiffs, a man named Knouff. He was the agent generally to sell this property, and he could do only whatever he was empowered to do by the terms of his agency. We are not informed here that these terms were set forth by any agreement in writing, but we are told by one of the members of the firm of the plaintiffs in this issue that the powers of the agent were simply to take orders for the sale of whisky and to collect bills — that and nothing more. If the agent went outside the terms of the agency, those who dealt with him did so at their own risk. It is the duty of a man who deals with an agent to know exactly what the terms of the agency are. If he then takes the agent’s statement for it, it does not bind the principal unless it is shown he is dealing elsewhere in the same way, or has been known theretofore to have done the same thing, or has done such things as induces a belief to that effect. It is the duty of those who deal with an agent to know the terms of the agency, because what he may do outside the terms of the agency is of no binding effect upon his principal.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b438-8" data-blocks='[["BL_438.13",438,[246,1948,1163,450]],["BL_439.1",439,[179,368,1168,500]]]'>“ Now, what are the facts here as claimed by the defendant ? That Knouff agreed to release Gorsuch and look to Imler for the payment of this bill. That was not a sale. The sale had been made, the contract between the plaintiffs and this man Gorsuch had been completed, the goods had been ordered, shipped and delivered; and when Gorsuch made his transfer to Imler, if he transferred or agreed to transfer this property along with other property, it did not release Gorsuch from his liability to these plaintiffs. [It was Gorsuch’s duty to get the <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>consent of these plaintiffs that he might transfer to Imler and have the plaintiffs look to Imler for payment. As he did not do so, as the uncontradicted proof here on the part of these plaintiffs shows that he did not do so, as far as they are concerned, his agreement with Imler would not bind these plain-tiffs. They were not notified, they were not parties to it in any way'; and they are not bound by any agreement between Gorsuch and Imler, unless they knew it. Wb say, therefore, on that state of the proof, that Knouff had no power to release Gorsuch and compel his principals to look to Imler.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b439-3" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[175,878,1164,857]]]'>“ They furthermore claim, on the part of the defence, that there was a ratification by reason of the long delay in presenting the bill for payment. It might be ratified by these plaintiffs, although Knouff might not originally have had the power. A principal may ratify and indorse the act of his agent; but the evidence shows here, on the part of these plaintiffs, that they never had any knowledge at all of the transaction. By the undisputed evidence, the plaintiffs appear to have had no knowledge of it at all. They never knew Imler, never heard of him, never corresponded with him, had no communication with him. We say to you, therefore, the undisputed proof is that theyr knew nothing about Imler, and had no arrangement with him and no knowledge of this thing; and, therefore, they could not ratify what they did not know. In order to make a ratification binding there must be knowledge; and the undisputed evidence here shows there was no knowledge.</p>

The delay in collecting the bill is not evidence of ratification, unless the plaintiffs knew the facts claimed by the defendant. If it is claimed that the evidence shows that Knouff furnished a statement to Imler, it is no proof of ratification by his principals, because, as their agent, he was not authorized to release the plaintiffs’ claim upon Gorsuch and take Imler in lieu of Gorsuch; and without proof that his act was ratified by his principals, it has no significance, and the point is therefore denied.” [2]</p>

The only defence that was attempted was a novation of the debt, by the substitution of a new debtor in place of defendant, with intent to release the latter. The contention was that Knouff, as plaintiffs’ agent, agreed to release defendant and, in his stead, to accept Imler, defendant’s successor in the business, and look to him alone for payment. There was no sufficient evidence to justify <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>the jury in finding that such a novation of his employers’ account against defendant was within the scope of Knouff’s agency. He was employed to solicit and send in orders for goods, and to collect outstanding accounts. That did not authorize him to release defendant from liability for the price of the goods he had purchased, and accept Imler in his stead. If he had undertaken to do so, nothing short of ratification by his principals could validate the transaction; and there is no evidence of such ratification. In the absence of sufficient evidence, of either precedent authority or subsequent ratification, to justify the submission of any material question of fact to the jury, the only proper course was to direct the jury to find for plaintiffs. The legal propositions involved are horn-book law, and citation of authorities is unnecessary.</p>
