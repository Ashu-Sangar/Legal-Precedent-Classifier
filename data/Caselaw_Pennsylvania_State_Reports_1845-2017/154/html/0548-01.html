Mr. Meyran makes the affidavit of claim and counter affidavit, in which he claims for the whole amount. This is certainly inconsistent with a theory that the proceeds of the discount of the four notes were to be applied on this #88,000, for then there was a credit due on the check of #42,500 as the Germania Bank had not paid out one dollar on notes discounted. At that time, i. e., 1884, the Germania Bank claimed by its actions that it had not deposited the #88,000 check for collection, because it refused to receive back the check, objected to the Farmers Bank charging it back to it, brought suit against the Farmers Bank for the full amount of the check, and drew on it for the sum of #2,400. Such a course of action seems to the master to be inconsistent with an application of the proceeds of the discount to the #88,000 check, but it does seem consistent with Mr. Meyran’s testimony: ‘We were just to hand over our cash and they were to pay the #88,000 check.’ If that be not correct, why did they have Eeiber, cashier, sign a proceeds cheek, and then give him two other checks to get cashed? If the discount was not a cash one, why did the Germania Bank not at once credit the Penn Bank.with the proceeds of the four notes as against the #88,000 check it then had in its possession? The Penn Bank opened Friday, May 28,1884, about 2 o’clock p. M., and remained open all day Saturday; during all this time the #88,000 check could have been presented at the counter of the Penn Bank and the balance above the proceeds of the discount of the four notes would have been paid.</p>

In those cases, although the bank became insolvent, as in St. Louis, etc., Co., v. Johnston, before any of the proceeds were drawn, yet the maker could not get back his paper and be charged with the proceeds. The principle of those cases does not seem to the master to apply to this case because this was a special discount for a special purpose, and was for cash; the giving of checks for the proceeds shows that fact. The mere entry in the books of a charge does not vary the transaction. ‘ There is no magic in bookkeeping ’ — especially bank bookkeeping, as illustrated by the Penn Bank.</p>
