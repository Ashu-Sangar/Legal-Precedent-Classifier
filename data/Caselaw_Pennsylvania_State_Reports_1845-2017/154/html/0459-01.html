It was occupied as a marble manufactory and yard. The business consisted largely of importing blocks of marble from Italy, and in manufacturing the marble for the market. A traveling crane was used in transporting the marble from the wharf to the mill. Plaintiff claimed that the space directly under the traveling crane or traveler was much diminished for storage purposes by the construction of the railroad.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[258,884,1159,1462]]]'>“ This particular property was a marble yard. You are not to consider what that property was worth only as a marble yard and factory — and when I say ‘ yard ’ I mean yard and manufacturing establishment — you are not alone to do that, either before or after the railroad came there, but taking it before the railroad came there to first consider that proposition and get at the value of that property as it stood before it was affected by the coming of the railroad, and what it was worth for the best uses to which it could be put. Then you will consider the next question, what was it worth after the railroad came there. Not necessarily as a marble yard and factory, but for the best use it could be put to. You can probably easily realize that there might be a condition of affairs where upon a lot of ground a dozen small dwelling houses were built that the coming of a railroad, either in front or behind them, might make them practically useless as dwelling houses, but yet that property might become very largely valuable as a manufacturing establishment; and if the owner of those houses should come into court and ask damages against the railroad company, a jury would have no right to consider simply their value as dwelling houses; but you ought to say what is the market value of that property before the railroad came there for all the purposes and for the best purposes to which it could be’ put before, and what is the value of it after the railroad came there. If the railroad increased the value of the property, although it may have destroyed the valúe of the houses for dwelling houses, for manufacturing or any other purposes, and that more money could be gotten for it than before, the plaintiff would have no proper claim for damages. . . .</p>

The fact that that amount of storage capacity is gone does not admit of any contention. The defendants attempted to show that that injury or damage can be supplied .by an additional track on the south side of his trestling, and in that way recovering the lost storage capacity by having a trestling there. You have seen the mechanism, and the models will be before you, and one set of engineers have given you their thought upon the subject, whilst other witnesses have condemned it, saying it is not practicable, and giving you their reasons. Now you will consider in that respect the amount of practical knowledge a man has in relation to the subject he speaks of, and when he gives his reasons you will .consider the soundness of those reasons as they appear to your understanding, and weigh him in that scale.</p>
