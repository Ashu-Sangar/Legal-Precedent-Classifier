J., defendant claimed that no proof of loss had been furnished within fifteen days after the fire, as required by the policy. Plaintiff, however, offered evidence which tended to show that plaintiff, immediately after the fire, gave notice of the loss to A. T. Cross, the agent of defendant, who directed Shattuck, an adjuster of all the companies which Cross represented, to adjust the loss; that Shattuck did so and made report to Cross, who accepted it without objection, and forwarded it to defendant company. The proofs thus furnished were retained by the company, until a considerable time had elapsed and plaintiff had demanded payment. The fire occurred May 28,1891, the adjustment was received by the company July 18, 1891.</p>
