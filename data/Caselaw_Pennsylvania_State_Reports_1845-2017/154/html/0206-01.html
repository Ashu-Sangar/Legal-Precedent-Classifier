    <p class="summary" id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[161,1088,1163,960]]]'>“ This bill cannot be sustained, because the agreement which we are asked to enforce is so vague and uncertain that specific performance cannot be compelled. In the first place, we do not know with sufficient certainty what is the subject of the agreement. That paper calls it ‘ a patent for the manufacture of railroad switch points and frogs,’ and from this language one would naturally infer that the thing to be patented was a process and not a tangible article. The same inference would probably be drawn from the language of the assignment, although nothing is there said about frogs, and the thing, to be patented is somewhat differently described as ‘ certain and useful improvements in the manufacture of switch points.’ The patent itself, however, as described in the bill, was issued to protect ‘ an alleged new and useful improvement in rolls for rolling switch points,’ and this seems to be a patent of a tangible article, and not of a process. Perhaps the discrepancy is only apparent, and the real subject may be the same throughout ; if so, it must be the thing described in the patent, viz.: an improvement in rolls for rolling switch points.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[159,2056,1163,350]],["BL_232.1",232,[292,370,1158,959]]]'>“ But, if we assume this to be true and thereby waive any objection on account of uncertain description of the subject-matter, a much more serious objection remains. What is meant by the practical ‘ operation ’ of this patent ? Would this phrase be satisfied if only one pair of points was rolled, thus in one sense practically operating the patent, although the manufacture was thereupon abandoned; or does it require that a plant <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>should be established for the purpose of continuously malting switch points by means of these improved rolls ? If a plant must be established, how large must it be and how many sets of rolls must it contain in order to be in practical operation ? Further, the defendants agree to pay all moneys ‘ necessary ’ to put the patent into practical operation. What is meant by necessary ? Barely necessary, or a full and liberal provision ? If a plant is necessary, where is it to be, and according to what design is it to be built ? Who is to superintend its construction and management? And, finally, who is to decide these questions — and many others which might be asked — when the inevitable difference of opinion arises ? The plaintiffs aver that $65,000 is necessary, thus undertaking to decide the questions for themselves, but obviously their mere naked averment is not sufficient, even upon demurrer. Without stating other reasons, it is enough to say that the court must first know what is meant by ‘ practical operation ’ before the prima facie ‘ necessity ’ for $65,000 could be determined, and as already declared we are unable to fix the boundaries of either phrase.</p>
