Giving to the word \u201c inclusive \u201d its accepted meaning, the note was to be included in the legacy, and form a part of it.\nThe decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.",

Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts\u2019 Appeal.\nWill \u2014 Legacy\u2014Deduction of debt due by legatee.\nTestator gave \u201c to the Academy of the Pennsylvania Pine Arts, $50,000, inclusive of the note of the Academy.\u201d At the time of his death testator held the note of the Academy for the sum of $8,000 for money loaned to it. Held, that the amount of the note should he deducted from the legacy, and that the legatee was entitled to receive only $42,000.\nArgued Jan. 25, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 44, Jan. T., 1893, by The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., Oct. T., 1890, No. 233, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in estate of George S. Pepper, deceased.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAudit of account of John S. Gerhard et ah, executors of George S. Pepper, deceased. [Reported below, 1 Dist. R. 148.] The adjudication was as follows, by Ferguson, J.:\n\u201c The testator gave: \u2018 To the Academy of the Pennsylvania Fine Arts, $50,000, inclusive of the note of the academy.\u2019\n\u201c It appeared that the testator, at the time of his death, held the note of the academy for the sum of eight thousand dollars for money loaned to it. The executors, therefore, when paying the above legacy deducted the amount of said note and only paid to the legatee the sum of forty-two thousand dollars. It is now claimed on behalf of the legatee that the testator meant to give it $50,000, in addition to the note. The whole question then is one of etymology, as to the meaning of the word \u2018 inclusive \u2019 in the clause of the will; whether it means that the note is included in the legacy of $50,000, or, that the legacy is given exclusive of the note. The auditing judge must give to the word its generally accepted meaning, in which sense it must be presumed that the testator used it. Webster defines \u2018 inclusive \u2019 to mean 4 inclosing, encircling, comprehending the stated limit or extremes, as from Monday to Saturday inclusive, that is taking in both Monday and Saturday.\u2019 Giving to the word this meaning, this clause must be interpreted as meaning that the note was to be included in the legaejr. This claim for an additional allowance of $8,000 is, therefore, not allowed.\u201d\nExceptions to adjudication were dismissed by the court, in an opinion (adopting the opinion of the auditing judge) by Hanna, P. J.\nErrors assigned were dismissal of exceptions.\nCharles Henry Hart, for appellant.\nTestator used the word :inclusive \u201d the same as, or synonymous with,44 and \u201d or44 with,\u201d and this is its correct etymological significance. Vide Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, 37. 44 As well as; \u201d 44 together with; \u201d 44 along with; \u201d 44 coupled with; \u201d 44 in conjunction with ; \u201d 44 also ; \u201d 44 likewise.\u201d It is an additive word. The illustration from Webster is in point, the legacy takes in both the $50,000 and the note. Suppose the note had been $51,000 ?\nQ-eorge Wharton Pepper and Joseph B.
