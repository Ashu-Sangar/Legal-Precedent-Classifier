Without going into the details of the evidence, we think there was sufficient upon this point to go to the jury, and that it was properly submitted.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Co., Appellant.\nFire Insurance \u2014 Proof of loss \u2014 Waiver\u2014Evidence.\nThe fact that a fire insurance company appointed an adjuster to adjust a loss, and that when an adjustment was made it was received by the company without objection, is sufficient evidence to submit to the jury on the question whether the company had waived a provision in the policy requiring proof of loss to be furnished within fifteen days.\nAssignments of error to admission of evidence.\nAn assignment o'f error to the admission of evidence which quotes the bill of exception but not the evidence is not in proper form and will not be considered by the Supreme Court.\nArgued Feb. 9, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 5, Jan. T., 1893, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Chester Co., Jan. T., 1892, No. 12, on verdict for plaintiff, Wm. Pl. Fritz.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAssumpsit on policy of fire insurance.\nAt the trial, before Waddell, P. J., defendant claimed that no proof of loss had been furnished within fifteen days after the fire, as required by the policy. Plaintiff, however, offered evidence which tended to show that plaintiff, immediately after the fire, gave notice of the loss to A. T. Cross, the agent of defendant, who directed Shattuck, an adjuster of all the companies which Cross represented, to adjust the loss; that Shattuck did so and made report to Cross, who accepted it without objection, and forwarded it to defendant company. The proofs thus furnished were retained by the company, until a considerable time had elapsed and plaintiff had demanded payment. The fire occurred May 28,1891, the adjustment was received by the company July 18, 1891.\nDefendant\u2019s request for binding instruction was refused. [10]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (2-4) rulings on evidence, quoting bills of exception but not evidence, and (10) above instruction, quoting it.\nJames O. Sellers, for appellant,\ncited, on the question of waiver: Beatty v. Lycoming Ins. Co., 66 Pa. 9; Mueller v. South Side Co., 87 Pa. 899; Gould v. Dwelling House Ins. Co., 134 Pa. 570 ; Kelly v.
