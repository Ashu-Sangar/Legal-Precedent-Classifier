R.\nNegligence \u2014 Railroad\u2014Fellow servants \u2014 Act of April 4, 1868.\nA person employed by the individual owner of cars run on a railroad, under a contract with the railroad company, is, when in charge of the cars, an employee of the railroad company within the meaning of the act of April 4, 1868, P. L. 58.\nNegligence \u2014 Defective guard rail \u2014 Excessive speed \u2014 Evidence.\nIn an action against a railroad company to recover damages for personal injuries, plaintiff, who was in the position of an employee, claimed that the accident was caused either by a defective guard rail, or by the excessive speed of the train around a curve. Plaintiff did not describe the position of the rail on the day of the accident, but as it was \u201c a few days \u201d or \u201c several days\u201d or \u201ca couple of days\u201d before that time; while the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses was positive and uneontradieted that a new rail had been put in proper position on the day before the accident. Held, that the evidence as to the defect in the rail was insufficient, and that if the accident was caused by excessive speed it was due to the negligence of a fellow servant, and that on neither of the grounds alleged was it proper to submit the case to the jury.\nArgued Feb. 15, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 275, Jan. T., 1893, by-plaintiff, Lewis Miller, from judgment of C. P. Lebanon Co., for defendant, non obstante veredicto.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams and McCollum, JJ.\nTrespass for personal injuries caused by defendant\u2019s negligence.\nAt the trial, before McPherson, J., it appeared that plaintiff was an employee of Coleman & Brock, proprietors of the North Lebanon furnaces. The ore for the supply of the furnanees was obtained from the Cornwall Ore Bank by way of defendant\u2019s railroad under a traffic agreement requiring the owners of the furnace to furnish their own cars and a man to take charge of them. Plaintiff was injured while in charge of the cars of his employers on the railroad. He claimed that his injuries were caused either by a defective guard rail, or by the running of the train at an excessive speed around a curve. He did not describe the condition of the rail on the day of the accident, but as it was \u201ca few days \u201d or \u201cseveral days \u201d or \u201ca couple of days \u201d before that time; while the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses was positive and uneontradieted that a new rail had been put up in proper position on the day before the accident.\nPlaintiff\u2019s points were among others as follows:\n\u201c 1. Lewis Miller, the plaintiff, was a passenger on the train when he received his injury.\u201d Refused. [1]\n\u201c 2. The act of April 4, 1868, is unconstitutional and void.\u201d Refused. [2]\nVerdict for plaintiff subject to the question reserved as to whether there was any evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence to go to the jury. The court subsequently entered judgment for defendant, non obstante veredicto.\nErrors assigned were (1, 2) instructions, quoting them; (5) entry of judgment.\nA. Erante Seltzer, B.
