If the learned judge below was right in his view of the evidence, and it has not been made to appear that he was wrong, we see no error in instructing the jury that they had no right to base their verdict upon a mere guess.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Baird et al., Appellants, v. Schuylkill River East Side R. R.\nRailroads \u2014 Eminent domain \u2014 Injury to business \u2014 Evidence.\nIn condemnation proceedings, where plaintiffs, a partnership, consisting of the owner of the lands and his two sons, claim damages for interference with their business, and the case is tried at the same time with the suit of the owner brought to recover damages for the land, it is not error for the court to give binding instructions for the defendant where there is no testimony showing the value of any interference with plaintiff\u2019s business.\nArgued Jan. 9, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 469, Jan. T., 1892, by plaintiffs, John Baird & Sons, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., Dec. T., 1888, No. 671, on verdict for defendant.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAppeal from award of jury awarding damages in condemnation proceedings.\nAt the trial the facts appeared as stated in the preceding case. It further appeared that the firm of John Baird & Sons consisted of John Baird, the owner of the real estate, and his two sons, Thomas E. Baird and John E. Baird. The firm occupied the property in question without any lease from the owner, and merely at his sufferance. No evidence was offered of the market value of any leasehold interest, or of any special injury to the business of the firm. There was evidence however that the contracts were made by the firm for repairs to the property, and that payments for such repairs were made out of firm assets, and these bills were given in evidence, although it would seem that these items were considered in connection with the preceding case.\nThe court charged as follows :\n\u201c The other case is a claim of John Baird & Sons for interference to their business. The plaintiff, however, has not offered you any testimony showing the value of an3r interference to his business, and for 3'-ou to fix any amount for the interference to his business would be an absolute guess on your part, and that you have no right to do. Under the law, therefore, I instruct you that it is your duty to render a verdict in the case of John Baird & Sons for the defendant.\u201d\nVerdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was above charge, quoting it.\nJohn Gr. Johnson, Wm. Henry Lex with him, for appellant.\nWilliam H. Addiclcs, for appellee.\nJanuary 23, 1893 :"
