    "head_matter": "Lawrence, Appellant, v. Philadelphia.\n\u2022Streets \u2014 Change of grade \u2014 Damages.\nA person owning a number of contiguous lots with houses thereon, abutting on. three streets, is entitled to damages for a change of grade of one of the streets, only as to the lots abutting on the street whose grade is changed, and not as to the lots abutting on the other two streets.\nArgued Jan. 27, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 70, Jan. T., 1893, by plaintiff, Edmund Lawrence, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., June T., 1887, No. 87, on special verdict.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.'\nTrespass for change of grade of street.\nAt the trial, it appeared that plaintiff was the owner of thirteen adjoining houses and lots, four of which were on Second street, four others adjoining on Venango street, and five others \u2022adjoining on Cooper street. The grade of Second street was\nraised in front of the houses abutting on that street. No change of grade was made on Venango street and Cooper street.\nThe jury found the following special verdict:\n\u201c Plaintiff was the owner of the premises indicated upon the plan attached hereto. In the years 1883 and 1884, the city of Philadelphia raised the level of Second street in front of plaintiff\u2019s four lots fronting upon that street, to the heights indicated by the said plan.\n\u201c If the plaintiff can recover damages because of depreciation in the market value of his lots upon Cooper street, Venango street and Second street, owing to the said elevation of Second street, then his damages incurred thereby are in the amount of $2,000. If the plaintiff must be restricted solely to the injury which his lots fronting upon Second street have suffered by reason of the change of grade referred to, then his damages are $950.\n\u201c During the entire ownership of plaintiff, the various houses and lots' owned by him and indicated by the plan attached hereto, were occupied by different tenants, and were wholly unconnected and unrelated in every respect, save that of ownership, each from the other.\n\u201c The injury claimed to have been suffered by the house-lots fronting on Cooper street, consists of the disadvantages arising from the fact that Venango street does not connect with Second street at a level, and does not permit travel to and fro, since it is nine or more feet below the level of the latter street.\n\u201c The injury claimed to have been suffered by the lots fronting on Venango street, arises from the same disadvantages to travel as above.\u201d\nJudgment for plaintiff for $950. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was not entering judgment for $2,000.\nAaron Thompson, for appellant,\ncited, R. R. v. Patent, 17 W. N. 198; Snyder v. Lancaster, 20 W. N. 184; O\u2019Conner v. Pittsburgh, 18 Pa. 190; Jones v. Borough of Bangor, 144 Pa. 647.\nE. Spencer Miller, assistant city solicitor, and Charles E. Warwick, city solicitor, for appellee, not heard,\ncited, Cold v.
