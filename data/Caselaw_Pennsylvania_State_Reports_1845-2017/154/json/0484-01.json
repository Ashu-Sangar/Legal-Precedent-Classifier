A member of the association named his mother in the certificate, but subsequently, on his marriage, changed the beneficiary to his wife, delivering the certificate into her control. Before his death he obtained the certificate without his wife\u2019s knowledge or consent, surrendered it and took out a new one, with his mother named therein as beneficiary. Held, that the wife was not entitled to recover from the association the amount of the benefit; and that the act of May 11, 1881, excluding the constitution and by-laws of life and fire insurance companies as evidence unless attached to the policy, does not apply.\nArgued Oct. 25, 1892.\nAppeal, No. 306, Oct.

Subsequently, without his wife\u2019s knowledge or consent, he surrendered this certificate and took out another in his mother\u2019s name. The constitution and general laws of the association gave to the members the right to change the name of the beneficiary mentioned in the certificate. Alter the death of Beatty, plaintiff filed a bill in equity to restrain the association from paying the amount of the certificate to decedent\u2019s mother.
