        "text": "Mr. Justice Sharswood\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nBy his last will and testament, dated November 20th 1832, the testator, John Bowen, appointed his wife, Martha P. Bowen, executrix, and his brother-in-law, Austin Montgomery, executor, and authorized and empowered them, and the survivor of them, whenever they, or the survivor of them, at any time before his son should attain the age of twenty-one, should think it expedient so to do, to sell his real and personal estate and property in the island of Jamaica, either at public or private sale, and directed .them, in case of such sale, to invest the proceeds. In the said property, or the proceeds of such sale, he devised and bequeathed to his said wife a life-estate, with remainder to his children; and in the event which happened of their death unmarried, and without issue, before the age of twenty-one, then to his sister, Isabel B. Montgomery, wife of Austin Montgomery, for her own use during her life, and upon her death to his half brothers, Ralph W. Peacock and George S. Peacock, absolutely in fee. He made his wife his residuary legatee. There was no direct evidence of any sale under the provisions of the will, but Mrs. Martha P. Bowen, the executrix named, died July 15th 1849, having first made her last will, in which was the following clause: \u201c I direct that so much of my 6 per cent, bonds of the city of Cincinnati, as may be necessary for the purpose, be sold, and the proceeds thereof to be applied as a repayment to the Bowen Hall estate, in the island of Jamaica, for certain moneys received from the sale of land belonging to the estate, and which moneys have been used in the management of said estate.\u201d In pursuance of this direction, her executor after-wards paid to Austin Montgomery, surviving executor of John Bowen, $2929.61, of'.which $431.93 ivas afterwards refunded to meet claims against the estate of Mrs. Bowen, leaving the sum of $2497.68, which, with -interest, is the amount awarded below to the appellees, who are the representatives of Ralph W. Peacock and George S. Peacock. Austin Montgomery died in 1855, having first made his last will and testament, by which he devised and bequeathed his whole estate to his wife, Isabel B. Montgomery, and appointed her the executrix. She never filed an inventory, nor settled any account of her husband\u2019s estate. She died in 1865, having left a will, in which the appellants were named as executors. By subsequent proceedings, which it is unnecessary to recite, it Avas found that Mrs. Isabel B. Montgomery had received from her husband\u2019s estate an amount sufficient to meet the claims of the appellees for this and other sums. After a controversy in regard to the will of Mrs. Montgomery was finally decided, letters testamentary were issued to the appellants, July 17th 1866. They filed their account April 21st 1868, Avhich Avas referred to an auditor, before Avhom the appellees appeared by counsel, and made claim to the sum now in controversy. This is a succinct statement of the facts so far as material to the question involved in this appeal.\nIt is very clear that the amount received by Austin Montgomery, under the provision of the will of Mrs. Bowen, before referred to, Avas received by him in his character as surviving executor of John BoAven, and Avas held by him in trust for the purposes of his will. It did not lie in his mouth to say that it was not the proceeds of a laAvful sale by the executors. Even if this had been the fact, it Avould not have altered the case. He received it as bequeathed by the will, \u201c as a repayment to the Bowen Hall estate, in the island of Jamaica, for certain moneys received for the sale of land belonging to the estate.\u201d He took it, therefore, upon that footing \u2014 impressed with the trust \u2014 however, in truth, the money may have come to the hands of the testatrix. Nor can it be pretended that Mrs. Bowen, as life-tenant, had any right to use such proceeds in the management of the estate. She honestly recognised that they had been misapplied by her, and therefore directed them to be repaid to the estate.\nIt only remains then to inquire whether the appellees have been guilty of such laches as should preclude them in a court of equity from now advancing this claim.\nMrs. Isabel B. Montgomery was the life-tenant of the fund under the will of John Bowen, and the appellees, as remainder-men during her life, had no right to any part of it. Concede that they knew, or might have known, that there had been a breach of trust in Austin Montgomery in not investing it as directed by the will, Mrs. Montgomery was entitled to the interest for life; and supposing the principal to have been paid, or given to her by her husband, all that they could have done was to demand an inventory and security. If they were satisfied, either with Austin Montgomery or Mrs. Montgomery, as fully able to respond in their estate when the time should arrive, they had a perfect right to remain quiescent. They needed no further security. They made their claim as soon as they could do so with effect. We see no laches whatever wrhich ought to bar them.\nThere is undoubtedly an error in the decree in not deducting from the amount the interest on $2639.32, from the date of Mrs. Bowen\u2019s death, July 15th 1849, to the date of its payment, May 21st 1851, to which Isabel B. Montgomery, as life-tenant, was of course entitled. For this error the decree must be reversed and the record be remitted, in order that the final award of distribution may be corrected accordingly.\nDecree reversed and record remitted, that the award of distribution may be corrected according to this opinion. Each party to pay their own costs of this appeal.",

    "head_matter": "Montgomery\u2019s Appeal.\n1, Bowen authorized his real estate in Jamaioa to be sold by his executors, who were his wife and Montgomery; he gave her a life-estate in the land or its proceeds, and after her death a life-estate to his sister, the wife of Montgomery, with remainder over. The wife died in 1849, and by her will directed the repayment to the Jamaica estate of \u201cmoneys received from the sale of land belonging to the estate, which moneys have been used in the management of the estate.\u201d The money was paid to Montgomery as surviving executor in 1851. He died in 1855, leaving all the estate to his wife; upon its distribution in 1872: Held, that Montgomery had received the money as executor of Bowen, and as proceeds of his real estate, and the remaindermen were entitled to receive it in preference to his wife.\n2. By his will Bowen directed the proceeds of the sale of the land to be invested; Montgomery did not invest, his wife being entitled to it for life : Held, there were no laches in the remaindermen in not claiming sooner than at the distribution, although they had been aware of Montgomery\u2019s breach of trust.\nFebruary 5th 1875.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Williams, Merour, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ.\nAppeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia: Of January Term 1873, No. 91\u00bd.\nThis appeal was by the executors, &c., of Isabel B. Montgomery, deceased, from that part of the decree reported in the preceding case (Pleasants\u2019 Appeal), which confirmed the report of the auditor awarding to Pleasants any part of the balance in the hands of the administrator, &c., of Austin Montgomery, deceased. That case contains all the material facts of this. The sum awarded to Pleas-ants, as administrator, &c., of John Bowen (Peacock) and George W. Peacock, as stated in the preceding case, was made up as follows:\nThe amount paid the decedent under the direction of\nMartha P. Bowen\u2019s will $2497.68 Interest from December 16th 1865 to February 16th\n1872, ten days after the date of the auditor\u2019s report 924.14\n' $3^1,82\nAfter exceptions, the Orphans\u2019 Court confirmed the report.\nThe appellants assigned thirty errors, which involved the following points :\n1. That the fund did not arise from the sale of the land in Jamaica ordered to be sold, and therefore the decedent was not liable as trustee for the money.\n2. The fund was properly applied to the repair of the Jamaica estate.\n3. The claims were barred by lapse of time.\n4. In any view the sum awarded was too great; the amount paid to the decedent by Mrs. Bowen\u2019s executors, including interest from her death till the death of Isabel B. Montgomery, who as life-tenant of the land in Jamaica, was entitled to the interest of the proceeds during her life.\nGf. M. Dallas and P. MeOaTl (with whom was J. Sivord), for appellants.\nThe estate in Jamaica being wholly unproductive, the decedent as executor had the right to repair for the preservation of the inheritance, it having been damaged by a previous tenant: Caldecott v. Brown, 2 Hare 144; Dunne v. Dunne, 3 Sm. & G. 22; Sharshaw v. Gibbs, 1 Kay 333 ; Dent v. Dent, 30 Beav. 363. As to the bar by lapse of time \u2014 the parties acquiesced: Brice v. Stokes, 11 Ves. 326; Pickering v. Stamford, 2 Ves. Jr. 583; Simpson\u2019s Estate, 1 Phila. R. 300. The claimants slept too long on their rights: Hercy v. Dinwoody, 2 Ves. Jr. 89; Smith v. Clay, 3 Brown\u2019s C. C. 639 n.; Gress\u2019s Appeal, 2 Harris 463; Calhoun\u2019s Appeal, 3 Wright 225; Ashhurst\u2019s Appeal, 10 P. F. Smith 316. Public policy requires the discouragement of stale claims : Jones v. Tuberville, 2 Ves. Jr. 14; Ellison v. Moffatt, 1 Johns. Ch. R. 46; Gregory v. Gregory, Cooper 201; Bonny v. Rigard, 1 Cox 145, although claimants may be remaindermen; Andrew v. Wrigley, 4 Brown\u2019s C. C. 125; Harrison v. Hollins, 1 Sim. & Stu. 240; McDonald v. Harding, 7 Sim. 178; Brown v. Cross, 14 Beav. 105; Smilie v. Biffle, 2 Barr 52; Hassler v. Bitting, 4 Wright 68.\nR. MeGfrath (with whom was S. Rood), for appellee,\nas to the effect of the lapse of time cited: Keen\u2019s Appeal, 10 P. F. Smith 504; Harper\u2019s Estate, 1 Brewster 478; Summerville v. Holliday, 1 Watts 507; Foulk v. Brown, 2 Watts 209; Price\u2019s Appeal, 4 P. F. Smith 485 ; Jackson v. Stiles, 4 Johns. R. 490; Barton v. Dickens, 12 Wright 522.\nMarch 1st 1875."
