        "text": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court,\nPer Curiam.\nIt has been held in several cases that a married woman is liable for repairs to her separate estate, made at her request, and necessary for its preservation and enjoyment. The last case is Lippincott & Wife v. Hopkins, 7 P. F. Smith 328, and the point is there directly ruled. There is no express statutory provision covering the case; but this liability is the necessary result of the rights of the wife and disabilities of the husband, conferred by the Act of 11th April 1848. Yain would be its enactment, that the property of a married woman shall be owned and enjoyed by her as her own separate property, and shall not be subject to the debts of her husband, or in any manner transf\u00e9rred or encumbered by him, if she. have no power to take care of it and preserve it from ruin. If the roof of her house be blown off by a storm, or sink into utter decay, so that the building becomes untenantable, what is to become of it if she cannot repair it ? Her husband may be unable or unwilling to advance the money. It is said she can borrow it; but this supposes the property to be a sufficient security, and that the husband will unite in a mortgage of it, and also that the creditor will be willing to risk the application of the money advanced, over which he has no control after it has passed out of his hands. The rights of property of the wife necessarily imply a power to repair. To what extent the wife can improve her property, or make extensive and expensive repairs by contracts binding on her, was probably the doubt in the mind of our brother who stated it in Moore v. Cornell, 18 P. F. Smith 323. But clearly there can be no reason to doubt her power to charge her estates for proper and really necessary repairs.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Lippincott versus Leeds.\n1. A married woman is liable for repairs to her separate estate made at her request, and necessary for its preservation and enjoyment.\n2. Her liability is the result of her rights and the disabilities of her husband under the Act of April 11th 1848; her rights of property imply a power to repair.\n3. Lippincott v. Hopkins, 7 P. F. Smith 328, followed; Moore v. Cornell, 18 Id. 323, distinguished.\nFebruary 12th 1875.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Williams, Mercur, Gordoh, Paxson and Woodward, JJ.\nError to the District Court of Philadelphia: Of January Term 1873. No. 284.\nThis was an action of assumpsit, brought November 17th 1869, by Joseph Leeds against Wallace Lippincott and Mary Ann Lippincott his wife.\nThe declaration was: In the first count \u2014 that plaintiff, at the request of \u201c defendants,\u201d furnished materials and repaired two houses, and the \u201c defendants \u201d promised to pay him for his services and the materials. In the second conut \u2014 that the plaintiff, at the request of the defendant, Mary Ann Lippincott, furnished materials and repaired two houses \u201cof the defendant, Mary Ann Lippincott,\u201d who promised to pay him for the materials and labor in the repair. In the third count \u2014 that plaintiff, at the request of Mary Ann Lippincott, undertook to furnish materials and repair two houses of Mary Ann Lippincott, who promised to pay plaintiff for his labor and materials in the repair, and that the repair \u201c was necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of said houses,\u201d and therefore the said Mary Ann became liable to pay plaintiff so much as the labor and material were worth; \u201c the said two houses being the separate estate of said defendant, Mary Ann Lippincott.\u201d The fourth count was the common count for work and labor and materials.\nAfter plea of non-assumpsit and replication, the death of Wallace Lippincott was suggested. Mary Ann Lippincott, the surviving defendant, pleaded that, at the time of the alleged promises, &c., and before the supposed causes of action accrued, she was a married woman, the wife of Wallace Lippincott. The plaintiff replied that the work, &c., was at the request of Mary Ann Lippincott, on her own separate estate, &c.\nThe ease was tried by Lynd, J., October 9th 1872.\nThe plaintiff testified that Mrs. Lippincott came to him in July 1867, to cover her roofs and do some painting; she ordered the work done. It was done in July and August 1867, and in September 1868.\nMrs. Lippincott, defendant, testified that she was a married woman when the work was done; she was owner of the property on which the repairs were done; had bought it when she was married.\nThere was evidence by both parties as to the value of the work and materials, their character, &c.\nThe defendant submitted, amongst others, the following points, which were refused:\n4. There being no evidence of any employment of plaintiff on the part of Mr. Lippincott, or to which he assented, and the defendant, Mary Ann Lippincott, having been a married woman, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.\n5. A married woman cannot be held liable for any such indebtedness as is claimed by the plaintiff in this case.\n6. Under the pleadings and evidence in this case the plaintiff cannot recover.\n7. The verdict should be for the defendant.\nThe verdict was for plaintiff for $173.90.\nThe defendant took a writ of error, and, amongst other errors, assigned the refusal of the foregoing points.\nJ. S. Sloan, for plaintiff in error.'\nA married woman cannot dispose of her property without her husband\u2019s consent: Mahon v. Gormley, 12 Harris 82.
