Graham et al., and as confirmed by the court, has for one of its termini a private road leading to a public highway, called the Beaver road, and for its other the Ohio river.\nThat it was error in the court to make such confirmation, under the circumstances, is patent from the Act of Assembly under which the proceedings were had.\nThat act (of 1886) requires that such private road shall have for its principal t\u00e9rminus the dwelling or plantation of the petitioner. If it have not this essential feature it is outside the provisions of the act, and therefore without authority and void: Sandy Lick Creek Hoad, 1 P. F. Smith 94.\nThe court committed a further error in fixing the width of the road at thirty-three feet, as the limit prescribed by the act is twenty-five feet.\nException is also taken to the record because the name of Hilands appears in the report as a viewer, instead of that of Bowman, the appointee of the court; hutas it is admitted that Bowman was the county surveyor, and Hilands his deputy, this substitution was regular and proper under the Act of Assembly \u201c Belating to the office of Surveyor and Civil Engineer for the county of Allegheny,\u201d February 24th 1873, Pamph.

    "head_matter": "Killbuck Private Road.\n1. A private road must have for its principal terminus the plantation or dwelling of the petitioner.\n2. It is error to fix the width of a private road at thirty-three feet, the act limiting the width to twenty-five feet.\n3. By an Act of Assembly (February 24th 1873) a surveyor is to be appointed for Allegheny county, with authority to appoint a deputy to perform his duties; the surveyor to act as artist on road views, &e. Viewers were appointed, the county surveyor by name being one, without designating his office. The report was signed by his deputy. Held, that the substitution of the deputy was proper.\n4. Sandy Lick Creek Road, 1 P. F. Smith 94, recognised.\nOctober 12th 1874.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Williams, Mercur and Gordon, JJ.\nCertiorari to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Allegheny county: Of October and November Term 1874, No. 87.\nThe proceedings in this case were for a private road, upon the petition and for the use of James M. Graham, Benjamin Waters and F. H. Anderson, in Killbuck township.\nThe petition was presented April 26th 1873, representing that the petitioners labored under \u201cinconvenience for want of a private road to lead from the end of a private road (granted by IT. P. Mueller, deceased, to the grantees of certain property in said ITillbuck township, the above-named petitioners being some of said grantees) to the river at, &c., on the ground or land of Robert Phillips.\u201d\nViewers were appointed who reported; that the road prayed for was necessary, and they returned a private road as follows:\u2014\n\u201cBeginning at the east end of said private road at a post in centre thereof, thence on lands of Robert Phillips, south 51\u00b0 east 10 perches, more or less, to low-water line on the Ohio river near to said bunch of willows, a diagram of which is hereunto annexed. The above road seems to be a continuance of the road by H. P. Mueller, and terminating on the lands of Robert Phillips, and he for some reason, best known to himself, has put a gate on said road, near to his line, preventing the petitioners from the use of that end of the road, which leads to the Ohio river. We award no damages to Robert Phillips, he having refused to give a release.\u201d\nOn the 2d of June 1873, the road was approved and when opened to be thirty-three feet wide.\nOn the 2d of August 1873, Robert Phillips presented a petition for review, representing that the \u201c private road, if confirmed by the court, will be very injurious to your petitioner, and burthensome to him, and that said road is not necessary for said petitioners for the same, and further that the said petitioners to said private road are not entitled to have the same, as it does not lead from their property to a public road, and is not necessary as a private road, and the petitioners for said private road have now a good public road to said river close by and nearly parallel to this private road.\u201d\nThe re-viewers reported:\u2014\n\u201cWe have reviewed said private road from a point on the Beaver road, thence south along the centre of said private road 16-J feet wide 11.8 perches to centre of said road at 33 feet wide, thence south 74\u00b0 20' east along the centre of said road 16.2 perches to Robert Phillips\u2019s line, thence through land of said Robert Phillips to the Ohio river. We do further report that-in our opinion that part of said road through land of Robert Phillips is unnecessary and of great damage to him. Not necessary because the parties asking said road have a front of 16.2 perches on the Ohio river between said points.\u201d\nThis report was approved and ordered to be filed.\nOn the 4th of October 1873, Anderson and Graham, two of the original petitioners, petitioned for a re-review; the court appointed George M. Bowman (artist), William Miller and James M. Smith, re-reviewers. Bowman was county surveyor of Allegheny county.\nThe re-reviewers reported that they were \u201cof opinion that a road is necessary at the place prayed for in said petition, and that after examining a deed of conveyance from H. P. Mueller, Esq., to Robert Phillips, whereby the land therein described is conveyed to him, the said Robert Phillips, for the purpose of a road, and for no other purpose whatever, and under certain conditions, to wit: The express provision, that the said party of the second part, his heirs or assigns, shall make said road at their own proper expense, and keep the same in good and sufficient repair at all times hereafter, the party of the first part reserving to himself, his heirs or assigns, of his other land at or near Killbuek station, now owned by him, the right to use said road from the Beaver road to the end thereof on the Ohio river, without further let or hindrance, to have free ingress and egress therein for ever, for the purpose of a road, and for no other purpose whatever, and notwithstanding ample provision has thus in our opinion been made for the accommodation of the petitioners, we have nevertheless laid out and returned for private use the following described road, commencing at a point at equal distances between the posts to which a gate is swung across the end next the river of the said road, thence south, &c., to the Ohio river, together 70J feet of river beach, the property of said Robert Phillips, to whom, having been applied to for a release of damages and being refused, we award no damages. James D. Hilands, Deputy Engineer, William Miller, James M. Smith.\nBy Act of February 24th 1873, (Pamph. L. 155), the District Court of Allegheny county was authorized to appoint a \u201c surveyor and civil engineer\u201d for that county, who should have authority to\nappoint a deputy. Amongst other duties imposed by the act on the surveyor and engineer, it was enacted that he should \u201c either in person or by deputy act as artist in all road and bridge views, &c., where the same may be ordered by the court,\u201d &c.\nOn the 2d of December 1873, the report of the re-reviewers was approved and the road ordered to he opened thirty-three feet wide.\nExceptions to the reports were filed by Phillips.\nI. That Bowman was appointed a viewer and the report was not signed by him but by Iiilands.\n3. The report finds that petitioners have ample accommodations without the private road.\n7. There is a public road from the Beaver road, just below ex-ceptant\u2019s private road, and landing.\nThe location of the different roads, &c., involved in this controversy appear to he as follows: Phillips owned land on the Ohio river, south eastwardly of the petitioners\u2019 lands; from the line of Phillips\u2019s land there is a private road (referred to in the reports) to Glendale station on the Beaver road and the Pittsburg, Eort Wayne and Chicago Railroad; at the line of Phillips\u2019s land and the end of the private road there is a gate referred to in the reports ; the existing private road (Mueller\u2019s) from Phillips for a distance of 162 perches is thirty-three feet wide ; at the end of -that distance it turns about at right angles and reaches the Beaver road at the distance of 11.8 perches, being for that distance sixteen and a half feet wide.\nOn the 27th of February 1874, .the court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report of the re-reviewers.\nPhillips removed the record to the Supreme Court by certiorari; he there assigned for error :\n3. Confirming the re-review made by other persons than those appointed.\n4. Confirming the report although it found that the petitioners had ample accommodation without the private road.\n6. Fixing the width of the private road at thirty-three feet.\n8. None of the petitions asked for a private road from the dwellings or plantations of the petitioners to the highway or place of public resort or to some other private way.\nIt. Woods (with whom were S. Woods and J. WMteselT), for certiorari,\ncited Sandy Lick Creek Road, 1 P. F. Smith 94.\nJ. It. Large, cont\u00f3.\nNovember 16th 1874."
