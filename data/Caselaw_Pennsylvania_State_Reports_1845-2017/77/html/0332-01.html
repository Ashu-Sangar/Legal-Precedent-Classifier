That the obligors failed to make up the amount of $45,000, good and valid subscriptions to the stock of said railroad company, in accordance with the terms and conditions of said writing, leaving a large deficiency on the subscription, say some $16,000. Upon a fair and equitable division among the solvent obligors to said writing, it was agreed that each obligor’s share of the deficiency of said guaranty, so far as relates to the subscription to be made, was $230. That when that part of the Lewisburg, Centre and Spruce Creek Railroad extending from Lewisburg to western boundary of Mifflinburg was completed, said company refused to run their locomotives and cars thereon until the balance of said $45,000 was paid or advanced; and the obligors to said instrument of writing, including the defendant, being very anxious to have the cars run on said road, D. H. Miller, J. E. Herr and O. B. Mensch were induced to advance to said railroad company the balance of the $45,000, with the agreement that said obligation should stand for <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>their use, and to collect thereon from such of the guarantors who might refuse to pay up their share, the defendant and other obligors assenting and agreeing thereto. That the said railroad company, being so advanced, did commence and continue running their locomotives and freight and passenger cars on said railroad mentioned in the bond of guaranty. That the defendant, having neglected to pay his share of said deficiency, suit was brought to recover his share of the same, to wit, the amount agreed upon as aforesaid. That Abraham Menseh, the obligor referred to in said special plea of defendant, agreed also to pay his share, $230, and did pay thereon, so as to reduce it to $72.50, but neglected to pay that balance, although frequently promising so to do, he was sued before George N. Youngman, Esq., a justice of the peace, to recover the same. In said suit before said justice nothing was embraced or passed upon, but the balance of said Abraham Mensch’s own share of the deficiency of $45,000, good and valid subscriptions to said railroad company, nor was any claim made in that suit in relation to procuring right of way between Lewisburg and Mifflinburg, nor in relation to grounds for'depots. That there was nothing investigated before George N. Youngman, Esq., the justice of the peace aforesaid, but to ascertain the balance due by said Abraham Menseh on his share of said deficiency of subscription, which share was found to be $74.43, for which said justice entered judgment, and from which judgment defendant appealed and entered a rule to have arbitrators chosen. Arbitrators were chosen, plaintiff’s claim established, and defendant making no defence, the arbitrators, on the 26th of April 1873, filed their report, finding in favor of the plaintiff and against Abraham Menseh, $74.43, which was for balance of said share of Abraham Menseh. • That amount of said award was paid over to George B. Miller, one of the firm of George F. Miller &amp; Sons. This arbitration arrangement was evidently a manoeuvre on part of some of the obligors in said guaranty to try to get clear by some imagined technicality from paying their honest proportion of the deficiency of said guaranty of stock. It is denied by plaintiff that the suit against Abraham Menseh, referred to in defendant’s special plea, was for the same matter for which the present suit against Samuel Stees was brought.”</p>

Miller, one of the beneficial plaintiffs, testified, that after the execution of the guaranty, work on the road proceeded quite rapidly and calls were made for money in pretty quick succession. The subscribers failed to pay the instalments, but the company finished the road nearly for the cars to run; at this time there was a considerable deficiency. The president of the company, on the 20th of September 1871, said the road was done, but the company would not run it until the subscribers paid the deficiency of their subscription, amounting to $7000 or $8000. On that day, O. P. Mensch, Iierr and witness gave their obligations for the deficiency, supposing each guarantor would pay his proportion. A meeting of the guarantors was held; the defendant was present; the amount each guarantor was to pay was discussed; it was not known what the share of each would be; it was agreed each should pay $175 ; defendant had given his note for this sum, but it was claimed it was more: all agreed to pay the amount of their shares of the deficiency; the only question was the amount. The amount was fixed at $220 for each guarantor to pay on the settlement. Defendant did not agree that his liability on the guaranty was $220. The beneficial plaintiffs gave their obligations to the railroad company for between $7000 and $8000; the company accepted it; $3700 were paid in cash, and the company accepted the note of the beneficial plaintiffs for the balance as cash; the company never assigned the guaranty to the beneficial plaintiffs.</p>

The plaintiffs declared upon a joint and several bond, executed by the defendant below -with others, guaranteeing to them good and valid subscriptions to their stock to the amount of $45,000, to be applied in a certain way, and alleging a breach. To this the defendant pleaded in bar that the plaintiffs had sued upon the same bond another of the obligors, one Abraham Mensch, and recovered a judgment thereon for the sum of $74.43, and that said judgment had been paid and satisfied. To this plea the plaintiffs filed a replication, admitting the judgment, but averring that the beneficial plaintiffs — two of whom were co-obligors — bad advanced the money to the railroad company, and that the other solvent obligors had agreed that the bond should stand for the use of the beneficial plaintiffs, to recover thereon their several proportions— the defendant and other obligors assenting and agreeing thereto; that Abraham Mensch also was a party to this agreement, and the judgment pleaded was for so much of his share of this deficiency as remained unpaid. There was no rejoinder to this replication. In strictness then there was no issue to be tried by the jury. Put the parties chose to go to trial on the pleadings without a formal issue, and in this state it is settled that an omission to compel the opposite party to perfect the pleadings beforehand, is a tacit agreement to waive matters of form, and try the cause on the merits, just as going to trial on a short plea is, according to our practice, a waiver of the right to demand a plea in full form; Sauerman <em>v. </em>Weckerly, 17 S. &amp; R. 116 ; Collum <em>v. </em>Andrews, <a href="/watts/6/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts 516" data-case-ids="1846110" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0516-01">6 Watts 516</a>. The plaintiffs then could not ask this court to reverse on this ground. And neither can the defendant set up the imperfection or defects of the pleading, all which he has waived by going to trial on the merits. He contends now that the replication was a departure from the declaration. Concede that it was — that it was a new cause of action — he might have demurred on that ground. But who ever heard of a departure in pleading being set up as a defence upon a trial before the jury ? The case stood as if the replication had been the original declaration, and the defendant' having gone to trial without a plea, it was a tacit agreement to try on the merits; in other words, a general traverse. Is it to be doubted then, that, had the declaration been in debt upon a special agreement by the obligors with the beneficial plaintiffs, that each of them should pay their proportion of the deficiency, and alleging what the deficiency was, the judgment against Abraham Mensch, one of those co-obligors, for his proportion of that de<a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>ficiency, would have been no bar to a recovery against Samuel Stees, another of them ? Yet, that was the issue, as it must be now regarded to have been before the jury. There was certainly evidence which went to support the allegations of fact in the replication. The record of the suit against Mensch showed that it was for what remained unpaid of his share of the deficiency. True, the suit was in the name of the legal plaintiffs, the obligees in the bond; but as the proceeding was commehced before a justice of the peace, that did not determine its true character under the Act of the 20th March 1810, which provides, that on an appeal “ the casé shall be decided on its facts and merits only; and no deficiency of form or substance in the record or proceedings returned, nor any mistake in the form or name of the action shall prejudice either party in the court to which the appeal shall be made: Comfort <em>v. </em>Leland, <a href="/whart/3/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Whart. 81" data-case-ids="1833443" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0081-01">3 Whart. 81</a>. We think, therefore, that the learned court below erred in instructing the jury to find for the defendant. As the case goes back for another trial, it will be well for the counsel of the plaintiffs below to have the record put into the proper shape, as the power of amendment now possessed by the courts, both as to the form of the action and the names of the parties, will enable them to do.</p>
