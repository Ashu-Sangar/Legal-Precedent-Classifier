The sheriff returned his distribution of the proceeds of sale. Exceptions to part of the distribution of the proceeds of sale were filed by Catharine Weyman, and the sheriff by order of the court paid the proceeds of sale into court. W. E. Austin, Esq., was appointed auditor to pass upon the exceptions; after-wards certain undisputed claims were paid out by agreement, leaving to be passed on by the auditor the sum of $1288.34, the sum awarded by the sheriff to the executors of Jonas Butterfield, deceased, and $104.32 awarded to Weyman and wife, the defendants in the execution. Philip Weyman was afterwards allowed to join in and prosecute the exceptions filed by his wife.</p>

The bargain was verbal, no papers drawn nor money paid at the time. The price agreed upon for the lot was $400. Before any money was paid, and some time after the bargain was made, Weyman dug a cellar and began to build upon the lot; did a part of the work himself, and employed Lewis Dengler to do the carpenter work on the house, for which Dengler obtained judgment against Weyman. Weyman and his family occupied the house, with the exception of three years, when he rented it, until his separation from his wife, four or five years ago. * * * It does not appear, however, that Mrs. Weyman had anything to do with the building of the house, Weyman’s wife paid, after the house was built, ten dollars in money to Mr. O’Hara on account of the lot, and Weyman worked for Mr. O’Hara, to the amount of thirty or forty dollars, all which were credited as payments by Mr. O’Hara. Weyman collected the rent of the house during a tenant’s occupancy, and was always treated as its owner.- * * *</p>

It is not disputed that the money thus paid was the largest part of the sum for which Mrs. Weyman afterwards gave a mortgage to Jonas Butterfield, and which is hereafter mentioned. ■ When O’Hara delivered the deed to Mrs. Weyman, Philip Weyman was not present, nor is there any evidence to show that he had released his claim to the property.</p>

The sale on the judgment against the husband and wife divested the titles of both. How then shall the proceeds of sale be distributed ? Shall the residue, after satisfying the judgment on which the property was sold and the other liens and charges for which the husband was liable, be given to the husband as decreed by the District Court; or shall it be distributed between the husband and the representatives of the wife’s mortgagee as'claimed by the appellants ? If the controversy was between the husband and wife, manifestly the fund should be divided between them in accordance with their respective rights and equities. The evidence shows that in 1847 the husband purchased the land of O’Hara for the sum of $400; that he built a two-story brick dwelling-house and frame kitchen thereon, and paid forty or fifty dollars of the pur<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>chase-money. In 1867 the wife paid, the residue, amounting to $669.50, and obtained from O’Hara a deed for the land. The sum paid by the wife, with interest, to the sheriff’s sale, is then the measure of her interest in the land and of her share of the proceeds of sale. If so, it is clear that the husband would not be entitled as against the wife to the whole of the fund left for distribution, but only to the residue after reimbursing the wife the amount of the purchase-money paid O’Hara. But the controversy here is not between the husband and wife, but between the husband and the legal representatives of the wife’s mortgagee. Are the latter then entitled to the wife’s share of the fund ? If not, they have no standing in court, and it is immaterial what are the equities between the husband and wife. If it be conceded that the wife had no power to execute the mortgage as a feme sole trader, and that the mortgage was void because the husband did not join with her in its execution, it does not follow that the judgment obtained against the wife on the mortgage was a nullity. On the contrary, the execution of the mortgage is conclusively established by the judgment in the scire facias upon it: Edmonson <em>v. </em>Nichols, 10 Harris 74. The mortgage is merged in the judgment, and, even if null and void, cannot be collaterally impeached : Hartman <em>v. </em>Ogborn, 4 P. F. Smith 120. In this respect the judgment on a mortgage under the Act of 1705, which is a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>differs from a judgment <em>in personam </em>on the bond of a married woman which is absolutely void. Doubtless the judgment on the mortgage was voidable, and might have been set aside or reversed at the instance of the wife; but until directly avoided by her, its validity cannot be inquired into or impugned collaterally except for fraud : Lowber’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20887" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 887">8 W. &amp; S. 887</a> <em>; </em>Billings <em>v. </em>Russell, 11 Harris 189; Yaple <em>v. </em>Titus, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20195" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Wright 195">5 Wright 195</a>. The judgment on the mortgage then cannot be disregarded, but must be treated as conclusive in this proceeding : Thompson’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 175 ; if so, it bound the wife’s interest in the land and is entitled to so much of the fund as was produced by the sale thereof. The decree of the District Court must therefore' be reversed, and the wife’s share of the proceeds of sale appropriated to the judgment on the mortgage and the residue to the husband. Distributing the fund in this way will do exact justice between the parties. It will give to the appellants the money which the mortgagee lent the wife to enable her to pay the purchase-money and procure a deed for the land; and it will give to the husband the proceeds realized from the sale of his equitable estate, and he can claim no more either in law or equity.</p>
