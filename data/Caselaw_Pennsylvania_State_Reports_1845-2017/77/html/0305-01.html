This point is correct, unless the judgments, executions and sale were in fraud af the bankrupt law; that is to say, with a view to give or attain a preference in an insolvent debtor’s estate.

To this point I assent, but must add, that if the plaintiffs were the active parties in procuring a preference by judgments and executions, knowing, or having reason to know he was insolvent, the preference would be in fraud of the bankrupt law, and a good title did not, as against it, pass to plaintiffs'by sheriff’s sale.</p>

The facts are for the jury, and we trust they, by this time, see that the great question for their determination is, whether there was collusion between the plaintiffs and defendant Kahn, to give them a preference over other creditors, or that the plaintiffs knew when they took judgments, issued executions and sold his property, that he was insolvent, or had reason to believe he was. If the testimony makes this out to your satisfaction, the defendants will be entitled to your verdict; for this took place within four months before the first decree in bankruptcy. If this is not made out from the evidence, to your entire satisfaction, then you will find for the plaintiffs such an amount of damages as you think the goods sold by the sheriff were fairly worth.”</p>

Our late lamented associate, Chief Justice Thompson, before whom this case was tried at Nisi Prius, was undoubtedly right in following the current of the decisions in the United States Circuit Court, but those decisions have since been reviewed in the Supreme Court of the United States, and a different rule established: Wilson <em>v. </em>City Bank, <a href="/us/84/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="17 Wall. 473" data-case-ids="62410" data-case-paths="/us/84/0473-01">17 Wall. 473</a>.</p>
    <p id="b308-8" data-blocks='[["BL_308.9",308,[291,1076,1170,434]]]'>It is now contended, however, that the uncontradicted evidence of the plaintiffs themselves showed a clear case of actual collusion, on which the court would have been justified in giving a binding direction to the jury. We cannot assent to this contention. Actual collusion, or, in other words, fraud in fact, is always a question for the jury, and however convincing may be the evidence on the subject, it would be to confound the province of the two tribunals for the court to assume the decision of it. Their only control over the matter is in the right to order a new trial, should a verdict be rendered clearly against the weight of the evidence.</p>
