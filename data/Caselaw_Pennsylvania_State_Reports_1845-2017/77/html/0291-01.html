The record further shows, that on the hearing before the inquest, the defendants appeared by counsel, and introduced witnesses in their behalf. No objection was there taken to the manner in which the jurors had been selected or summoned. After a full trial on the merits, the inquest found against the defendants.</p>

The record of the aldermen was regular on its face. There was no averment of fraud, nor that the jurors were not substantial freeholders. They were not charged with improper conduct in the discharge of their duties. They, as well as the aldermen, possessed all the qualifications necessary to give them jurisdiction. The effort was to contradict the record on parol proof of an irregularity in the manner of summoning three jurors, in place of that number of those first summoned, who failed to attend. To establish fraud or want of jurisdiction, the court might have heard facts by affidavits, but not to show an irregularity which contradicted the records. When heard by the court below they do not come regularly before this court and should be disregarded: Boggs <em>v. </em>Black, <a href="/binn/1/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Binn. 336" data-case-ids="1787956" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0336-01">1 Binn. 336</a>; Blashford <em>v. </em>Duncan, 2 S. &amp; R. 480; Cunningham <em>v. </em>Gardner, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 120" data-case-ids="1856451" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0120-01">4 W. &amp; S. 120</a>; McMillan <em>v. </em>Graham, 4 Barr 140; Union Canal Company <em>v. </em>Keiser, 7 Harris 134; Bedford <em>v. </em>Kelly, 11 P.

The former was a case of partition in the Orphans’ Court, in which an inquest had been awarded. The case is badly reported, but it appears the jurors were summoned by a constable from a list furnished by one whose authority is not shown-. In setting aside the inquisition, this court said there was a gross inequality in the partition, and the case. presented “ a bundle of irregularities.” In the latter case the <em>record </em>showed that the sheriff had deputed one juror to execute the writ, and the depositions showed that this special deputation was made at the request of the landlord’s attorney. This was therefore a clear case of fraud on the part of the landlord.</p>

It is true the Acts of Assembly, which hold that pleading the general issue or a trial on the merits in any court, civil or criminal, is a waiver of all irregularities in drawing and summoning the jurors, do not in express terms apply to an inquest under the Landlord and Tenant Act, yet the whole reason and spirit of them applies with full force: Burton <em>v. </em>Ehrlich, 3 Harris 236; Fife <em>et al. v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 Casey 429; Jewell <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 10 Harris 94.
