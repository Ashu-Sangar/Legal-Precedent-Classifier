The defendant filed an affidavit of defence, setting out in substance that by the provisions of the company’s charter, the city of Pittsburg was designated as one terminus of its railroad, and the borough of Washington, in the county of Washington, as the other terminus thereof; that the defendant by the terms and legal effect of the contract upon which the suit is founded, engaged to pay the sum therein mentioned, only upon condition that the plaintiff would in good faith observe the provisions of its charter, and construct its road to the terminal points designated; that the plaintiff, while claiming to have completed its road, has not extended it to either of the terminal points aforesaid, but has terminated it on the north at the town of Mansfield, some eight miles distant from the city of Pittsburg, and has finally abandoned the construction of its road in the direction of the said city; and on the south at the Cumberland road, on the farm of Catharine Shirls, two thousand feet, or <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>thereabouts, distant from the terminus fixed by its charter, and contemplated and required by the contract between it and this defendant, and has there erected passenger and freight depots, engine house and other buildings necessary for the accommodation of its business; starts and stops all its trains, and receives and delivers all its freight at the said point, and so has continued to do since the opening of its road, and has definitely fixed and determined the same as the southern terminus thereof.</p>

Under the provisions of the Act the writ of error must, therefore, be dismissed without prejudice to the plaintiff’s right to trial by jury and a second writ of error after final judgment. Where the decision of the court below in refusing to enter judgment for the plaintiff, in default of a sufficient affidavit of defence, is sustained, it is manifest that the act intends that the case shall go back and be tried precisely as it would have been if no writ of error had been taken, and therefore any discussion of the principles of law involved in the action would be out of place until the case comes here on a writ of error after verdict and judgment.</p>
