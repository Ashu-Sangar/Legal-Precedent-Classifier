In the case in hand, the plaintiff charges, that through the default of the officers of the city of Corry, the ice and snow had been permitted to accumulate, upon the sidewalk in question, in such a manner as to be dangerous to foot passengers, and that by reason thereof, he fell and received the injuries of which he complains. Whether this were so or not, was a question for the jury, and as such the court should have submitted it.</p>

    <p id="b113-8" data-blocks='[["BL_113.6",113,[139,1177,1170,1251]]]'>It is argued, however, that, as the obstruction complained of was the result of natural causes, over which man has no control, therefore the defendant is not liable. This would be true if the effects produced by these causes were beyond human remedy; but ordinarily such is not the case. Roads are constantly being worn by the never-ceasing action of the elements; but no one imagines that this is an excuse for a neglect to repair them. A sudden flood may render a public bridge or highway impassable, but surely that is no reason for allowing it to remain so for ever. A municipality cannot prevent the general slipperiness of its streets, caused by the snow and ice during the winter, but it can prevent such accumulations thereof, in the shape of ridges and hills, as render their passage dangerous. It is no more difficult to remove or level such obstructions than it is those occasioned by the water and earth during the summer.

The plaintiff’s second, sixth, and seventh points should have been affirmed. If the obstruction was one of such long duration as to be generally observable, the city would be charged with constructive notice thereof. So, the true measure of damages, in addition to that indicated in the seventh point, would be the plaintiff’s actual permanent loss of earning power, occasioned by the accident. What he gets from his present employers by way of wages, cannot go in mitigation of damages, any more than would the donations of friends and neighbors; but what he earns from any source may, with other things, be considered as going to prove what his earning powers actually are.</p>
