The difference was of form only, and the case was therefore within the statute which is to receive a liberal construction : Knapp <em>v. </em>Hartung, 23 P. F. Smith 290. If the plaintiff adheres to his original cause of action, he may add a count substantially different from the declaration: Cabarga <em>v. </em>Seeger, 5 Harris 514; Schoneman <em>v. </em>Fegley, 7 Barr 433. Plaintiff sues, not for a fraud upon the company, but for a fraud upon, himself, and such suit can be maintained by individual stockholders: Kimmel <em>v. </em>Stoner, 6 Harris 155; Kimmel <em>v. </em>Gosling, <a href="/grant/2/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Grant 125" data-case-ids="227637" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0125-01">2 Grant 125</a>.

    <p id="b447-9" data-blocks='[["BL_447.11",447,[104,1771,1169,477]]]'>A careful examination of this record discloses no error for which the judgment should be reversed. In the view of the case taken by the plaintiff in error, that the action lay against the company only, there would be force in some of the exceptions taken at the trial. But the evidence of the plaintiff below presented a case of individual overreaching on part of the defendant, and it was so submitted to the jury, whose verdict establishes this view of the defendant’s conduct. In that light we discover no error in the manner the case was treated. If the evidence were insufficient to support this view, or its weight fell upon the other side, the remedy of the defendant was in the court below.</p>

The test is in the cause of action, not the Statute of Limitations. If the cause of action is the same declared upon then the suit, <em>quoad </em>it, was brought in time. If the cause of action was not the same, <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>then the action was not brought for it, and the Statute of Limitations would fairly apply. The fact that the first <em>narr. </em>was for money had and received (this being the material count), did not make the change from assumpsit to case in deceit, necessarily a change in the cause of action. The same circumstances of fraudulent imposition, showing that the defendant had obtained the money of the plaintiff, which <em>ex equo et bono, </em>he ought to return, would support either form of action.</p>
