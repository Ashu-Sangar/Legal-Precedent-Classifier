The assignment was recorded the same day. The mortgage and bond, with the assignment, were left in the possession of Fox, who was Neide’s conveyancer and agent, had acted for him in the purchase of the mortgage, and had been his intimate friend for a long time.

    <p id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[116,638,1176,1174]]]'>Thus it appears that the language of the Acts of Assembly providing for the recording of written instruments has not generally been mandatory. When recorded, however, we do not understand the effect thereof is in any respect lessened by the absence of an imperative command to record.. It is optional whether or not to record. When the election is made and an instrument authorized by law to be recorded, is actually recorded, all the incidents and force of a public record attach to that record. It is an early and well recognised principle that one great object in spreading an instrument of writing on a public record, is to give constructive notice of its contents to all mankind: Levine <em>v. </em>Will, <a href="/dall/1/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Dall. 430" data-case-ids="12149636,12149709,1408601" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0430-01,/dall/1/0430-02,/us/1/0445-01">1 Dall. 430</a>; Evans <em>v. </em>Jones <em>et </em>al., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Yeates%20173" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Yeates 173">1 Yeates 173</a> ; Brotherton <em>v. </em>Livingston, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 334" data-case-ids="1854648" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0334-01">3 W. &amp; S. 334</a>. We discover no evidence of legislative attempt to make the record of the assignment of a mortgage less effective than that of the mortgage itself. It was held in Pryor <em>v. </em>Wood <em>et al., </em>7 Casey 142, the assignment of a mortgage, duly executed and recorded passed the legal title, and no suit could subsequently be maintained thereon in the name of the assignor for the use of the assignee. In Partridge v. Partridge, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%2078" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Wright 78">2 Wright 78</a>, where the assignment was not under seal nor in the presence of witnesses and not acknowledged and recorded, it was held, the scire facias might issue in the name of the holder of the legal title for the use of the assignee. The 1st sect, of the Act of 22d April 1863, Purd. Dig 485, pi. 130, provides, however, that the assignee of a mortgage, although the assignment has been duly recorded, may, at his option, sue and proceed thereon, either in his own name, or in the name of the mortgagee, to his use.</p>
    <p id="b377-7" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[116,1811,1176,524]]]'>Prior to the enactment of the 14th sect, of the Act of 9th April 1849, <em>supra, </em>the decisions were conflicting as to whether the assignment of a mortgage was within the recording acts. In Craft <em>v. </em>Webster, <a href="/rawle/4/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Rawle 242" data-case-ids="1823544" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0242-01">4 Rawle 242</a>, and in Mott <em>v. </em>Clark, 9 Barr 399, it was held not to be; but in Philips v. Bank of Lewistown, 6 Harris 394, it was held to be within the recording Act of 28th May 1715. The right to record this assignment was set at rest by the Act of 1849. To adopt the view urged for the appellant would defeat the main object of all the statutes which we have cited. Instead of a system designed to give unity and harmony to the recording acts, it would inaugurate one fraught with mischief and uncertainty.</p>
