A railroad company issued stock; becoming embarrassed, a law was passed in 1855, authorizing them to complete their road, &amp;c., to issue preferred stock, the holders to receive a dividend of 8 per cent, from the time of payment therefor before the other stock; the dividend to be paid only out of the net earnings of the road. Other laws authorized the issue of a “ consolidated preferred stock,” to retire the stock theretofore issued; the holders to receive 8 per cent, from July 1872, before any other stock should receive a dividend. “ Consolidated” stock was issued, which was used in retiring all other stock except forty-two shares of the “ preferred” stock, the holders of which declined to convert into the “ consolidated” stock. In July 1873 a dividend was declared on the “consolidated” and “preferred” stock as it should then stand on the books, payable out of the earnings of the road for the two preceding years: <em>Held, </em>that the owners of the forty-two shares of “ preferred” stock were entitled to a dividend of 8 per cent, per annum from the time of payment for it in 1855, the whole amount of dividend declared being sufficient for that purpose.</p>

There are many reasons why this should be so, but whether we will follow Massachusetts need not be considered now. This suit is not for an undeclared dividend, but for damages resulting from breach of duty, as in Reese <em>v. </em>The Bank of Montgomery County, 7 Casey 78. The defendant <em>has </em>declared a dividend, amounting in the aggregate to $33,000. Ascei’taining the net profits, it set aside a dividend fund of this amount, which it resolved should be distributed. But, instead of distributing to the plaintiff her just proportion, the defendant gave part of what belonged to her to others, in violation of its duty. The extent of her injury is the difference between what she received and what she should have received. Now why may not this sum be recovered in assumpsit ? The action lies for breach of trust, breach of duty, arid violation of other equitable rights: Coleman <em>v. </em>The Columbia Oil Co., 1 P. F. Smith 74; Crossgrove <em>v. </em>Himmelrich, 4 <a href="/mass/95/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Allen 400" data-case-ids="2114840" data-case-paths="/mass/95/0400-01">Id.</a> 203 ; McCullough <em>v. </em>McCullough, 2 Harris 295; Forrest <em>v. </em>Campbell, Leg.

Here is no question involved respecting the receipts, disbursements and liabilities of the company, nor the discretion of directors, as where the suit is for an undeclared dividend. Every fact is ascertained, the fund applicable to distribution set aside, and a dividend declared. The fault is simply in withholding a part of the plaintiff’s just proportion and giving it to others.</p>

What should she have received ? This depends on the number of shares of preferred stock to participate in the distribution. The case finds that there are but forty-two, all others having been redeemed and cancelled. That this redemption was effected by means of other stock is unimportant. The result is the same as if it had been accomplished by returning the money. The preferred stock was given up, and all rights and obligations created by it are gone. The holders sold out, and in turn became purchasers of a <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>different stock, creating other and different relations to the company. There are hut the forty-two shares remaining, all besides is common stock, no matter by what name called. The dividend ascertained and set apart was sufficient to pay eight per cent, on the par value of this from the time it was issued. And this sum, deducting the amount received, is what the plaintiff should have had. The parties agree that the balance is $2534.59.

And his contract rights were precisely defined by the Act] of 1855. In effect, it was an agreement for the advance of money to an embarrassed railroad company. A corporation may issue new shares and give them a preference as a mode of borrowing money, where it has power to borrow on bond and mortgage, as pret]) ferred stock is only a form of mortgage. Redf. on Railw., sect. <em>237; </em>Everhart <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., 4 Casey 353. The preferred stock wasj] not designed to form a permanent part of the capital, for pro-,'! vision was made by the fifth section of the act for its redemption.] Mr. Gray's subscription was made upon the faith and in view off the statutory stipulations, and of these the plaintiff- has the right! to require the performance by the defendants. She is entitled to] <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>receive just what the company agreed to pay when the 'money was obtained.</p>
    <p id="b328-6" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[275,455,1168,478]]]'>It is no answer to the plaintiff’s demand to say that her thirty-six shares were part of the 5764 shares originally issued. Her right is not limited to the proportion of the net profits divided in 1873, which would come to her if the other stockholders had retained their rights to participation in the distribution. All of them, except the holders of six shares, have entered into a new contract with the defendants, under the Acts of 1871 and 1872, by which their claims as preferred stockholders under the Act of 1855 were surrendered and extinguished. The case stands as if forty-two shares only had been issued, for they only were outstanding when the dividend was declared.</p>

The proviso to the fourth section of the Act of 1855, that dividends should not he paid except out of the net earnings of the road, nor until after payment of all interest due on the company’s debts, bad reference only to the time when the dividends should be paid to the stockholders. The amount of them, and the time when they were to commence, were fixed by the enacting clause of the section. They were to be eight per centum per annum, payable semi-annually, “from the time of payment for the stock,” and before any payment to the holders of the common stock.</p>
    <p id="AOC" data-blocks='[["BL_328.6",328,[271,1411,1166,521]]]'>The dividend the defendants declared in July 1873, proved them to be in possession of ample funds. Unquestionably, the time had arrived when it was legitimate for the plaintiff to call on them to perform their contract. And her claim was properly presented in this action. This is not, in any aspect, an effort to coerce the policy or control the discretion of the directors. It is not an attempt to enforce the declaration of a dividend. That has been declared, hut the defendants have made a mistaken distribution of money they admitted to he in their hands, and which legally belonged to the plaintiff. The authorities relied on by the court below, adequately proved that an action of assumpsit was the plaintiff’s appropriate remedy. Judgment affirmed.</p>
