The latter grow out of and are attached to the realty, and hence, by reason of their fixed and permanent character, can only be seized and held as realty. Alease of land, during the term, is as fixed as the land itself, for it can only be used upon the land out of which it arises. It is nothing more or less than a right to use the freehold for the term mentioned in the lease. It is therefore an estate in land. These chattels cannot be seized and held as can personal goods, which accompany the person, and are susceptible of transportation from place to place. The officer in levying upon the latter, is supposed to have them in his immediate personal custody, and he must have them present at the place and on the day of sale. Not so, however, a leasehold estate: Sowers <em>v. </em>Vie, 2 Harris 99. The sheriff can have no manual caption thereof; he cannot take it into personal custody, and hence is no more responsible for it than for any other species of real estate. His levy can only be by description of the realty out of which the leasehold issues.
