Under the 3d section of the 5th article of the New Constitution, the Supreme Court “ shall have original jurisdiction in cases of injunction where a corporation is a party defendant.” Did the convention mean by the word “ corporation” one class of corporations only, and to confine the exercise of the power of injunction to private corporations? It did not say so. Did it mean so ? It is a word of known legal signification, embracing public and private corporations. If private only were intended, it is a result of mere inference. On what ground can we infer that the convention used a term of art and yet meant what it did not say ? That body was composed largely of lawyers, many of great professional eminence and some professionally familiar with corporations. We must presume they used the term <em>“ </em>corporation” in view of its legal meaning, and also in view of the existing powers of the Supreme Court over corporations. It was well known to them that the power to enjoin municipal corporations against the performance of illegal or unconstitutional acts, had long existed. Judge Sergeant, referring to the equity powers in the Act of 16th June 1836, so early as the year 1844, remarked upon the 5th clause of the 13th section, that over corporations of a municipal character, that court has no general chancery control; but said, “ I speak not now of the next clause, to which I am going to advert, providing especially for injunctions in certain cases, because that clause no doubt applies to all persons, corporations, municipal or otherwise, as well as individuals, and is a remedy of a peculiar character:” Hagner <em>v. </em>Heyberger, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20106" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 106">7 W. &amp; S. 106</a>. The same opinion is stated by Woodward, J., in Wharton <em>v. </em>School Directors, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20363" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Wright 363">6 Wright 363</a>, and in Prescott <em>v. </em>Bank of Duquesne, 12 Id. 120. In the celebrated case of Sharpless <em>v. </em>The City of Philadelphia, 9 Harris 170, no one thought of interposing the fatal argument of a want of power to restrain a municipal corporation. We have a legislative construction also in the Act of 8th April 1846, forbidding injunctions to restrain the prosecution of public works in Philadelphia, a provision wholly unnecessary if the city was not liable to be enjoined. In Wolbert <em>v. </em>The City, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20439" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="12 Wright 439">12 Wright 439</a>, the case was put directly on this act, and the want of power to enjoin not suggested. Then, in The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Rush, Mayor of Allegheny City, 2 Harris 186, <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>the power was actually exercised. So in Kerr <em>v. </em>Trego <em>et al, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20292" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="11 Wright 292">11 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20292" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="11 Wright 292">Wright 292</a>, it was exercised where two bodies were claiming to be the Common Council of this city. Hill <em>v. </em>Commissioners, 1 Pars. Eq. 507, may also be referred to. The 3d sect, of the 5th art. of the New Constitution is a restriction úpon the general powers possessed by this court. If it were the intention of the convention to restrict the power of injunction to <em>private </em>corporations, it was absolutely necessary to say so, or else by every rule of sound interpretation the power exists as to corporations generally. And fatal would it be to the interests of the state if there were no power in this court to prevent municipal corporations from overstepping the boundaries of their authority and trampling both laws and constitution under foot.</p>

This, however, furnishes no argument that the word “ corporation,” as <em>nomen generalissimum, </em>was .intended to be restricted here to private corporations; for it was necessary to distinguish in other provisions, to reach the specific intent in each. Where the convention meant to provide for a city or a county, or a private corporation specifically, it was necessary to say so. The single question upon the 3d section is, Did the convention mean to confine our original jurisdiction to private corporations ? It did not say so, and there is no reason to infer an intention expressed by no appropriate language.</p>

    <p id="b349-6" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[132,1089,1169,1177]]]'>For the purpose of taxation, real estate may be classified. Thus, timber lands, arable lands, mineral lands, urban and rural, may be divided into distinct classes, and subjected to different rates. In like manner other subjects, trades, occupations, and professions, may be classified. And not only things but persons may be so divided. The <em>genus homo </em>is a subject within the meaning of the Constitution. Will it be contended that as to this there can be no classification? No laws affecting the personal and property rights of minors as distinguished from adults ? Or of males as distinguished from females ? Or, in the case of the latter, no distinction between a feme covert and a single woman ? What becomes of all our legislation in regard to the rights of married women if there can be no classification ? and where is the power to provide any future safeguards for their separate estate ? These illustrations might be multiplied indefinitely were it necessary. But it is contended that even if the right to classify exists, the exercise of it by the legislature, in this instance, is in violation of the Constitution, for the reason that there is but one city in the state with a population exceeding 300,000; that to form a class containing but one city is in point of fact legislating for that one city, to the exclusion of all others, and constitutes the local and special legislation prohibited by the Constitution. This argument is plausible, but unsound. It is true, the only city in the state, at the present time containing a population of 300,000, is the city of Philadelphia. It is also true that the city of Pittsburg is rapidly approaching that number, if it has not already reached it, by recent enlargements of its territory.</p>

In the meantime, is the classification as- to' cities of the first class bad because Philadelphia is the only one of the class ? We think not. Classification does not depend upon numbers. The first man, Adam, was as distinctly a class, when the breath of life was breathed into him, as at any subsequent period. The word is used not to designate numbers, but a rank or order of persons or things ; in society it is used to indicate equality, or persons distinguished by common characteristics, as the trading classes; the laboring classes; in science, it is a division or arrangement, containing the subordinate divisions of order, genus, and •species.</p>

We may instance the laws in regard to the quarantine, lazaretto, board of health, and other matters connected with the sanitary condition of the city; the laws in regard to shipping and pilotage as affecting its commerce; laws concerning its trade, such as those that relate to mercantile appraisers, inspectors of flour, bark, beef and pork, butter and lard, domestic distilled spirits, flaxseed, leather, tobacco, petroleum ; and the laws in regard to building inspectors ; the storage and sale of gunpowder ; laws affecting its political condition, as by the division and subdivision of wards, and the establishing of the ratio of representation in councils. We have but to glance at this legislation to see that the most of it is wholly unsuited to small inland cities, and that to inflict it upon them would be little short of a calamity. Must the city of Scranton, over 100 miles from tide water, with a stream hardly large enough to float a batteau, be subjected to quarantine regulations, and have its lazaretto ?

Yet its true meaning may <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>be gathered with reasonable certainty. The end sought to be attained was clearly a limitation upon the debt of municipalities, and seven per centum upon the assessed value of the taxable property therein was fixed as the maximum. The fact was, however, known to the convention that at that time the debt of the city of Philadelphia and perhaps some other municipalities, exceeded seven per centum. In such. instances an arbitrary provision, that there should be no further increase of the debt, might have worked great injury by the stoppage of public works already commenced and essential to the public convenience and welfare. It was therefore provided, that as to such municipalities the debt might be increased three per centum. The main controversy, however, was as to the manner in which such increase should be accomplished. Here again the distinction is preserved between municipalities whose debt is under seven per centum and those in which it exceeds seven per centum. In the former, the municipal authorities may increase the debt from time to time until two per centum has been added, provided the original debt, with the increase, does not exceed seven per centum. After the two per centum has been added there can be no further increase without the vote of the people. To illustrate:</p>
    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[332,1288,883,43]]]'>The whole debt is not to exceed seven per centum.</p>
    <p id="b352-7" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[288,1331,1161,88]]]'>We will suppose the debt to have been two per centum at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b352-8" data-blocks='[["BL_352.6",352,[287,1419,1159,86]]]'>Two per centum may be added by the municipal authorities, making the debt four per centum.</p>
    <p id="b352-9" data-blocks='[["BL_352.7",352,[282,1505,1169,691]]]'>No portion of the remaining three per centum can be added without the assent of the electors of such municipality at a public election, in such manner as shall be provided by law. But when a city, whose debt at the time of the adoption of the Constitution already exceeded seven per cent, seeks to increase its debt, it can do so only with the consent of the law-making power of the state. The Constitution has interposed the legislature between such municipality and any further increase of its debt. But when the legislative sanction has been obtained, the municipal authorities may increase the debt precisely as in the case of towns whoso debt is less than seven per centum. The proposed increase hero is one per centum. This clearly does not require a vote of the people. Whether it would have been necessary to have submitted the question to a popular vote, had the increase exceeded two per centum, is a question about which we express no opinion. When the point is legitimately raised we will decide it.</p>

Nor do we see any force in the objection that the object of the act is not clearly expressed in the title. In Allegheny County Homes’ Appeal, <em>antea </em>77, it was held that “ if the title fairly gives notice of the subject of the act, so as reasonably to lead to an inquiry into the body of the bill, it is all that is necessary. It need not be an index to the contents, as has often been said.” Tested by this rule, we do not regard the title as fatally defective.</p>

All the deeds and muniments of title are taken in the name of the city. This is true not only of what may be called the original Gas Works, but of all purchases made since. The works of the Éichmond Gas Company, the Germantown Gas Company, the Southwark and Moyamensing Gas Company, the Manayunk Gas Company, and the Kensington Gas Company, have all been consolidated with the Philadelphia Gas Works. The title to each of these separate works is vested absolutely in the city. No other individual or corporation has any interest in them as stockholder or part owner. The Trustees of the Gas Works have no pecuniary in<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>terest in them. It is true they have the control of the management, hut this is by virtue of the original contract between the city and the bondholders and for the protection of the latter. This ■ is the scope of the decisions in the. Western Saving Fund cases. So long as the loanholders remain unpaid they have a right to demand that no change shall be made in the management, either as to the number of the trustees or their mode of appointment. But the moment the loanholders are paid the Gas Works revert to the city, and the trustees have no further duty to perform but to account with the city for their stewardship. They are agents of .the city, nothing more, and their possession of the works is the possession of the city, with this qualification, that until the city pays the debt for which they are pledged, the trustees cannot be moved or disturbed in their management.</p>

Such being the case, are we to regard the Gas Works as an “ institution” having a separate, recognised existence apart from the city ? The affirmative of this proposition cannot be successfully maintained. The most that can he urged is, that the city is acting in a double capacity; in the one, exercising rights of sovereignty ; in the other, performing the functions of a private corporation in the manufacture and sale of gas. This tvas the view taken of it by this court, in the Saving Fund Cases, above cited. It was said by Mr. Justice Strong, delivering the opinion of the court, 7 Casey 185: “Nor can there be any doubt that the trust existing in the trustees is a private one, and that the city of Philadelphia, is to be regarded as a private corporation, so far as relates to its contract with the bondholder,s. It was not as a municipality that it dealt with them. As a local sovereign it had no authority to enter into the business of manufacturing and selling gas, for its sovereignty did not extend to such subjects any more than it did to almost any other manufacture.” This was of course predicated of what was then before the court, viz. : whether the city, in violation of its contract with the bondholders, could take the management of the works <em>out </em>of the hands of <em>the </em>trustees. While it is no part of the ordinary and necessary duties of a municipal corporation to supply its citizens with gas and water, it is nevertheless true that it may lawfully do so. Without desiring to enter into a nice discussion of the source of its right or power to do this, the fact that it has been exercised in this and many other states-for a long time unchallenged exists. Rights have grown up ; large expenditures and costly improvements made ; the health and comfort of large communities promoted thereby. The lighting of a city with gas, and supplying it with pure water, are entirely dis<a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>connected from wild speculations of the character indicated upon the argument.</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[127,479,1178,1176]]]'>We do not think the Gas Works have any separate entity. They resemble the Water Department and the Fairmount Park. Aside from the trustees, and they amount to nothing in our view of the case, the Gas Works may be considered as property belonging to the city, and operated, not for the purpose of speculation, but to promote the comfort of the whole body of the people. As their original acquisition and subsequent use were lawful, debts contracted therefor must be paid by the city. While, as regards the loanholder, the city may be considered as a private corporation, as between the city and her citizens, for whose benefit the works were constructed and are now used, it is of little moment whether we regard the former as a private corporation or a sovereign, legislating for the benefit of its citizens. In either event the latter are bound by the contract of the city. The constitutional provision referred to, was intended to prevent: First, the city from becoming jointly interested as stockholder with any company, association or corporation ; and second, from obtaining or appropriating money for, or loaning its credit to, any corporation, association, institution pr individual. The Gas Works being exclusively owned by the city, it is clear the case does not come within the first division above stated. It appears equally plain that the latter division or clause of the article referred to was not intended to apply to cases where the corporation, association or institution had no legal existence, separate and apart from the city, and where the latter merely sought to borrow money for its own use, in the improvement of its own property, lawfully acquired, for either the comfort, health, or pleasure of its citizens.</p>

In Walker <em>v. </em>The City of Cincinatti, before cited, the Supreme Court held, that an Act of Assembly authorizing tho entire construction of a railroad by a city of the first class, where such road was material to the development of the city, and to empower the local authorities to provide means therefore by the taxation of its citizens, was not in violation of the constitutional provision referred to. Says Chief Justice Scott, in delivering the opinion of the court: 11 The mischief which this section interdicts is a business partnership between a municipal or subordinate division of a state, and individuals or private corporations or associations. It forbids the union of public or private capital or credit in any enterprise whatever. In no project, originated by individuals, whether associated or otherwise, with a view to gain, are the municipal bodies named permitted to participate in such manner as to incur pecuniary expense or liability. They may neither <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>become stockholders, nor furnish money or credit for the benefit of the parties interested therein. As this alliance between public and private interests is clearly prohibited in respect to all enterprises of whatever kind, if we hold that these municipal bodies cannot do on their own account what they are forbidden to do on the joint account of themselves and private partners, it follows that they are powerless to make any improvement, however necessary, v'th their own means, and on their own sole account. We may be very sure that a purpose so unreasonable was never entertained by the framers of the Constitution.”</p>

It is substantially the same as the amendment to the late Constitution, adopted in 1857. See article 11, section 7, Brightly’s Purdon 34. Since 1857 five loans, aggregating $4,500,000, have been issued by the city for the benefit of the Gas Works, without an objection on the part of any citizen. The considerations which are now urged upon us are not such as should move a chancellor to interfere, especially when there has been such universal and long-continued acquiescence.</p>
