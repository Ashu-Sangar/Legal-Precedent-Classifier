In passing that law, the legislative mind was manifestly directed to the wants of the principal coal region of the state, and to the kind of business there carried on, especially with reference to the fact that a very large part of it consists of improvements made by mechanics on leased lands. But the expression of the law left room to give it a broader application to leased lands, and it was considered well adapted to the oil-producing business in our region, and therefore by the Act of 11th April 1866, it was extended to Erie, Crawford, Warren and Venango counties. After-wards another act was passed, 8th April 1868, for the same purpose, more expressly applicable and adapted to the oil business. It was, however, confined to Venango county, until it was extended to Crawford, Warren and Clarion, by the Act of 18th March 1869. This requires us to look at the Venango Act, and we will find the 8th section contains a repealing clause, which is quite broad enough to set aside the remedies given by the Luzerne Act, and substitute better ones in their place.”</p>

    <p id="b88-10" data-blocks='[["BL_88.14",88,[270,1796,1155,506]]]'>The plaintiff’s claim was filed under the provisions of the Act of 1858, and its supplement of 1866, extending the Mechanics’ Lien Law of 1836 to buildings and machinery erected upon leasehold estates. Under this act, it was only necessary that the mechanic or material-man should file his claim within six months from the date of the last item of work done or materials furnished, in order to create a valid lien. The lien, so created, continued without further action for the period of five years from the date of the filing of the claim. It is conceded, that if this act is still in force in the county of Crawford, the plaintiff’s claim was a lien upon the leasehold in question, and the court erred in striking it off.</p>
    <p id="b88-11" data-blocks='[["BL_88.15",88,[271,2309,1153,88]],["BL_89.1",89,[130,391,1161,258]]]'>The Act of April 8th 1868 (Pamph.

    <p id="b89-6" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[132,651,1163,563]]]'>It is admitted that the plaintiff did not comply with these provisions, hence if the latter statute supplied or repealed the former he has no lien. That the Act of 1868 did supply and repeal that of 1858, a very .cursory examination will prove. In the first place, the latter contains all the subjects of lien embraced in the former; and in the second place, if the former is still in force, then all the provisions of the latter requiring the affidavit of claim, the' filing of the claim within three months, and the issuing of the scire facias within a like period thereafter, are nugatory. For in such case all these provisions may be disregarded and the lien be good, nevertheless. It is clear, therefore, that, as the legislature intended the provisions of the Act of 1868 to have force over the subjects therein named, those of the Act of 1858 must give way.</p>
