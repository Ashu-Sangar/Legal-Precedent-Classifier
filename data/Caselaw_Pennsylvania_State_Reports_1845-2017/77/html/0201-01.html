Land was sold under execution out of the District Court of Allegheny county, on a mortgage which was a first lien ; the purchaser paid to the sheriff $850 on his bid ; having failed to pay any more, the sheriff returned the land unsold. It was then sold by the same sheriff under an execution out of the Common Pleas on a subsequent judgment, and subject to the mortgage, for a sum which with the amount due on the mortgage and the $850, was no greater than the first bid. The $850 was ruled into the District Court for distribution. Held, there being no terms, &amp;c., of the second sale different from the first, that a lien-creditor not paid by the second sale was entitled to the fund; not the purchaser at the first sale.</p>

On the 6th of February 1872, De Lange &amp; Co. assigned all their assets of every kind to F, H. Eaton. A fi. fi. was issued out of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny county on the House judgments, and the same real estate was sold by the sheriff for $3900, subject to the mortgage of the Dollar Savings Bank, which at that time amounted to $3460, thus making the whole amount for which the property sold $7360. This sale divested the lien of Tindle’s mortgage, which then amounted to $2104.60. By the sale under the fi. fa. all the liens prior to his mortgage were paid ; on account of it he received from the proceeds of this sale $1239.20.</p>

They, however, paid to the sheriff $850 only on their bid, and refused to pay the residue. The sheriff thereupon returned the property unsold, and' paid that money into court.</p>
    <p id="b203-7" data-blocks='[["BL_203.8",203,[156,744,1182,566]]]'>This first sale was made upon a levari facias issued on a judgment, which had been recovered upon a mortgage. The mortgage was the first lien. An alias levari facias was issued, but prior to a sale thereon the property was sold upon a fi. fa. issued upon a judgment which intervened between the first lien mortgage and the mortgage of the appellant. The sum for which the property sold at the second sale, added to the amount then due upon the prior mortgage, was $850 less than the sum bid by De Lange &amp; Co. at the first sale. The effect of the second sale was to discharge the lien of the mortgage held by the appellant, and to pay him thereon, out of the proceeds thereof, $1239.20 only, being $850 less than he would have received in case De Lange &amp; Co. had made their bid good.</p>
    <p id="b203-8" data-blocks='[["BL_203.9",203,[159,1311,1181,261]]]'>After the money made at the second sale had been appropriated, an auditor was appointed to distribute the $850. He gave the money, less the costs of the audit, to the appellant. Upon exceptions filed the court reversed his decision, and decreed that it be paid to the assignee of De Lange &amp; Co. From that decree this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b203-9" data-blocks='[["BL_203.10",203,[162,1572,1180,207]]]'>Thus, it appears, the assignees of De Lange &amp; Co. and the appellant are the only claimants before us. None of the creditors whose lien was prior to that of the appellant is here claiming the fund. They were either paid out of the proceeds of the sale made on the fi. fa. or were otherwise satisfied.</p>

No evidence was given before the auditor of any fact calculated to reduce the price for which the property first sold. We discover nothing connected with the sale tending to produce such a result.

Nor if he was the plaintiff in the execution upon which the sale was made is he relieved from liability by the fact that the levy did not give any description of the township, county or boundaries: Spang <em>v. </em>Schneider, Id. 193. Nor can a purchaser take advantage of irregularities in the execution under which the sale was made: Emley <em>v. </em>Drum, 12 Casey 123. Nor that the purchaser at the second sale paid no portion of his bid to the sheriff, but gave a credit therefor on his mortgage lien: Forster <em>et al. v. </em>Hayman, <em>supra.</em>

It is fair to presume that the resale primá facie showed that sum to be the legal measure of damages. No evidence was given to overcome that presumption. Their assignee has no reason to complain, inasmuch as the damages claimed do not exceed the difference between the first and second sale: Gaskill <em>v. </em>Morris, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 32" data-case-ids="481780" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0032-01">7 W. &amp; S. 32</a>.</p>

    <p id="b204-9" data-blocks='[["BL_204.7",204,[261,1486,1180,480]]]'>It is difficult to assign any substantial reason to sustain this position. Why should the sheriff be compelled to bring suit to recover the money which has already been paid to him in the very transaction in which his right of action accrued, and upon which its foundation must rest? The court is in possession of the fund, and is charged with its distribution. It arose from a sale of real estate on execution. The statutes requires that it be distributed “according to law and equity:” Purd. Dig. 645, pl. 107. Force and effect are to be given to the equity branch of the court’s power: Kelly’s Appeal, 4 Harris 59. The appellee is invoking the aid of those equitable powers.</p>
