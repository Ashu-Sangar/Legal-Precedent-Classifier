Before she released, she said she would not do it without I gave her a note, and I promised to do so. Kirby gave me the money, $800,. at his house. I gave her the note because I owed her the money. The $200 I got also from Kirby, the spring after I got the $800. I also paid that on account of the land. My wife and I agreed the note should be for $1780, at the time it was given; we reckoned out the interest on the amount I had received, and it all came to more than that; hut she was satisfied with that. She has had the note in her possession ever since. I paid on it occasionally; the payments are endorsed on the note. The reason I gave the note at the time I did, was, she had been insisting upon giving a note from the time when I got the money. At the time I gave the note, I had bailed some person at court. This made her restive, and she insisted absolutely on a note. She wanted to have a right for the money — a note (security) that would bind the land. While we were going over to the justice’s to get the money and release for it, my wife demanded a note, and I promised to give it to her. This was about 1837, and then I got the money.”</p>

Looking then at the evidence which the auditor returned with his report, we discover this uncontradicted testimony in regard to Moyer’s agreement under which he received the money. He testifies “ my wife did not want to let me have the money, without a note; I told her I would give her a note, but I put her off; my wife gave Kirby a release. Before she released, she said she would not do it, without I gave her a note, and I promised to do so.

It was a promise which he made immediately preceding his obtaining the first and principal part of the money. It was the agreement under which he received the whole of the money. It is true, he was not obliged to accept the money on those terms, but he consented to do so. He thus assumed a trust, by which in equity the money remained the property of his wife, although it passed into his actual possession. There is no act or declaration of either Moyer or his wife calculated to weaken this conclusion, save his delay in giving the note. We think that circumstance alone, wholly insufficient to overthrow the other evidence. The mutual confidence, existing between them, undoubtedly delayed giving the note. The facts found by the auditor, do not justify the legal inferences he drew therefrom, and the learned judge erred in confirming his report.</p>
