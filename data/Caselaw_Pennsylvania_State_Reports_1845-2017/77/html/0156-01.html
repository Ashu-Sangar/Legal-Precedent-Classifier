Beeson, revokes the devise as well as the legacy given by the will, and that thereupon the interest of Jonathan, as originally created, by the will, became part of the residuary estate. The will, as altered by the codicil mentioned, is to be taken as republished, and stood then as a devise of one-third of the land in question to Jacob Beeson, and one-third to Henry Beeson, and the interest before in Jonathan became a part of the <em>balance </em>of testatrix’s property, which the executors were empowered to sell. To this extent I feel clear. The sale by the executors would be valid. As to their right to dispose of the interest of Henry, who, though dead at the time of'■ the death of the testatrix, is not found to have been so at the date of the codicil, I do not feel so sure; indeed, as to that I have serious doubts. But that the case may be presented to the Supreme Court on both points by one writ of error, I have concluded to hold that the sale by the executors was good as to the interest of both Jonathan and Henry, and therefore vested a good title to the two-thirds of the land in plaintiff.”</p>

    <p id="b159-7" data-blocks='[["BL_159.8",159,[165,733,1173,1609]]]'>We are of opinion that upon the true construction of the will of Rachel Skiles there was no power given to her executors to sell the out lot on the National Road or any part of it in any event. She makes a specific devise of that lot unto Jacob Beeson, Jonathan D. Beeson and Henry Beeson, to them and their heirs forever. She then immediately adds, “ all the balance of my property, both real and personal, I direct to be sold by my executors as soon after my decease as they may deem best for the interest of my estate, and the proceeds, after paying my just debts and necessary expenses, I divide as follows.” She then proceeds to give several pecuniary legacies, and a general residuary bequest. “ All the rest and residue of my estate I give and bequeath unto Henry H. Beeson, Jacob B. Miller and Jonathan D. Spring, to be equally divided.” It is to be observed that it was not a mere power to sell but an absolute direction, and worked an immediate conversion. She meant that all the balance of the property (except the out lot) should be converted into money and distributed as she directed, in pecuniary legacies, with the residuary bequest. It cannot be inferred that at the time of the execution of the will she had any intention to convert the out lot into money. If she had not then such an intention, how can such a power arise from subsequent events ? An express revocation of the devise by a subsequent codicil would not work such an effect. It would require a new power, either clearly expressed or necessarily implied. It is very much like the case of Downer <em>v. </em>Downer, <a href="/watts/9/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Watts 60" data-case-ids="1850043" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0060-01">9 Watts 60</a>, where, after a specific devise of a lot charged with legacies, which the devisee refused to accept, the testator directed his executors to sell his whole real estate not otherwise disposed of in his will. It was held clearly that the power of the executor to sell did not include the lot, though in the event which had occurred it became a part of his real estate not otherwise disposed of. It had reverted to his estate just as is supposed in the case before us. But the charges upon it were not affected, and it was held therefore that the only mode of proceeding was in the Orphans’ Court to enforce the charge by a sale. It results from this construction of the will that Clark Breading, the plaintiff below, derived no title from the sale by the executors, and therefore</p>
