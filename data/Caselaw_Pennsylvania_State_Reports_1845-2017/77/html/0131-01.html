      <em>“ </em>Commonly there can be no judgment in favor of the plaintiff, after a verdict for the defendants, with a reserved point, on the sufficiency of the facts found as a defence, because commonly that would leave the plaintiff’s facts not found; but no such reason exists in this case. And I suppose there may be eases where the plaintiff’s case is admitted by pleadings, and the defence set up by the defendants is found by verdict in their favor. Where the question of the sufficiency of the defence may be raised by a reserved point and then decided in favor of the plaintiff, and judgment in his favor according to the declaration, a plea in confession and avoidance, even when found in favor of the defendants, does not prevent the plaintiff from having judgment in his favor, unless the plea is a sufficient answer. In our short pleadings a reserved point may stand in place of such a plea set out at length. If pleaded at length a demurrer would test its validity and bring its proper judgment, and a reserved point may do the same.</p>
