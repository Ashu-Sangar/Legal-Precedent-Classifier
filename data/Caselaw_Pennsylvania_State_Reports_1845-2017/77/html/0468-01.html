That section expressly excepts debts secured by mortgage or judgment; suit is unnecessary when the debt is already in judgment. The record gives notice of the debt to all persons interested, and it remains unaffected by time, as to all volunteers, until a presumption of payment arises. This section is interpreted, also, by the next proceeding section, the 25th, which provides that the lien of a judgment at the time of the death of the defendant in it shall continue for five years, but after that period shall not be a lien on the real estate as against a bonfi fide purchaser, mortgagee, or other judgment-creditor, unless revived by scire facias, or otherwise according to law. Here the heir or devisee is not mentioned or excepted.
