If there is an unlawful entry shown, the plaintiff and executor .have aright to recover damages sustained up to the commencement of the suit on January 28th 1869, from dune 1868. If there has been no actual damage, nominal damages only can be recovered. The pleas are not guilty, and two pleas of justification. First, That they had a right to enter on this ground under their charter and the laws of the Commonwealth; and second, that they had certain easements of drainage on the premises. Plaintiffs have tra<a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>versed these facts. Under not guilty, there must be some evidence of the presence of each of these defendants at the time of the trespass. Under the second plea, defendants rely upon their right to enter under their charter and the laws of the Commonwealth. This is a mere question of law, and I have no difficulty with it. [The company has no authority by its charter to enter upon lands adjoining their road without the permission of the owner.] They are authorized to make a turnpike road over an existing road. It has been argued from this, because supervisors of roads have the right to enter upon adjoining lands, the turnpike company has the like right. It does not follow that, because the penalty imposed upon the company for not properly maintaining their road, is the same as that to1 which supervisors are liable, the company has the same rights of entry for the purpose of drainage as the supervisors. This was not a free road. The company levies toll for its own use. They must show a right under their charter. There is nothing under their charter or laws that confers on this company rights of drainage on adjoining landowners.</p>

Was there any grant of such a privilege ? or, what was the same thing, was there a continuous adverse use for twenty-one years or more prior to 1855 of this easement of drainage ? Tnere is evidence of an old inlet there. Was it an easement of drainage? For what purpose made, and who made it ? It is for you to find whether you can presume a grant by owners of Piper’s lot of right of drainage.</p>

If the use was interrupted from time to time, the jury may say what was the character of the use. To constitute such an adverse use it must be either by virtue of a grant or as a trespass. If, as Fisher says, it was opened for purposes of irrigation, who could have brought trespass ? No harm was done to the company by taking the water off. They could have no action. Fisher certainly knows, if he is to be believed. It is for you to say, on this sort of testimony, whether there was a continuous use of this easement for drainage for twenty-one years prior to 1855. Non-user for less than twenty-one years afterwards would not bar the defendants’ right.</p>

By the resolution, defendants say they did give permission to lay the curb. There is no evidence of what their superintendent did. What was done at the setting of the curb is some evidence of the understanding of the parties as to whether or not this was an easement of drainage. If enlarged beyond what it originally was, defendants had no right to increase the capacity of the old drain, and are liable for damages for the excess.

It is unnecessary to consider whether the special character of the declaration rendered this unnecessary. If a plaintiff sets out his claim by metes and bounds, the defendant may plead <em>liberum tenementum, </em>but no new assignment is necessary, for obvious reasons. But here there was the plea of not guilty, and the cause was before the jury on all the issues. Under the general issue the defendants below could have given evidence of their easement without reference to the special plea. Even the defence set up by a plea of <em>liberum tenementum </em>can be given in evidence under the general issue: Fisher <em>v. </em>Morris, <a href="/whart/5/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Whart. 358" data-case-ids="8878117" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0358-01">5 Whart. 358</a>. Surely, then, the plaintiff could answer that defence by showing that the trespass complained of was not justified by the easement proved; that while the easement of which evidence had been given was of a drain of one foot, the defendants had made a drain three times that size. Where there are several issues before the jury, whatever would be competent evidence under either, if it stood alone, is admissible. In Darlington <em>v. </em>Painter, 7 Barr 473, the general issue was hot pleaded, yet it was held in that case that a plea of a general right to a watercourse is not sustained by evidence of a particular right. It would follow that the defendants below failed in their defence under the plea of “ certain easements of drainage,” if it appeared on their trial that all they could lay claim to was a drain at a particular place and of a limited capacity. The evidence admitted, therefore, to show that the ancient drains had been very much enlarged, was entirely competent under the authority of that case even under the special plea.</p>
