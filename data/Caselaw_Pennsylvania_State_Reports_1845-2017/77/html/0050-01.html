It is evident Heckler and his wife made the absence of that disease a material ground for accepting the offer of Holmes. Now clearly, equity, under such circumstances, will not compel a man thus misled to perform specifically a contract of exchange at the risk of his health and that of his family. Even had there been no misrepresentation on Holmes’ part, it would be doubtful whether a chancellor would compel specific performance against one who was ignorant of the fact; but when this conduct of the plaintiff is added, there can be no hesitation. The other question does not necessarily arise under this view of the case. Decree affirmed •with costs, to be paid by the appellant, and the appeal dismissed.</p>
