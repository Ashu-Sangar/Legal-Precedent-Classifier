    <p class="headnotes" id="b270-8" data-blocks='[["BL_270.3",270,[283,1452,1168,593]]]'>1. Neill and Simpson were joint owners of two wharves in the Delaware, between which was a dock. These wharves and docks were built by them as riparian owners of two pieces of ground, the northern of which (No. 1) embraced within its lines the northern wharf and dock, and the southern wharf and dock were within the lines of (No. 2). They each conveyed their interest to the other, so that each became separate owner, the conveyances being “with the docks and other appertenances.” The defendants being lessees under Neill of the first property, which embraced the dock in question, an Act of Assembly was passed giving them the exclusive right to occupy the same, &amp;c., and requiring the harbor master to remove any vessel so moored as to obstruct the use, &amp;c., of the docks. The plaintiffs by their bill claiming that the dock was appertenant to the wharf granted to them, prayed to restrain the defendants from preventing them from the use of it. _ The defendants answered, denying that the dock was appertenant to plaintiff’s wharf, and set up the Act of Assembly. The case was heard on hill and answer. <em>Held, </em>in absence of proof of title to the dock, the plaintiffs could not question the effect of the Act of Assembly.</p>

Neill and James Simpson were seised in fee as tenants in common of a certain wharf property, including one pier which extends into the river Delaware. Neill was sole seised of the wharf property adjoining the above on the south. As part of one transaction, by deeds bearing even date and recorded on the same day in the same book, Simpson conveyed his undivided half part of the first-mentioned premises to Neill, and Neill conveyed the other property to the plaintiffs, who are sons of James Simpson, “together also with the passages, waters, water-courses, wharves, docks, landings, landing-places, and other appertenances thereunto belonging.” The northernmost pier of the plaintiffs is on the line between the two properties, and is, and was, at and before the conveyance, built, fitted and intended for use on its north side, and on account of the width of the dock, this is the most valuable part of it. Plaintiffs claimed that the use of this dock passed to them under the express language of the deed above cited, and would have passed without it as an “apparent easement.” Defendants, the Steamship Company, are lessees of Neill’s property, having become so since the conveyance. Defendant Colesherry is harbor master of the port of Philadelphia. The Steamship Company claim the exclusive use of the dock, and are interfering with the plaintiffs’ use of it, and Colesberry at their instance is assisting them.
