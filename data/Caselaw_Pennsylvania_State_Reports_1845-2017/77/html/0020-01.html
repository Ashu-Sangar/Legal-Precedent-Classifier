A deed is not likely to be thrust aside, and it should not be. There should be no mistake as to the clear, satisfactory and convincing character of the evidence by which, in the estimation and finding of a jury, such a result can be accomplished. The presumptions of the law are that a deed is what it purports “to be, and it is also well and rightly and authoritatively settled that when parol proof (proof such as is here relied on) is relied on to show that a deed, absolute in form, such as this was intended by the parties, is a mortgage, it must be, as we have already instructed you, clear and convincing. And the adjudicated cases upon this subject, as is said by our own Supreme Court, go so far as to hold that the intention of the parties that it was to be a mortgage and not a conveyance, must be established by proof, not merely of declarations, but of facts and circumstances outside of the deed inconsistent with the idea of absolute purchase. So, too, that when a parol defence is set up (as in this case), it, the defeasance, should not <em>only </em>be <em>proven to </em>exist, but its terms should be established, else there could be no decree of foreclosure or redemption.</p>

The principles of adjudication and method of determination applicable to a proceeding by bill in equity, must equally control, avail and have application in this action of ejectment. And a chancellor will not interfere when the form of the conveyance is such that it purports to form an indefeasible estate (such as this conveyance here and now upon trial), unless some equity is shown not founded on a mere verbal declaration of two parties, in connection with its absolute terms, but in facts and circumstances independent of the debt and of the verbal declarations, and although such facts and circumstances may be shown outside of the deed by the admission of the grantee (the defendant here), after all it is the facts and not the admissions which raise the equity on which, in an action of law such as this is, entitle the plaintiff to a recovery.</p>

This point has also been heretofore considered by this court and determined adversely to the present contention of this plaintiff in error, in Harper’s Appeal, 14 P. P. Smith 320. It is there shown that the words “ to enforce an equity of redemption,” upon which reliance is placed, are confined to such an equity “ after reentry made for any condition broken,” and have no application to the equity of redemption of a mortgagor.</p>
    <p id="b26-5" data-blocks='[["BL_26.4",26,[286,826,1165,724]]]'>The third assignment of error is that the court erred in allowing the wife of the plaintiff to testify for him. But the language of the Act of April 15th 1869, is very explicit, that neither interest nor policy of law shall exclude a party or person from being a witness in any civil proceeding. And the proviso only excepts the case of husband and wife testifying against each other. It is argued, as I understand, that as the wife must be subjected to cross-examination, she may thereby be compelled to give testimony against her husband. But so may her testimony in chief be when offered in behalf of her husband. He may have utterly misapprehended the effect of it, or indeed, may have been mistaken as to what it would be. The act is providing for the competency of the witness for the party for whom she is offered, not as to the effect of the testimony. She is offered for her husband on his behalf. When admitted, as by the act she must be, her husband must take all the risks of what her evidence will be, whether upon exami-' nation in chief or cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b26-6" data-blocks='[["BL_26.5",26,[281,1559,1179,303]]]'>As to the third assignment of error, that the court erred in refusing the nonsuit asked for by the defendant, it is clear that such refusal is not the subject of review in this court: Girard <em>v. </em>Gettig, <a href="/binn/2/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Binn. 234" data-case-ids="1788981" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0234-01">2 Binn. 234</a>. The only proper course, as is pointed out in that case, is for the defendant to present the point or points upon which the nonsuit is asked, and request the answers of the' court to them in their instructions to the jury.</p>
    <p id="Ao" data-blocks='[["BL_26.6",26,[326,1861,1119,44]],["BL_26.7",26,[280,1905,1168,519]]]'>The fourth assignment of error is, that the court erred in admitting the testimony of so-called experts in regard to receipts which were in evidence. It was alleged, and direct evidence was given by the plaintiff below to prove, that the receipts had been altered, and then experts were offered to show that these alterations were not made at the same time with the body of the receipt. It was ruled in Fulton <em>v. </em>Flood <em>et al., </em>10 Casey 365, that the testimony of experts is receivable, in corroboration of positive evidence, to prove that in their opinion the whole of an instrument was written by the same hand, with the same pen and ink, and at the same time. This case is indeed the converse of that, but the principle is undoubtedly the same, whether the evidence is of experts to attack or support the instrument.</p>

      <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>It only remains to consider under the seventh assignment, whether upon the whole testimony, the case ought to have been, as it was, submitted to the jury. It is unquestionable, and is now horn-book law, in this state, that in controversies of this character —in equitable ejectments — the judge acts as chancellor, with the assistance of the jury, to determine the credibility of witnesses and questions of fact upon conflicting evidence. It is true that the character of the whole case as presented must be such as to satisfy the conscience of the chancellor, that the equity is clearly, not doubtfully, established by the evidence of the witnesses, if believed. How far he may be called on to exercise his discretion upon the credibility of witnesses it is not necessary to decide. That is now a very important question, since both parties are competent witnesses, and when their testimony is in direct conflict, the chancery rule may perhaps he invoked, that when the equity is distinctly denied by the defendant, his denial must prevail, unless other evidence he given than that of the plaintiff alone. In this case there was ample evidence by other witnesses than the plaintiff, both of acts and declarations by the defendant below, 'the plaintiff in error, to establish the equity, that the absolute deed was intended as a mere security for money-loaned and to be loaned.</p>
