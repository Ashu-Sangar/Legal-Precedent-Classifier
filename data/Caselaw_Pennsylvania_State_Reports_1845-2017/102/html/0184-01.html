The Auditor’s ruling introduces a preference in the distribution of an insolvent estate, whereas a just distribution gives an equal share to all stockholders.

That case decided that a withdrawing stockholder could not be put off indefinitely. The award by the Auditor, in the present case, of their full claim to some stockholders, and of nothing to others, is in direct conflict with the principle of that decision ; a withdrawing stockholder is a quasi partner, who must share the losses in case of insolvency, and is entitled only to a pro rata distribution of the funds in the hands of an assignee : Estate of the National Savings Loan and Building Association, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.N.C.%2079" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 W.N.C. 79">9 W.

The several payments, for which credit, was claimed by the treasurer, were made on orders regularly drawn upon him as such. His relation to the association was therefore similar to that of a general creditor ; and, in the absence of any other claimants of that class, he was entitled to be fully paid in preference to either of the other classes, whose claims were founded upon the relation which they sustained to the association, as stockholders thereof. The propriety of the decree, in that particular, has not been seriously questioned, nor indeed can it be. The principal ground of complaint is that after satisfying the treasurer’s claim, the residue of the fund was distributed pro rata among claimants of the second to the exclusion of the third class. That result was reached by holding that members of the association who had given the requisite notice of withdrawal, thereby ceased to be stockholders and became creditors to the extent of the withdrawal value of their stock as evidenced either by orders on the treasurer or by the books of the association, and consequently their claims are superior to those of their fellow stockholders who had not given the requisite notice of withdrawal. In this we think there was manifest error. While, in a qualified sense, withdrawing stockholders may be considered creditors of the association, their rights, as against those with whom they have <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>been associated, are very different from tho e of general creditors whose claims are based wholly on outside transactions. If the association- has been prosperous, they.have a right, under certain limitations and restrictions, to demand and receive their proportionate share of the accumulated fund, but if bad investments have been made or losses have been sustained before actual withdrawal, they must bear their just’proportion thereof. That right, as was held in United States Building and Loan Association <em>v. </em>Silverman, 4 Norris 394, may be enforced by ap: propriate proceedings at law. But, the right of withdrawal and the extent to which it may be exercised presupposes that at least a relative proportion of the assets will remain for the benefit of those who continue to be active members of the association.</p>
    <p id="b207-6" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[117,1000,1166,1198]]]'>When a building association has failed to fulfill the object of its creation and has become hopelessly insolvent, it cannot be justly or equitably wound up on any other principle than that above suggested. After expenses incident to the administration of its assets are deducted, the general creditors, if any, should be first paid in full, and the residue of the-fund should be distributed, pro rata, among those whose claims are based upon stock of the association, whether they have withdrawn and hold orders for the withdrawal value thereof, or not. Both classes are equally meritorious, and in marshaling the assets-neither is entitled to priority over the other. The claims of each are alike based upon their relation to the association as. members thereof. Orders issued to withdrawing stockholders are merely evidence of their .interest in the assets remaining after paj'ing general creditors. As was well said by the learned president of the Common Pleas in the Assigned estate of National Savings, Loan and Building Association, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.N.C.%2079" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 W.N.C. 79">9 W. N. C. 79</a> such an organization is, in fact and in law, a partnership, with corporate rights, in which every stockholder is a member ; and while it may be true that a stockholder may recover judgment against the corporation, and thus become, in a certain sense, a creditor thereof, he is nevertheless not a creditor within the meaning of our assignment laws. There is also great, force in his suggestion that the appropriate method of administering the assets, remaining after payment of general creditors, would be through a receiver. While such a course would be strictly regular, the same result may be more directly and equally as well attained, by the course pursued in this case.</p>
