The court below, in their opinion, holds that the office of controller of the city of Philadelphia is a county office, but omits to determine the question in whom the power rests to fill a vacancy therein. It evidently assumes that being a county office the power is vested in the Governor. But that does not follow, unless it be shown that “ provision is not already made (prior to the Act of 1874) to fill said vacancyfor it is solely upon this proviso that the Governor’s right to appoint is based, under the Act of May 15th 1874 (P. L. 205). But by the Consolidation Act of 1854, which created the office of city controller, provision was made for filling a vacancy therein. Section 45 of that Act vests the power of removal in the city councils, and section 46 provides for the reciprocal power of filling vacancies, as follows:</p>

Even if the provisions of art. XIV. of the Constitution and of the 17th section of the Act of March 31st 1876 (P. L. 13) make the city controller of Philadelphia technically a county controller, it does not affect the argument as to power of removal and filling vacancies. The change is only one of name and time of electionthe incumbent is elected by the same constituents ; the duties and functions are the same; the amenability to councils, the penalties and the term of office remain the same. In all fiscal concerns the functions of county officers of Philadelphia as distinguished from city officers have ceased: Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 2 P. F. S. 454.

It was decided in Walsh <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 Norris 421, that by the adoption of the Constitution the officers enumerated in the first section of the fourteenth article were ipso facto created for and attached to every county, and it necessarily follows that even if the office of city controller, existing at the date of the adoption of the Constitution, was not converted into a county office, the election for controller in November 1874, and each successive election, was for the constitutional office of controller, and that if there is a distinctive office of city controller it is in abeyance. The clause of the Act of 1876 to the same effect is merely declaratory of the Constitution. Its title is broad enough to embrace this provision : Blood <em>v. </em>Mercelliott, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20391" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Smith &amp; H. 391">3 Smith 391</a>.</p>

It would be inconsistent with established usage that a body like the city councils should elect a county officer, even for the purpose of filling a vacancy ; and the more especially would this be so since the office has been invested with new duties independent of its former relations to the city councils. All these considerations justify the conclusion that the case was within the Act of May 15th 1874 (P. L. 205), and that the vacancy in the office of city controller created by the withdrawal of the former incumbent was properly filled by the Governor.</p>

The purpose was to deal with duties, using names so far only as to indicate the objects to be attained. Hence art. XIV. § 1, declares “ county officers shall consist of shei'iffs, coroners, prothonotaries, registers of wills, recorders of deeds, commissioners treasurers, surveyors, auditors or controllers, clerks of the courts, district attorneys and such others as may from time to time be established by law.”</p>

The fair import of the language “ auditors or controllers,” in the connection it is used with other official titles, admits of one construction only. It assumes that each substantially exercises the same powers and performs the same duties, and when those powers and duties are coextensive with a county, by whichever name they may be designated, they shall be county officers.</p>

If the words “ auditors or controllers ” did not make controllers thereafter elected in Philadelphia county officers, legislative authority under the clause cited is most ample to so make them. The form of law by which this power may be exercised rests in the sound discretion of the legislative branch of the government. It may be done either by the creation of a new officer whose powers and duties extend over the whole county, or by so designating, an existing officer <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>of like powers and duties. Hence, in the exercise of legislative power expressly given by tbe constitution, section 17 of the Act of 31st March 1876, P.
