What legislative authority do defendants show us for such taking or change of use? The organization of the defendant company is under the general railroad law. They claim no special privileges. Their case is certainly no stronger than that of the defendants in Mifflin <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., 4 Harris 191, where the railroad company was authorized to purchase a turnpike road from the company owing it, for the purpose of laying rail thereon, under certain supplements, which supplements said nothing about damages. But the Supreme Court held they took under their original charter, which contained the usual provisions for assessment of damages (sections 79 and 80, pages 595 and 596, P. L. session 1831-2); and that plaintiff was entitled to have his damages assessed against the railroad <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>company for the change of use, though lie had receipted in full to the turnpike company for damages sustained by the location and construction of the turnpike road, and though the railroad occupied no other ground than that formerly used by the turnpike. That in some cases the change of use from a canal to a railroad would be a very serious injury to the owners of property adapted for certain purposes, and used in connection with the privileges secured to all citizens on the canal, is very evident. The abandonment of the canal would, we have heretofore held in such a case, be damnum absque injuria (and see Pennsylvania &amp; New York Canal and Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Bunnell, 2d Weekly Notes 633); but it certainly, in many cases, would be no answer to a just claim for damages by the construction of a railroad, to say that the damages were settled for, when the canal, whose place the railroad took, was constructed.

There is no language in the Act incorporating said'company, expressly giving, or necessarily, or even fairly implying any such light or power. Every provision and every implication in the Act is fully complied with by assuming that the company took only a right of way over these lands. Because the use may continue forever it does not draw to itself the fee. ■ It may well be a perpetual use and the fee remain in the owner, and when the use ceases, as it did in this case, the title and the right of possession become absolute in the owner : Jessup <em>v. </em>Loucks, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20350" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="5 Smith &amp; H. 350">5 Smith 350</a>. This is not the ease of a public improvement made by the Commonwealth, but the ordinary case of a corporation invested with the right of eminent domain for a particular purpose, and if the Commonwealth should resume the franchises and purchase the property of the corporation it would take only such franchises as it had granted, and such real estate as had been properly acquired under them. The title which the defendant company took by their purchase was nothing more, at furthest, than the right to maintain and operate a canal over the land ; and that right, we submit, could not be purchased and held by this railroad company. It was incorporated May 18th 1874, for the purpose of building and operating a railroad. The constitution at that time, and yet in force, provides that “ no corporation shall engage in any business other than that expressly authorized in its charter, nor shall it take or hold any real estate, except such as 'may be necessary and proper for its legitimate business.” How, then, could this railroad company undertake to operate a canal, or take and hold a title or interest in land limited to the ■ maintaining and operating a canal on it? In point of fact, however, the canal has been oblitei'ated, and there is a x'aih'oad in its stead. For this change of use, no law or authority is shown.</p>

    <p id="b51-7" data-blocks='[["BL_51.9",51,[168,694,1170,131]]]'>This case was well tried in the court below, and to the opinion of the learned judge we can add but little beyond our approval.</p>

Again, the charter of a corporation must be construed liberally as to the public, and strictly as to the grantee. Commonwealth <em>v. </em>the North East Bail road Co., 3 Ca. 339. The plaintiff in error, however, inverting this rule, would have us construe its charter in such a manner as to give it not only such rights as are therein plainly granted, but also such as may be raised by a forced construction of that instrument. This, we need scarcely say, cannot be done, It would be such an exercise of judicial charity in favor of a corporation, as has not yet found place in the courts of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b51-9" data-blocks='[["BL_51.11",51,[165,1337,1167,855]]]'>This whole case is determinable by the solution of a single proposition, which is this; if the Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio Canal Company took, under its charter, a fee in the land of Thomas Bruce, then the judgment of the court below was wrong and must be reversed; but if it took but an easement that judgment was correct and must be affirmed. But when we come to examine the act of incorporation we find no trace of the power, as claimed by the defendant, to take, by the exercisé of the right of eminent domain, an absolute estate in land. “ That for the purpose of assuring to the corporation,” reads the act, “ all the lands, real estate, waters and materials, requisite for most economically constructing and maintaining said canal and the works connected therewith, and incident and necessary to the navigation of the same, whenever the said lands, waters and materials shall not be attained by voluntary donation or fair purchase, it shall be lawful for said corporation, by any of their officers, and each and every agent, superintendent or' engineer by them employed, to enter upon, take possession of and use all such lands, real estate and streams as may be necessary for the purposes aforesaid.”</p>

There was, then, in this company but a possession and use, in other words, a right of way, and that for a single purpose, the construction and maintenance of a canal, and when the canal was abandoned the use and occupation of the land reverted to the owner of the fee: Jessup <em>v. </em>Loucks, 5 P. F. S. 350. It follows the possession having thus revested in the owner he may maintain any action that is necessary to regain his rights ór to protect his property : Ridge Turnpike Co. <em>v. </em>Stoever, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20379" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 379">6 W. &amp; S. 379</a>.</p>
    <p id="b52-6" data-blocks='[["BL_52.5",52,[281,794,1174,684]]]'>If further argument were needed to fortify this position, it might be found in the fact that in the act not one word is discoverable which gives damages to the-owner of .the land for the taking of the fee. On the other hand, the commissioners who were to be appointed to make the assessments were to be confined to <em>“ </em>such - damages as they think any person will sustain, or have sustained, by the opening of the'said danah through his or her lands, or by the construction of embankments, reservoirs, &amp;c. or for 'any materials used in the construction thereof or from the diversion of water.” But if compensation was not allowed for the taking of the fee in the land no such fee could be taken. This company, as we have already seen, had the right to take and hold lands in fee, but such taking must be by gift or purchase and not by the right of eminent domain; that right extended not beyond a use and occupation, and we cannot agree to enlarge it by implication.</p>
    <p id="b52-7" data-blocks='[["BL_52.6",52,[272,1476,1169,941]],["BL_53.1",53,[159,413,1164,342]]]'>But it is urged, that, by the act of the legislature, the Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio canal was made a public highway, and that therefore the state had the undoubted right to grant the use of that highway to the present corporation, and that without compensation to any one. But this proposition is founded upon a premise that will not bear scrutiny. In the first place, this public highway belonged toa private corporation, and it was public only in this, that the public had the right to use it by paying the tolls which the company might see fit to charge. It was a public highway in the sense that a tavern is a public house. Any one might float a boat over the one, under the same conditions that he might stop at and demand entertainment in the other, that is, by paying the proper charges. Thus, whilst the canal company held its franchise subject to a qualified jmblie right, yet its navigable way was its own property, and was by no means like a common road or street over which the commonwealth has the exclusive control, and which it may devote to corporate uses. Without the consent of the canal company the state could not, in the absence of provision -for compensation, have appropriated this canal to the use of another company, any more than it could so appropriate the property of a private person. It is thus made patent that the attempt to bring this <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>case within that class of cases, in which is recognized the right of the commonwealth to authorize'a railroad to lay its track on a common road or street, cannot be sustained. In the second place, it was only as a canal that the improvement of the Pennsylvania &amp; Ohio Company could be regarded even as a quasi public highway. It was to the canal that the legislature gave that character, and to nothing else, and when it was abandoned as a canal its character as a highway went with it.</p>
