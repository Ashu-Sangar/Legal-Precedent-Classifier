Blunter, committee of Joseph Strassburger a lunatic. Before the Auditor to whom the said account was referred, it appeared that the accountant received, on his appointment as committee in 1868, about $4818.41, and in his account filed April 30th 1877, claimed a balance due to" him of $1,600. Among numerous objections to the account were those to credits for money spent in the repair of a house belonging to the lunatic and in building a new kitchen in place of an old and dilapidated one, the ground of objection being that the committee had not obtained a previous order of court, authorizing him to make said expenditures.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b607-11" data-blocks='[["BL_607.14",607,[162,1920,1157,77]]]'>The Auditor sustained the objection and surcharged the accountant with the amounts for which he claimed credit.</p>

In making the repairs of the property of the lunatic, without a previous order of the court, the committee ran the risk of not having his action approved. In so far as the court has since decided the repairs to have been necessary and proper, the ratification is as valid as if previously authorized. The learned judge appears to have carefully scrutinized all the charges made by the committee. lie has allowed for no repairs that he would not have ordered in case application had been made before the expenditures were incurred. We see nothing in the case to require us to reverse his action in the adjustment of the account.</p>
