Besides, the hospital service of the United States is confined to our own ports, and is maintained in but few of these ; and non constat that the sums collected and paid over, as hospital dues, will be adequate for the support of the service where it is thus provided for; whereas the provision of the maritime law secured relief in all the seas and sea ports upon the globe. It cannot be pretended, therefore, that seamen, injured in the ship’s service, who, by the maritime law, had a right to be cured at the ship’s expense, must accept, in lieu of that right, a provision so inadequate. The provisions of the Acts of Congress, above recited, cannot be regarded as repealing the ancient maritime provision, referred to, but must be treated as simply auxiliary to it. The provision for hospital dues enables seamen, at their own expense, to increase their opportunities for medical treatment, and provides an additional safeguard for their own protection, when the vessel and its owners are perhaps in foreign seas, or cannot or will not extend the aid which the law requires.</p>

Of the circumstances of the removal, it is not shown that the physician had any notice; of the tender and refusal of the hospital service it does not appear that he knew anything. No notice was subse<a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>quently given, and the physician had a right to assume that the rights and the responsibilities of the parties continued. The claim here is for medicines and medical attendance only, there is no claim for nursing, board or other service during illness.</p>
