The several Mennonite congregations of Eastern Pennsylvania, of which the Colebrookdale was one, had been associated in a common conference, called from its place of meeting the Franconia Conference, which was composed of clerical and lay delegates from the several congregations, and whose purpose was the general government of the church. In or about the year 1844, a discussion arose in this conference concerning the customs and usages of the Mennonite Church. One party desired to introduce various innovations into their mode of life and method of religious worship, a departure that was signalized by the leader of the movement, a Bev. John Overholtzer, appearing in the conference in a. coat of a different cut from the customary garb of the Mennonite persuasion. The discussion of these differences between the two parties, known as the “Old” and “New” Mennonite Church, gave rise to great dissension in the conference, and finally culminated in 1847 in the Overholtzer or “ new ” party formally withdrawing from the Franconia Conference and organizing a new judicatory. The schism extended from the conference to its component congregations. Of the two preachers at Colebrookdale, one, a Mr. Grehtnan, sided with the Franconia Conference or “ Old ” Church, while the other, a Mr. Clemmer, espoused the cause of the Overholtzer party. A separation thus ensued, but both parties, being non-combatant in principle, consented to worship m the meeting-house on alternate Sabbaths, and this peaceful arrangement continued for twenty-nine years.</p>

In recognition of the long-continued occupancy of the church 'on alternate Sabbaths by the new congregation, they drew up a paper, in which, after stating their intention of rebuilding, they offered the new party the use of the new church on alternate Sabbaths, as theretofore, but accompanied their offer with a stipulation that “po musical instruments or any other things objectionable to the old congregation ” should be introduced. The paper concluded as follows : “ The new congregation shall be at liberty to aid in the building and contribute to the liquidation of the costs according to their own free will and pleasure, as they may deem just and proper.”</p>

      <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>The Master reported, inter alia, (1) that the withdrawal from the Franconia Conference by the Overholtzer party was an actual separation from the Mennonite faith, and the formation of a new ecclesiastical organization; (2) that-such withdrawal by the plaintiffs was an abandonment of all their right and title in the Boyertown clmrch property, and that it belonged exclusively to those who remained in the jurisdiction of the Franconia Conference; (3) that the use of the church at Boyertown was merely permissive and that, therefore, no title arose by reason of any statute of limitations; (d) that plaintiffs are not tenants in common, but merely tenants by sufferance. He therefore reported a decree that the plaintiffs’ bill be dismissed with costs. The plaintiffs excepted to these conclusions both of law and fact. The court, after argument, recommitted the case to another Examiner and Master (Frank R. Schell, Esq.), with leave to take further testimony, who reported, inter al.a, that the deed contained no express condition that this congregation should be under the supervision of the Franconia Conference or any other conference of the Mennonite Church; that it is doubtful whether this conference could be called an ecclesiastical judicatory ; but assuming that it was, only a radical change of faith and doctrine and not a mere separation from any particular church judicatory, would have the effect to forfeit its rights in the trust; that the changes proposed by the New Mennonites were not such radical changes in faith or doctrine, but were evidences of a progressive spirit, which merited judicial sanction rather than condemnation; that independent of these facts, both parties by their acts and conduct after the division in 18é7 are estopped from now disputing the right of either to the common enjoyment of the church property. He therefore recommended that the parties to the bill be decreed to be tenants in common, and that the defendants pay the costs of this proceeding.</p>

Assuming, however, that it did, time does not run against a trust, having the character of a religious or charitable use, and of which equity alone takes cognizance. In Perry on Trusts, sec. 745, it is held that so long as the relation of trustee and cestui que trust continues, no length of time can bar the rights of a beneficiary, as the rights of a creditor may be1 barred. Still less will the Statute of. Limitations apply to a charitable trust, there being “ no limitation against God and religion.” And when a corporation held the property of a charity 150 years adversely under a deed of purchase, but with notice of the charitable use, it was decreed that the property should be re-conveyed upon the original trusts: McKissick <em>v. </em>Pickle, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20H.%20148" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 H. 148">4 H. 148</a>; Pickle <em>v. </em>McKissick, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20H.%20232" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 H. 232">9 H. 232</a>; Jones et al. <em>v. </em>Wadsworth et al., <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.N.C.%20514" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 W.N.C. 514">4 W.

It is very full,.clear, and impartial in its statement of facts, and, in view of those facts, the conclusion reached seems to us inevitable. These new measure men had not a foot to stand upon, in the way of the maintenance of a bill, legal or equitable. More than half a century before the secession of Overholtzer, and those who adopted his principles, the property in controversy was deeded to the Mennonite congregation of Colebrookdale township, and there is not a circumstance in the case that points to a disproval of the fact that the defendants represent the legal succession of the original congregation of 1790. Not only has the same organization been regularly continued from that time, but as the Master finds, so far back as tradition extends, it has had the same ecclesiastical connection. It may, indeed, be true, that this long connection with the Franconia Conference may not be of any very great importance in the disposition of this case, forasmuch as the Mennonite churches are, in their government, congregational; historically, however, it lias some force as an indication of what was the original <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>Colebrookdale congregation. But passing this question of ecclesiastical connection which, were it material, must at once drive the plaintiffs to the wall, for they make no pretence to a connection with the old conference, we ask, upon what do these new measure people profess to stand ? — Not upon the fact that they are a majority of the congregation, for it is admitted that they are but a minority, hence, according to the organic law of Congregationalism, not entitled to the control of the church and its property. Neither do they profess to represent the original Mennonite doctrines, for confessedly they are dissenters. The second Master in his report has said that the primary cause of of the differences between these people had its origin in the cut of the Kev. Mr. Overlioltzer’s coat. Undoubtedly such was the fact, for this new-fangled coat, when it first made its appearance in the conference, symbolized rebellion ; a change of principles, and it is not the first time that the cut or turning of a coat has signified something of much more importance than was apparent either in its style or texture. In this case it meant a written constitution for one merely traditional; a revision of the catechism ; a permission to marry outside of the palé of the church; a permission to institute aggressive proceedings at law, and an allowance of the use of instruments in church music. Now, we do not undertake to say that these are not improvements on the old way of doing things. They may, or may not be so, just as people choose to think about them. But of these matters it is not our business, as it was not the business of the court below, to decide, for they are questions of conscience, and belong to individual judgment.</p>

If then, it be so, that these coinpláinants are not the representatives of the original ecclesiastical connection ; if they have not with them a majority of the congregation, and if they do not adhere to the original Mennonite tenets, upon what substantial ground do they ask for a decree ?</p>
