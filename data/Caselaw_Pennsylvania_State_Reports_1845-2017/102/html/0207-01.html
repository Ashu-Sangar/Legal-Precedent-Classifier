Sr. 30, said that it is an ordinary and common rule of construction in wills “ not to consider exactly the order of placing the words, if it would better answer the apparent intent of the testator otherwise.” The purpose and limit of this rule were ascertained by the same judge in Marlborough <em>v. </em>Godolphin, 2 Ves. Sr. 74 to be to attain the intent which appeared on the face of the will, but not to let in other devisees, where the persons to take are certain, and the only question respects the interest to be taken. In a case like the present, where the testator has clearly indicated his intended beneficiaries, and the proportions in which they shall take his entire property, but where a literal adherence to <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>the order of his bequests will involve an intestacy as to the greater part of his estate, there would seem to be a clear field for the application of the rule. His design, apparent on the face of the will, was to provide for his unmarried daughters, and to make the gift to those who were married, contingent upon the receipt of the insurance moneys. It 'was uncertain at the date of the will whether these moneys would be realized. He, therefore, in one part of the instrument, disposed of his estate as it then stood, and in another gave additional legacies in case the moneys should be received. He neglected, however, in expressing it, to give the natural and logical order of his thought. That order would have been observed if he had said; “ I give to my unmarried daughters all the residue of my estate, and in case my estate shall realize the insurance upon my life, I give to each of my daughters who may be married $1,000.” If the clause in which he disposes of his whole estate be made to precede the clause which was meant to be subsidiary to it, the introductory words providing for a failure to realize the insurance moneys would be unnecessary, and might safely be rejected as surplusage. Unless we so marshal his language, the gift of the residue will be defeated, and the children who most needed his bounty, and who were evidently the chief "objects of his care, will receive less than those whose legacies were fixed at a specific sum, and limited upon a contingency.”</p>

F. S. 415, regard must be had to the whole scheme of the will, and if it is found that a particular intent is inconsistent with the general intent, the former must give way to the latter. Another rule is that cited in the brief and able opinion of the court below, from the'case of East <em>v. </em>Cook, ‘2 Yes. Sr. 30 ; that is-to say, we are not to consider exactly the prder in which the words are placed, if a different arrangement will better answer the apparent intent of the testator. A third rule is, that no presumption of an intent, on part of the testator, to die intestate of any part of his property, is to be made, when his words, as found in the will, can fairly be construed to dispose of the whole of it.</p>
    <p id="b228-8" data-blocks='[["BL_228.12",228,[274,2219,1156,129]],["BL_229.1",229,[156,388,1165,299]]]'>The mere statement of these rules is, in itself, sufficient to dispose of the case before us. That Dr. Scoffin did iutend to dispose of his whole estate, isa matter that, from the whole <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>tenor of his will, is not doubtful. That there was such a disposition of it for and during the life of his wife is, we believe, not disputed, and the only shadow of a reason urged against the absolute and final character of that disposition is supposed to be found in that part of the will in which the testator attempts to define the conditions under which his married daughters shall have their bequests of $1,000 each.</p>
    <p id="b229-6" data-blocks='[["BL_229.6",229,[156,687,1164,1674]],["BL_230.1",230,[305,405,1163,80]]]'>We fully agree with the court below, that the will, from the beginning to the end, most clearly shows that the main design of the testator was to provide for his wife and unmarried daughters, including such as might happen to be widowed. If, however, we adopt the theory of the appellant, and wipe out the residuary clause, we give the preference, by $1,000 each out of this small estate, to those daughters who may chance to have husbands at the time of their mother’s death. And why? That, says the appellant, the sum thus .given may stand as an offset or equivalent for the maintenance of the unmarried daughters in their father’s house! In other words, the? scant subsistence which this small estate can afford to these helpless girls, during their mother’s life, is to be charged up to them, and finally to be deducted from the share that may fall to them. But how, suppose one of them happens to marry the day before the mother’s death ? She is, nevertheless, to have her $1,000, though she has had her maintenance with the others. Here is a fact which at once breaks down the appellant’s hypothesis, and still leaves the assumed preference for the married daughters unaccounted for. Perhaps it was intended as a kind of premium upon marriage? But in the way of this supposition stands the fact, that though a daughter had been married, if she was unfortunate enough to lose her husband before the time fixed for the distribution of the estate, she was entitled to no preference, but took only as one of the unmarried children ; and yet we can hardly suppose that the testator had it in mind thus to reflect upon an unfortunate daughter for the loss of her husband. The consideration of these things show us most conclusively what the testator did not mean, and so strengthens the position assumed by the court below. If, however, in pursuance of the rules above stated, we allow the residuary clause to stand, and disentangle it from the awkward and unskillful language-by which it is surrounded, everything in the'will becomes clear and unambiguous. The married daughters are to have each $1,000, because they are to enjoy no other part of the decedent’s property, and to the unmarried daughters, whether widows or spinsters, there is no specific bequest, because to them goes the residue of the estate. We therefore approve of the decree of the Orphans’ Court, because, as it seems to us, it enforces that <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>construction of the paper in controversy which most clearly reveals the will of the testator.</p>
