If this judgment had.been given by the grantees to Stunner [the- vendor], and by him assigned to the bank, it would undoubtedly have-been a purchase money judgment. Why, then, should the fact that it is given directly to the bank prevent its being so regarded, when; in point of fact, the money which it secures does constitute a part of the purchase money of the property. By consent of the vendor, the vendees contract directly with the bank, to pay it this part of the consideration of the sale.”</p>

The Deininger mortgage not only fails to state that it was given for purchase-money, but, if that was its real character, its recitals are positively misleading.

The Act of 1850, which was local, was fully supplied by that of 1859, which was general, and a complete revision of the law on the subject. The Act of 1859 not only defined the powers and peculiar privileges ofj building and savings associations, incorporated under its provisions, but it promoted associations, formed under previous statutes, to the exercise of the same powers and privileges ; thus establishing a uniform, consistent and general law, for the observance of all. This was practically the first encouragement, which the scheme for establishing associations of this character received from the state; all previous legislation had been merely local, tire courts were severe in their strictures upon it, the receipt of premiums and fines was held to be usurious, and the recovery of the sum loaned only, with interest upon it, allowed ; all in excess of this was held to be usury.

The announcement of the decision of this court, in the case of Rhoads <em>v. </em>Hoernerstown Building Association, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20Pa.%20187" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="82 Pa. 187">supra;</a> although subsequent to the granting of this charter, was not the introduction of any new principle, but was simply the application of an old and familiar rule of construction, to the Act of <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>1859, which declared its meaning and effect from the date of its passage. The presumption is that the court, in the granting of this charter, was neither ignorant of the rule, nor incapable of applying it. This presumption is greatly strengthened by a reference to the proceedings, under which the charter was granted. The first section of the Act of 1859 provides, that tlie application for a charter shall be made to a court of common pleas of the proper county, in the manner and at such times and, as prescribed by the 13th section of the Act of 13th October 1840, and, the 13th, 14th and 15th sections, of that Act, were extended to and made part of the Act of 1859, with regard to such associations. Referring to these sections of the Act of 1840, and to the proceedings to obtain this charter, it will be found, that the latter closely pursued the provisions and requirements of the <em>former. </em>The application was in almost the precise language of the Act, and “ specified the objects, articles conditions and name, style and title under which they associated.” What the court intended to do would probably best appear from what the court actually did, but the several orders and decrees of the court are not given in the testimony; we assume, therefore, that nothing appears in the orders and decrees entered, inconsistent with proceedings under the Act of 1859, or those sections of the Act of 1840 which are part thereof.</p>

It is an abundant answer to this contention, that this association is unquestionably and essentially a building association, not only in name but in nature. Although some of the powei’s conferred are inconsistent with the Act of 1859, the acceptance of the charter is necessarily subject to its provisions ; thus these inconsistencies are rendered inoperative.
