That relation gives l’ise to great confidence and the attorney is presumed to have the power to strongly influence his client, and to gain by his good nature and credulity, and to obtain undue advantages and gratuities. Hence, the law often declares transactions between them void, which between other persons would be unobjectionable. Unless the transaction is fair and conscionable it is deemed a constructive fraud. This long established rule applies to this case, even if the receipt is taken as evidence of a settlement of the amount of fees for the services in the judgment therein recited. More than eighteen per centum was deducted for fees, and the jflaintiff in the first place must show that the sum retained is larger than the services of the defendant were reasonably worth, or larger than agreed upon if there was an express contract. If he does, then the burden is cast upon the defendant to prove to the 'satisfaction of the jury that the sum was <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>retained by his client’s agreement under circumstances that made it fair and conscionable.</p>

After the date of the receipt the defendant wrote an order in favor of James, which Saeger signed, for the costs, amounting to $160.40. James received the costs ; but nothing from the defendant except letters containing, among other things, urgent directions to draw the costs and not pay a cent to the witnesses or Saeger. These letters tend to show the manner of dealing between the parties, and Saeger’s dissatisfaction. The evidence ought to have been submitted to the jury and considered in connection with the fact that the parties held the confidential relationship of attorney and client. It is now immaterial whether the defendant could rightfully have paid out of money in his hands, James’ fee; he did not. The first and sixth specifications of error must be sustained.</p>
