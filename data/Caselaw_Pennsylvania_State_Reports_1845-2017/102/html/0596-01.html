Thomas Norton employed counsel to represent his interest at the sheriffs sale, who examined the judgment docket and found that the above mentioned judgment of Franklin Township against John S.

May ; that this mistake was not discovered until several weeks after the said sheriff’s sale, when the prothonotary erased the word “satisfied” as written, and wrote it on the line above, opposite the Silvara judgment. It further appeared that Franklin Township had no knowledge of said erroneous entry until after said sheriff’s sale, and also aid not have knowledge of said sale until some time after it took place. W. T. Davies testified that the full value of the tract sold at said sheriff’s sale was $1,800 or $2,000, and that if the Franklin Township judgment had not been satisfied of record, he would have bid up the property to an amount sufficient to cover both that judgment and his own. Other witnesses corroborated him as to the value of said tract.

It is no defence to an action for damages by persons aggrieved by this act for him to show that he made a clerical error or an honest mistake. It was undoubtedly more than a mere clerical error. It was an official error. It was only by virtue of his official authority that he is authorized to enter satisfaction.
