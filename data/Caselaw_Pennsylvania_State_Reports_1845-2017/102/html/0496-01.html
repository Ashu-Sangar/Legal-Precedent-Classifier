J., the following facts appeared : At an Orphans’ Court sale of reSl estate by the administrators of Wotring, Thomas Bertseh became the purchaser of a tract of land for $1,250, possession not 'to'be'delivered until payment of purchase money. Bertseh paid $300, and gave a note for $500, and it was then agreed between him and the vendors, that if he would give a note for the balance of $450, with a satisfactory surety, lie should be permitted to take immediate possession. Bertseh gave such note with one.Kehnel as surety, which was accepted as satisfactory, and he took possession. Some time afterwards Kehnel declined to continue as surety, and Bertseh then signed the note in suit, with Saeger as <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>Surety, which was accepted by the vendors in place of the former note which was surrendered and cancelled.

    <p class="summary" id="b515-8" data-blocks='[["BL_515.8",515,[138,1035,1168,685]]]'>“It is contended by the plaintiffs that something else entered into the consideration of this note; that part of the consideration of the note was, that Bertsch should have possession at once upon the giving of the note, and before he had paid the whole purchase money in cash, which had been agreed upon. The court is of the opinion, however, that that fact, even if it were found, would not entitle the .plaintiffs to recover, because after all Bertsch went into possession as a purchaser, and all he was to pay for the land, including the possession he obtained, was his bid of $1,250, and so this is a case, in the opinion of the court, where the seller of land is seeking to recover part of the purchase money of the land against a man who never obtained the title, on a sale which the seller himself rescinded ; because the administrators by making another sale of the land to Henninger rescinded the sale,- and the plaintiffs cannot recover the purchase money in this case.”</p>

This suit is not to recover from the person to whom the property was first struck down, the difference between his bid, and the sum for which it was afterwards sold. It is against one who signed the note as security for the payment of so much of the purchase money. When that sale was rescinded, all liability for purchase money as such fell, and thenceforth the note was without consideration to support it.</p>
