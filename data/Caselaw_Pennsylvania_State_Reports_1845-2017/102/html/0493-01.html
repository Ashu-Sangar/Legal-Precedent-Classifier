J., the plaintiff’s evidence showed the following facts: — In the partition of the real estate of John H. Romig Sr. in the Orphans’ Court, in 1845, said real estate was divided into two purparts, one of which was accepted at the valuation by John Ii. Romig, Jr., charged with the sum of $3758.25, and purpart No. 2 was accepted by David Gackenbach and May his wife, née Romig, charged with the sum of $659.61, the interest on said sums so charged on the land, to be paid to the widow of John H. Romig,'Sr. for life, and on her death the principal to bo divided between his children. Subsequently the said Gackenbach and wife conveyed purpart No. 2, subject to said charge, to said John IT. Romig, Jr., whereby both purparts became vested in him. Under a judgment after-wards recovered against him both tracts were sold at sheriff’s sale, as his property, in 1851, to the'defendant David Koons, and a sheriff’s deed was duly acknowledged to him therefor. John H. Romig, Jr., afterwards died, and letters of administration on his estate, were granted to the plaintiff.

Romig, that therefore the interest of John H. Romig in said thirds remained charged on ' the land, and the defendant, who-is the sheriff’s vendee, is liable in this action. The interest of John H.

Therefore, by the acceptance by an heir of a portion of the land charged, and by the subsequent convey anee to him of other land so charged, there was no merger of his personalty interest in said principal sum in his estate in the land: Schall’s Appeal, 4 Wr. 170; Gourley <em>v. </em>Kinley, 16 P.
