Besides, the claim was made too late. The attachment execution issued October 21st 1880, and the claim for exemption was not made until March 5th 1881. This was not at the same term, nor within a reasonable time : Bair <em>v. </em>Steinman, 2 P. F. S. 423; Bittennger’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/76/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="76 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1038888" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0105-01">76 Pa. St. 105</a>. The costs which a "plaintiff recovers are his costs, and. are as much a part of the judgment in his favor as the judgment- for the debt. - There is no privity between plaintiff’s witnesses and defendant, and defendant owes such witnesses nothing. Nor is any part of the amount paid to plaintiff on the judgment a-trust fund in his hands. The relation of plaintiff and -his witnesses is simply that of 'debtor and creditor, and that relation neither arises out of, nor is -modified-<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>by the fact of recovery or non-recovery by plaintiff of witness fees as part of his costs in the cause: Curtis <em>v. </em>Buzzard, 15 S. &amp; R. 22; Horner v.

The defendant, who lived in Chester county, was not served with the attachment, and filed his claim for exemption as soon as he knew of it, the execution plaintiff having incurred no additional expense by the delay. The claim was clearly in time: Bancord <em>v. </em>Parker. 15 P. F. S. 336. In the cases cited by the plaintiff in error, the defendant was served with the execution, and additional costs were incurred before the claim was made. The amount of Wismer’s bill of costs was not attachable. It was exclusively for witness fees, and mileage which had not been paid. The same principle applies to these costs as to the fees of the protlionotary and sheriff, which a plaintiff collects for them by his execution. Though the legal title to these fees is in the plaintiff, he collects them merely as trustee for the officers: Ranck <em>v. </em>Hill, 3 Barr <em>423; Ellsbre v. </em>Ellsbre, 4 Casey 172. The fees and mileage of a witness belong to him as completely as the fees of the court officers, and the party subpoenaing him, upon the recovery of such fees holds them as trustee for the witness: Adams <em>v. </em>Avery, 2 Pitts. 77; Horner <em>v. </em>Harrington, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20334" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts 334">6 Watts 334</a>; Curtis <em>v. </em>Buzzard, 15 S. &amp; R. 22.</p>

They are, for many purposes, essentially different : Ramsey <em>v. </em>Alexander, 5 S. &amp; R. 344. Costs are an- allowance to a- party tor expenses incurred in conducting his suit: fees are compensation to an officer for services rendered in the progress of the cause: Musser et al. <em>v. </em>Good et al., 11 Id. 247. The plaintiff in a judgment, whether he be plaintiff or defendant in the action, collects the officers’.fees not for.himself, unless he has paid the officers, but as trustee for the officers who rendered the services: Ranck <em>v. </em>Hill’s Executor, 3 Barr 423; Ellsbre <em>v. </em>Ellsbre, 4 Casey 172.

His claim for services is against the party in whose behalf he rendered them. His right thereto is the same, whether such party failed or succeeded in recovering^ judgment. The losing party cannot collect the .fees of his witness from the successful party, yet the former- is nevertheless liable therefor. Nor is his witness’ righc of' action to recover the same, necessarily postponed until final judgment in the case: Utt <em>v. </em>Long, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 174" data-case-ids="480180" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0174-01">6 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 174</a>.</p>

It prescribes the measure of the party’s liability to the witness. Hence it was said by Mr. Justice Kennedy in Horner v. Harrington, <a href="/watts/6/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 Watts 331" data-case-ids="1846134" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0331-01">6 Watts 331</a>, in commenting on the right of a witness under the fee bill, <em>“ </em>the allowance here expressed must be understood, and so it has ever been held, is to be paid to the witnéss by the party at whose instance or on whose behalf he shall have attended court, and the witness can look to no other for it.”</p>

Had he been served with the attachment he should have made his claim of exemption at the term to which the writ was returnable and before the plaintiff therein had taken any step to his detriment: Morris <em>v. </em>Shafer, 12 Norris 490. He however was not served. He appears to have made his claim as soon as he had notice of the execution of the writ, and before the plaintiff in the attachment had taken any further step to his detriment.
