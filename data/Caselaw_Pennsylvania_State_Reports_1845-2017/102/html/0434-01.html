The genuineness of the signatures, the sufficiency of the sureties, the erasures and interlineations, with other matters material to its validity, were proper for the judgment of the court, and are presumed to have been satisfactorily established and explained.</p>

It is undoubtedly time, as held in Smith <em>v. </em>Weld, 2- Barr 54, and many other cases, that “any alteration or addition, in a material or immaterial part of a bond, by the obligee, without the consent of the obligors, avoids the whole deed ; and <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>when the alteration is apparent on the face of the instrument, and non est factum is pleaded, before it is proper to admit it in evidence the consent of all the obligors must be shown, at least some evidence must be given from which their assent may be implied.” Nor can it be disputed that the plea of non est factum goes to the state and condition of the bond when the plea is pleaded as well as when it was sealed and delivered, it puts in issue the execution of the bond and its continuance as the deed of all the parties to the time of the plea.</p>

The bond which was signed by the defendants is a statutory bond, the object and effect of which were, of course, well known to the obligors, whilst its particular conditions are copied from the statute and written on its face. The statute fully defines the rights and responsibilities of the parties, and the court as the mere instrument of the law in taking the security, was without power or discretion to restrain its provisions or limit its operation. No collateral agreement between the obligors can affect its legal force. The bond, as taken by the court,'is the basis of the guardian’s appointment and credit, by force of which he enters into the possession and control of the ward’s estate, and if any deceit or fraud was practiced in procuring the signatures of the sureties, the effects of that fraud cannot.be visited upon the ward, who was no party thereto, and could not therefore be affected by it. If Fink’s agreement with Jacobs was as he alleges, and as he offered to prove, ho should have attended at the adjudication of the security, to see that his agreement was •complied with ; if he failed in this, and entrusted the paper to Jacobs he thereby made Jacobs his agent for the delivery of the bond: Ogle <em>v. </em>Graham, <a href="/pen-w/2/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 132" data-case-ids="8877554" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0132-01">2 P. &amp; W. 132</a>; Sigfried <em>v. </em>Levan, 6 S. &amp; R. 308; Wiley <em>v. </em>Moor, 17 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 438; Patterson <em>v. </em>Patterson, <a href="/pen-w/2/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 200" data-case-ids="8878013" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0200-01">2 P. &amp; W. 200</a>; Beary <em>v. </em>Haines, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%2020" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="4 Whart. 20">4 Wh. 20</a>. He must therefore accept the consequences of his own act. If objection had been raised when the bond was presented for approval, or an application made at any time before Xander’s insolvency, the court would have taken such action as would, have protected Fink from loss. Instead of this, Fink entrusted this whole matter to Jacobs, who was Xander’s attorney, and thereby became Fink’s agent; and if Jacobs deceived him, he deceived the court also, and Fink must have recourse to Jacobs for redress, and not against those whom the bond was taken to secure. The rule is a familiar one, and well settled in such cases, that he who puts it in the power of another to commit a fraud must bear the consequence: where one of two parties who a're equally innocent of actual fraud must lose, the one who by misplaced confidence in an agent or attorney has been the cause of the loss, shall not throw it on the other: Penna. R. R. Co.’s Appeal, 5 Norris 80; Mundorff <em>v. </em>Wichersham, 13 P. F. Smith 87; or as Judge King has well expressed this principle in the Bank of Kentucky <em>v. </em>Schuylkill Bank, 1 Parsons Eq. Rep. 248., the true doctrine on this subject is that where one of two innocont persons must suffer from the tortious act of a third, he who gave the aggressor the means of doing the wrong, must alone bear the consequence of the act.</p>
