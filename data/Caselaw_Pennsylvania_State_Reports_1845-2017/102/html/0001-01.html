The term of the leasehold, under which Walbridge held, expired, and Walbridge surrendered possession to the owner, Sill; Pruden remained in possession of the house. Subsequently Walbridge, claiming that a balance of $9 remained due to him by Pruden at the time he (Walbridge) gave up .possession, issued a landlord’s warrant of distress, under which Miller as liis bailiff, levied on certain personal property in Pruden’s house, and advertised the same for sale. Pruden’s daughter notified the constable, Miller, that a portion of said property belonged to her. At the time of the constable’s sale,’this property .claimed by the daughter was missing, and the sale of the remaining property did not bring sufficient to satisfy the distress. A search warrant was then procured, and after failure to find the missing goods, upon information by Miller, Pruden was arrested and imprisoned as above stated. At the hearing before the alderman, Walbridge was examined as a witness. He declined to state whether he was the prosecutor. At the conclusion of the hearing, he objected-to the defendant’s request for indulgence until next morning, in order to get bail, it being then late in the evening. (This testimony was objected to, and its admission constituted the 11th assignment of error.) Walbridge denied the above statements. The court permitted plaintiff to testify under objection, that when Miller served the landlord’s warrant, he said, in the absence bf Walbridge, that he was acting-for Walbridge, who had issued the Warrant.

The act was a nullity, and the persons undertaking to enforce it by taking the property of the plaintiff were mere trespassers and the plaintiff was not bound to notice or respect it.” It cannot be doubted that a lessor who has parted with all his interest in the demised premises has no right to distrain for rent in arrea'r.

While it clearly appeared that the information was made by the constable, and there was no positive evidence that he did so by direction of the plaintiff in error, there was testimony from which it might be fairly and legitimately inferred that the latter not only encouraged but actively promoted the prosecution. His conduct during the preliminary hearing, objecting to granting any indulgence to the accused for the purpose of enabling him to procure bail, etc., was not that of a disinterested spectator or witness. It is true, there was some conflict of testimony as to that, and other circumstances tending to show his connection with the prosecution, but the question was properly for the jury <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>and the testimony relating thereto was submitted with instructions that appear to be free from substantial error.

'While it is exclusively the province of the jury to pass upon the testimony and ascertain the facts, it is the duty of the court to say, as matter of law, whether they do or do not amount to probable cause. In that sense, probable cause is considered a mixed question of law and fact; and it was so treated by the learned judge in this case. He directed the jury to inquire, in the iirst .place, whether the plaintiff in error originated or promoted the prosecution. If they found he did not, there could be no recovery ; but, if they were satisfied that he did, it then became their duty to determine whether he had probable cause for so doing. • If he acted in good faith, “ not merely using the process of the criminal haw for the purpose of enforcing the payment of money, . . . and that the circumstances were such as to lead a judicious man to believe there had been a violation of the law, it would constitute probable cause.” If they found there was probable cause, “ that would be the end of the case, because there must not only be want of probable cause but malice.” If there was not probable cause, they should then consider the question of malice, etc. In all its aspects, the case was as favorably presented to the jury as the plaintiff in error could reasonably ask. The principal difficulty with which he had to contend was that the preponderance of evidence was against him, and the jury found accordingly.</p>
