Our judgment is conclusive of the debt of his estate ; the fund being “subject to the further order of the court” should be applied thereto. If Catharine ELoban had not been a lunatic, and the fund had been awarded to her, she would have been obliged to give a refunding bond, on which we could have recovered from her or her estate the amount of our judgment. The status of the present fund in the hands of the committee is that of a sum awarded, but not paid for want of a refunding bond, the court retaining control of it to meet the demands of James Hoban’s creditors, if any, which might be established. The court should have decreed its payment into court by the committee, and then have awarded it towards payment of our judgment.</p>

Besides, the fund was actually paid overby James Hoban’s administrator in accordance with the decree of distribution, to the committee of Catharine Hoban, who blended it with other moneys of the lunatic, and used it for her support. The decree on the account of the substituted committee lias also established the fact that the fund belongs to Catharine Hoban’s estate, and that decree cannot be impeached collaterally in this proceeding.

In pursuance of this order the money was paid to Mr. Crane. He blended it with other moneys of hers in his hands, and thus mingled, it was used for her benefit. On the death of Mr. Crane, all her money remaining unexpended was passed over to Mr. Hand, the succeeding committee. On the death of Catharine, Hand settled his account as her committee.
