On the southern or lower side of the street, at the edge of the culvert, a hand rail had been placed for the protection of pedestrians, but upon the upper or northern side there was no guard.

    <p class="summary" id="b397-10" data-blocks='[["BL_397.10",397,[159,1919,1165,301]]]'>Answer. This point we cannot affirm as it is here presented ; but we say to you, as we have already said in our general charge, that whenever a city constructs a public work, such as a bridge or a culvert, and leaves it so unguarded and unprotected that a person while passing over it, may in an instant be injured, it falls clearly within the rule we have already stated to you in our general charge.

This may be further illustrated, as it was in several other cases. Where a master employs a servant and puts him in such a dangerous position that in an instant he has to form a judgment whether he shall step to the right or to the left, and having but that instant to save his life, if he errs in judgment and loses his life by taking that step, the master is liable; the master had no business to put his servant in a position of that kind. We apply the same rule of law to a city. If a city will so construct a bridge or a culvert, and leave it in such condition that by an error of judgment committed in the space of only two steps, which may be taken in an instant, the city is liable.” (Sixth assignment of error.)</p>

From a point, on the same side of the street, a short distance beyond the culvert, a foot path diverged in the direction of plaintiff’s home. According to the uncontradicted evidence in the case, including his own testimony, he intentionally left the street <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>with the view of taking the path and following it homeward ; but, by mistake, he turned off the street too soon, — before lie had crossed the culvert and reached the: point where the path commenced, — and was thu's led to the end of the culvert, from which he fell. If he had not purposely- gone beyond the line of the street, or had not turned off quité so soon, it is very evident he would have encountered no danger. The unfortunate accident which befel him resulted not from the want of proper guards for the protection of those passing and repassing along the street, but solely from the fact that he had determined to leave and did leave the street for the purpose above stated. In answer to a question, on cross-examination, the plaintiff himself says he would not have fallen if he had not turned off the street. It cannot be doubted that if he had intended to keep within the lines of the street and proceed thereon in the direction he was going before he turned off to the left, he would have passed the. culvert in safety, and without being exposed to any danger. The testimony is susceptible of no other rational conclusion. It follows, therefore, that in purposely leaving the public highway, as he did, he took upon himself the risk of every danger that beset his path; at least, the city owed him no duty of protection in his voluntary effort, not to follow the street, but to leave it in search of the foot-path, through private property, over which the municipal authorities had no control whatever.</p>

They were each clearly and conclusively established by the testimony of the plaintiff himself and other witnesses. Nor can there beany doubt as to the correctness of the legal conclusions drawn therefrom. We think, therefore, that the learned judge erred in submitting the facts to the jury, and in not affirming the point as presented, without any qualification or expression of doubt as to the correctness of the facts therein stated. The proposition was vital to the defence, and conclusive of the plaintiff’s right to recover upon the evidence before the court and jury.</p>
