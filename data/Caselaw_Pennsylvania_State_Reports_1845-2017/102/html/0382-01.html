The warrants of the City of Scranton, issued under the authority of the charter of said city, and countersigned by the comptroller of the city, are sufficient for the foundation of a suit Or action.

The city is not precluded from setting up any defense she may have, but it is in her power to give them the character of an obligation or liability.</p>

We distinguish this case on its facts from the ordinary case of a city warrant issued with no provision made for interest thereon. Interest is considered an incident to all debts unpaid, after demand and refusal. A city may not be liable without an agreement to pay interest, but we consider it within^, the power of the city of Scranton, incident to the express pow- ^ ers granted, to provide, for the payment of interest in default of payment of the principal. In this case, as the facts show, as ordinance was passed (afterwards repealed,) providing for the payment of interest. It was in force when this order was presented. The power of the city to contract for supplies, would enable it to agree expressly to pay interest on liabilities after they aré diie. In order to save tiie credit of the city, such a power, may be an important one, and its exercise wise. This case is to <em>be </em>distinguished in its facts from the case, of the same plaintiff against the city, reported in Lackawanna Legal Record, <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>vol. 1, p. 393, to which we refer with authorities there cited.

Interest is not recoverable as allowed, from date of the order to date of the judgment. The only ground on which interest was claimed is that it was given by the ordinance offered in evidence by the plaintiff, which was never supposed to be in force, and under which not a dollar of interest has ever been paid on a city order, and which was repealed as soon as claimed to be valid. The date of the ordinance is subsequent to the date of the contract, in part payment of which the order was drawn. If this ordinance gave the contractor something to which he was not entitled when the contract was made, then it is a mere gratuity, and comes within the prohibition of § 5, Act of May 23d 1874 [P. L. 232], which provides that “No ordinance shall be passed, except by a two-thirds' vote of both councils and approved by the mayor, giving any extra compensation to any public officer, servant, employee, ageut or contractor, after services shall have been rendered or contract made.” It does not appear that the ordinance in question was passed in this manner, and the gratuity or extra compensation being illegal without its passage in the particular manner required by the Act, such passage in such manner should appear affirmatively. In no case could interest be allowed after the date of the repealing ordinance, for as the ordinance was passed after the contract was made, it formed no part of the consideration of the contract, and the ordinance <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>being repealed left the order standing without interest under the decisions of this court.</p>

This suit is in the name of the party to whose order it was payable, and to the use of the holder. A written contract, bearing date the'28th'March 1877, was duly executed between the parties in pursuance of an ordinance of the city, whereby the Hyde Park Gas Company was to furnish gas for the public lamps, in consideration of which the city was to pay a sum specified, for the gas provided for each lamp, payments to be made monthly. This warrant bears date the 29th December following. It is drawn on the treasurer of the city of Scranton, directing him to pay to the Hyde Park Gas Company a sum specified, “ for account of gas and water appropriation.” It is signed by the mayor, and countersigned by the city controller. The presumption is that it was given in payment of gas furnished under the contract, and the demand for which it was given had been duly audited and settled by the proper officer of the city. In this important particular the warrant differs from all of the orders referred to in the cases cited. All of those had yet to pass the ordeal of áii audit,"and"their validity and; correctness be tested. Prima facie this warrant had passed all such examination, and no obstacle stood in the way of its absolute payment. It had issued under and by virtue of legislative authority vested in the city, and the evidence of its correctness was stamped <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>on its face. This suit was not only in the name of the party to whom the city was indebted on the contract, but this warrant was a distinct and separate admission of indebtedness by officers on whom the law imposed the duty of determining the same. We think suit may be maintained in the name of the holder of a city warrant thus issued in a negotiable form.</p>
