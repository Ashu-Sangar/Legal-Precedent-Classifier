F. Smith 325, before us, emphasized by the later case of Page’s Estate, 25 P. F. Smith 87, and Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, 39 Leg. Intel. 356, in which the principles of that decision were accepted as operative, we are forced to the conclusion that the will of the testator worked a conversion of his real estate. Among the reasons which give the earliest of these cases a. controlling application to the present, are the gift of the residuary estate, real and personal, to the executors, in trust, to invest the same in such securities as they should select, coupled with a power of sale and a direction, after a final settlement of their accounts, to pay over the balance in their hands, and to convey such real estate as may remain unsold, to the trustees, who were to “ succeed to all the powers of the said trust.” The gift to the life tenant' may also be specified, which carefully enumerates the income, issues and profits, but omits mention of rents ; and the gift of $25,000 to each son, as he should attain eighteen years of age, which was to be paid out of either the principal or income. In these provisions of the will an intent to create from the blended realty and personalty, a fund in money for the purposes of distribution, is at least as diseernable as in Dundas’s Appeal and Roland *. Miller, and this circumstance, in all of the cases cited, was recognized as equivalent to an express direction to sell. Excluding the trust for the children, which failed because the testator died childless, we find, immediately following, the special power of sale for the purposes of that trust, a general and unlimited power to sell, which was designed to meet the event which has actually happened. No analogy is presented between this and the last reported case in which the question was fully argued (Peterson’s Appeal, 7 Nor. 397), because in that case the children were expressly privileged to take the land itself at a valuation, a provision which effectually negatived the theory of a conversion by the testator. The intent is the solo test of conversion, and a devise, as here, to the executors for the purpose of sale, manifests an intent to convert; <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>Chew <em>v. </em>Nicklin, 9 Wr. 84. The objection that the distribution was ordered among heirs as well as next of kin, and that the executors were to pay the taxes and repairs, does not, we think, conflict with our view of the testator’s intention. His use of the phrase “ next of kin or heirs at law,” shows that he regarded those expressions as convertible terms, and we cannot, in^the face of his intention elsewhere to the contrary, substitute “and ” for the disjunctive which he has employed. So the executors might properly be enjoined in the will to provide for the taxes and repairs of the real estate, when the direction to convey to the trustees what remained unsold, indicated the testator’s belief that all' of the property would not be disposed of within the year.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[279,964,1179,1408]],["BL_263.1",263,[166,405,1168,89]]]'>“ More doubt, perhaps, attaches to the remaining question. In the event of his death without issue, the testator declared his will to be that his whole estate, after his wife’s death, should be divided among his heirs or next of kin, as though he had died intestate and unmarried. The auditing judge found these words to be descriptive of so literal a dying without a will, as to obliterate all the provisions for a sale and investment of the real estate; and he therefore awarded a part of the proceeds, representing the real estate which had descended <em>ex parte materna </em>to the heirs on the mother’s side. In opposition to this rendering it is to be observed that immediately after this proviso for a distribution under the intestate laws, the testator confers the power to sell, and directs the payment oyer of the proceeds. May we not reasonably infer that the estate as thus proposed to be converted was in the mind of the testator when lie designated the parties who were to take? If we hold that, as to those parties, the will was to be treated as if it had never been written, we at once ignore all which precedes and follows the intestate clause, descriptive of the estate which was the subject of the gift. We must also ignore the appointment of the trustees, because the intestate clause expressly declares that the whole of the estate sliall vest in and be divided among the next of kin or heirs at law, as though the decedent had died intestate. The difficulty disappears with the statement that when the testator penned the clause in question he had already stamped his property with the character of personalty, and it was therefore of personal estate alone that his direction as to intestacy was predicated. We are told that, in doubtful cases, that construction is to be preferred which most nearly conforms to the statutes of distribution : Smith’s Estate, 11 liar. 9. But there is no disposition in what has been said to evade those statutes; the inquiry simply concerns the fund upon which the statutes are to operate. On the whole, we conclude that the testator, having <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>•worked a conversion by his will, intended his estate to go as personalty to his next of kin, under the intestate laws.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b263-6" data-blocks='[["BL_263.6",263,[166,489,1168,218]]]'>This determination renders it unnecessary to consider the objections which were raised by the children of Joseph Perot, inasmuch as the parties through whom they claim could take only as heirs on the part of the mother, and have no interest in the personal estate of the decedent.</p>

See Patterson’s Appeal, 7 Norris 397. But, as if to guard against any possibility of mistake, the testator, who had created the trust and- made all the provisions with regard to sale and conveyance solely in the interest of his' wife and issue, declared in express terms that, should she die without issue (an event which occurred in his lifetime), his estate should go <em>“ </em>the same as though ” he had “ died intestate and unmarried,” to his heirs at law or next of kin.</p>

Nor did it indicate an intention to “ convert,” for the trustees were to apply income to <em>“ </em>paying taxes, expenses, repairs,” and one can’t “repair” investments. And by the codicil, testator directs his executors “ to convey all real estate which may not have been sold by them ” to trustees for the purposes designated in his will. The rational construction of the powers of sale is that testator authorized a sale, for the more convenient distribution to the persons who would have taken had there been no sale or power of sale. The authority to sell can have no effect upon the question who is to take. This case is different from the class of cases cited by the appellees, such as Evans <em>v. </em>Chew, 21 P. F. S. 47, and Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, 4 Out. 47, in which, unless there was conversion, there was nothing in the will which indicated to whom the property should go. If, under existing circumstances, this were a case of actual intestacy, the duty of administrators would be just what is the duty of the executoi' — no more, no less — yet it is argued that because there is vested in the executor a power of sale for a contingency which has not, and cannot happen, a con<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>version is effected, and parties become' entitled to take who would not otherwise take under the will.</p>

Assuming there was no conversion, who are the parties entitled <em>% </em>They are not named in the will, but are described in these words: “ Such persons, and in such proportions as is provided for by the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, it being my will that . . . [in the contingency which has happened] . . . the whole of my estate shall vest in and be divided among my next of kin or heirs at law, the same as though I had died intestate and unmarried.” There is nothing illegal or irrational in a testator adopting the provisions -of the intestate laws as a designatio personarum. “ Next of kin ” or “heirs at law ” is as certain as if the persons to whom those descriptions apply at the testator’s death were named individually. Those persons .take, immediately on testator’s death, “ the same as though he had died intestate and unmarried.” The court below strike out one class named — “ heirs at law ” — and recognize alone the other class named — " next of kin.” But to disinherit an heir, requires not merely an express exclusion, but an actual devise to some one else, for lapsed devises go to the heir. Uncertainty of meaning determines the construction in favor of descent by law: Lipman’s Appeal, 6 Cas. <em>184; </em>Rupp <em>v. </em>Eberly, 29 P. F. S. 141. The court, misled by their theory of conversion, thought that warranted their finding an intention in the will to override the expressed intention in favor of the heir. But if a testator clearly expresses his intention to die “ the same as if intestate,” how can another and repugnant intention be found in the will <em>%</em>

This testator owned realty and personalty. LLis legal adviser doubtless informed him that if he died intestate without widow or issue, his real estate would descend according to the <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>most complicated rules of inheritance, dependent upon whether he derived title <em>ex parte paterna </em>or <em>ex parte materna; </em>but as to his personalty, the devolution would be perfectly simple, to his next of kin. He would naturally say, why cannot it all go as if I had myself purchased the realty <em>% </em>and on receiving the reply, so it can, if you convert it, he, as we contend, adopted that plan and gave his executors full power of sale of all his real estate, directing them to “invest and re-in vest” the proceeds, and on settlement of their accounts, pay over the balance in their hands and convey any real estate remaining unsold to trustees to “ dispose thereof in accordance with the powers and directions hereinbefore given to my <em>executors” </em>— i.e., inter alia, to convert the unsold real estate. The word “ convey ” is used here in a formal or physical sense, viz., to execute deeds from one set of fiduciaries to another set. His <em>general intent </em>was conversion, sooner or later. With the exception of providing for temporary care-taking of the real estate until sold, all the words of the will relate to personalty and not realty. He directs all his residuary estate, real and personal, to be invested in “ securities,” the “ income, issues and profits ” to be paid over quarterly, and the “principalof my said residuary estate” to be divided, &amp;c. Page’s Estate does decide that a devise of “ all one’s estate, real and personal, to be invested in securities ” works conversion. Eoland <em>v. </em>Miller is to the same effect. It is sought to avoid the effect of Dundas’s appeal, by the fact that an actual sale had been made. The fund for distribution here was, likewise, the proceeds of actual sales, so that case is directly applicable ; but this is immaterial, as the doctrine of conversion applies independently of actual sale. More discretion as to time and mode of sale does not affect the question of conversion: Leiper <em>v. </em>Thomson, 10 P. F. S. 177; Tazewell <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 Randolph 320; Stagg <em>v. </em>Jackson, 1 Comstock 212. The conversion was not merely for administration of the trust, which failed, but a principal object was for the “ division ” of the residuary estate. The argument, deduced from ancient English law, in favor of the heir at law, has no application under our intestate system, in which, beginning with Penn’s agreement and charter, and running through our several intestate acts (the earliest of which were repealed by the crown and as often re-enacted here) down to the Act of 1833, the heir at law is never preferred to the next of kin: Purd. Dig. 809. The only survival with us of ancient doctrines of inheritance is that when the heir at law is entitled, real estate descends according to the blood of the first purchaser. This case illustrates its absurdity, for according to that canon, we must, in order to find the testator’s heirs as to real estate <em>ex parte materna, </em>ignore his near relatives, on his father’s side, and go <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>back to the testators maternal great-great-grandfather to establish collateral relationship in the appellants, <em>ex parte materna. </em>The testator expressly ignores blood-relationship as to three of these appellants, by describing them, in pecuniary-bequests, as “ my friend,” thus illustrating the remark of Chancellor Kent (4 Com. 411), “ the stream of-the natural affections, so remote from the object, must flow cool and languid.” In the bequests to his paternal uncles, the testator mentions the relationship.</p>

In order to reach the result contended for by the appellants,' it is necessary to interpolate the words “ as though I had not converted my estate into personalty,” which would destroy the testator’s primary intent, to wit, conversion into personalty, and distribution as such, according to the intestate law.</p>

The first is the event of his dying without leaving a child or children or the descendant of a child or children living at the time of his death. After giving a number of pecuniary legacies to relatives, friends and public institutions, the testator bequeaths a legacy of two hundred thousand dollars to his wife, and the rest, residue and remainder of hi's estate to his executors in trust: 1st. To invest the same and keep the same invested ; 2d. To collect the income, issues and profits thereof ; 3d. To pay all taxes, expenses and repairs; 4th. To pay the remaining income to his wife, Ellen M. Lardner, for life; and, 5th.

I will not stop to discuss the proposition that the direction to invest the residue and keep the same invested indicated an intention on the part of the testator to convert his real estate. It is sufficient to say in passing that the direction to invest was applicable to the personal estate, just as the word “ repairs ” applies to and was evidently intended for his real estate.

The omission of the word “ rents ” in the gift to the life tenant has no especial significance, for the reason that <em>“ </em>income, issues and <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>profits ” include the rents of the real estate. The word “ issues” is an apt term to indicate the rents and profits derived from realty.</p>
    <p id="A2aR" data-blocks='[["BL_274.5",274,[284,532,1165,980]]]'>N or are we able to see the applicability of the cases referred to. In Dundas’s Appeal there was a conversion in fact. No question of the effect of an unexecuted power was before the court. On the contrary, the power had been fully executed, and the main contention was whether the executors should be surchai’ged for the actual value of a house alleged to have been sold at an under-price. The most that can be predicated of that case is that a trust for sale, with a power of sale, and an execution of the power, works a conversion. Anything beyond this is dictum. We are wholly unable to extract anything from Page’s estate which favors a conversion of Perot Lardner’s real estate. If authority at all upon this question its weight would seem to be on the other side. In the recent case of Roland <em>v. </em>Miller, there was a discretionary power given, which, after a time, became imperative, and it was held that it must be regarded as a trust, for unless it'was executed no legatee could be paid. The legatees were given the proceeds only, not the estate or property itself. The execution- of the power was therefore compulsory in order that the object of the testator might not be defeated, and it was held there was a conversion. This distinction has been frequently recognized: Chew <em>v. </em>Chew, 4 Casey 17; Evans <em>v. </em>Chew, 21 P. F. S. 47; and see 2 Sudgen on Powers.</p>
    <p id="b274-6" data-blocks='[["BL_274.6",274,[289,1512,1161,630]]]'>The blending of real and personal estate by a testator in his will is not of much significance unless it clearly appears that he intended thereby to create a fund raised out of both real and personal estate, and to bequeath said fund as money. Where such a purpose is expressed and a power of sale given to carry it into effect, there is some room for holding that a conversion was intended. Nothing of the kind exists in this case. As before stated, the testator owned both real and personal estate at the time of his death. The manifest intent of his will is that his personal estate shall be kept invested, the real estate shall be kept in repair; the income, issues and profits be paid to his widow during her life, and at her death the whole of the residue of his estate “ shall vest in and be divided among my next of kin or heirs at law the same as though I had died intestate and unmarried.”</p>

On the contrary, the intention is manifest and emphatically expressed that in the contingency which has happened his property, both real and personal, shall go as if he had died intestate. This gives to the <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>heirs <em>ex parta materna </em>the real estate and the rents thereof, which descended to Perot Lardner through his mother.</p>

In the court below the executor accounted for the rents of certain real 'estate belonging to the testator, of which he had taken possession and charge, which had descended under the intestate laws from the testator’s mother. The appellants are heirs <em>ex parte materna </em>and the auditing judge awarded them the rents. Upon exceptions by the appellees, who were the next of kin on the side of the father, this adjudication was reversed, and the rents awarded to them. This was a logical result of the ruling of the court below upon the question of a conversion. Under our view of the law, it is manifest the rents must follow the real estate out of which it issued.</p>

It having been settled by the preceding appeals that the will of Perot Lardner did not work a conversion of his real estate, and that the proceeds of the real estate, which descended <em>ex parte materna </em>must be distributed to such of the heirs of said Perot Lardner as are of the blood of the first purchaser, the question now to be decided is whether Francis Perot and William S. Perot, who were the only children of Elliston Perot (a deceased great-great uncle of the testator) take exclusively, or in conjunction with the appellants who are the children of the deceased brothers and sisters of Francis and William S. Perot. The latter were living at the death of the testator, and claim in their own right; the appellants claim by representation through their deceased parents.</p>

This construction, would exclude the appellants as they are not children of a brother or sister of the testator.</p>

Under the Act of 1833, the children of brothers and sisters can take under the Act of 1855, the grandchildren of brothers and sisters, and the children of uncles and aunts, can take by representation. But here again, the brothers and sisters must be the brothers and sisters of the intestate. The appellants do not come within the description of the Act of 1855. They are neither the grandchildren of a brother or sister of Perot Lardner, nor children of his uncle or aunt. They are not grandchildren of a brother or sister of the common ancestor, Eliiston Perot, nor children of an uncle or aunt of the latter. We need not elaborate this point. We are of opinion that the appellants are not entitled to take either under the Act of 1833 or that of 1855, and their appeal must be dismissed.</p>
