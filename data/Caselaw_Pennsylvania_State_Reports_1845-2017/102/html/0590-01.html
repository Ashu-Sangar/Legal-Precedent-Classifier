Such an arrangement, under the circumstances of this case, though concealed from the judgment creditor of the insolvent owner of the fund, with the view of preventing its being attached, is not a fraud on said creditor.</p>

J., the following facts appeared: On December 12th. 1880, Lieberman obtained judgment against Hoffman on a bond, accompanying a mortgage, for $5,012, being the judgment upon which this attachment issued.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b609-7" data-blocks='[["BL_609.7",609,[130,736,1162,257]]]'>On April 12th 1878, George W. Hoffman being entitled to a distributive share in his father’s estate, of which Walter P. Huber was administrator c. t. a., assigned his interest therein to his wife for her life and on her death to his children. It was alleged by the plaintiff, and not denied, that Hoffman was insolvent at the date of the assignment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b609-8" data-blocks='[["BL_609.8",609,[131,992,1165,985]]]'>On May 24th 1880, while the property constituting Hoffman’s interest in his father’s estate was in Huber’s hands as administrator, Lieberman began proceedings by attachment under the Act of 1869, attaching said interest in Huber’s hands. Pending that proceeding Lieberman recovered the said judgment on the bond, December 12th 1880. Pending that proceeding, also, on August 15th 1881, with the view of preventing Hoffman’s interest from being attached, a secret arrangement was made between Huber, his counsel, Morris L. Kauffman, Esq, and George W. Hoffman and wife and their counsel, Edward Harvey, Esq., whereby Huber as administrator paid to Harvey the sum of $1,904, being the distributive share due Hoffman or his wife and children under said assignment; and Harvey deposited the same with Kauffman, who agreed in writing to hold the same until the final determination of the said attachment suit under the Act of 1869, and if determined in favor of Lieberman to pay the same to Huber or to such person as would be then legally entitled to receive it; but if the said action was determined against Lieberman, then to pay the same (less $500 to Mr. Harvey as his fees), to Mrs. Hoffman, as assignee of George W. Hoffman. On the trial of this attachment execution the plaintiff’s attorney stated that “ he makes no claim against Mr. Huber.”</p>

Kauffman paid Harvey $500, and the balance of $1,400 to Hoffman and wife, in March and May respectively 1882, the latter payment being after the final decision of the Supreme Court in said case.</p>

The fund, though deposited with Kauffman, remained in the control and virtually in the possession of the garnishees at the date the attachment was served. The court should have submitted the question of fraud to the jury: Forsyth v. Matthews, <a href="/pa/14/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="405915" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0100-01">14 Pa. St. 100</a>; instead of which the court treated the transaction as a lawful one, and submitted to the jury only the immaterial question whether the insolvent debtor gave his consent to the arrangement, and instructed them that if he did, the arrangement was a valid payment by Huber and Harvey to deprive the plaintiff of his rights under the attachment. This, we contend, was error.</p>

It is in no wise affected by the proceedings instituted under the Act relating to fraudulent debtors. On the trial all claim against Huber was abandoned. The case is therefore pressed against Harvey only. The evidence shows that the money had been temporarily in his hands as attorney for his client, but the jury have found that it had passed out of his hands before the service of this writ of attachment. We discover no evidence of any fraud in the conduct of the garnishee nor any error in the record.</p>
