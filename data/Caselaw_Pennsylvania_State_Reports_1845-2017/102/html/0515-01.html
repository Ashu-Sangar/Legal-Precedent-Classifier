By a supplement to the above Act, passed April 15th 1867, it was provided that the said water works should not be built until the question of erecting the works had been submitted to a popular vote. In 1881 a vote was taken resulting in a majority for the works, and three commissioners were elected, who proceeded to erect the works. The Lehigh Water Company, a corporation created by Act of March 20th 1860, authorized to supply the borough of Easton with water, and which hud in part done so, having June 21st 1880, accepted the provisions of the Act of April 29th 1874, which provides for the incorporation of water companies, § 34, clause 3, which reads: “ the right to have and enjoy the franchises and privileges of such incorporation within the district or locality covered by its charter shall bo an exclusive ODe,” filed a bill in equity for an injunction to restrain the borough of Easton from erecting the said water works:</p>

As to the effect of the first section of article XYI. of the present Constitution, which declares that “ all existing charters or grants of special or exclusive privileges, under which a bona fide organization shall not have taken place, and business been commenced in good faith at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall thereafter have no validity.” This article is designated “ Private Corporations.” It is' manifest from the language of the 1st section that it was not intended to apply to municipal corporations. The charters, etc., referred to in the section, contemplate an organization by individuals under the existing charters or grants of special or exclusive privileges, and business commenced under said organization. This language is not appropriate to a mere enlargement of powers and privileges conferred upon a municipal corporation already in existence and performing its quasi governmental functions. A power subsequently conferred, or a duty imposed upon a municipal corporation to erect water works, requires no special organization to carry it into effect; nor can it be said, that when such water-works are completed and in operation, that the municipal corporation <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>is doing business. A municipal corporation, like a borough, as distinguished from a private corporation, is a body politic and corporate, established by law, to share with civil government of the country, but chiefly to regulate and administer the local or internal affairs of the city, town or district which is incorporated. The word “ charter,” in the above section of tho Constitution, is synonymous, with the words <em>“ </em>grants of exclusive or special privileges,” immediately following it; and the purpose of the constitutional provision under certain conditions, is to make invalid and destroy the entire corporate power and franchise and not to make invalid and destroy a mere enlargement of privileges granted by subsequent legislation to a corporation already organized.</p>

We think not. That the plaintiffs have certain rights that are exclusive for a limited period, there is no doubt. But how and as to what parties? Clearly not against a corporation of like character authorized by law to supply water to the inhabitants of the borough of Easton, and in existence and operation at the time of the incorporation of the plaintiffs under the Act of 1874. The statute prohibits the incorporation of any other company for the same <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>purpose until the corporation shall have, from its earnings, realized and divided among its stockholders, during five years, a dividend equal to 8 per centum upon its capital stock. The words of the statute that the right shall bean “ exclusive one,” standing alone, probably would confer such a right even as against an existing-corporation of like character, not organized and with no -water works in operation, and also against a municipal corporation where the latter has not availed itself of the right aud privilege to erect and operate such works. But the words immediately following the words “ exclusive one,” and part of the same sentence, manifestly show that the words “ exclusive one,” have reference to the prohibition in the future under certain limitations, of the incorporation of another company for a like purpose. It also appears that it was not the intention of the Legislature to interfere with the municipal rights, for the 7th clause of the same section provides “ that nothing in this section contained shall authorize a company incorporated under the provisions of this Act to construct gas or water works within the limits of any municipality, where gas or water works shall have been constructed by said municipality, without the lawful consent of said corporate authorities thereof.” Thus while the statute protects the rights of municipalities against their invasion by incorporate companies, where waterworks have already been constructed by the former, it nowhere, cither by express words or clear implication, excludes the right of municipalities having the legal authority, as in this case, to erect water works, from exercising the same. It is not pretended that the Acts of 1867 are expressly repealed-. The Acts that are expressly repealed are those of April-7th 1849; April 24th 1854; July 18th 1834, and March 21th 1873. Moreover the rule of construction is that “ all Acts of incorporation and Acts extending the privileges of incorporated bodies, are to be taken most strongly against the companies. Whatever is not expressly and unequivocally granted in such acts is taken to be withheld Packer <em>v. </em>Bun bury and Erie Railroad Company, 7 Harris 218. In this case Black, C. J., says that <em>“ </em>the same rule was laid down by Chief Justice Marshall in Billings <em>v. </em>The Providence Bank, <a href="/us/29/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Pet. 514" data-case-ids="3309032" data-case-paths="/us/29/0514-01">4 Pet. 514</a>, and in the Charles River Bridge <em>v. </em>The Warren Bridge, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Pet.%20524" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 Pet. 524">11 Pet. 524</a>, it was placed on grounds so impregnable by the present Chief Justice of the United States that it is not probable that we will ever hear it seriously questioned again.”</p>

The Legislature, by a supplement to their Act of incorporation, passed March 20th 1860, empowered said corporation to mortgage all their estate and their chartered and corporate franchises, lights and privileges to those persons, who, as endorsers, sureties or guarantors had paid, or were liable to pay, the indebtedness of said company, and that at any judicial sale which might be had under said mortgage, all the estate, franchises, rights and privileges of said company passed to and vested in the. purchasers, who were then authorized to organize a corporation under the name and style of the Lehigh Water Company.

During the term the corporation was to pay £200 annually to Harvard College. Forty-two years after the bridge was opened to passengers, the state incorporated a company for the purpose of erecting another bridge over the same river, a short distance only from the first, and which accommodated- the same passengers. The necessary effect would be to decrease greatly the first franchise, if not to render it altogether worthless. But the first charter was not exclusive in its terms ; no contract was violated in granting the second ; the resulting injury was incidental to the exercise of an undoubted right by the state, and as all the vested rights of the first corporation still remained, though reduced in value by the new grant, the case was one of damage without legal injury.”</p>

The case of Dartmouth College <em>v. </em>Woodward, <em><a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wheat.%20636" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Wheat. 636">4 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wheat.%20636" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Wheat. 636">Wheat. 636</a>, and subsequent cases which sanction and affirm the law of that case, are principally relied upon by -the plaintiffs, that the Acts of 1867 are unconstitutional. As I undei'stand the law and facts of that case, it has little, if.any, application to the question now under consideration. The Supreme Court of the United States there held, “that the charter incorporated twelve persons therein mentioned as trustees, and granted to them and their successors the usual corporate privileges and powers, and declared that the trustees should forever thereafter consist of twelve, and no more, and should govern the college, and fill up all vacancies which might be created in the body, is a contract, within the meaning of the clause in the Constitution of the United States, which declares that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts ; and that the subsequent statutes of New Hampshire which increased the number of trustees to twenty-one, and gave, the appointment of the additional members to the Executive of the state, and created a board of overseers with power to inspect and control important, acts of the trustees, being passed without the previous or subsequent assent of the trustees, were unconstitutional and void.” A mere statement of the case shows a radical alteration of the charter in many and material respects, by which the powers and privileges of the corporation and trustees were practically taken away, the number of trustees increased, and the appointing power vested in tire Executive of the state, and the control of the corporate property and franchises conferred upon a board of overseers created for that purpose. Here then was a direct invasion of the rights of property of an incorporation, and substantially a destruction of its corporate privileges and powers. Whatever doubts may since have been entertained by courts as to the soundness of the law in that case, it need not be questioned here so far as it affects the question of the unconstitu<a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>tionality of the law now under consideration.

It is well settled that nothing in the new Constitution has the effect of a repealing Act unless it is clearly so intended. There is nothing in the Act of 1874 which expressly repeals the Act of 1887. The Act of 1874 does, indeed, repeal certain Acts, naming them, and not this.

The Legislature chartered the complainant’s predecessor to supply pure water, and afterwards authorized the borough to build “ works using the water of the Delaware,” and there can be no ground to construe this as the impairment of any contract. It is not a question as to whether the two will compete. The power to establish public water-works is a branch of police power which cannot be contracted away. The police power extends to ¿11 matters affecting the public health: Stone <em>v. </em>Mississippi, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20U.S.%20818" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="11 U.S. 818">11 Otto 818</a>. The right to provide water cannot be exclusively committed to any corporation as against the borough or city. The authorities cited on the other side are inapplicable ; all are cases of direct legislation upon the corporation itself, and most of them are tax cases.</p>

L. 412. A supplement to this Act was passed on April 15th 1867, providing that the water-works should not be built by the borough until after the question of the erection of said works has been submitted to a popular vote at a spring election, when, if a majority of the qualified voters were in favor of such erection, the town council should proceed to construct said works. A vote was taken at the spring election-in 18S1, resulting in a majority in favor of the works. Three persons were elected water commissioners <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>at the same time, who purchased a lot upon which to erect said works, and presented a petition to the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton county for the purpose of .compelling the town council of the borough of Easton to supply the necessary funds.</p>
    <p id="b545-6" data-blocks='[["BL_545.6",545,[129,568,1168,600]]]'>The Lehigh Water Company (plaintiff) is a corporation duly authorized by its charter to supply the borough of Easton with water, and has expended a large amount of money in the construction of its works. It is required by its charter to erect a sufficient number of fire-plugs, and supply water to the borough for the extinguishment of fires without charge. This obligation has been performed, at least in part, and it has furnished the citizens of the borough with water. • On the 21st of June 1880, the said company accepted the provisions of the Act of 29th of April 1874, P. L. 93, section 34 of which provides for the incorporation of water companies, and enacts that “the right to have and enjoy the franchises and privileges of such incorporation within the district or locality covered by its charter shall be an exclusive one,” &amp;c. *</p>
    <p id="b545-7" data-blocks='[["BL_545.7",545,[128,1169,1166,300]]]'>The grounds upon which the water company seeks to restrain the borough are : 1. That under the Act of 1874 the right of the water company is exclusive ; 2. That the borough has no power under the Act of 1867 to construct waterworks; and, 3. That to do so would contravene article I. section 10, of the Constitution of the United States, which declares that “ no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.”</p>
    <p id="b545-8" data-blocks='[["BL_545.8",545,[127,1468,1169,813]]]'>Neither of these positions can be sustained. While the language from the Act of 1874 above quoted would seem to favor the' exclusive right claimed by the water company, a careful examination of clause 3 of section 34 shows that the legislature intended that the right should be exclusive only as against other water companies, for immediately in this connection occur the words : “ And no other company shall be incorporated for that purpose until the said corporation shall have from its earnings realized and divided among its stockholders, during five years, a dividend equal to eight per centum per annum upon its capital stock.” The provision that another company shall not be incorporated was not intended to prohibit a city or borough from providing its citizens with pure water by means of works constructed by itself from money in its own treasury. Aside from this, the water company claims this exclusive right by reason of the Act of 1874, while the right of the borough to' construct the works was conferred by the prior Act of 1867, and there is no pretence that the one Act repeals the other.</p>

It was intended to extinguish a vast number of charters obtained for speculative purposes, under which “ a bona fide organization ” had not taken place nor “ business been commenced in good faith,” but which were being hawked about to the manifest shame of the commonwealth. No one ever supposed that this article was intended to repeal an Act of Assembly conferring additional powers upon a municipal corporation, for the mere reason that the power had not been exercised in whole or in part.</p>

Those cases decide that when a municipal corporation undertakes to supply its citizens with gas and water it must be held to its contracts precisely as a private corporation. Rut that it is nevertheless a municipal corporation plainly appears from Wheeler <em>v. </em>The City, where it was attempted to restrain the city from borrowing money for the use of the gas works, upon the ground that such borrowing was prohibited by article IX. section 7, of the Constitution, which declares that the “ General Assembly shall not authorize any county, city, borough, township, or incorporated district, to become a stockholder in any company, association or corporation, or to obtain or appropriate money for,- or loan its credit to any corporation, association, institution or individual.” The gas cases, established the principle that a municipal corporation may perform the functions of a private corporation in supplying its citizens with gas and water.
