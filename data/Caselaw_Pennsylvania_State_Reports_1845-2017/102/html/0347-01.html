At any rate the defendant claiming under the sheriff’s vendee took a good conveyance, for he had no notice of the unrecorded conveyance: Keller <em>v. </em>Nutz, 5 S. &amp; R. 251. The words of limitation are such as to vest a fee or an estate tail in Nathaniel Allen. The language used is not such as imports a Particular estate for life, sufficient to vest a remainder in fee. io remainder is referred to. It is a present disposition of an estate for life to trustees named therein for the special use of the cestuis que trustent. By the habendum a fee is clearly created, for the words used are “ to have and to hold to N. Allen and wife in trust for their, heirs.” A particular intent must yield to a general, if both cannot exist together : Doebler’s Appeal, 14 Sm. 9. The deed expressly defines the gran. <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>tor’s intention to be that, the children shall take only in the character of heirs, and from this, in connection with the whole deed, and particularly. the habendum, the estate. can only be construed as a fee in Allen, and is within the rule in Shelley’s case. The words <em>“ </em>in trust ” are the governing words in this deed, and construction must be made' bn the entire deed : Ludwig <em>v. </em>Leonard, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2048" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 48">9 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 48</a>.

Allen died in 1857, whereupon the right by possession vested in his wife, who held it until 1864, when she died, when the plaintiffs succeeded to a complete estate in fee of the land. As they could not maintain an action of ejectment until after the death of Hannah Allen, in 1864, the Statute of Limitations did not run against them prior to this date : Zacharias <em>v. </em>Zacharias, 11 Harris 452.</p>

Beyond'that part,'therefore, of the , learned judge’s opinion which we have in the seventh assignment of error, we need not go, for if it be true that, under that <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>deed Allen and wife took an estate, in the land in controversy, for their lives and the life of the survivor of them, with a vested remainder in fee to their children, then, since under the sheriff’s deed, of March 22nd 1838, to Schuyler, the defendant held Allen’s right, it must necessarily follow, that the plaintiffs, the remainder men, have no right of entry or action until his death, the Statute of Limitations could not begin to run, as to them, until that time: Ege <em>v. </em>Medlar, 1 Nor. 86.</p>
    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[319,744,1171,1323]]]'>If, however, the learned judge was mistaken in this view of the case ; if by that deed Allen and wife took a fee in themselves, or if, under it, they held but in trust for their children, and did not thereby take a life estate to their own use, then, and in that event, it is certain, that, as against the defendant, the plaintiffs had no title, for they were effectually barred by the statute. We cannot, however, adopt the suggestion of the counsel for the plaintiff in error that a fee was vested in Allen and wife'by virtue of the Mary Doctor deed. Possibly such might be the result if we consulted only the habendum of that instrument, for the word “ heirs” as therein used, is ordinarily a word of limitation, and is definitive, not of the persons who are to take, but of the estate granted, and we agree that this word is to be accepted in its technical sense, unless the- context requires a different construction : Huss <em>v. </em>Stephens, 1 P. F. S. 282. Here, however the context evidently requires that the word “ heirs ” be taken to mean “children,” for the premises very clearly indicate that the estate, whatever it was, was intended to be vested, not in the grantees, who took but a trust, but- in “their children, their lawful heirs, namely; William Allen, now begotten, and to their children and heirs to be begotten, being the issue of her, the said Hannah Doctor, by her husband Nathaniel Allen.” Here we see the words “ children ” and “ heirs ” used indiscriminately, and that their “ children” or “heirs ” must take as purchasers, there can be no doubt, since one of them is mentioned by name. It follows, therefore, that in order to harmonize these two parts of the deed, we must, for the word “heirs” in the habendum, substitute “children.” In other words, we must treat this word “ heirs ” as a designation of persons rather than of estate.</p>
    <p id="b370-5" data-blocks='[["BL_370.6",370,[319,2065,1159,343]]]'>Moreover, as the whole of the preceding context precludes the idea of an estate of any kind other than a trust, in Nathaniel and Hannah Allen, we cannot allow the habendum to defeat the clear and obvious intent of the grantor. The purpose of the habendum is to define the extent of the interest granted, if that interest has not been already defined, and whilst it may be used to explain or qualify the grant, as set forth in the premises, it cannot be used to defeat it: Tyler <em>v. </em>Moore, 6 Wr. 374.</p>

    <p id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.6",371,[179,614,1174,643]]]'>But the most careful examination of the deed fails to discover a life estate in Allen and wife to their own use. It may, indeed, be regarded as a matter of doubt whether this deed vests a fee in any one, and certainly not in the trustees, for they have only a life estate in trust, and that, as we have already said, not for their own use, but for the use of their children. It is not open to question, that for these children, they were to hold something in trust, but as the deed gave them nothing but a life estate, what else had they to hold as trustees <em>% </em>And if in this there was no use for the children, where shall we look for such use <em>% </em>This deed certainly puts into the parents nothing but a trust, to run for the period of their lives, for the benefit. of their issue, and as there were no active duties to be performed by the trustees, we may regard the trust as executed, from its inception, in the equitable owners.</p>
