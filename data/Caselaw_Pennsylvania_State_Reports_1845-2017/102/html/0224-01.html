L. 82, and of May 17th 1871, § 1, P. L. 269. It is contended that neither of these acts authorize a court to compel the delivery of assets from an executor to a life tenant, except upon the request of the latter. The Act of 1834 was for the protection of the executor, providing that he should not be compelled to deliver to a life tenant unless security was entered, and the-Act of 1871 simply enables a devisee for life to compel a delivery, upon entering security. In the present case the devisee for life preferred to have the securities remain with the executrix who was not bound to give security : Keene’s Estate, 31 P. F. S. 133; Lindsay’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%2036" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 36">10 W. N. C. 36</a>. The only authority for <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>removing an executor is found under the Acts of March 23th 1832, § 22 P. L. 195, and May 1st 1861, § 1 P. L. 680, and removal must.be for some of the causes therein mentioned, none of which have been shown to exist in case of the appellant. But even if such did exist a citation is required to be issued, and a hearing had, before removal. The offénce of the appellant is simply that she has declined to compel the delivery of the possession of the assets from herself as executrix to herself as life tenant. The only case in which the court have power to appoint a trustee is under the Act of 1816, where the authority is given to supply a vacancy in the office of testamentary trustee: Surely it cannot be held to apply here, where the only persons who were more than simple executors were, those whose powers commenced with the death of Mrs. Yan Dusen.</p>

Act 24th February, 1834, section 49, P. L. 83; Act 17th May 1871, section 1, P. L. 269. It is absurd to say that because the legatee for life, who is one and the same person as the executrix, has not demanded possession of the estate as legatee for life she can not be compelled to enter security. The object of both these Acts was to protect the interests of those entitled in remainder, and under either of them, as before their passage, by filing a bill in chancery, the legatees in remainder could compel security to be entered by the life legatee: King <em>v. </em>Diehl, 9 S. &amp; R. 409; Duval’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20Pa.%20120" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="38 Pa. 120">38 Pa.

When the Orphans’ Court removed appellant she had twice refused to comply with the order of the court, and she had invested money of the estate in her own name. This was sufficient cause for her removal. The order vacating the letters testamentary was surplusage, as all her functions under the will of testator had ceased. 'The vital part of the decree was the order commanding the transfer of the estate to the <em>“ </em>Northern Savings Fund, Safe Deposit and Trust Company,” and it is submitted that no reason has been shown why it should be set aside.'</p>

It thereupon ordered her to convert the railroad stock into a legal investment, and to assign the mortgages to herself as executrix. The court' further awarded the whole principal of the estate amounting to $12,957.33 of which the stock and mortgages formed a part, to the appellant for life. That decree was not appealed from, and remains in full force. The appellant has in an irregular and unsatisfactory manner attempted to execute the order in regard to the mortgages ; but has wholly failed and neglected to convert the railroad stock as directed. Under an assumed right to interpose her private judgment against the order of the court, she has omitted to convert the stock into a legal investment, and to transfer the principal of the estate to herself as life tenant in pursuance of the decree. Thus she not only disregarded the order to invest, but by continuing to hold the property as executrix she sought to deprive the residuary owners of the estate, of that security to which they are entitled.</p>

While the manner of removal in the present case is objectionable, and should not be followed, yet in view of the command of the statute, and of the manifest justice and equity of the case, we do not feel that the decree should be reversed. Her active duties as executrix in the settlement of the estate, had terminated. The sum justly in her hands had been ascertained, and fixed by final decree. Nothing remained for her to do, but to execute the orders‘made for the transfer of the property. Her removal as executrix- took from her no valuable right.
