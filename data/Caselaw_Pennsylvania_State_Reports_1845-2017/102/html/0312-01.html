An examination of the record shows that the suit below was commenced in the name of the Commonwealth and for this reason the chief burgess might, perhaps, have been justified in declining to send up the record. But he has sent it, and it requires but an amendment of the writ, to make it conform to the burgess:s record. This, we think, may be done, as it is the merest technicality: Specht <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 12 Harris 103, was an entirely different case. There the certiorari was against the Commonwealth as in a criminal proceeding, while the record sent up was an action of debt in the name of Henry Krib, who sued as well for the Commonwealth as for himself <em>v. </em>Valentine Specht. This court held that ki a certiorari against the Commonwealth does not give us jurisdiction to reverse a judgment of Henry Krib against Valentine Specht.” That was a criminal proceeding below, although improperly brought 'as a qui tam action, while in the present case the action was for a. penalty for a violation of a borough ordinance.
