N. C. 532</a>), it was not in proof that Mrs. Cowperthwaite alleged any other title, than such as she claimed to arise from the paroi contract, which she claimed to have made'with the officers, of the Carboudale Lank, to purchase the property for her at the sheriff’s sale. She was, of course, the wife of the defendant in the execution, and had a prospective dower interest, contingent upon her surviving him. She did not then offer to show that she had paid any part of the purchase money on the original purchase of the land by her husband, or that she had any present subsisting interest in the land whatever. She was, therefore, so far as the case then appeared, a stranger to'the title. Green, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says: — ‘ ‘ The case is therefore the ordinary one of a parol agreement by one, tc&gt; purchase land for another át a sheriff’s sale, followed by a breach of the contract <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>to convey on the part of the purchaser, in which case, it has been uniformly held that no resulting trust arises, unless the promisee had furnished the purchase money in whole or in part, or had, at the time of the contract an actual estate or interest in the land, or a bona fide claim thereto.” The judgment of the court below, in favor of Mrs. Cowperthwaite, on that trial was therefore reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>

We are of opinion that the refusal of this offer was error.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.7",420,[270,1647,1165,597]]]'>If the. facts alleged were sufficiently proved, she would have, or appear to have, a bona fide claim, to an interest in the land ; such an interest as she might at a proper time be able to enforce in equity against her husband or those representing him. The-case comes, therefore, within the ruling of Wálford <em>v. </em>Herring-ton, 5 Norris 36, where it was held, Sharswood, J., <em>“ </em>where one, not the defendant, having any interest in lands, is induced to confide in the verbal promise of another that he will purchase for the benefit of the former at a sheriff’s sale, and, in pursuance of this, allows him to become the holder of the legal title, a subsequent denial by the latter is such a fraud as will convert the purchaser into a trustee ex maleficio.” The claim of title may not be a valid one, but if it is made bona fide, the claimant has a right to protection against the fraud of the purchaser.</p>

Cowperthwaite. She, also, submitted a similar affidavit, in which she states that she firmly believes she is entitled to the premises in dispute, against the First National Bank of Carbondale, that she does “ not claim the same by, from or under the defendant (her husband) as whose property the same were sold, but by another and a different title,” and that she does “ not claim the same by title derived from the defendant, subsequent to the rendition of the judgment.” The offer above referred to is in no way inconsistent with the claim here set forth, the precise nature of which is however not disclosed in the affidavit. She very distinctly declares, however, that she does not claim title by, from or under her husband, but by another and a different title. Her claim as set forth in the offer is not by, from or under her husband ; but by and from the payment by her of the purchase money. Her title, if she has any, is not subordinate to, or derived from his, but is co-ordinate with and independent of that title. Her title, as alleged, was not created by decent or purchase from him but by act and operation of law, resulting'froin the payment of the purchase money, at the original purchase. She does not claim therefore by, from or under him, or his title, but under her own, a different title not evidenced by his deed, but established by parol.</p>
