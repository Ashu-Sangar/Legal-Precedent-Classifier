J., the following facts appeared : On January 8th 1877, the several members of the firm of Siegfried, Ludwig &amp; Co. (the defendants) signed articles of dissolution, wherein it was provided, inter alia, “ that the said George Hagenbuch and Charles W. Ludwig shall and will take charge of the books .... and forthwith proceed to and with the collection and closing of the said accounts as speedily as possible ; and that the said George Hagenbuch and Charles W. Ludwig will in all things consult with the said parties to these presents and act upon and in accordance with their advice and under their instructions.” Thereupon a notice was published in the newspapers of Allentown by and with the knowledge and consent of all the partners, and signed “ Siegfried, <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>Ludwig &amp; Co.” that “ Charles Ludwig and George Hagenbuch arc duly appointed liquidating partners, to whom all debts must be paid and to whom all creditors of said firm will please hand their accounts.”</p>

Ludwig, acting as liquidating partner, borrowed the sum of $1,050 from the plaintiff, his son, then twenty years of age, to make up the amount necessary to pay said [judgment, and gave him the note in suit therefer. The money so borrowed was applied by Charles W. Ludwig, in payment of the firm’s debt.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b566-7" data-blocks='[["BL_566.7",566,[301,1085,1166,300]]]'>The court submitted the evidence to the jury to find whether the plaintiff had moneys of his own out of which he lent his father the amount of the note, for the purpose mentioned, and whether Charles W. Ludwig borrowed the same as liquidating partner for the payment of the firm’s debt. On the latter.point the court, after referring to the provisions of the agreement of dissolution, said in the charge:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b566-8" data-blocks='[["BL_566.8",566,[300,1382,1167,938]]]'>“ But there is no power in that paper to do the act which Charles Ludwig did here. [Outside of that writing, and without any express direction, if the facts satisfy you that the other partners were willing that Charles Ludwig should act as liquidating partner, he is to be taken as such, and his acts bind the firm. I say to yon that it does not require an express authority to constitute a member of a dissolved firm a liquidating partner.] One may be such by permission or tacit consent of the other parties. When one of several members of such dissolved firm acts as a liquidating partner, acts as the one whoso right and duty it is to settle the affairs of the late firm, and the other members know that he is so acting, and they raise no objection to his doing so, the jury may infer authority to so act...... If under the evidence you find that he was not the liquidating partner, your verdict will be in favor of the defendant. If you find that with the knowledge of his late copartners and their permission, he acted by way of settling up the affairs of the dissolved firm, he is to be taken as a liquidating partner, and if as such he actually obtained this money from the plaintiff, and applied it towards the payment of the Bitting judgment, as he says he did, because that was a debt of the firin', the plaintiff is entitled to recovery.’’</p>

    <p id="b567-8" data-blocks='[["BL_567.11",567,[139,1070,1166,553]]]'>There was sufficient evidence to justify the finding that Charles W. Ludwig was a liquidating partner. The published notice signed by the firm declared that he and Hagenbuch were appointed liquidating partners. The latter ceased to act as such, and Ludwig was suffered to act alone. It matters not that by a private agreement between the parties all of them were to be consulted in regard to the business, and the action to be in accordance with their advice. Express authority need not be proved. It may be found from the continued exercise of such powers with the knowledge and implied assent of the co-partners. The evidence shows the money was borrowed by Ludwig in good faith, and actually applied in payment of the indebtedness of the firm. We discover no cause for reversal.</p>
