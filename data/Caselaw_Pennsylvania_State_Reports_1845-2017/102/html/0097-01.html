At the time of opening the street and before, the names of the owners of the property were duly registered.

    <p id="b119-6" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[145,637,1163,644]]]'>One of the objects of the statutes is to prevent the filing of a lien and the accumulation of costs thereon, until thirty days after actual notice to the owner. The assessment of damages may be confirmed upon such notice to the property owners as the court may direct: but the statute .prescribes what notice the owner shall have before the filing of a lien against his property. Notice to the owner being a prexquisite, the claim should be filed against the property in the name of the person upon whom the notice was served. The law requires the return and registry of the owners of every lot of ground upon the plans of the city, and if so registered the lot shall not be sold for taxes or other municipal claims, except in the name of the owner as returned. “Although the proceeding is in rem, it is contemplated that the owner’s name shall appear in the claim and proceedings thereon.</p>

The claim for an assessment for benefits resulting from the opening of a street differs in some respects from other municipal claims, yet much of what Avas said by Sterrett, J., in Simons <em>v. </em>Kern, <a href="/pa/92/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="92 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="490979" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0455-01">92 Pa.
