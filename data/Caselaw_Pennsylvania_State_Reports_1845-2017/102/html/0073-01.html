    <p class="headnotes" id="b91-10" data-blocks='[["BL_91.10",91,[157,1448,1168,566]]]'>Two physicians, one of them having an established and lucrative city practice, the other a stranger, entered into a copartnership agreement for the joint practice of medicine for the term of five years, the latter paying to the former $1,000 in cash and a note for $500, for a moiety of said established practice. The articles contained the usual partnership stipulations, and further this proviso : “Provided, nevertheless, that the said L. S. Filbert [the established practitioner] shall be at liberty during the said term to carry on and attend to any business other than that of practicing medicine and surgery, and may at any time absent himself from attendance in said profession as he may and shall see fit and proper.” After two years Filbert engaged in other business and left the city permanently, without his partner’s consent. He subsequently brought suit on the note for $500, to which the defendant set up as a defense breach of the agreement and failure of consideration. The court charged, in effect, that under the terms of this proviso, he had a right todo as he did. Held, not to be error.</p>

      <em>“ </em>I observe in the agreement no ambiguity or any doubt about the intentions of the parties. ... It appears that Dr. Filbert desired to leave his medical practice. That was understood at the time. It was the motive on his part for making the arrangement, and it accounts for the proviso in the agreement which enabled Dr. Filbert to carry out his original design of going into some other business. [By the very terms of the agreement he was at liberty to go into any other business, and could give as little time to the practice of medicine as he pleased. . . . It is perfectly plain, that under this agreement, if Dr. Filbert chose to embark in any other business on his own account, he was altogether, at liberty to do so without incurring any responsibility to the defendant. It is no answer to the plaintiff’s demand for the defendant to say to the plaintiff that he gave up the practice of medicine. That is what he intended to do.] Something was said by Dr. McFerran to the effect that Dr. Filbert abandoned the practice of medicine. [He had a right to abandon the practice of medicine. It is one thing to abandon the partnership agreement, which he could not do, and quite another thing to abandon active practice, which he had thought to do. For doing that, he could not be held responsible by the agreement. He was free by the terms of that agreement to embark in any business he chose.] ”</p>

S. Filbert. Now the proviso permitting Dr. Filbert to carry on other business, and to absent himself at any time from attendance in said profession as he may and shall see fit and proper, is capable of two constructions; one consistent with and the other repugnant to the main intent of the agreement. By the former, he was permitted to carry on other business at the same time he practiced medicine with his partner, and to absent himself from attendance temporarily as he might see fit. By the latter he could, two weeks or two years after taking Dr. McFerran’s money, desert him, a stranger in a strange city, thereby preventing him from securing the practice, the consideration for his money. In such case, that construction by which the whole agreement may be harmonized, should be adopted, but the court below adopted the other construction. If that be the right and only construction of which the proviso is capable, tlíen the proviso, being repugnant to the grant, is void. Associa-! tion is a necessary incident to the agreement, in order that the “ good will ” may continue, and the plaintiff by his breach of contract, having willfully failed to assure to the defendant that which he agreed to sell and the defendant purchased and paid for, the latter is entitled to set up failure of consideration as an equitable defence to the note in suit under the plea of nonassumpsit.

When the learned judge instructed the jury that under the agreement between the parties the plaintiff below “ was at liberty to go into any other business, and could give as little time to the practice of medicine as he pleased,” he but repeated what was substaniially set forth in said agreement. This is too plain for argument. But it was alleged there- was error in that portion of the charge wherein the court said : “ It is no answer to the plaintiff’s demand, for the defendant to say to the plaintiff that ho gave up the practice of medicine — that is what he intended to do.

The distinction between abandoning the partnership agreement, and engaging in active practice under it, was clearly stated by the learned judge below. The question of the abandonment of the partnership agreement was in effect left to the jury. The defendant, having submitted no point, nor asked for any instruction, cannot now convict the court below of error for omitting to charge more fully upon this branch of the case.
