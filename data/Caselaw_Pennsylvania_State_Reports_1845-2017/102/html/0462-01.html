The defeasance may be in writing, and if drawn in apt words is easily proven, but such defeasance may not have been reduced to writing, and then it is susceptible of parol proof, or it may be partly in writing and not wholly, and the part not written may be supplemented by parol evidence.</p>

It will be observed, however, that as in this case the equity is asserted by the defendants below, the burden of proof is upon them, that the proof must be clear explicit and unequivocal; that the evidence adduced in support of it, is principally the testimony of Emanuel Huoncker, one of the defendants, and, that the equity thus asserted is specifically denied by the plaintiff below, in his testimony at the trial. Upon what rule of equity practice, therefore, was it the duty of the chancellor to control the finding?
