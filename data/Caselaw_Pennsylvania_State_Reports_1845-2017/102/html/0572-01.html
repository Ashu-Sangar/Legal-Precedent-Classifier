    <p class="summary" id="b591-7" data-blocks='[["BL_591.7",591,[187,664,1161,206]]]'>The facts were as follows : The decedent Jesse Rodenbach, at the time of his death, held a judgment note, dated April 7th 1875, for $2,460, against Alexander Rodenbach, upon which were indorsed two payments, of $147.60 each. This judgment note was never entered of record as a lien.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b591-8" data-blocks='[["BL_591.8",591,[186,879,1162,505]]]'>Alexander Rodenbach, having taken out letters of administration upon the estate of Jesse Rodenbach, deceased, took pssession of said note, with other assets; he presented it to the appraisers, and it was entered in the inventory thus: “ Judgment and interest to date of inventory against Alexander Rodenbach, $2,768.04.” The administrator charged himself in his account, filed September 5th 1881, with the full amount of the inventory, to wit: $5,460.68, which sum included the principal and interest of his own note, as inventoried. His account showed that in the course of the administration he paid out all the assets of the estate, except a balance of $431.88, which he held for distribution.</p>

The mere fact that he became the administrator of the estate did not stop the running of interest. He was justly held chargeable therewith until the note was paid.
