If there is a deliberate and premeditated purpose to kill one, and, in the execution of'such purpose, another is killed, the requisites of a murder in thfe first degree exist.

He saw the woman of the house, a Mrs. Harrington, aud asked to see his wife. He was informed that his wife was out at work, but that Mrs. Bead was upstairs. He went up and had a conversation with her, of which Mrs. Harrington overheard one or two remarks by the prisoner, one being the question “ where is my child buried 2” It was in evidence that one of his two children had died a short time previously and had been-buried by his wife and Mrs. Bead without notifying him.

About seven o’clock he left the saloon where he had slept, after drinking two glasses of soda water, and went to another saloon and took a drink of whiskey.</p>

[She recovered.] Mrs. Read started to run down and across the street, crying “ murder,” and McGinnis chased her for 200 to 250 feet, when she turned and disappeared into a small covered alley-way, McGinnis following her. Immediately thereafter two pistol shots were heard, and McGinnis .was arrested as he came out of the alley.

Their power of review, on a special allocatur, was confined to matters occurring at the trial, formally excepted to, noted and filed of record : Act of November 6th 1856, re-enacted in Criminal <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>Code, 1860, sec. 60, Purd. Dig. 389; Fife <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 5 Casey 429. But we contend that this was changed by section 24 of art. Y. of the Constitution of 1874, which reads: “ In all cases of felonious homicide . . . the accused, after conviction and sentence, may remove the indictment, record, <em>and all proceedings, </em>to the Supreme Court for review.” The same language is used in the Act of May 19th 1874, P. L. 219, passed in pursuance of the constitutional provision. This language has not been construed heretofore by this court. We insist that in homicide cases where the question is only one of the degree of murder, no man shall be put to death, under a verdict of murder in the first degree, until, if the prisoner so elect, the Supreme Court has “ reviewed all the proceedings” — including the refusal of the court below to grant a new trial — in order to determine, as matter of fact as well as matter of law, whether all the evidence warrants a conviction of murder in the first degree. We therefore invite the attention of tins court to the reasons for a new trial presented to the court below, including the after-discovered evidence, taken in connection with the evidence adduced on the trial.</p>
    <p id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[279,1275,1166,598]]]'>The learned judge erred in that part of his charge, assigned for error, wherein, in connection with the circumstances of this case, he instructed the jury that there must be at the time of the assault “a willful, deliberate and premeditated intent to kill <em>some one </em>— the <em>person need nothe </em>designated.” He should have instructed them that whatever may have been the prisoner’s intent to kill his wife, whom he did not kill, it was necessraw, before convicting him of murder in the first degree, for killing Mrs. Read, to find a distinct and independent deliberate and premeditated intent to take her life. The judge was probably misled into a wrong application of the common law doctrine, that “where A., with intent to kill C., shoots at C. and kills B,” he is guilty of murder. This was not that case, but a separate and independent assault.</p>

On this point, this case is ruled by Jones <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 25 P. F. S. 403, 408, and Keenan <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 Wr. 57. The words of Agnew, J., in the former case, at. p. 410, fit this case : “ It seems to us a matter of great doubt whether his frame of mind was such that he was capable of deliberation and premeditation ; it appears to have been rather the sudden impulse of a disturbed mind, led away <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>from reason and judgment by dwelling upon the conduct of his wife, influenced by his continued state of excitement.”</p>

The murder was committed between eight and nine o’clock in the evening. Two witnesses, who saw him and heard him talk just previous to the commission of the crime,.saw no indication that he was intoxicated. Another, who saw him a few minutes thereafter, testified, he was sober. While the whole evidence thus clearly indicated the absence of intoxication when the act was committed, yet the court very fairly left the question of his condition to the jury. It charged substantially if the prisoner was intoxicated to such a degree that he could not deliberate or form a purpose, or could not hold such a purpose in his mind so as to premeditate upon it, he was not guilty of murder in the first degree. The prisoner has no just cause of complaint against this statement of the law.
