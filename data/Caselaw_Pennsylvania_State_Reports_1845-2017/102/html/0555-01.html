J., the facts as claimed by the plaintiff, were as follows: Solomon Boyer, the plaintiff, had possession of the factory, known as the Nitnson Forge <em>&amp; </em>Axle Company, situate in the city of Allentown, and carried on the business of manufacturing wagon axles, boxes, etc., during the year of 1876-7. Before Mr. Boyer surrendered possession he obtained judgment against the company for $42,600, upon which an execution was issued and the personal property of the company was sold and purchased by the Elaintiff. By an agreement between Boyer and the American life Insurance Co., who owned the real estate, Boyer occupied the premises for a definite period. Before he left the premises lie was requested by E. J. More, Esq., attorney of the American Life Insurance Co., to leave all the furniture, tools, etc., purchased by Boyer at sheriff’s sale, because the removal of the furniture and tools would injure the appearance of the office and the machine shop. The American Life Insurance Co. intended to sell the property. It was sold by the insurance company to Bullard. Mr. Bullaid and C. Van Brunt came into possession of the property. John Murray and Joseph Hill <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>•were employed as watchmen. James TI.' McKee and James W. Fuller purchased some of the property in question. The American Life Insurance Co. had sold the real estate to Bullard. Bullard entered into a recognizance with surety and the property was released. Mr. Boyer made demand for the property purchased by him at sheriff’s sale. This was refused. Tw'O of the defendants residing outside of the state, a foreign attachment was issued in case sur assumpsit.</p>

After the testimony was closed the defendants moved for a compulsory non suit. This was allowed ; and on motion, the court in banc refused to take it off, Albright, P. J., delivering the opinion, which was, inter alia, as follows :</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b574-9" data-blocks='[["BL_574.9",574,[275,1927,1166,129]]]'>Thereupon the plaintiff took this writ of error, assigning for error the action of the'court in granting a compulsory non-suit and in refusing to take it off.</p>

The plaintiff waived the tort and asks that the defendants pay the value of the goods. Where one takes the personal property of another, the owner may waive the tort and maintain assumpsit: McCullough <em>v. </em>McCullough, 2 Harris 295 ; why, therefore, cannot foreign attachment be maintained in <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>all cases of assumpsit ? By entering recognizance and dissolving the attachment the defendants waived all irregularities and thereby the nature of the proceedings were changed from a proceeding in rem into a mixed proceeding in rem et in personam. The judgment in foreign attachment when recovered has the same effect as if the suit had been commenced by a summons: Blyler <em>v. </em>Kline, <a href="/pa/64/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="64 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1021272" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0130-01">64 Pa.

That this construction is correct appears further from the fact that when the legislature wished to make foreign attachment available in certain cases arising ex delicto, they found it necessary to pass the Act of May 15th 1874, extending this form of procedure. An action like the present, foreign attachment against some and summons against others, can be employed under § 70 of the Act of June 13th 1836, only in “ cases where two or more persons shall be jointly but not severally liable.” In torts, the parties are jointly and severally liable. Nor can the plaintiff waive the tort and proceed in assumpsit; this mere election of remedies cannot enlarge the scope of foreign attachment; this was decided in Piscataqua Bank <em>v. </em>Turnley, supra.</p>

It is true that section does declare, inter alia, “where two or more persons shall be jointly but not severally liable to the suit of another if one or more of such persons shall be liable to attachment as aforesaid, and another or others of them shall not be liable to such process, it shall be lawful for the person to whom such liability is due, to sue out and prosecute thereon a writ of attachment and summons.”</p>

This section therefore must be applied only to cases arising on contract where there is a joint liability exclusively. Again the action is given to the person to whom the liability <em>“ </em>is due.” This is not the language usually employed to indicate an action sounding in damages for a tort. The object of the statute was to give the action when one of the joint debtors resided out of the state, and had property within it.</p>
