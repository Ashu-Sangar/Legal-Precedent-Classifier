The city of Scranton, at the time of issuing this bond, had no power to covenant to pay the state tax upon this bond.. The charter of 1866 exempted $20,000 of the city debt from taxation for state purposes; It did not authorize the city to pay the tax. The acts of 1870 and 1873 were to the same effect. By the act of March 19th 1873, these exemptions were expressly taken away from city loans, not previously negotiated into the hands of innocent holders. At the time of the issuing of this bond, this repealing law was in force, so that, if the previous legislation could be construed to empower a city to covenant to pay a tax, the repeal, being as broad in language as the words implying the power, must be held to have repealed the power. It matters not whether the individuals of the city committee or the councils supposed they had the power, or supposed they were making a true representation ; if we are right in construing this as a question of power, the true meaning of the law as it stands is the criterion of construction, and the evidence of a fact.</p>

If this corporation has the power to make this covenant, she has it by express language in her charter ; if it rests in doubt she has not the power. It is not a question of what ought to be done <em>ex aequo et </em>bono, but a question of what has been done by the express power of the state, and we look in vain for any authority to the city of Scranton to issue bonds and pay the taxes thereon. It is not a parallel case with a bond issued by the Commonwealth, or by the United States Government, for it is possible that the state <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>may so act with her creditors as to render it unjust for her (having the legislative power) to exercise that power subsequent to and against such action. The powers of the city are not self-derived or self-existent; they are derived from superior powers which must grant them or they are not in existence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[270,620,1175,1236]]]'>The Act of March 27th 1865, does not give this power to a municipal corporation ; that we deem is lacking in her charter, even if that act should be construed to include municipal corporations, it must mean corporations who, by their charter, have such power to contract. It is doubtful if that Act conferred any power on the private citizen, lie had the power to so contract naturally, and it required the usury law to take it from him, and by virtue of those laws it became unlawful to contract for any higher rate than statutory interest. The act of 1865 repealed so much of the usury laws, and restored a power which by law had been taken away, or at least rendered an exercise of it legal, but it did not confer any power on a municipal corporation. Municipal corporations have no power to contract for any unlimited rate of interest, unless conferred by their charter. It has been questioned whether a municipal corporation can agree to pay interest on its obligations without authority, though we are aware that by the course of trade and business and common custom, it is now held that they are now liable for interest on over-due obligations. In the case at bar, the power given to the city of Scranton was to pay seven per cent, interest and no more. It is true the law did exempt from state taxes, but that was no power conferred on the city; on the contrary, it was a restraining power on the state itself. No question of implied power can arise, for an implied power is one necessary for the execution of a granted power. We therefore conclude that the city is not liable for the tax levied by the state on their bonds, and may deduct the amount as required by the law of this state from the coupons at the time of payment.</p>

It was <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>neglect of duty imposed by the Act of 1864, for which the city could not maintain an action to recover back the sum neglected to be deducted. As against the present holders, it could not be asserted back of the time they became owners, for they did not receive the money. We think it can not' be asserted since, except in strict compliance with the Act of 1864. The city of Scranton was authorized to pay seven per cent, interest on this bond. She covenanted so to do. Her right to pay less must be in strict accordance with the law of the state which interferes with this payment. That law makes the treasurer of the city the medium for the collection of this tax, and liable for it. It makes it his duty to deduct the tax on the payment of any interest or dividend on the debt due by the city, and pay the same over within thirty days after the said interest or dividend has fallen due. The treasurer not having done this, there is no authority in the law by which he may deduct the taxes of former years; the judgment in this case should therefore be for the amount of coupons, seventy dollars, less nine dollars tax deducted since notice to plaintiff.</p>

No express statutory authority is required to enable any corporation to do what an individual can do without statutory authority, e. g., to contract to pay interest on borrowed money. The Act of 1865 simply enacts that it shall not be usurious to agree to pay taxes in addition to interest.

The learned judge of the court below, to whom this case was referred, held that this covenant-, so far as the state taxes were concerned, was void for the want of power in the city officials to make it. He says : “ The city of Scranton, at the time of issuing this bond, had no power to covenant to pay the state tax upon this bond. The charter of 1866 exempted $20,000 of the city debt from taxation for state purposes. It did not authorize the city to pay the tax. The Acts of 1870 and 1873 were to the same effect. By the Act of April 19th 1873, these exemptions were expressly taken away from city loans, not previously negotiated into the hands of innocent holders. At the time of the issuing of this bond, this repealing law was in force, so that, if the previous legislation could be construed to empower a city to covenant to pay a tax, the repeal, being as broad in language as the words implying the power, must be held to have repealed the power.

    <p id="b411-6" data-blocks='[["BL_411.6",411,[157,471,1177,1071]]]'>With the conclusion thus reached we cannot agree, since, in' our opinion, the Act of the 9th of April 1873, in no wise interfered with the power of the city councils ■ to contract as they did. So far as mere power was concerned, they had as much after as before the date of that act. Nowhere in this statute is found the expression of an intention to interfere with municipal powers. It but repeals previous Acts exempting loans, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness, from taxation for state purposes, but it certainly does not take avray from any municipality the right, if any such it had, to contract with its creditor for the payment of such tax. Could the clause cited be regarded as a mere reference to the preceding exemption Acts, there would be no doubt as to the rectitude of the judgment of the court below, for in that case, whether the holder of the bond had, or had not, taxes of any kind to pay would depend solely upon the legislative will. But that this part of the bond cannot be regarded in this light is manifest in this: at the time when the joint resolution of the city councils, of May 19th 1873, authorizing the issuing of this obligation, among others, was passed, those parts of the Acts exempting such obligations from state tax had been repealed. There was, therefore, at that time, nothing of the kind to which reference could have been had, so that if the clause referred to is to have any force whatever, it must be regarded and treated as it was in th&lt;? court below, as a covenant.</p>

The most ample power is here given to all coming within the category of borrowers, to contract for the payment of taxes. The learned judge thought this did not apply to municipalities, but for this opinion he gives no reason. That it does apply to corporations other than municipal cannot well be denied, for the words “any borrower” can certainly not be confined to natural persons; the words are entirely too extensive in their meaning to admit of such a construction. Besides this, a power is given to contract. which, as to private persons, is superogatory, since, as to them, it was only necessary to relieve such contract from the taint of usury, for which the latter part of the Act makes provision. But if the statute does apply to corporations, by what process of reasoning can we eliminate from its provisions municipal corporations? We. <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>confess that no such process presents itself to our mind. Beyond controversy, the city of Scranton, when it received the money on the bond of the plaintiffs, was a borrower, and being such, it does seem to us, that it must certainly come within the meaning of the words “ any borrower.”</p>
