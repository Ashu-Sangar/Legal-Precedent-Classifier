J., when the following facts appeared : — On the forenoon of August 12th 1881, the plaintiff Quigley and one Robert McClure were driving a horse and wagon belonging to the plaintiff William J. McClure, going from Bridgewater to Rockdale, on business. At the suggestion of Quigley, who was driving, they took the shortest road, which ran for some distance by the side of and some sixteen feet above the track of a railroad. At one point the roadway was not more than eight or ten feet wide, and as they approached this point the horse, which was ordinarily a quiet animal, shied at a large rock on the side of the road and both horse and wagon fell down the embankment. The horse was killed and Quigley was injured, whereupon the present suits were brought against the township to recover damages for said injuries.</p>

So modi of the road as was actually required for the railroad was cut down to grade, about sixteen feet below the grade of the road, and the railroad company permitted the public to continue to travel over the unused portion of the old road. The supervisors erected guards along the embankment, and notices were posted on the fence of on signboards that the road was “ dangerous until repaired.” Some two or three years before the said accident occurred the notices and the guards at the point in question had disappeared, and had not been replaced. There was testimony that until within two or three years the township supervisors had taken charge of the road, and when complaints were made to them of its dangerous condition, they promised to make it all right, claiming at the same time, that the railroad company was responsible.</p>

The uncontradicted evidence is that the whole track as now used at that place is within the lines of the land taken possession of by the railroad company, for the use of its road, it was therefore neither the right nor the duty of the supervisors to make and maintain a road at that place, and the township is not liable in this action.</p>

I affirm that down to the words, “ for the use of its road,” but I cannot say that they are not liable for the consequences of this accident — not because of their failure to perform that duty, but because they did not shut up the road, and did not use guards to prevent the accident when they knew the road would be used.

So much of the road as the township had control of was safe. It being the duty of the railroad company, under the Act of 1849 (Purd. Dig. 1221, pl. 39) to reconstruct the road, they, and not the township, are liable for failure to do so.

The injuries were produced by the dangerous condition of the i’oad kept open by the township authorities. It is true the part in question was within the limits of the ground condemned by the Chester Creek Railroad Company, but outside of the portion actually occupied by the railroad. The track of the latter was on a lower grade than the wagon road. They were separated by a bank almost perpendicular, and about sixteen feet in height. The railroad was constructed some fifteen years ago. For many years the wagon road was protected by a guard or railing placed on the top of this bank by the township'authorities. It had been suffered to fall into decay for a few years prior to the injuries in these cases. During all this time the township had suffered the wagon road to remain open and to be used as a link in the public highway. It was of narrow width and unprotected on the side next to the railroad. ■ In thus maintaining this wagon-road as a public highway, the township held it out as such, and invited the public to so use it. It is now claimed that the township is not liable inasmuch as the railroad company should have reconstructed the public road forthwith on taking the old road. It is true the Act of 19th February 1849, does infpose such duty on the railroad company, and it was subject to indictment for omitting and neglecting so to do: Pittsburgh, Virginia &amp; Charleston Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Common<a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>wealth, § Outerbridge 192. The same ease holds that the railroad company could be compelled by bill in equity to perform its duty in reconstructing, or the township might rebuild the road and collect the cost thereof from the corporation: Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Borough of Irwin, 4 Norris 336; Bean <em>v. </em>Howe, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20223" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Wright 223">Id. 260</a>.</p>
    <p id="b344-4" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[277,671,1161,512]]]'>If the township had ceased to recognize this portion of the road as a public highway and to invite its use as such; if it had erected any barrier whereby the public use thereof was denied or repudiated, the township might have been relieved from liability. The township officers could not of their own action alone, build another road on new ground, and the township is not liable by reason of their not doing so. The liability arises from their keeping open, using, and maintaining, as a public highway, this dangerous road. While the railroad company was derelict in the discharge of its duty, the township was also guilty of negligence, and liable to respond in damages to the persons injured by reason thereof.</p>
