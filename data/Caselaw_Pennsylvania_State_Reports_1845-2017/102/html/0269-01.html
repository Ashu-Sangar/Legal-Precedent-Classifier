    <p class="headnotes" id="b287-14" data-blocks='[["BL_287.11",287,[156,1364,1166,627]]]'>3. The president of a corporation, without the knowledge or consent of the finance committee, to whom was given the power to “ make arrangements for providing the necessary funds for meeting all liabilities of the company, and report to the board any suggestion they may consider advisable for paying off or discharging any of the permanent indebtedness of the company,” employed a broker to procure a party to pay off an existing ground-rent upon the company’s property, and take another security at a less rate of interest. After such a party had been procured, the president employed a sec.ond broker to notify the original holders that unless they reduced the rate of the ground-rent, it would be extinguished. Upon the holders agreeing to reduce the rate, the matter was then, for the first time, brought before the board and ratified, nothing being said about the employment of the first broker. In an action by him for his commissions, the court below allowed the jury to determine whether there was such an agreement between the president and the broker, and incidentally the question whether the company, by accepting the benefits of this broker’s services, did not ratify his employment.</p>
