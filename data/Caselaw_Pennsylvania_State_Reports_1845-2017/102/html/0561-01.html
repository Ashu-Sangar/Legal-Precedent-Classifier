In England, when on application for summary relief on motion, it appears by the depositions, or otherwise, that the facts on which relief is asked are disputed or doubtful, it is the practice to refuse the motion, an.d put the party to his audita querela. Hence this remedy has been revived and more frequently used of late than it had been during the previous century. But as it is the settled practice of courts of this state to relieve upon motion, and to grant an issue in such cases, the same reason does not exist for encouraging the use of an antiquated and cumbersome remedy here.

These decisions are entitled to the greatest respect, but they do not come to us with the sanction of authority, and they are anomalous in not receiving the unqualified approval of the judges'who made them.

The old authorities are uniform that an allowance is necessary and that it can be only issued out of the court in which the judgment was entered.

    <p id="b585-6" data-blocks='[["BL_585.6",585,[134,763,1175,1542]]]'>The averments of the petition are extremely vague in their character. Fraud is freely charged in connection with the mortgage, which is the subject of the controversy, but we are not informed who the parties are that committed the fraud. There is no allegation that fraud was practiced upon the petitioner by the mortgagee either in the creation of the mortgage or its execution. She says “ that the fraud, misrepresentation and coercion practiced upon her, render the mortgage totally void.” Whose fraud, misrepresentation and coercion? Of this we are left entirely in the dark, and if the averments are untrue, they are so vague that no indictment for perjury would lie. The chief ground of complaint, however, is that there was no service of the scire facias upon the petitioner, and that the appearance for her by counsel was “without any authority from your peti-, tioner.” ' Here again, while all that is stated may be true, there is much omitted that should have been stated. It may be literally true that the petitioner never authorized Mr. Mutehler to appear for her, and it may be equally true that she knew her husband had authorized him to. appear for both of them, and approved of it. After this lapse of time it would not be a violent presumption that she had authorized her husband to act for her. Indeed, this would be conclusively presumed in favor of a purchaser at a sheriff’s sale : Evans <em>v. </em>Meylert, 7 Harris 402; McCullough <em>v. </em>Wilson, 9 Id. 436. The judgment on the scire facias was entered September 1st 1879. This ap-. plication was made April 28th 1882. There is nothing upon the face of the petition to account for this delay. Nor is there any averment that the petitioner did not know that Mr. Mutehler was employed by her husband, on their joint account, and that judgment had been entered against her by default. If she did know, it was her duty to seek relief at the earliest possible day, and if she did not know such ignorance should have been stated as an excuse for the delay. On the whole the petition is more remarkable for what it omits than for what it avers, and we think the learned judge was fully justified in refusing the writ.</p>
