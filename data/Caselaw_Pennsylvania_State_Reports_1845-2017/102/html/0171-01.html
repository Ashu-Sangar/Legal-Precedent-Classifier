This foundation, and the lower portion of the wall resting thereon, supported the lateral thrust of a series of arches which supported the floors of both buildings. After changes of ownership of both lots, the owner of one lot removed the arches in his building and built on his ground an additional w.all abutting on the division wall to resist the lateral pressure of the airchés in.tlie other building, and to give additional support to his own interior construction as altered. Subsequently the owner of the other building tore it down and erected a new and higher building, constructing on his ground a new wall abutting on the old division wall. He also, in building, encroached 6^ inches over the top of the old division wall, and the same distance in front of. a certain portion of it whicli did not extend to the building line. The adjoining owner thereupon filed a bill in equity against him, averring that the division wall was not a party wall, and praying that the defendant be restrained from overlapping on top or in front thereof, or from otherwise using it as a party wall:</p>

In that year these two corporations joined in the , erection on these lots of two several banking houses occupying the full front of both lots, and presenting in front the appearance of one building, though distinct in the interiors. The division wall between the buildings was a solid wall 18 inches thick, the whole of which (except a small part of the foundation, as hereinafter mentioned) was within the line of the United States bank property. Above the first story the front wall of both buildings receded 28 inches from the build ing line of Chestnut street. The base or lower portion of the front wall of the two buildings consisted of a series of arches, which supported that wall above the first story. One of these arches was sprung over the division line between the lots, one abutment thereof resting on the Philadelphia bank lot, the other on the United States bank lot, so that this arch supported at once the western portion of the front of one bank building, and the eastern portion of the front of the other bank building. The interior construction of the lowest story of these buildings consisted also of a system, of arches, mutually sup<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>ported, latterly, by the division wall; these arches supported the main floor. The joists of the Philadelphia bank building were let into and supported by said division wall; this wall also suppported the roof of both buildings.

The deed was made to Eichard D, Wood, then a director of the Philadelphia bank, who took and held the legal title in trust for the Philadelphia bank, which thus became the owner of both said lots and buildings. The description in this deed was, inter alfa, as follows : “ All that certain lot . . . with the marble edifice thereon erected, situate on the south side of Chestnut street . . . beginning at a point at the distance of 64 feet westward from the southwest corner of Chestnut and Fourth streets, and extending thence southward, partly by ground of the Philadelphia bank,. . . on a line parallel with said Fourth street, 104 ft. 10 in. to a point, thence westward .... thence northward ... to the south line of Chestnut street . . . thence eastward along the south line of Chestnut street, 46 feet 6 inches to the place of beginning.”</p>

The defendant’s contractor underpinned the eastern wall of the Western Bank to the extent of three feet; then built a solid brick wall on his own lot, adjoining the old division wall, 13 inches in thickness, from the foundation up, until it reached the roof af the Western Bank, then carried it over the top of the division wall six and a half additional inches, and ran it up of the thickness of nineteen and a half inches for a short distance, then narrowed it to seventeen and a half inches, and finally, before reaching the roof, to thirteen inches. This front end of this wall started on the building line of Chestnut street, and after reaching the height of the first story of the Western Bank (where the front wall of the latter receded from tne building line), it was carried over the party line six and a half inches, and run up in front of that much of the face of the bank’s building until it reached the roof, and there joined the wall above.</p>

The division wall between the two buildings, as now constructed, is not subject to any different or greater burden than it previously supported. It required the entire wall, together with the addition built by the Western Bank when its internal arrangements were, altered, to bear the strain imposed by the old building, of the Philadelphia Bank.. The western wall of the Wood building, if newly constructed of its present thickness, and ten additional inches in the foundation, and six and a half above, would be of sufficient strength and up to the requirements of the law ; but it would be inadequate if the existing division wall was pared down to ten inches in the foundation and six and a half above.”</p>

The wall was built by the adjoining owners of two distinct properties, and between separate buildings; for the circumstance that the front for architectural purposes presented' the appearance of but one, is unimportant. It was erected partly on the land of each, the testimony showing that it rested on a foundation which, to the extent of at least seven inches in front and three in the rear, was on the property of the defendants. It also supported the joists of the defendants’ building, which were let into it some seven inches, and sustained the roof of bo.th, besides affording a mutual abutment for the arches hat formed the interior arrangement of the two.</p>

In Gordon <em>v. </em>Milne, the wall only rested three and a half inches on the land of one of the parties, but the court say: <em>“ </em>The character of the wall must be determined in part from its foundation. If the builder starts the latter over the line, and thus takes the land of the adjoining owner, he must carry it up strictly as a party-wall, or at least in such a manner as to give the adjoining owner all the benefit of such a wall. Otherwise the land of the latter would be taken without any corresponding benefit.”</p>

An adjoining owner is not to be debarred of his privilege of a party wall by the mere fact that the builder chooses to recede at any distance above the foundation within his own line. The principle of party-wall legislation is repugnant to any such doctrine. Every one in the city of Philadelphia takes his land subject to the servitude of a party-wall, and to hold that the first builder, even when he builds strictly on the party line, can deprive the adjoining owner of his right to build against it, and to carry his wall over the top to the extent allowed by law, seems to the master subversive of the object of the statute. But the evidence in this case completely negatives the idea of there being any intention on the part of the builders .to consider this other than a party-wall. It is far stronger than the case of Gordon <em>v. </em>Milne, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.N.C.%20513" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 W.N.C. 513">2 W. N.

Here, on the contrary, not only was there ground for such presumption, but it was clearly demonstrated that it was so constructed and so used. Roth parties treated it as a party wall from its first erection to the present time, and the two buildings being once owned by the same person cannot vary the status of the present owners.</p>

And that the Acts of 1855 and 1857, by virtue of which the defendants have used the six and a half inches within the complainants’ line are inapplicable, because the latter’s title to maintain the wall up to the line had vested prior to those enactments, and any attempt on the part of the legislature to give another the right to build six and one-half inches thereon would be unconstitutional.</p>

Even admitting, then, that the wall was not paid for when built, which there seems but little reason' to doubt, considering the circumstances, it is perfectly clear that the complainants are not entitled to compensation now; any such claim, if it ever existed, has long since been barred by lapse of time, and if still valid, would belong to the first builder; and as it was clearly proved by the testimony of Mr. Crump that the defendants are not at present making any other or <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>greater use of the wall than heretofore, it follows that no compensation is due to complainants.</p>

The perpendicular easement of the old Wood btiilding was the support of a roof; the perpendicular easement of the new Wood building is merely the support for a small distance of a wall six and a half inches thick.
