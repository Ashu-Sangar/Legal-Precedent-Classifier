Whilst, perhaps a mortgage might be properly spoken of, as being upon a building yet as the antecedent use of the word “premises” clearly refers to the building alone the peculiarity of the language employed, in the clause quoted, seems to throw some light on what was contemplated by the parties, in the use of the term “ premises mortgaged.”</p>

Having indemnity for its object the contract is to be construed liberally, to that end and.it is presumably the intention of the insurer that the insured shall understand, that in case of loss lie is to be protected to the full extent which any fair interpretation will give : Dow <em>v. </em>Hope Ins. Co., 1 Hall Sup. Ct. 174; Riggin <em>v. Patapso </em>’atapsco Ins. Co., Co., 7 Harr. &amp; J. (Md.) 279. The spirit of the rule is that when two interpretations, equally fair, may be given, that which gives the greater indemnity- shall prevail: To afford a reasonable indemnity in an}' given case, the amount of the insurance money payable would, or should, bear some proportion to the value of that which was lost, and against the loss of which the contract was made. It would seem absurd to estimate the loss upon any other basis. The value of the land, or any other matter, not the subject of the insurance, unless expressly made material by the contract, would seem to-be unimportant -in the -estimate. If the mortgagee desired to indemnify himself against'the loss of the buildings, to maintain the-margin of his security why should the value of the land affect the verdict ?

A11 experiment with a few hypothetical cases, wrought out according to the appellant’s scheme of proportion, will fully illustrate the fact, that the results are not uniform, are agreeable.to no general rule of indemnity, do not preserve any relative proportion between the mortgage debt and the security, and in some cases, indemnity is impossible.</p>

It will be observed however that the transfer is made with the consent .of the company, the increased risks are voluntarily accepted, new rights and new duties accrue to and are assumed by both parties; the duty of notice is enjoined upon the mortgagees perhaps to afford opportunity for cancellation; Mund and Albrecht are eliminated from the contract and its provisions subsist between other parties under new terms and conditions ; the measure of damages is materially changed ; the right to an assignment of the mortgage is stipulated for and thus, in some cases, full indemnification! against loss is secured.</p>
