Where an assignment for the benefit of creditors, conveying lands situated in more than one county, is duly recorded in the county where the assignor resides, but not elsewhere, and land in another county is sold at sheriff’s sale under a judgment obtained against the assignor subsequent to the assignment, one who purchases at such sheriff’s sale, having at the time actual knowledge of the prior assignment, takes no title, as against the assignee or those claiming under him.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b603-6" data-blocks='[["BL_603.6",603,[146,753,1168,602]]]'>2. A. made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, conveying, inter alia, a tract of land described as situated in Schuylkill county, a small portion of which was in fact in Lehigh county. In the assignment the grantor was described as residing in Schuylkill county. The assignment was recorded within thirty days, in Schuylkill county, but was never recorded in Lehigh county. The land was afterwards sold at sheriff’s sale, as the property of the assignor, under a judgment recovered against him in Lehigh county subsequent to the assignment. In ejectment by the grantee of the assignee for creditors against the purchaser at said sheriff’s sale, the court permitted the plaintiff to prove, under exception, that the defendant, at the lime of the sheriff’s sale, had actual notice of the prior assignment for creditors. There was some testimony that the assignor lived in Lehigh county, at the date of the assignment; hut the court instructed the jury: “You need not concern yourselves about that : so far as it affected the assignment, for all practical purposes in the case, we take it for verity that he lived in Schuylkill county when the assignment was made.’’</p>

You need not concern yourself about that So far as it affected the assignment, for all practical purposes in this case, we take it for verity that he lived in Schuylkill county when the assignment was made. He so described himself in the deed, and the proceedings under that assignment were in the county of Schuylkill. When Frederitza was deceased, Mr. Creitz was appointed as assignee in his stead in that county. It will not therefore, do much good, and it might do much harm in this contest, and others that might arise, if the jury were left in doubt as to whether they were to consider whether this was an assignment made by a Schuylkill county or a Lehigh county man. It was an assignment made in Schuylkill county and was not recorded in Lehigh county.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b605-7" data-blocks='[["BL_605.7",605,[140,1105,1167,1029]]]'>“ [The law provides that an assignment for the benefit of creditors must be recorded within thirty days after it has been executed, or it shall be null and void as against any of the creditors of the assignor. Outside of that provision of the law, there is another Act of Assembly which provides that a deed of conveyance must be recorded, or it is void as to subsequent mortgagees and grantees, as to them it is void if not recorded within six months. It .appears that this deed of assignment from David W. Follweiler and wife to Frederitza, and under which Creitz as assignee had title, was recorded in the county of Schuylkill, but it was not recorded in the county of Lehigh, and therefore that deed of assignment and all the proceedings under it conveyed no title to Mrs. Lutz, the plaintiff, which can affect Mrs. Follweiler, the defendant, unless the plaintiff has proved something more. So far as the assignment is concerned, the deed which the assignee has, and the deed which Mrs. Lutz has from the assignee, the title is void, and your verdict must be against the plaintiff, unless the plaintiff has proven clearly and to your satisfaction that Mrs. Follweiler, at the time she purchased at sheriff’s sale, knew of the assignment from David W. Follweiler to the assignee, and knew that the four acres which she purchased at sheriff’s sale, were included in the tract described as containing 195 acres and odd perches in West Penn township.] . . . .</p>

The object of placing <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>deeds on record is that notice may thus be furnished to all the world.....The law says while an unrecorded deed is void, it is void only as to subsequent purchasers, who purchased innocently. If a deed is on record, it gives notice to the world that somebody else owns the land. But if one who is concerned in the matter, and who purchases, knows himself that the property has been sold to some one else by the same grantor, from whom he intends to buy, then he has all the knowledge which the record would 'give him. Therefore the law is, that as against one who purchases with such notice, an unrecorded deed is good and valid.”</p>
