The plaintiff produced at the same interview a, written list of the articles of personal property which had been destroyed, and Mr.. Huntzinger marked upon the paper as “ accepted ” such as the company would be willing to pay for, and fixed their aggregate value at $269.47. Nothing further was done until May 8th 1877, when Staats offered, by letter of that date, to accept 4,700 for his loss. Two days later, Huntzinger replied that “ before we (the insurance company) can go into any fnrther negotiations for settlement we want to know just at what figure you can replace the building destroyed, after having which sum it will be an easy matter to proportion the loss amongst the parties interested.” Acting upon this letter, Mr. Staats fixed the 17th of May for a meeting of the insurance companies who had risks upon the building. On that day Huntzinger again visited Portland, with a representative of the Farmers’ Insurance Company, and entered into an agreement in writing of that date, by which the cost of rebuilding the insured projrerty <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>was estimated at $4,600.
