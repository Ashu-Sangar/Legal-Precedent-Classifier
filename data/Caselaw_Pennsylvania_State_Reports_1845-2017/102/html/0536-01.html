A judgment honestly confessed by an insolvent, man in favor of his wife to secure her for money loaned to him by her, out. of her separate estate, is not fraudulent as against creditors, merely because it includes interest on the loan, when there was in fact no agreement that the sum loaned should bear interest.</p>

If, in such case, an issue be not demanded, or be waived, the question whether the judgment was collusive, and therefore void as to creditors defrauded thereby, is a proper one for the auditor’s determination.</p>

Douglass, 12 P. F. S. 415 ; ‘ A judgment confessed voluntarily by an insolvent or indebted man for more than is due, is prima facie,' fraudulent within the statute of 13 Eliz. c. 5.’ When the $1,800 judgment was drawn up they should have tried to recall or ascertain from Daniel H: Siegfried how much had actually been given by the wife to the husband, and then the husband should have confessed a-judgment for that amount and no more. As between the parties it is binding and valid, but as to creditors it is fraudulent and must be disregarded in the distribution in so far as is necessary to make honest creditors whole. The law looks upon the judgment as fraudulently given by collusion between the debtor and the plaintiff, for the purpose of hindering and delaying creditors, and hence it may be attacked collaterally by such creditors.”</p>

In the case of the appeal of the Nat. B’k of Titusville, 4 Norris 531, the question is elaborately discussed by Paxson, J.,who after reference to the authorities says — “ All the cases say that the mere fact that the debtor has been overreached and a fraud perpetrated upon him by the creditor gives no right to other creditors to attack the judgment collaterally. So long as it stands as a'valid judgment against the defendant, it is good against them. They have no right to complain of a fraud upon him. In such cases the only person who can impeach the judgment is the defendant himself and this must be done by a motion in the proper court to open it. . . . Where, however, a judgment has been fraudulently given by collusion between the debtor and the plaintiff in such judgment for the purpose of hindering and delaying creditors, it may be attacked collaterally by the creditors intended to be defrauded. As to them, such judgment is void. But they can only have it set aside as to themselves. They cannot impair it as between the parties.”</p>

A collusive judgment may be- attacked before him, and, in the absence of a proper application for an issue, that question is one for his determination. In a proper case, and at a proper time, an issue is of right-: Souder’s Appeal, 57 Penna. St. 498; but the right may be waived: Myers’ Appeal, 2 Penna. St. 463; Seip’s Appeal, 26 Ibid. 176. It has been settled by authorities that in a distribution ’an Auditor cannot inquire into the validity of a judgment regular upon its face: Dyott’s Estate, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 557" data-case-ids="1853564" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0557-01">2 W. &amp; S. 557</a>; Leeds <em>v. </em>Bender, 6 Ibid. 315; Ellmaker <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., Idem. 442; Titusville B’k’s Appeal, 4 Norris 530; if void upon its face he may disregard it: Brunner’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%2067" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="11 Wright 67">11 Wright 67</a>. He may receive testimony to establish payment: Borland’s Appeal, 16 P. F. Smith 470; but not to show that it is erroneous or a fraud upon the debtor: Hauer’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 473" data-case-ids="478782" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0473-01">5 W. &amp; S. 473</a>; Thompson’s Appeal, 7 P.

There was not much if any-conflict in the testimony, and from the report <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>of the Auditor it would appear that Henrietta Christman received in and after the year 1856 at different dates and from different sources, in her own right, $1,363; that the husband asked her for the money and, as she received it, she gave it to him and he paid his debts with it; that this made him her debtor to the extent of the money received by him that whilst interest is often mentioned in the testimony of the husband and wife, their appears to be no certainty whether interest was to be paid or not, but he is of the opinion from áll that appeared that at the time of the loan there was no agreement made to pay interest; that the judgment No. 447 April term 1879 for $1,800 was given to cover the loan of $1,363, and that the difference between $1,800 and $1,363 was intended for interest.</p>
    <p id="b561-6" data-blocks='[["BL_561.6",561,[137,959,1163,345]]]'>The Auditor further, finds that Jonas Christman in this testimony was not guilty of actual fraud or falsehood, and that he had no dishonest purpose or intent to cheat or defraud his creditors, by giving to his wife what he knew did not belong to her. Speaking of Jonas Christman and his wife the Auditor says, that he does “ not desire to convey any impression that these unfortunate people are designedly wicked or corrupt, but rather careless and negligent.”</p>
    <p id="b561-7" data-blocks='[["BL_561.7",561,[138,1303,1162,801]]]'>Inasmuch, however, as $437 was charged for interest on the loan, the Auditor determined that the judgment was necessarily collusive. Whilst we agree with the Auditor, in his finding of the facts, we must disagree with him in his deductions therefrom. It is doubtless true, as said by Mr. Justice Sharswood, in Clark <em>v. </em>Douglass, 12 P. F. Smith 415, that “ a judgment confessed voluntarily by an insolvent or indebted man for more than is due is prima facie frandulent within the statute of 13 Eliz. c. 5but then it is only prima facie fraudulent, and as the Auditor has specifically and expressly found from the evidence that in fact, there was no dishonest or fraudulent purpose to cheat or defraud, delay or hinder the creditors, that prima facie presumption is by the Auditor’s finding fully rebutted. If the parties had no fraudulent purpose or intent, then the judgment was not collusive, and the powers of.the Auditor over the judgment were at an end. If the wife had no right to interest, and the husband by mistake and in ignorance of the law .embraced interest in the bond the judgment was erroneous not collusive or fraudulent.</p>
    <p id="b561-8" data-blocks='[["BL_561.8",561,[143,2114,1158,298]],["BL_562.1",562,[301,406,1168,174]]]'>For mere mistake, however, as we have said, the judgment cannot be set aside by an Auditor, as the question in a contest with strangers is not whether the judgment is erroneous, but whether it is fraudulent: Hauer’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 473" data-case-ids="478782" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0473-01">5 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 473</a>. In Bergey’s Appeal, 10 P. F. Smith 408, Thompson, C. J., says, * We think the Auditor, even if he might set aside the judgment for fraud, had no sufficient evidence in any of the consi<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>delations noticed, and certainly not in the fact that the judgment was for too large an amount by the sum of the interest included in it; that was an easy mistake to make, and was not a ground for setting aside the judgment.”</p>
    <p id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[298,575,1168,259]]]'>The distribution made by the Auditor and confirmed by the court, although made under a mistaken view of the law, is nevertheless a correct one. <em>We </em>do not therefore find fault with the schedule of distribution thus made, and having stated what we conceive to be the correct principle of the law from which such a distribution results, the decree is affirmed.</p>
