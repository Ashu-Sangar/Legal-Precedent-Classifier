That is not the object of the Act. Its purpose is to more effectually secure the payment of costs made in this court, and make the return of the record to the court below, obligatory on the party-bringing it here. In order to effect these objects it imposes an additional liability on the party appealing or obtaining a writ of certiorari or of error. It leaves wholly untouched the question in what court the security shall be given.</p>

Leaving this power with the judges of that court evinces wise legislative forethought. They know better than any other tribunal what security is necessary to protect the vast and complicated interests which they are required to guard. It follows that the judges of the Orphans’ Court of the county of Philadelphia violated no law in declining to send up the record in the case wherein the relator had not given such security as the statute requires.</p>
