        "text": "Chief Justice Mercur\ndelivered the opinion of the court, February 12th 1883.\nTiie defendant is a mutual insurance company. The losses are paid by assessment on its members. The object of the company is to .insure .against, bodily injuries produced in a certain manner specified, that is, caused by external violent and accidental means. Not injuries caused by any one of these means, but by all of them combined. Hence the certificate of membership expressly declares the benefits shall not be held to extend to any case of death or personal injury unless the claimant shall establish by direct and. positive proof that the death or personal injury \u201c was caused by external violence and accidental means.\u201d To remove all doubt as to the liability of the association to the plaintiff in this ease the certificate further declares the benefits under it shall not-extend to any death or disability which may have been caused \u201c by the taking of poison.\u201d It is not necessary that the poison be taken with an intent to produce death, in order to defeat a claim flowing from the right of membership. If the poison be innocently taken, and without any knowledge of the injurious effect which it was likely to produce, and did produce, so far- as the person taking it is concerned, the effect may be said to be accidental. If we go a step' further and admit in such case, that the \u201c means \u201d are accidental; yet it is one of the accidental means expressly excepted from the protective power of the certificate. The liability for injuries caused by external violence is still further limited and restricted. Thus the benefits do not extend to cases where the injury was -\u201c the result of design either on the part of the member or of any other person.\u201d To hold the association liable for a death caused by taking poison would not only be in conflict with the letter of the agreemen t, but contrary to the whole purpose for which the association appears to have been formed.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Pollock versus United States Mutual Accident Association.\n1. Where a policy of insurance in an accident insurance company provides that its benefits shall not extend to death or injury caused \u201c by the taking of poison,\u201d an involuntary taking of poison, by mistake, causing death, is within said provision in the policy.\n2. A certificate or policy of insurance issued on the life of A. by a mutual accident insurance company, insuring him against \u201cinjuries effected through external, violent and accidental means,\u201d provided that the policy should not extend to any bodily injury of which there shall be no external and visible sign/ or to any bodily injury caused directly or indirectly \u2018\u2018by the taking of poison.\u201d The assured, being pi'esent in a store where a salesman was offering for sale a sample of birch oil, and mistaking.it for \u2018\u2018milk of birch,\u201d first tasted, and then took a good drink of the birch oil, from the poisonous effects of which he died within twenty-four hours. It was admitted, in a case stated, that the deceased mistook the birch oil for \u201c milk of birch \u201d which he had been in the habit of drinking, a harmless beverage, which very closely resembles in color, smell and taste \u2018\u2018 birch oil.\u201d In an action by the widow of said insured, the beneficiary named in the policy, against the insurance company to recover the sum insured: Held, that the terms of the policy did not extend to the cause of the death, and that the court below, therefore, rightly entered judgment, on the case stated, for the defendant.\nJanuary 29th 1883.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Paxson, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ. Gordon and Trunkey, JJ., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 3, of Philadelphia county: Of January Term 1883, No. 118.\nCovenant, by Catharine A: Pollock, against the United States Mutual Accident Association, of the city of New York, upon a policy of insurance issued by the said company upon the life of Henry Pollock, the plaintiff\u2019s husband.\nThe parties agreed upon a case stated which set forth substantially the following facts: The corporation defendant was chartered under the laws of New York ; the object of the association being the accumulation of a fimd for the mutual benefit of its members, or their beneficiaries, \u201c who shall have sustained, while members of the association, bodily injuries, whether fatal or disabling, effected through or by external violent and accidental means.\u201d Said company issued a certificate or policy to Henry Pollock, dated March 7th 1882, the principal sum to be raised by assessment from members in his class, not exceeding $5,000, to be paid to his wife, Catharine Pollock, within sixty days after due proof that said insured \u201c shall have sustained bodily injuries effected through external violent and accidental means .... and such injuries alone shall have occasioned death within ninety- days from the happening thereof .... Provided that benefits under this certificate shall not extend to any bodily injury of which there shall be no external and visible sign; nor to any bodily injury happening directly or indirectly in consequence of disease .... or by the taking of poison . . . And no claim shall be made under this certificate when the death or injury may have been caused by . . . suicide, felonious or otherwise, sane or insane ... or self-inflicted injuries . . . The member is required to use all due diligence for personal safety and protection.\u201d\nThe case stated further set forth': \u201c That the said Henry Pollock was by occupation a commercial traveler, N and sold goods for his father, John Pollock, who is a brush manufacturer in the borough of Easton, Pennsylvania, the deceased son being a resident of the same place.\n\u201c That on Saturday, April loth 1882, the said Henry Pollock, being upon a business trip, and having reached the borough of White Haven, Penna., went into a store in that place, kept by a man named John S. Parke, to whom said Pollock was in the habit of selling brushes. That the said Parke, who keeps a general country store, also buys from the small distillers in the neighborhood the essential oils of birch and wintergreen. That while the said Pollock was in the store and engaged in showing his samples to the proprietor, a distiller by the name of John' S. Keiper came in with a can of \u00a3 birch oil \u2019 to sell to Parke. Parke left Pollock, and taking the can ef oil from Keiper to examine the same, poured a tumbler about two-thirds full, held it up to the light and then set it down upon the counter. Parke then said,\u00a3 Come, boys, I will set them up,\u2019 or \u00a3 Now I will treat, won\u2019t you take something V and Pollock thereupon took the glass, either from Parke\u2019s hand or from the counter, and said, \u2018 1 don\u2019t care if I do;\u2019 whereupon Pollock tasted it, then took a good swallow. Then Keiper said,\u00a3 Young man, you have killed yourself!\u2019 Pollock laughed and said that \u2018 he had often drank it on the Pocono Mountain, where they made it,\u2019 and with this remark drank the balance of the oil.\n\u201cThat during the previous summer, to wit, the summer of 1881, the said Henry Pollock, together with one Robert Martin, a brush manufactui\u2019er of New York city, and Allen Carpenter, a dry goods merchant of Easton, Pa., and the families of the three named, had boarded on the Pocono Mountains in Monroe county, at a public house kept by a man named Peter Mervine ; that in close proximity to the hotel where the party was staying there was a distillery, operated by a son of the proprietor named above, where the essential oil of birch was manufactured; that the said Pollock and the other members of the party, including ladies and children, frequently drank at this distillery \u00a3 the milk of birch,\u2019 or \u2018lighten,\u2019 which is the water through which the oil passes in the process of distilling, and which in' color, smell and general appearance can hardly be distinguished from the genuine \u00a3 oil of birch.\u2019\n\u201c That after the said Pollock had drank the \u2018 birch oil,\u2019 as hereinbefore described, he remained in the store of the said Parke for from one hour to two hours, and after selling some goods, left the store, having remarked to. Parke that he would soon call and see him at his (Parke\u2019s) new store at Weatherly, Pa. That while in Parke\u2019s store, after having drank the oil, Pollock was asked \u2018 how he felt on the oil,\u2019 and he answered, \u2018 all right.\u2019\n\u201c That after the said Pollock left Parke\u2019s store he went to the hotel, sent the hostler for his samples, and afterwards took the 3 p. m. train for Easton, his home. That he arrived at the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company\u2019s depot at South Easton at about 6.25 p. m., and rode in the omnibus which carries passengers to and from that depot, to his house on Front street, in the borough of Easton, a distance of about one-half mile: that during the ride over to town he told the driver \u2018to hurry up, that he was sick ;\u2019 that he was taken violently ill as soon as he got into the house ; that Dr. Isaac Ott, the family physician, was sent for and attended him, and that subsequently Dr. Traill Green was called in to assist him ; that all that medical skill could do to save his life was done, but without avail, as the said Pollock died the next day, to wit, on Sunday, April 16th 1882, at 11 a. m.\n\u201c That the death of the said Pollock was caused solely by the \u2018 oil of birch\u2019 which he had taken by mistake, the said oil being a deadly poison ; that the said \u2018 oil of birch \u2019 was taken by the said Pollock without any intention of taking life, and without the knowledge by the said Pollock of its deadly effect, he having mistaken it for \u2018 lighten,.\u2019 or the \u2018 milk of birch,\u2019 which he had drank scores of times before, and which is a harmless beverage.\n\u201c That due notice of the death of the said Pollock was served upon the association, defendant, at its place of business in the city of New York on Monday, the 17th day of April, 1882, and that satisfactory proof of the fact and cause of death have been furnished to the managers of the said association.\n\u201c If the conrt be of the opinion that the death of the said Pollock was such an accidental death as is intended to be covered by the certificate of membership hereinbefore referred to, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of five thousand dollars, with interest thereon from the fifteenth day of June, a. d. 1882, but if not, then judgment to be entered for the defendant. The costs to follow the judgment, and either party reserving the right to sue' out a writ of error therein.\u201d\nThe court, in an opinion by Ludlow, P. J., entered judgment for the defendant on the case stated, whereupon the plaintiff took this writ of error, assigning for error, said judgment.\nJames W. Wilson (Edward J. Fox with him), for the plaintiff in error.\n\u2014 The condition relieving the company from liability for death caused \u201c by the taking of poison \u201d should not be construed to apply to accidental poisoning; \u201c taking \u201d means intentional taking. The case falls within the rule that \u201c where an exception in a policy of insurance is capable of two interpretations, equally reasonable, that must be adopted which is most favorable to the insured, for the language is that of the insurer\u201d: Western Ins. Co. v. Cropper, 8 Cas. 351; Commonwealth Ins. Co. v. Berger, 6 Wr. 285: Ins. Co. v. O\u2019Maley, 1 Norris 400.\nWilliam S. Price (with him William, Bro. Smith), for the defendant in error."
