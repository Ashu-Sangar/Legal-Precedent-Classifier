The Act of August 1st 1868, Pur. Dig. 1028, pi. 21, applicable to such claims in the city of Philadelphia, expressly declares they shall not be a lien \u201c except from the time of filing the claim.\u2019\u2019 The appellants\u2019 claim was not filed in the lifetime of the owner of the building. When he died it was not of record, and no lien by virtue of the Act cited. By 1ns death it became a lien lik\u00e9 other debts of his, not of record. It was then of no higher grade. It had no preference over any other of his debts. The filing of the claim after-wards gave no preference. The claim which under the Act of 1861 was no lien until filed, could not create a lien which would relate back of the filing whether the owner of the building was living or dead, when it was filed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.",

    "head_matter": "Appeal of Hoff, et al.\nA mechanics\u2019 lien for repairs, alterations and additions under the Act of August 1st 1868 (P. L. 1168), filed after the death of the debtor but \u25a0within six mouths after the completion of the work, is not entitled to priority, over the general debts of decedent, in distribution of the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale, in'execution, of tlie premises against which such mechanics\u2019 lien was filed.\nJanuary 26th 1883.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunket, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.\nAppeal from the Common Pleas No. 2, of Philadelphia county: Of January Term 1883, No. 69.\nThis was an appeal by Hoff and others from a decree of the said court dismissing their exceptions to the report of an auditor, distributing the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale of realty and confirming the report.\nThe real estate in question was sold January 1st 1882, in execution under a judgment against Alfred Yezin and Bella G., his wife. After payment of the execution creditor in full, the matter was referred to an Auditor (Charles D. Freeman, Esq.) to report distribution of the balance of the fund. Before the Auditor, the fund was claimed on the one hand by Thomas W. South, administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Alfred Yezin, the defendant in the execution, who died April ,15th 1881, and on the other hand, by Hoff, Fontaine & Abbott and by one Cape-hart under mechanics\u2019 claims filed by them for work and labor done in the repair, alteration and addition to buildings erected on the premises, the sheriff\u2019s sale of which produced the fund. These mechanics\u2019 claims were filed respectively on April 27th and May 4th 1881, within six months from the completion of the work, and prior to the sheriff\u2019s- sale but after the death of Alfred Vezin.- The Auditor found that said Vezin was both the owner of the realty sold, and the contractor for the work and materials mentioned in the claims ; that the amount due to Hoff, Fontaine & Abbott for the work and materials mentioned in their claim was $824.87; the amount due Cape-hart for the work mentioned in his claim was $378.90.\nThe Auditor reported, as matter of law, that upon the death of Alfred Vezin his debts not of record became liens on his real estate, or on the proceeds thereof sold in execution after, his death, under the Act of February 134th 1834, \u00a7 33 (Pamph.' L. p. 79); and that the filing of the mechanics\u2019 claims after his death did not operate to give the claimants priority over the general creditors of the decedent.\nThe Auditor, therefore awarded the fund for distribution to Thomas W. South, Administrator, etc-., of Alfred Vezin, to be accounted for and distributed in the Orphans\u2019 Court.\nThe claimants in the mechanics\u2019 liens filed exceptions to the report, which were dismissed by the court and the report confirmed. The exceptants took this appeal, assigning for error the decree dismissing their exceptions and confirming the report.\nJoseph C. Ferguson, for the appellants.\nRobert H. Hinckley (Shoemaker and Staake with him), for the appellee."
