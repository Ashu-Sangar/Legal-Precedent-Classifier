In this regard, they note that under the terms of the Rent Withholding Act a tenant may but need not necessarily employ the escrow funds to make the needed improvements and can avoid eviction during the period of rent suspension notwithstanding his mistreatment of the property or other violation of his lease, and the landlord may irretrievably lose rentals if, after making a good faith and reasonable effort, he cannot rehabilitate the property within six months after its certification as unfit. Appellants also construe the Act as allowing the tenant to remain in possession regardless of his payment of rent to the escrowee and as requiring the landlord to renew a lease which is set to expire during the statutory six month period. The foregoing features, however, do not render the Act unduly oppressive or otherwise unreasonable.</p>

The Rent Withholding Act states expressly that “[d]uring any period when the duty to pay rent is suspended, and the tenant continues to occupy the dwelling, the rent withheld <em>shall be deposited </em>by the tenant in an escrow account . . .” (emphasis added.) This language makes clear .that a tenant may in no event remain in possession without paying the required rent to the escrowee. See also <em>National Council v. Roberson, </em><a href="/pa-super/214/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="214 Pa. Super. 9" data-case-ids="786730" data-case-paths="/pa-super/214/0009-01">214 Pa.

In addition, the Act does not, as appellants argue, require the renewal of a lease which is set to expire during the six month period of rent suspension. The Act provides that the duty to pay and <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>the right to receive rent shall be suspended “without affecting, any other terras or conditions of the landlord-tenant relationship”. As the termination date of a lease is surely a term or condition of that relationship, the quoted language suggests that there is no requirement of involuntary lease renewal. On the other hand, the last sentence of the Act states: “No tenant shall be evicted for any reason whatsoever while rent is deposited in escrow”. To give meaning to both of these portions of the Act, we conclude that the Act does not require the <em>renewal </em>of an existing lease but only an <em>extension </em>of the original lease so long as rent is in escrow.</p>
    <p id="b458-4" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[195,1042,1144,738]]]'>This construction serves the intent of the Act. Undoubtedly, a portion of those who rent unfit dwellings are tenants from month to month or at will. With respect to this class of tenants, if the Act were construed to require no extension of the tenant’s possessory right, the landlord could largely avoid the impact of the Act by giving notice to vacate as soon as the first rental payment was put in escrow. However, in the case of a tenancy from year to year or longer set to expire one or two months prior to the expiration of the rent withholding period, the objectives of the Act would no't be served and the landlord would be needlessly burdened, if he were required to renew the lease for an entire additional term.</p>
    <p id="b458-5" data-blocks='[["BL_458.6",458,[195,1802,1145,537]],["BL_459.1",459,[161,338,1151,374]]]'>That the Eent Withholding Act permits but does not require the necessary improvements to be made with the escrow funds is surely not unreasonable. A substantial and recurring part of a landlord’s business is the maintenance of his property. Accordingly, it is to be expected that most landlords possess either the skills needed to make property repairs or, at least, the knowledge of whom to hire to make such repairs. Tenants, as a class, are not likely to possess these skiUa and this knowledge in the same degree. Thus, it is far <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>from unreasonable to put the burden on the landlord rather than the tenant to make the needed repairs., Of course, the Act imposes an additional burden upon the landlord in the sense that he will be out of pocket to the extent of the cost of the repairs until the repairs are completed and the rents released from escrow, but we do not deem this unduly oppressive.</p>
    <p id="b459-3" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[165,721,1156,1572]]]'>Neither are we persuaded by the example of a landlord who is unable to make the required improvements within six months notwithstanding his good faith efforts to do so. In the first place, the Legislature had to set <em>some </em>cut off point in order to make meaningful the sanction of permanent rent loss. Otherwise, a landlord could procrastinate interminably. A half a year is surely not an unreasonably short time. Furthermore, there can be little sympathy for the landlord who despite diligence and good faith cannot repair his property within the alloted time. Landlords have a duty to maintain their properties in a condition fit for human habitation not only after that property has been certified as unfit but <em>at all times. </em>Section 7-104 of the Philadelphia Housing Code itself provides for fines of up to $300 or imprisonment for up to 90 days or both, for any violation for each day such violation continues after notice and opportunity to comply. Section 7-505 of the Code provides for direct abatement of the violation by the Department of Licenses and Inspections. Thus it is not unreasonable that a landlord suffer a financial penalty even if he cannot render his property fit within six months after its certification as unfit. This situation might have even been contemplated by the Act: the goal of good housing would be served not only by rehabilitating houses which are certified as unfit but also by <em>deterring </em>owners of rental property from allowing their property to degenerate into a condition of unfitness in the first place.</p>

      <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>The provision of the Rent Withholding Act that insulates a tenant from eviction during the rent withholding period is not a constitutional deficiency. To be sure, this statutory right is a windfall to the tenant. However, it serves as an additional deterrent inducing the landlord to maintain his property in a habitable condition. Furthermore, one of the possibly beneficial effects of the Act is that it permits the aid of tenants in an effort to enforce health and housing codes. To enlist tenant initiative, the Legislature might well have deemed it necessary to forestall tenant fear of landlord reprisal. And in the case where a tenant abuses the leased property while shielded from eviction by the statute, the landlord is fully protected. He may sue the tenant for money damages for any destruction or, if monetary damages are inadequate, seek an injunction against the misuse of his property.</p>
