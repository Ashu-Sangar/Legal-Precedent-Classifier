We answered this argument in <em>Deitch Company v.

The procedure requires that the taxing authority first present its assessment record into evidence. Such presentation makes out a prima facie .case for the validity of the assessment in the sense- that it fixes the time when the burden of coming forward with evidence shifts to the taxpayer. If the taxpayer fails to respond with credible, relevant evidence, then the taxing body prevails. But once the taxpayer produces sufficient proof to overcome its initially allotted status, the prima facie significance of the Board’s .assessment figure has served its procedural purpose, and its value as an evidentiary device is ended. <em>Thereafter such record, of itself, loses the weight previously accorded to it </em>and may not then influence the court’s determination of the assessment’s correctness. . . .</p>
