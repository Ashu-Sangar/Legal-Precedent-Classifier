Phila. Electric Co., </em><a href="/pa/402/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="402 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1296613" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0297-01">402 Pa. 297</a>, 301, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20472" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="167 A.2d 472">167 A. 2d 472</a> (1960). Underlying these requisites, of course, is the existence of a contract or of a prospective contractual relation between the third person and the plaintiff. Thus in this case the questions are whether the complaint discloses (1) a prospective contractual relation between Sheraton and plaintiffs, (2) the purpose or intent to harm plaintiff by preventing <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>the relationship from occurring, (3) the absence of privilege or justification on the part of the actor (appellee), and (4) the occurrence of actual harm or damage to plaintiff as a result of the actor’s conduct.

Paragraphs Seventh and Eighth assert that Sheraton would entertain offers through brokers, and that if an offer were accepted would recognize the broker and pay the usual commission. The possible sale price of $790,000, including furnishings, mentioned by appellants to appellee was not so far beyond the actual consideration of $700,000 (possibly without furnishings) as to make plaintiffs’ prospective position as the efficient cause of a sale unrealistic and merely wishful thinking. It is true that there could be no guarantee of Sheraton’s reaction to any offer that might be submitted, and it of course was under no compulsion to deal with either appellants or appellee. But anything that is prospective in nature is necessarily uncertain. We are not here dealing with certainties, but with reasonable likelihood or probability. This must be something more than a mere hope or the innate optimism of the salesman. As the Superior Court of New Jersey has put it, “. . . the rule to be applied ... is that the broker may recover when the jury is satisfied that but for the wrongful acts of the defendant it is <em>reasonably probable </em>that the plaintiff would have effected the sale of the property and received a commission.” <em>Myers v. Arcadio, Inc., </em><a href="/nj-super/73/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="73 N.J. Super. 493" data-case-ids="359607" data-case-paths="/nj-super/73/0493-01">73 N. J.

It must be emphasized that the tort we are considering is an intentional one: the actor is acting as he does <em>for the purpose of causing harm </em>to the plaintiff. As proposed comment <em>d </em>to the Tentative Draft of §766A of the <em>Restatement (Second) Torts </em>emphasizes, “The defendant must not only have intended the interference, but must have acted in part at least for the purpose of accomplishing it.” In the words of a leading text, “The wrong ordinarily requires conduct intended to interrupt negotiations or prevent the consummation of a contract.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The lower court stated in its opinion that “there is no allegation that the defendant acted for specific purpose of causing harm to the plaintiffs.” We agree. Paragraph Twenty-First alleges that “By negotiating directly with [Sheraton], the defendant intentionally, wrongfully, maliciously, fraudulently, deceitfully and without <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>justification interfered -with and precluded and prevented plaintiffs from entering into the relationship of brokers in the transaction with [Sheraton], thus depriving plaintiffs of their commission.” While this comes close to charging an intent to cause harm to plaintiffs, it stops short of doing so. It thus does not meet the test of <em>Birl, supra, </em>or the <em>Restatement. </em>See, <em>Locker v. Hudson Coal Co., supra, </em><a href="/pa-d-c/87/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="87 Pa. D. &amp; C. 264" data-case-ids="1604392" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c/87/0264-01">87 Pa.

    <p id="b544-4" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[197,788,1153,926]]]'>The absence of privilege or justification in the tort under discussion is closely related to the element of intent. As stated by Harper &amp; James, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>§6.11, at 513-14: “. . . where, as in most cases, the defendant acts at least in part for the purpose of protecting some legitimate interest which conflicts with that of the plaintiff, a line must be drawn and the interests evaluated. This process results in according or denying a privilege which, in turn, determines liability.” What is or is not privileged conduct in a given situation is not susceptible of precise definition. Harper &amp; James refer in general to interferences which “are sanctioned by the ‘rules of the game’ which society has adopted”, and to “the area of socially acceptable conduct which the law regards as privileged,” <em>id. </em>at 510, 511, and treat the subject in detail in §§6.12 and 6.13. See, also, the <em>Restatement, </em>§768.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.6",544,[192,1728,1151,650]]]'>In the instant case the lower court clearly felt that the defendant’s conduct as alleged in the complaint was within the privileged area: the defendant merely failed to be persuaded by plaintiffs to deal through them in seeking the purchase of the hotel, and chose instead to deal directly with Sheraton. This may be a fair inference from the pleading of what in fact occurred; on the other hand, it may be an oversimplification. Without more facts in hand, we deem it unwise to speculate. Suffice it to say now that the complaint as presently drafted does not negate the existence of privilege on the part of defendant.</p>

Development of interest in those properties by exhibiting them to potential buyers is his chief activity, and he does that frequently with nothing more than the expectation that if he produces a buyer the owner will pay him a commission. That expectation may arise from an express agreement with the seller (even though unenforceable, because oral or for other reasons), but it may also arise out of other circumstances, such as an offer to the public or to brokers generally; and generally owners fulfill such expectations.” See, also, <em>Sustick v.
