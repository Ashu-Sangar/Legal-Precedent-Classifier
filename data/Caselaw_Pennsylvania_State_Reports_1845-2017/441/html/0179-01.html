The death of appellee’s decedent on November 24, 1967, was allegedly caused by the malpractice of certain physicians and the negligence of appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> A summons in trespass was filed November 15, 1968, and was served on appellant five days later. On March 11, 1969, counsel for the appellant wrote to appellee’s counsel requesting him to file a complaint without the necessity of a for<a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>mal rule. It was alleged and <em>admitted </em>that the following day appellant’s counsel, by telephone, agreed to an extension of time in which to file a complaint because appellee’s counsel, without the hospital records in the possession of the appellant, doubted the validity of this cause of action. <em>Although these records were made fully available to appellee’s counsel, </em>no complaint was filed. On May 12, 1969, appellee’s counsel was notified that a rule to file a complaint within twenty days or suffer a judgment of non pros, had been filed. After the expiration date of June 2, 1969, appellant’s counsel notified appellee’s counsel that a judgment of non pros, would be taken if the complaint was not promptly filed. A second warning was later given appellee’s counsel indicating that a judgment of non pros, would be taken on July 2, 1969.</p>

      <em>None of this correspondence was heeded </em>and a judgment of non pros, was taken on July 7, 1969. Even after that date appellant’s counsel, on July 8, 1969, graciously agreed not to oppose an opening of the judgment if a complaint was filed by July 15, 1969. No complaint having been filed, appellant’s counsel closed its file and so informed appellee’s counsel on August 28, 1969. Notwithstanding, appellee filed a complaint on September 23 1969, which was later returned by the Prothonotary as having been accepted in error. Thereafter, appellee’s counsel petitioned to remove the judgment of non pros., which petition was granted by the court below following oral argument.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In this same vein, we have stated: “A request to open a judgment of non pros, is by way of grace and not of right. Its grant or refusal is peculiarly a matter for the lower court’s discretion..

Furthermore, there is no medical or psychiatric evidence in the record supporting the otherwise bald allegation of appellee’s counsel that appellee would be so distressed. Indeed, it is interesting to' note that such difficulty did not hamper the filing of complaints against the individual physicians involved.</p>
