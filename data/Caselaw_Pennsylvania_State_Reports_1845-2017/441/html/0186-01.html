Thus the pharmacist will no longer be able to “monitor” prescriptions to determine whether the consumer is taking antagonistic drugs. (3) Price advertising may encourage small retailers to buy unusually large quantities of drugs, so as to obtain a lesser price. As a result, drugs may stay on the pharmacist’s shelf for an extended period of time during which they may deteriorate.

As the Supreme Court of Florida stated in a case striking down as unconstitutional a rule prohibiting price advertising of prescription drugs: “The rule proceeds on the notion that the advertisement of a prescription drug will subject the physicians to some sort of irresistible pressures that will force them to prescribe drugs for their patients simply on the basis of patient demand and without regard to the physical well-being of the patient.

Further, it is primarily the physician’s duty to be certain that he is not prescribing drugs antagonistic to those already being taken by his patient. Indeed, it would appear that if the Legislature was in fact concerned about the prescribing of antagonistic drugs, it would have chosen a route more direct than simply prohibiting the advertising of their prices.

As in the case of the monitoring function, the means chosen are so far removed from the goal suggested that one must strain to find the relation. In addition, we note that this problem <em>has </em>been attacked in a more direct fashion. A drug will be deemed “adulterated” if it falls below the requisite standard of strength, quality and purity, see The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 P.S. §780-13 (b). Sale of such an adulterated drug is prohibited; see 35 P.S. §780-4(a), and may subject the pharmacist to criminal liability: see 35 P.S. §780-20, as well as the loss of his license, see the Pharmacy Act, 63 P.S. §390-5.

For example, a recent survey conducted in New York City by Consumers Union indicates that the price for the same thirty capsules of a well known antibiotic may range from $.79 to $7.45. Part of the reason assigned for this large discrepancy was the lack of advertising, and Consumers Union concluded: “All in all, here is a case where honest-to-goodness price advertising is much needed.” “What’s the price of an Rx Drug?”, 35 Consumer Reports 279 (1970).

Today the majority finds violative of due process <em>only </em>that portion of Section 8(11) of the Pharmacy Act, Act of September 27, 1961, P. L. 1700, 63 P.S. §390-8(11) prohibiting the advertisement of “dangerous drugs”. <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>Owing to the unique statutory definitions chosen by the General Assembly and the interaction of state and federal law, the majority is able to equate drugs legitimately available only on prescription with “dangerous drugs.” Henceforth, the pharmacies in the Commonwealth will be permitted to advertise prescription drugs and <em>not </em>all those drugs loosely termed “dangerous drugs”. Though only prescription drugs may be advertised, I must nonetheless dissent.</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[187,840,1147,693]]]'>The cornerstone of the Majority Opinion is the “unique purchasing structure” of the prescription drug industry whereby such drugs are available only upon a written or oral prescription from a duly licensed medical practitioner and filled by a licensed pharmacist. Thus, the majority is able to erect the required prescription as a bulwark against drug abuse; to do otherwise, the majority concludes, would impugn the professional integrity of either doctors or pharmacists. It may be true that the incidence of <em>legitimate </em>drug taking will not be increased but one must pause to consider the effect of the majority’s decision on the incidence of <em>illegitimate </em>drug consumption.</p>
    <p id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.6",262,[187,1544,1145,809]],["BL_263.1",263,[181,338,1146,92]]]'>In an increasingly drug-oriented society it cannot be gainsaid that such advertising might very well “titillate an aberrant person”. Considering the thesis of many popular writers that advertising agencies can sell any product, including politicians, could not this prescription drug advertising have the side effect, albeit unintentional, of popularizing the illegal use of drugs? The blatant, multi-media advertising of prescription drugs that can be anticipated may very well have the effect of placing society’s stamp of approval on any and all drug usage. While it may be argued, owing to the already widespread use of narcotics, that my position would add but one more cup of water to the sea, such advertising may also be the straw to break society’s back. Thus, it is my belief that the majority’s <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>analysis does not fully explore all the possible ramifications of this decision.</p>
    <p id="b263-3" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[180,448,1150,1023]]]'>I further disagree with the majority’s dismissal of this Court’s rationale in <em>Ullom v. Boehm, </em><a href="/pa/392/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="392 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="8845767" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0643-01">392 Pa. 643</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=142%20A.2d%2019" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="142 A.2d 19">142 A. 2d 19</a> (1958), because of the “unique purchasing structure” of prescription drugs. In distinguishing <em>TJllom, </em>the majority pays no heed to the spirit or essence of the <em>TJllom </em>opinion insofar as that case impugned the profession of optometry by recognizing the legislative determination to remove “from dealers the temptation to sell to the public, eye-damaging glasses in order to adhere to an arbitrarily established reduced budget”. <a href="/pa/392/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="392 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="8845767" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0643-01">392 Pa. at 648-49</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=142%20A.2d%2019" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="142 A.2d 19">142 A. 2d at 21</a>. For some unarticulated reason the majority does not choose to demean pharmacists whereas this Court has already impugned optometrists. Just as an optometrist may sell “eye-damaging glasses in order to adhere to an arbitrarily established reduced budget”, so may a pharmacist sell prescription drugs without a prescription in order that his volume of drug sales at reduced prices will cover his costs.</p>
