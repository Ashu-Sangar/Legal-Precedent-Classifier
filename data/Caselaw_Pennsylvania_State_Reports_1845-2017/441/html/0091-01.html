Gray, appellant, and one John Stephens were indicted in Delaware County for murder, voluntary manslaughter and conspiracy in connection with the fatal stabbing of Emanuel Brown on January 12, 1969, in Darby Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Each was tried separately and Stephens, who was tried first, was acquitted of all charges. Thereafter, the trial of Gray commenced, with the jury ultimately rendering a verdict of guilty of second degree murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial was made and denied by order of court filed November 24, 1969.

Subsequently, ten to thirteen boys, led by the victim, began to chase and throw bricks at Gray and Stephens. Eventually, a hand-to-hand encounter ensued between the victim and Stephens. According to appellant’s testimony, he later joined the fray and succeeded only in punching the victim while being knocked unconscious by a brick and waking up some distance away.</p>

At the trial of John Stephens, Mr. William Brown testified that Stephens, with something in his hand, was on top of the victim and, as Stephens stepped away, the victim staggered away from Stephens. At the closing of the prosecution’s case, the district attorney stated he did not intend to call Mr. William Brown whereupon the defense requested a bench warrant for Mr. Brown in order to call him. The defense, however, did not call Mr. Brown; nor was a request made to re-open the case to permit his testimony in defense. “Pennsylvania decisions have long recognized that in criminal tri<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>als the prosecution is not absolutely bound to call to the stand all available and material eyewitnesses.

The cousin was not at home, so they proceeded in the direction of the residence of a girl friend. As they walked south on Ash Street, they were accosted by twelve to fifteen members of the “alley gang” led by Brown, who started to pursue them and threw pieces of brick at them. Stephens and Gray walked, sometimes backwards, to a nearby police station, but found it locked since it was Sunday. Some of the pursuers then started to “move in” on Stephens and others on Gray. At this time, Stephens and Gray were standing several feet apart from each other. Gray grabbed two pieces of brick thrown at them, but one of the members of the gang pointed a gun at him and told him to drop them. Gray urged Stephens to run, because “there was too many of them.” Gray then started to run, but was called back by Stephens. A brick then hit Gray in the area of the left ear and knocked him down. After a short interval of darkness, he looked up and saw some of the gang “trying to get Stephens” and Brown with “a hold” on Stephens. Gray was in fear of his life, as well as that of Stephens, and “went back ... to fight . . . for both of our lives” and “to help free Stephens ... so he could run.” He hit Brown with both hands and backed away. He then yelled to Stephens “to come on” but Stephens said “he will give it a go or try”, and he hit Brown and knocked him down. Gray again yelled to Stephens to “come on”, and the “guy” with the gun waved it in <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>his face.

Ewing, </em><a href="/pa/439/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="439 Pa. 88" data-case-ids="1931001" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0088-01">439 Pa. 88</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=264%20A.2d%20661" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="264 A.2d 661">264 A. 2d 661</a> (1970), a jury may reject one part óf a defendant’s testimony and still believe another portion thereof. Given the fact that the jury disbelieved Gray’s denial that he stabbed Brown, as the verdict indicates, it could still believe the remaining portion of his testimony, and if this testimony was sufficient to establish the possibility that the stabbing was committed in a legitimate act of self-defense, as I conclude it--was, then the issue was for the jury under proper instructions from the court. In other words, if there was any téstimony which might lead the jury to conclude that the stabbing occurred in a legitimate act of self-defense, the court was obliged to submit the issue to the jury.
