This occurred without Murray’s consent or the prior issuance of a search warrant. An analysis of the blood sample indicated an alcoholic content of 2.06 milligrams per c.c. The folloAving day, a complaint was filed and arrest warrants issued. Because of Murray’s condition and hospitalization, execution of the warrants was delayed until April 3rd, or until the time Murray was being discharged from the hospital.</p>

California, </em><a href="/us/376/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="376 U.S. 483" data-case-ids="379537" data-case-paths="/us/376/0483-01">376 U.S. 483</a>, 486, <a href="/us/376/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="376 U.S. 483" data-case-ids="379537" data-case-paths="/us/376/0483-01">11 L. Ed. 2d 856</a>, 859 (1964). The problem is how to apply this test in a given set of circumstances, bearing in mind that it is constitutionally mandated by the Fourth Amendment: if not closely connected in time and place with an arrest, a warrantless search is “unreasonable”.</p>

While following the letter of the test as enunciated in <em>Stoner, <a href="/us/376/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="376 U.S. 483" data-case-ids="379537" data-case-paths="/us/376/0483-01">supra,</a> </em>this holding, in my view, distorts its substance.

The blood test was ordered because the investigating officer who extricated appellant from the wreckage found that the appellant “reeked of alcohol”, and that there were beer bottles in his car. As in <em>Schmerber v. California, </em><a href="/us/384/0757-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="384 U.S. 757" data-case-ids="12047531" data-case-paths="/us/384/0757-01">384 U.S. 757</a>, 770, <a href="/us/384/0757-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="384 U.S. 757" data-case-ids="12047531" data-case-paths="/us/384/0757-01">16 L. Ed. 2d 908</a>, 919 (1966), this presented an emergency situation “in which the delay necessary to obtain a [search] warrant, under the circumstances, threatened The destruction of the evidence’.” While in <em>Sehmerber </em>the arrest of the suspect took place at the scene of the accident, the arrest here was deferred because the appellant, like the victim, was seriously injured and in need <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>of immediate medical attention. After receiving the results of tbe blood test the day following the collision, the police officer filed a complaint charging appellant with involuntary manslaughter. Warrants were obtained but, as stated above, were not then served. Until the appellant had recovered sufficiently to be discharged from the hospital, it was deemed unwise to confront him with an arrest warrant. He was placed under arrest as he was being released from the hospital.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

A. Well, it is more or less standard procedure we got, if he is in the hospital under treatment, we can hardly serve the warrant on him and take him down to the prison or to make bail. We have to almost wait until he is discharged before a warrant could be served for his own health. Q. Is it because you didn’t feel you would be able to take him to a magistrate or justice of the peace? A. That’s true, and he was undergoing care at the hospital and the warrant wasn’t served there due to his being under medical attention.”</p>
