In this connection, it is asserted that recovery must be denied as a matter of law because: (a) The publication involved was incapable of the interpretation urged by the plaintiff and was not defamatory as a matter’of law; (b) The plaintiff, admittedly a public figure, failed to show by clear and convincing evidence either falsity or actual malice, and hence permitting recovery against Curtis under the circumstances would violate its rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>

As noted before, Curtis moved both for judgment n.o.v. and a new trial on the libel count. The lower court denied the former, but granted the latter. An appeal from the order denying judgment n.o.v. is specifically permitted by the Act of April 9,1925, P. L. 221, 12 P.S. §682.</p>

Thus the rules governing appeals from orders which simply grant a new trial were held applicable: See, e.g., <em>Phillips v.

After a careful reading of the statute and review of the cases thus far decided thereunder, we conclude the approach adopted in <em>March, </em>supra, thwarts the purpose of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b502-4" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[189,956,1149,1145]]]'>In the situation at issue, there is no final order or judgment as to the moving party from which an appeal could be taken. Because of the favorable action on its motion for a new trial, the denial of its motion for judgment n.o.v. is an interlocutory order, which would not be appealable absent specific statutory authorization therefor. The purpose of the Act of April 9, 1925, supra, was to provide a statutory right of appeal to the moving party from this interlocutory order, because if it were entitled to judgment n.o.v., this would be determinative of the case, justifying a speedy review of this issue. In this respect, it is analogous to the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, §1, 12 P.S. §672, whereby questions of jurisdiction, because of their determinative significance, are appealable although interlocutory. Thus, when the moving party appeals pursuant to the Act of April 9, 1925, supra, it is <em>not </em>appealing from the favorable grant of a new trial, as the Court indicates in <em>March, </em>supra, but it is appealing from the interlocutory decision denying the motion for judgment n.o.v., and the statute so specifically states.</p>
    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.6",502,[191,2113,1146,212]],["BL_503.1",503,[152,348,1152,1099]]]'>The granting of the new trial and the denial of the judgment n.o.v., should be considered independently , of one another.

Thus, if one skirts the judgment n.o.v. issue, as sanctioned in <em>March, </em>supra, the purpose of the statute is emasculated, resulting in a perhaps unwarranted new trial with accompanying expense in money, time and judicial resources. This has been implicitly recognized in several cases: See, e.g., <em>Kuhler v. Harrison Const.

It just says it is a story about Lillian Reis.” “I had to sit down and start writing about Lillian Reis. Now, who was Lillian Reis? Well, I had her introduce herself: ‘This is what they call me.’ ” “The intention in all of this summary of the case, of the Pottsville case, which takes a lot of room because there were a lot of details—and it is still very quick, very sparse—it is just to try to summarize the events which had elevated Lillian as a public figure from notoriety in this country.” “It never stated that she was guilty.” “Anybody who reads this can just—just by reading it, can know that she protests her innocence.” “The whole article is more or less a statement of denial of guilt in this crime, by Lillian.” “What I am saying is that articles are not written so that somebody says, ‘You are guilty,’ and somebody else says, ‘I’m not guilty,’ and that’s an article. All you need is this much space for that, and you get no feeling, no emotion and no depth, and you wouldn’t have any kind of understanding of the characters. I mean that’s the headline; that’s not an article. And that’s exactly what I was trying to dispel with this article.

But “allowance of the defense of truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only false speech will be deterred. Even courts accepting this defense as an adequate safeguard have recognized the difficulties of adducing legal proofs that the alleged libel was true in all its factual particulars. . . . Under such a rule, would-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt- whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so.” <em>New York Times Co. v.

Why did Rich claim that only $3500 was stolen, instead of half a million?

The circulation staff was apparently independent of the editorial staff, and the circulation staff presumably prepared their advertisements from reading the article, which at the time would have been at press. Even if Curtis Circulation were completely independent, the editors of Curtis Publishing Company would at least have known before the issue “hit the streets” that an independent circulation staff had interpreted the article as imputing to Miss Reis the commission of the murders and the assault. If Curtis Circulation were not independent, Curtis Publishing Co. could have controlled their actions and did not, and therefore must have sanctioned them. In both events, they knew the imputations to be false or, at the very least, “entertained serious doubts as to [their] truth.” <em>St. Amant v. Thompson, </em>supra, at 731. Yet they condoned and capitalized on this exploitation of the present plaintiff, to her serious detriment. Such use of calculated falsehood is without the pale of the constitutional privilege given to the media as to public officials and figures, and is sufficient evidence to warrant a jury in finding “actual malice,” i.e., publication with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth or falsity.</p>

      <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>We believe that this case illustrates why a plaintiff, even a public official or public-figure plaintiff, ought <em>not </em>to have to prove falsity to vindicate his or her reputation in a libel suit. To require such a burden in this case would have meant that Miss Reis would have had to adduce clear and convincing evidence that she did <em>not </em>commit the murders and assault imputed to her, as well as actual malice. Such is practically the opposite of what would occur at a criminal trial, and the rule ought not to be different when one is charged with a crime by a member of the media. Common decency would seem to require that the defaming defendant have the burden of substantiating the accusations, especially when, in many instances, a defamed but innocent plaintiff may not be able to adduce more evidence than a denial that he or she committed the offense charged.</p>

She said she did this because “Al” was introduced to her' as a free lance writer by a reporter from the New York Post, by whom Aronowitz was employed at the time. He offered, after several conversations, to assist her with a book, which she herself was then writing about “her side of the story.” Miss Reis admitted that Aronowitz had told her that he had contributed previously an article to the Saturday Evening Post, but she also testified that she thought that he was “free lance” and that anything he wrote about her life and any photographs would be submitted for her advance approval, which was not done. Miss Reis received no compensation for the article. Aronowitz testified that Miss Reis wanted to see and approve what he wrote, but that he told her it was against the rules of the Post, although she could see and approve in advance any book that he might write about her. In the circumstances, the court properly left the issue of consent to the jury’s determination, and they apparently found that Miss Reis did <em>not </em>consent to the publication of the article.</p>

Curtis, without explanation, failed to produce Clay Blair, the Post’s editor at the time the article was written. Instead Curtis produced its editor at the time of trial, William Emerson. Emerson testified that he “never heard any official word of a new policy within the Saturday Evening Post” with respect to sophisticated muck-raking, but had read about it in Newsweek. Emerson also claimed that Blair told him he had been misquoted on the subject.</p>
