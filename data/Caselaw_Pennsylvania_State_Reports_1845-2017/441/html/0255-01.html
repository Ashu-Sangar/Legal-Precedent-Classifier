Knowles, </em><a href="/pa/440/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="440 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="1932163" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0084-01">440 Pa. 84</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20739" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="269 A.2d 739">269 A. 2d 739</a> (1970). The trial court at the PCHA hearing specifically found against Henderson on this issue, and even assuming that Henderson’s own testimony would warrant the opposite conclusion, there is ample evidence in the record, particularly the testimony of Henderson’s trial counsel, to justify the court’s finding.</p>
    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[192,798,1152,1256]]]'>Next it is argued that the plea was unlawfully induced and, in support of this contention, Henderson testified at the PCHA hearing that his trial counsel urged him to plead guilty and implied that if such a plea were not entered, Henderson would probably be sentenced to death, and that his guilty plea was entered with the thought in mind that leniency would result. A plea of guilty which would not have been entered except for the defendant’s desire to avoid a possible death sentence does not necessarily demonstrate that the plea was not the product of a free and rational choice. <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em><a href="/us/400/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="400 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="12045986" data-case-paths="/us/400/0025-01">400 U.S. 25</a>, <a href="/us/400/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="400 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="12045986" data-case-paths="/us/400/0025-01">91 S.

Ct. 1463</a> (1970). Moreover, one of Henderson’s trial counsel testified at the PCHA hearing that on several occasions prior to trial he discussed with Henderson the nature of the charge pending against him, the evidence available in the case, and the advisability of pleading guilty or not guilty. After these discussions and with Henderson evidencing that he understood his choices and the possible consequences, Henderson decided to follow his counsel’s advice and plead guilty. This, without more, demonstrates that the plea was not “unlawfully induced.”</p>
    <p id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.6",320,[189,2063,1148,264]],["BL_321.1",321,[167,344,1149,991]]]'>Next, it is maintained, that Henderson was denied “competent” trial counsel, and this is based solely on the premise that his trial counsel erred in advising Henderson to plead guilty. This is clearly without merit and requires no extended discussion. <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>As pointed out in <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em><a href="/us/397/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="397 U.S. 759" data-case-ids="12058501" data-case-paths="/us/397/0759-01">397 U.S. 759</a>, <a href="/us/397/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="397 U.S. 759" data-case-ids="12058501" data-case-paths="/us/397/0759-01">90 S. Ct. 1441</a> (1970), the decision of counsel to advise his client to plead guilty or not guilty involves difficult judgments which cannot be answered with certitude and is not always expected to withstand retrospective examination in a post-conviction hearing. And, even if it later appears that counsel was mistaken in these judgments, this, in itself, does not establish that he was incompetent or ineffective. If considering all of the circumstances then existing, counsel’s advice “was within the range of competence” reasonably demanded of an attorney in such a situation, the defendant is not denied competent or effective counsel. The record in the present case clearly establishes that counsel’s advice to Henderson to plead guilty was not only justified under the circumstances, but the best possible advice that could be given, and may well have saved Henderson from paying for the crime with his life.</p>
    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[169,1346,1149,762]]]'>Next, it is argued, that since Henderson’s testimony at the Budd trial was given without notice or awareness of his right against self-incrimination, the use of this testimony at his own degree of guilt hearing violated constitutional due process.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> With this we agree. Before Henderson was permitted to testify at the Budd trial, he should have been fully advised and made aware of his constitutional right against self-incrimination. See <em>Grosso v. United States, </em><a href="/us/390/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="390 U.S. 62" data-case-ids="6166543" data-case-paths="/us/390/0062-01">390 U.S. 62</a>, <a href="/us/390/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="390 U.S. 62" data-case-ids="6166543" data-case-paths="/us/390/0062-01">88 S.

And, under the circumstances, it was error to have permitted the evidentiary use of this evidence at his degree of guilt hearing. However, we conclude that the error was harmless.</p>

Moreover, there was other evidence which substantiated the truth of this statement. We are, therefore, persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that, even if the now challenged evidence were excluded at the hearing involved, the adjudication would have been the same. Cf. <em>Chapman v. </em>California, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">386 U.S. 18</a>, <a href="/us/386/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="386 U.S. 18" data-case-ids="6168882" data-case-paths="/us/386/0018-01">87 S.
