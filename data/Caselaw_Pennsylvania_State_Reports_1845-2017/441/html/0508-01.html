    <p id="b571-5" data-blocks='[["BL_571.9",571,[139,843,1151,711]]]'>Appellants were injured in an explosion which occurred at defendant-appellee Clark’s slaughterhouse on November 27, 1989. On the day of the explosion, appellants went to pick up a hog they had taken to Clark’s plant to be butchered. Upon arrival appellants were informed that the hog had not yet been butchered. Appellants entered Clark’s slaughterhouse to wait while the hog was butchered. Clark entered a smoke room and called for appellants to follow. Appellant Shirley had just entered the smoke room, and appellant McCullough was in the doorway of the smoke room, when an explosion occurred which resulted in bodily injury to both appellants.</p>
    <p id="b571-6" data-blocks='[["BL_571.10",571,[140,1564,1150,480]]]'>Appellants instituted suit against appellee Clark, alleging that the explosion was caused by Clark’s negligent lighting of a match, without first ascertaining if there was any gas in the area. Clark joined Ugite L. P. Sendees Div., Inc. as an additional defendant, alleging that Ugite provided him with defective gas tanks, valve stems, etc., and that this defective equipment permitted gas to escape which somehow caused the explosion.</p>

The trial Judge granted the non-<a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>suits, and after argument they were affirmed.

Appellant McCullough testified that he did not <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>see Clark with any matches and lie did not see Clark strike a match.
