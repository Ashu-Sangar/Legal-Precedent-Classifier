Only when consideration is given to the two taxes which exist on liquor and the specific preemption doctrine enacted as part of the Sterling Act, as well as to the Liquor Code, can the conclusion be reached that the City of Philadelphia is barred from authorizing the imposition of a tax on the retail sales of liquor in hotels, restaurants, taverns or clubs.</p>

In <em>Smith, Kline </em>we interpreted “state license fee” to mean only those fees imposed for purposes of raising revenue. By so doing, we ascribed to the General Assembly the same philosophy of preemption, as contained in the various tax-enabling acts, which we have followed in developing our own preemption doctrine in connection with other areas where state legislation and local ordinances must be reconciled, i.e., the philosophy of abstaining from striking down a local ordinance unless there is direct conflict with a state statute. In the area of taxation, that philosophy means that if the local tax is not imposed directly on specific transactions on which the state is dependent for revenues, then the local ordinance poses <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>no real threat to the state’s revenue plans. Consequently, the local tax is permitted. However, when the state decides to enter a specific area for purposes of raising state revenues, a municipal tax in the same area could pose a threat, either by causing a diminution of the taxed activity or by increasing the costs of collection. Consequently, the state has preempted that area insofar as specially directed taxation is concerned.</p>

Consequently, because the state had not preempted the field for purposes of raising revenue, the city was not barred from enacting a tax. In the case of sales of liquor, however, there can be no doubt that the two taxes, one for eighteen percent, the other for six percent, are clearly designed to produce revenue for the state.</p>

In that case the Philadelphia Mercantile License Tax (Ordinance of December 9, 1952) was challenged as violative of the preemption provisions of the Sterling Act when imposed on the gross receipts of holders of state liquor licenses because of the license fees which such licensees are required to pay. However, that case dealt with a gross-receipt tax aimed at business generally, rather than specifically at liquor sales. Moreover, in <em>Cahill </em>we explained that even though the license fees which licensees are required to pay did generate revenue, that revenue was turned over to the municipality rather than being appropriated by the state.

Pursuant thereto, Philadelphia City Council has adopted Ordinance No. 1861, amending Chapter 19-1800 of The Philadelphia Code. This ordinance authorizes the Board of Education to impose for general school purposes a tax, not to exceed ten percent of the sale price, “on the sale in the [School] District of liquor and malt and brewed beverages which are sold or dispensed during the tax year ... by any hotel, restaurant or club, or other person licensed by the Commonwealth” to sell or dispense such beverages. Plaintiffs, being such licensees, contend that the City of Philadelphia has no power to impose such a tax and therefore cannot delegate the authority to do so to the Board of Education.

As to the preemption issue, I agree with the majority that by enacting the Liquor Code, <em>supra, </em>the legislature did not indicate explicitly any intention that its statewide regulation of liquor (or brewed beverages) should preempt the field not only as to local regulation but also as to local taxation; neither do I see any indication that it meant to do so by implication. Moreover, we are not here concerned with a tax which is in reality regulation because so excessive as to be confiscatory. The appellee has not cited, nor does our research reveal, any cases where the doctrine of preemption as it exists in Pennsylvania has been applied so that state regulation of an industry or other area of state interest has the effect of preventing local taxation of the regulated field.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

To my knowledge there has not heretofore existed in Pennsylvania a doctrine of preemption in the field of taxation, nor do I see any basis or need for creating one. Municipal subdivisions in Pennsylvania are creations of the sovereign state; they have no inherent power to tax, but <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>only such as the state gives them. The Pennsylvania legislature has from time to time made specific grants of such power. With respect to the City of Philadelphia, that power has been delegated by the Sterling Act, <em>supra,. </em>That act grants to Philadelphia the power to levy and collect such taxes as it may determine “on persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property”, subject, however, to the exception that the city may not levy “any tax on a privilege, transaction, subject or occupation, or on personal property, which is now or may hereafter become subject to a State tax or license fee”. The stated intent of the legislature in so providing was “to confer upon cities of the first class the power to levy, assess and collect taxes upon any and all subjects of taxation which the Commonwealth has power to tax but which it does not now tax or license. . . .” 53 P.S. §15971 (a). The approach that has traditionally been followed, and which to me seems still to be proper and adequate, is simply to ascertain whether a tax levied by Philadelphia is or is not within its Sterling Act power. In practical effect, the inquiry becomes one of ascertaining whether the city is <em>without </em>such power because the “privilege, transaction, subject or occupation, or . . . personal property” sought to be taxed is already subject to a state tax or license fee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

The appellees do not dispute that the state could tax (and therefore the city can tax) the sale of liquor, malt and brewed beverages as dispensed by state licensees; they assert that since the local tax and the state tax are both upon the sale of liquor, the subject of the taxes is the same, i.e., liquor; and the transaction is the same, i.e., sale of liquor.

As to liquor, malt and brewed beverages, sales at retail are defined so as <em>to include </em>all sales of liquor by Pennsylvania liquor stores (“State Stores”) to any person for any purpose and the sale of malt or brewed beverages from the manufacturer or distributor thereof to any person for any purpose, but <em>to exclude </em>sales of liquor by any person holding a retail liquor license or sales of malt and brewed beverages by a retail dispenser (72 P.S. 3403-2 (j) (7) (d)). The 18% Emergency Liquor Tax, Act of June 9, 1936, Ex. Sess., P.

Moreover, although alcoholic beverages are involved in both sales, the entire context of the sales and, indeed, the form of dispensing of the articles sold, is different in the two situations. The Commonwealth chooses to tax only the liquor sales which are made by its State Stores, which must be by the unopened bottle (47 P.S. §3-305 (d)), and to tax only the brewed beverage sales which are made by the distributors thereof, which must in general be by packages containing not less than 24 containers (47 P.S. §1-102). Neither the liquor sold at State Stores nor the malt or other brewed beverage sold by distributors may be consumed on the premises. In contrast, the proposed city tax is on the sale by licensees which sale must, in the case of liquor, be by “the glass, open bottle or other container, in any mixture” (47 P.S. §4-406 (d)) for consumption on the premises and, in the case of malt or other brewed beverages, by individual containers for consumption on the premises, or, if to “take out”, in quantities not in excess of 144 ounces (two “six packs”) in a single sale to one person (47 P.S. §1-102).</p>
