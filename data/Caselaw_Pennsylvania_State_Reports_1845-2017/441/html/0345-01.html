Groh, in an action in trespass. Appellee’s decedent was foreman of the maintenance crew at the Anchor Finishing &amp; Dyeing Company located at Adams Avenue and Leiper Street in Philadelphia. Groh had held this job for two years, when on the morning of May 29,1961, he was assigned the job of removing the rainspouting on the outside of the building facing Adams Avenue. Sunning parallel to the building along Adams Avenue and six feet, three inches from it was appellant’s transmission line. The lowest line was about forty feet above the street, and the highest line was about two feet below the windowsills of the fourth floor of the building.</p>

The window was opened, and decedent straddled the sill, sitting beneath the opened portion of the window. One leg was outside the window; the other was inside and next to some pipes. Decedent leaned under the sash and outside the building, and he then disconnected a ten-foot <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>section of the rainspont and maneuvered it so as to bring it under the opened portion of the window and into the building. At this point there was a sound and a flash. Decedent was badly burned and died on June 2, 1961.</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[183,628,1151,755]]]'>Appellee filed a complaint in trespass which stated that the action was being brought under the Wrongful Death Act, Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, as amended, 12 P.S. §1602, and Pa. E. O. P. 2202(a). On May 22,1967, after the trial had begun, the court below permitted appellee to amend the complaint to state a cause of action on behalf of decedent’s estate under the Survival Act, Act of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, as amended, 20 P.S. §320.601. The jury returned a lump sum verdict of $80,000 which the court molded so as to allocate $65,500 to the Wrongful Death Action and $14,500 to the Survival Action. After denial of motions for a new trial and judgment n.o.v. by the court en banc, this appeal was taken.</p>

On direct examination the expert, Dr. Kaplan, testified that the National Bureau of Standards Electrical Safety Code was a commonly accepted standard of good practice and that it recommended an eight foot clearance from the side of a building for 13.2 KY transmission lines. On cross-examination the witness admitted that of the three wires malting up this 13.2 KY line the voltage from <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>any one wire to ground was between 7500 and 7800 volts and that under the literal wording of the National Electric Safety Code a conductor of such voltage could be within three feet of the wall. In spite of the literal wording of the Code, the witness stated: “A. I feel that, specifically, the code intended a clearance of eight feet in the case of a 13.2 voltage line, with voltage line-to-line (as opposed to line-to-ground), what would be called in the industry a thirteen-thousand-volt line. I know of no one in the operation of the industry who would refer to these lines as 7500 volts, and in view of my understanding of the industry I think the 13.2 thousand volt spacing is what the code intended it to be. And that is what should have been used in this case.” And later: “A. It seems to me that from reading some of the discussions that entered into the setting up of this code it was intended that reasonable good space should be maintained for the purpose of safety and it seems to take a line of thirteen thousand volts and put it within three feet of a window doesn’t seem to me that would be very safe practice. Q. Well, don’t you agree with what the table says? Doesn’t it refer to conductors and not to lines, this Table 4? A. You are absolutely correct there. There is no indication as to whether it is from line to line or from line to ground. According to this, it can come within a three-foot clearance, but as a matter of purely professional experience, I don’t think it would be safe.” And finally: “Q. At the time of the accident, was the wire that was six feet, three inches from the side of the building a safe installation or unsafe within the standards, judged by the standards at that time? A. I think, within the intent of the National Safety Code, it was too close in the absence of any guards or protection.”</p>

On redirect examination, however, appellee introduced a statement which Schmieder had made and signed on September 3, 1964 in which he stated that he had never been specifically warned about those wires. While this prior inconsistent statement could not be used as substantive evidence of the truth of the matter stated, it could be used to impeach the witness’ credibility. <em>Bizich v.

      <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>Appellant argues that there were two entirely safe methods of proceeding and that decedent was contributorily negligent as a matter of law because he disregarded these and chose a perilous course. It points out that a rope could have been tied to the rainspout and the spout lowered to the ground or pulled up to the roof. While appellant states that, “This would have eliminated any possibility of the rainspout’s inadvertently contacting defendant’s wire,” there is nothing in the record to support the conclusion that this method was any safer than the one decedent tried. It also states that decedent could quickly (five minutes) and easily have removed the entire center section of the window which maneuver would have given him more room in which to work and would have eliminated the necessity of working in an awkward position. Decedent’s son, however, testified that the window could not have been taken out in five minutes and that only about half the window, from side to side, could be removed. Therefore, it was for the jury to evaluate decedent’s decision not to pursue that course.</p>

The accident occurred May 29, 1961; the initial complaint was filed on August 24, 1961, and the motion to amend was filed on May 22, 1967, long after the two year statute of limitations on the Survival Action had expired.</p>

In that case, leave to amend a complaint in order to bring upon the record the administrator of the estate of the deceased victim of the tortious act there involved so that the personal representative might claim damages under the Survival Act was denied because the statute of limitations had run. The action had been instituted by the father of the deceased minor victim in the capacity of trustee ad litem for those entitled to damages under the Wrongful Death Act (see Rule 2202(b) Pa. R. C. P.), and damages were claimed only for wrongful death. An administrator of the deceased minor’s estate, for the purpose of pressing a claim under the Survival Act, had never been a party to the record before the statutory limitation had expired.

And, since the action was instituted within six months of her son’s death, she was also exclusively entitled as the administratrix of his estate to maintain the suit for damages for his wrongful death: see Rule 2202(a), (b) and (c) Pa. R. C. P. Thus, she was in court timely in an action (see Rule 213(e) Pa. R. C.

In this context it is clear that the inclusion of the survival claim imposed no new burdens on the appellant. And, the appellant can hardly maintain that the survival claim caught it by surprise in view of the allegations of decedent’s pain and suffering contained in the eighth paragraph of appellee’s complaint, which should certainly have alerted appellant to the possibility of a survival action claim in appellant’s suit. In fact, the dual capacity of tbe appellee in this case should have rendered unreasonable any assumption other than that she intended to press both the wrongful death and the survival claims. As in <em>Schwab, </em>the appellant here knew well that it was faced with a lawsuit timely filed by an individual qualified to press both the wrongful death and the survival action claims; as in <em>Schwab, </em>the appellant was confronted with a complaint which, while not spelling out the statutory basis for the survival claim, did contain reference to damages which were recoverable only in a survival action; and as in <em>Schwab, </em>

Without belaboring the point, the plaintiffs decedent was permanently employed at the building where the unfortunate accident occurred as foreman of the building maintenance crew. Thus he was no stranger to the premises; he knew of the existence of the wires, which were clearly visible; he was specifically told by his superior to “be careful about the wires” j<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> in straddling the window sill as he did decedent assumed an unnecessarily awkward position in seeking to get at the drain-spout; he avoided using at least one obviously safe way <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>of bringing the spout into the building.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_2" id="ref_footnote_4_2">2</a> The presumption of due care to which a decedent is properly entitled does not serve to impose liability in the face of this kind of a showing.
