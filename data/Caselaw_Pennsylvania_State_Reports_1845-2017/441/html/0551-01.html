The complaint alleged, inter alia, that Wilbur negligently operated his automobile so as to cause it to collide with and injure the minor plaintiff. Defendant Wilbur filed an amended answer containing new matter joining the minor plaintiffs father, Michael Reardon, as an additional defendant. <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>Wilbur, iu Ms amended answer, alleged that Reardon’s failure to properly supervise the activities of the minor plaintiff and to provide for her safety at the time of the accident was a concurrent cause of her injury. Reardon thereupon filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to the amended new matter, alleging that the facts stated therein were insufficient to state a cause of action against him. The Court below sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the amended answer containing the aforesaid new matter. From this Order, Wilbur took this appeal.</p>
