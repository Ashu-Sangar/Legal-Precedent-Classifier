In one of these altercations, Frank J. Ament, Jr., a white boy fifteen years of age, suffered contusions of the face and head and a stab wound, in the back from a “sharp pointed instrument.” The last mentioned wound perforated one of the main arteries <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>in the body, the subclavian artery, resulting in massive hemorrhaging in the right pleural cavity and caused almost instant death. Ben David Darden, Jr., born on June 18, 1952, was arrested and charged with Ament’s murder. After indictment, he was tried before a jury and convicted of murder in the second degree. This appeal is from the judgment of sentence imposed in the lower court.</p>

About 8:50 p.m., when they sought to return, readmittance was refused at the main entrance, resulting in an altercation between the group and the ticket takers.

The police were alerted to the above trouble, <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>and when the fighting started on the parking lot after the conclusion of the game, several officers were on the scene very quickly. Three black youths were observed running away, and Ament was found on the ground fatally wounded.</p>

However, the police learned that Darden was also a participant in this particular fight, and officers were dispatched to look for him. One of these officers visited Darden’s residence, but he was not at home. The officer talked with Darden’s mother and requested that she phone the police when he returned.</p>

About 11:45 p.m., on February 9th, he was questioned by a lieutenant of the City Police Department assigned to and in charge of the Youth Special Service Division. Three other police officers, one of whom was a black man, and an assistant district attorney were present at the time. Darden was without counsel. This questioning continued until 1 a.m.</p>

The lieutenant then read to Darden from a printed card a warning of all of his constitutional rights required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.

In every instance his reply was, “Yes.” After the reading of the warning of all rights was completed, Darden was <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>again asked if he understood his rights, and again he replied in the affirmative and said that he was willing to answer questions. The questioning that followed dealt with the trouble outside the gymnasium following the game, as well as that at the main entrance with the ticket takers during the game. As the questioning progressed, one of the ticket takers appeared in the room briefly and identified Darden as one of those involved in the fracas at the entrance to the gymnasium following half-time. Since the questioning officer was still under the belief that Ament’s injuries resulted solely from being struck with a wine bottle, the questioning did not deal with a stabbing or knives. In fact such were not mentioned. Darden denied that he hit Ament with a bottle and denied knowledge of the identity of the person who did.</p>

After this questioning proceeded for some minutes, the detectives involved were informed for the first time that an examination of Ament’s clothing indicated that he had been stabbed, and the questioning then focused on this aspect. Darden then admitted being in the fight Avith Ament and using a knife. He said that one of his friends was fighting with Ament and hit him over the head with a bottle. Darden then started “smnging it [the knife] Avildly” and “didn’t intend to cut him <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>[Ament]” but “somehow cut the boy,” and then he noticed blood on the knife. He also informed the police of the identity of the boy to whom he had given the knife after the fight. A female employee of the district attorney’s office stenographically recorded Darden’s statement, and after it was typewritten it was given to Darden to read. About 3:45 a.m. he signed his signature on each page thereof.</p>

He also described in detail the circumstances of his questioning by the police officers. His description thereof did not vary significantly from that of the Commonwealth witnesses, except he did say that the second period of questioning during which the written statement was obtained consumed “maybe two hours.” Significantly, Darden did not deny that he was given the warning of his <em>“Miranda” </em>rights before the questioning began and, more significantly, he did not say or indicate that he did not understand this warning. He admitted that he was given the challenged typewritten statement to read before he signed it, and said that while he didn’t “read everything”, it did not contain any words that he didn’t <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>understand and he didn’t ask anyone to explain any of the words.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

We cannot agree.</p>
    <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.6",110,[187,1066,1148,921]]]'>It is unquestionably correct that unless Darden was aware of all of his constitutional rights before the police questioning began, which induced the challenged incriminating evidence, evidentiary use thereof was constitutionally proscribed. <em>Miranda v.
