While the foregoing cases involved personal rather than real property, as in the case here, this, to us, is of no legal significance. Is there any difference or legal significance between 'that bundle of <em>rights </em>which we call <em>ownership </em>of real property and that termed <em>ownership </em>of personal property? Can it be fairly said that <em>active use </em>is consciously calculated into the ad valorem property tax when, for example, the measure of the property tax of a building suitable to use as a department store, <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>but which is empty and not so used, is the same as that of the thriving Wanamaker’s, namely, the fair market value?</p>
    <p id="b635-6" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[145,493,1150,530]]]'>The lower court attempted to distinguish certain of the use tax cases cited hereinbefore, especially <em>Henneford v.

    <p id="b635-8" data-blocks='[["BL_635.7",635,[149,1372,1152,970]],["BL_636.1",636,[207,331,1147,1403]]]'>The plaintiff argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the tax was repugnant to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment because there were many domestic yachts whose use was identical to his which escaped taxation. Important for our purposes is what Chief Justice White had to say in upholding the tax about “use” as the basis for taxation: “[I]t is not ownership but the election during the taxing period of the owner to take advantage of one of the elements which are involved in ownership, the right to use which is the subject upon which the statute places the excise duty. In this view the fact of use, not its extent or its frequency, becomes the test, as distinguished from mere ownership, for that in the statutory sense could exist without use having taken place. . . . Let it be conceded that the ownership of property includes the right to use, plainly we think, as use and ownership are distinguished one from the other in the provision, the word ‘use’ as there em<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>ployed means more than the mere privilege of using which the owner enjoys, and relates to its primary signification, as defined by Webster; ‘The act of employing anything or of applying it to one’s service; the state of being so employed or applied’. If the use which arises from the fact of ownership without more was what the statute proposed, then it is inconceivable why the difference between use and ownership was marked in the provision and made the basis of the tax which it imposed. While this construction in this case leads to the same conclusion as does that which the court below affixed to the statute, that is, that it taxed the privilege of use, or, in other words the potentiality of using involved in ownership, inherently there is this fundamental difference between the' interpretation we give and that which the lower court adopted, since the privilege of use is purely passive (or subjective), a right which necessarily pertains to ownership and must exist where there is ownership, as one may not obtain ownership without acquiring the privileges of use which ownership gives. The other, on the contrary, that is, use in the statutory sense, although it arises from ownership, is active (objective), that is, it is the outward and distinct exercise of a right which ownership confers but which would not necessarily be exerted by the mere fact of ownership.” <a href="/us/232/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="232 U.S. 261" data-case-ids="3671893" data-case-paths="/us/232/0261-01">232 U.S. at 280-81</a>.</p>

In Billings, what was levied upon was the <em>“outward and distinct exercise of a right which ownership confers hut which would not necessarily he exerted hy the mere fact of ownership”. </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <a href="/us/232/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="232 U.S. 261" data-case-ids="3671893" data-case-paths="/us/232/0261-01">232 U.S. at 281</a>.

      <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>It can be conceded without fatality to the appellants’ case that the ad valorem property tax is bottomed on factors which include the intrinsic element of use. “ ‘We have defined market value as the price which a purchaser willing but not obliged to buy, would pay an owner, willing but not obliged to sell, taking into consideration all uses to which the property is adapted and might in reason be applied’.” <em>Flamingo Apartments, Inc. v.

But, it is submitted, this latter element of use is what the <em>Billings </em>court termed “purely passive”. There still remained that active exercise of the right, “that state of being so employed or applied”, which was held taxable to Mr. Billings. In this case, the Philadelphia School Board has gone and done likewise. While economically the incidence of the tax is on the property itself, its legal incidence is on the privilege of using, making it a true excise tax.</p>

Each taxpayer, no matter how great or small, has a right to demand that his property shall be assessed upon the basis of a uniform valuation of other properties belonging to the same class and within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax .... It will not do to assess farm lands at one-fifth their actual value, dwelling houses at one-third, manufacturing establishments at one-half, and coal lands at full value. The Constitution says the valuation must be uniform on the same class of taxable subjects and <em>real estate is a taxable subject of a particular class </em>. . . hence the rule of uniformity must be applied to all kinds of real estate as a class.” <em>Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Co.’s Tax Assessment (No. 1), </em>supra, at 243-48, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.%20429" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="73 A. 429">73 Atl. at 430-32</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> (Emphasis added.)</p>

However, it is one thing to talk about the freedom of choice of a potential luxury yacht owner to buy his tangible personal property overseas, and quite another to speak of a major department store’s freedom to elect to use its real property, located in Philadelphia’s central business district, for commercial purposes. Wanamaker’s commercial use of its property is the only realistic economic use to which that property can be put. The surrounding land is used for department stores or office buildings. Should Wanamaker’s convert to a warehouse, or a manufacturing concern, or an office building, it would still be subject to the tax. The only way Wanamaker’s can <em>choose </em>to avoid the tax is to not open for business, take down its building, or sell its land. Beyond question, a tax on Wanamaker’s commercial use of its land is a tax on ownership, and hence a property tax, as defined by the United States Supreme Court in the <em>Dawson </em>case.</p>

      <em>City of Detroit </em>is inapplicable for other reasons. The Michigan statute imposed a tax on private lessees and users of tax exempt property for private profit. The taxes due were the personal obligation of the private lessee or user, and the owner was not liable for their payment. Here, the Business Use and Occupancy Tax applies to owner-occupiers as well as tenants, and owners are secondarily liable. Also, the Michigan tax was compensatory. The tax sought to equalize the tax burden between tenants who leased from private owners and tenants who leased from tax exempt owners.

The standard of measurement is not more related to business use or occupancy than it is to residential or any other use or occupancy. In fact, the tax is measured without regard to whether the particular occupancy is an economic one. What the standard of measuring the tax is directly related to is the ownership interest in property not produced by or dependent upon the exercise of the privilege said to be taxed. Indeed, even to speak of an owner’s ‘privilege’ of occupying his real estate is itself a confusion. If someone owns real estate, he has a right to occupy it.
