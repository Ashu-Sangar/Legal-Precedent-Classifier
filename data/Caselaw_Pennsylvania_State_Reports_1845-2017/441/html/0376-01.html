The remarks made by appellant, the Commission found, “were critical of personnel and policies of the public assistance administration of the York County Board”. The dissenting Commissioner noted that “appellant urged public assistance recipients to get on caseworkers’ backs and demand their rights; he stated some caseworkers failed to accord recipients dignity and inform them of their rights of appeal and ... he exhorted recipients, quoting Frederick Douglass, to ‘agitate, agitate, agitate.’&gt;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">

The importance of the First Amendment was perhaps most eloquently stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis: “Those who won our independence believed that . . . the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government. . . . [T]hey knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination ; that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies; and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the power of reason as applied through public discussion, they eschewed silence coerced by law —-the argument of force in its worst form. Becognizing the occasional tyrannies of governing majorities, they amended the Constitution so that free speech and assembly should be guaranteed.” <em>Whitney v.

If the Majority’s “near-absolute freedom-of-speech approach” be carried to its logical conclusion, it could conceivably create such lack of public confidence in one or more Departments and such bitter resentments and divisions as to not only (I repeat) greatly impair the efficiency and existence of that Department (or Departments), but also could jeopardize the effective operation and functioning of our entire Government. An employee of the Commonwealth, working in a sensitive area of the business of his Governmental Department, is—and quite properly should be —subject to much greater restriction, in regard to (legislatively unsolicited) criticism of the Department which he purports to be serving, than a person who has no connection therewith.
