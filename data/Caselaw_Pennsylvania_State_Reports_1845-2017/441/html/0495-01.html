The complaint continued by stating that appellant had not yet been brought to trial for these crimes and was continuing to violate The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act and other laws of Pennsylvania. Further, the. complaint asserted that appellant “. . . has openly, publicly, repeatedly, consistently, persistently and intentionally sold, distributed, consigned and possessed with intent to sell, resell, distribute and consign pictures, posters, figures, designs, drawings, advertisements, emblems, insignia, ensigns, merchandise and other clothing, wearing apparel and publications, at his place of business, The <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>Atlantis, all of which are obscene.” Finally, the complaint alleged that The Atlantis constituted a public nuisance.</p>

The record is utterly silent as to what occurred in the interim to require the Commonwealth and the Secretary of Health suddenly to seek an ex parte injunction without notice on December 16,1970. The complaint baldly asserts that the violations of The Drug, Device and .Cosmetic Act were continuing; yet not one shred of evidence is offered to support that assertion regarding appellant’s conduct during November and December.</p>
    <p id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.6",562,[206,1441,1150,704]]]'>Even if the complaint made out a case demanding the issuance of an ex parte preliminary injunction, we would still vacate the decree now before us, because it is void on its face. The injunction enjoins appellant from violating “. . . all other laws of the Commonwealth.” It is well established that equity will not act merely to enjoin the commission of a crime, although the criminal nature of defendant’s conduct will not bar equity from assuming jurisdiction if that conduct has interféred with plaintiff’s individual property rights. See, e.g., <em>Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Bravo Enterprises, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/428/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="428 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1912378" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0350-01">428 Pa. 350</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=237%20A.2d%20342" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="237 A.2d 342">237 A. 2d 342</a> (1968).</p>

See Act of September 26, 1961, P. L. 1664, §21, 35 P.S. §780-21. That provision in no way provides a chancellor with a carte blanche to enjoin someone either temporarily or permanently from violating “all other laws of the Commonwealth”. The Legislature defines crimes and fixes varying penalties for criminal conduct, depending on the severity of the crime and the degree and value of the public interest to be protected. It is not for courts of equity to summarily superimpose broad injunctions on this criminal legislation, thereby subjecting defendants to possible summary contempt proceedings in addition to the penalties fixed by the legislative branch.
