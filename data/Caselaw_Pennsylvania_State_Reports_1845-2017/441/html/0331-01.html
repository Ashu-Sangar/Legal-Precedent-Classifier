The crack was described as being one inch wide, one inch deep and six to seven inches long. There were a total of three cracks in the sidewalk.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> It was a bright, sunny day and there was neither pedestrian nor vehicular traffic in the area, nor were there any obstructions or distractions to prevent Mrs. Lang from keeping her attention on where she was walking or from seeing the defect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">**</a> The lower Court held that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.

I would say if you walked with your eyes on the street in front of you, if a person walked that way looking to the walk, you would be able to see it. But a normal person don’t walk that way. Q. Well, how did you walk? A. I walked with my head erect looking in the direction I was going. Q. You were not looking where your feet was going; is that right? A. That is right.”</p>
