Both properties are located within 1500 feet of appellee’s coal processing plant, which consists of crushers, conveyors, vibrating equipment, screens and picking tables. The plant has been operated by the appellee and its predecessor since 1948, and the appellants realized at the times of their respective purchases that the properties were located in an area generally used for industrial and coal mining purposes. As a result of complaints, appellee installed in 1962 an air cleaner, thermodryer and coal washing unit, and soon thereafter a dust collector and covered coal conveyor. Notwithstanding these measures, the appellee’s coal cleaning operation has contributed to air pollution affecting the properties of appellants from 1962 to the time of trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The appellee has employed specialists in the field of fuel and combustion air pollution who have conducted numerous tests. They have recommend<a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>ed tbe installation of a certain type of wet scrubber on the thermodryer as a means of reducing emission of dust from that source. This equipment will cost $20,-000 to $30,000. The appellee has adopted the recommendation and “intends to either discontinue using the thermodryer or install the wet scrubber.” “With the installation of the wet scrubber, defendant company will have done everything now known and economically feasible to eliminate any source of air pollution.” The cleaning plant is an essential part of appellee’s mining operations, and appellee is not in default as to compliance with any requirements of the Air Pollution Control Commission.</p>

An actor’s conduct is unreasonable under §822 of the <em>Restatement, </em>unless the utility of his conduct outweighs the gravity of the harm. <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>§826 (1939). Our Court has stated that the actor’s conduct lacks utility if it is economically and technically possible to correct the harm and such steps are not taken. <em>Burr v.

Since such facts were requisite to show that an invasion was unreasonable and they were not included in the findings of fact by the trial court, it can only be concluded that the appellants did not carry their burden of proof. It is clear, however, that the learned trial judge had before him sufficient facts to justify the legal conclusion that the invasion was not unreasonable: the major improvements in 1962 and the continuing attention to the problem thereafter, culminating in a decision to employ apparatus whereby the appellee “will have done everything now known and economically feasible to eliminate any source of air pollution.”</p>
    <p id="b659-4" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[140,1158,1150,818]]]'>Since, as indicated above, the posture of this case at the time of decision was an action at law for damages tried without a jury, the court was obligated to render a verdict for either the plaintiffs or defendant; the injunctive or conditional forms of equity decrees were not available. It is clear that the verdict for the appellee was based in part, at least, on its announced intention at trial to install a wet scrubber or abandon the thermodryer. Because the verdict was based in part on an expectation, however, the judgment thereon is not to be considered <em>res judicata </em>as to any damage subsequent to the date of the verdict in the event the appellee has not subsequently fulfilled that expectation or discontinued what otherwise might be considered an unreasonable invasion of the appellants’ property.</p>

Appellee deduces that these findings coalesce to produce a finding of fact that the invasion was not substantial. Based upon the abbreviated record presented and without opportunity to review the complete testimony, this seems to be a reasonable reading of the adjudication.
