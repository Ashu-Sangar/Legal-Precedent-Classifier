We agree with the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>County (Commonwealth Docket) that Section 15 as enacted, violates Article III, Section 32 and Article II, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.

    <p id="b357-3" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[200,616,1152,1083]]]'>This case arose out of the following circumstances. In 1968, the Life Fellowship of Pennsylvania, a professional association of chiropractors, applied to the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners for approval of a two-day educational conference, which Life Fellowship proposed to hold. The reason for conducting the conference was to satisfy the requirements of Section 15 of the Act. Section 15 provides in pertinent part: “No applicant for registration shall be granted a registration for the ensuing license year unless the applicant shall furnish to the board satisfactory evidence that he has attended not less than one two-day educational conference by the Pennsylvania Chiropractic Society, Inc., during the current license year, or that he has attended an equivalent educational conference during the same period. An equivalent educational conference shall be one approved or ratified by the board as meeting the educational and professional requirements of the profession.” Act of August 10, 1951, P.

Life Fellowship appealed to the Dauphin County Court sitting as the Commonwealth Court, which held that the references to the Society made the statute a special law in violation of Art. Ill, Section 32, and also that the automatic approval of conferences held by the Society was an unlawful delegation of legislative power under Article II, Section 1. The Commonwealth Court, however, concluded that the statute would be valid if all references to the Society were stricken. It therefore dismissed the appeal, but observed that the Board must now promulgate additional rules relative to the approv<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>al or disapproval of conferences so as to comply with Section 15 after severance of the offending language.</p>

Milk Control Commission of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/341/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="341 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1204497" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0153-01">341 Pa. 153</a>, 162, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.2d%20868" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="18 A.2d 868">18 A. 2d 868</a> (1941). Our basic guideline in approaching these questions, as the Court recognizes, is the Statutory Construction Act, Section 55 of which provides in part as follows: “The provisions of every law shall be severable. If any provision of a law is found by a court of record to be unconstitutional and void, the remaining provisions of the law shall, nevertheless, remain valid, unless the court finds the valid provisions of the law are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision, that it cannot be presumed the Legislature would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.” Act of May 28, 1937, P.

There remained, however, the phrase “an equivalent educational conference”. The court below recognized that this was awkward, since the quoted phrase had meaning only with reference to the deleted <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>reference to the Society. Indeed, as the majority opinion indicates, an “equivalent” conference is unintelligible standing without the stricken reference to the Society. It is, in the words of the Statutory Construction Act, “inseparably connected with” the reference to conferences of the Society. The solution, however, is neither a rewriting of the section, which the Court properly declines to do, or holding the entire section void, which is what the Court does, but merely the striking of the clause requiring attendance at an “equivalent” conference, together with the adjective “equivalent” in the following sentence. If this were done, the remaining portion of the first paragraph of Section 15 would read as follows: “No applicant for registration shall be granted a registration for the ensuing license yéar unless the applicant shall furnish to the board satisfactory evidence that he has attended not less than one two-day educational conference during the current license year. An educational conference shall be one approved or ratified by the board as meeting the educational and professional requirements of the profession.” I am satisfied that the statute in this form, after deletion of the offending portions, would not ignore, or subvert, the purpose of the legislature in enacting the statute. Taken as a whole, Section 15 reflects a general legislative intent to insure the exposure of registered chiropractors to an educational conference which will satisfy certain requirements established by the Board. Set against this basic legislative purpose of Board certification pursuant to a legislative standard, the statutory reference to conferences held specifically by the Society—and the corollary to that reference, “equivalent” conferences—is but incidental. Thus there is no valid basis for concluding that the indicated words and phrases are not properly separable from the statute as a whole.</p>

      <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>The cases relied upon by the Court are, in my opinion, better authority for the position here espoused. Thus, in <em>Rieck-McJunkin Dairy Co. v. Milk Control Commission, </em>supra, the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice, later Chief Justice Steen, said: “Even in the absence of a statutory declaration, it has never been considered a barrier to the application of the principle of severability that the valid and invalid provisions are contained in the same paragraph or section of the act, the only question being whether or not they are essentially and inseparably connected in substance: [citations omitted]. . . .” <a href="/pa/341/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="341 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1204497" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0153-01">341 Pa. at 162, 163</a>. Again, in <em>Rutenkerg v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/329/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="329 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1181393" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0026-01">329 Pa. 26</a>, at page 39, the test of severability was restated thus: “. . . after the invalid portion of the act has been stricken out, whether that which remains is self-sustaining and is capable of separate enforcement without regard to that portion of the statute which has been cast aside. If this be true the statute should be sustained to the extent of that which remains.” That which would remain of Section 15, paragraph one, as above quoted, is both self-sustaining and capable of separate enforcement without regard to the deleted portion. Nor do I consider that <em>Saulsbury v. Bethlehem Steel Co., </em><a href="/pa/413/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="413 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="1888552" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0316-01">413 Pa. 316</a>, 320-21, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.2d%20664" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="196 A.2d 664">196 A. 2d 664</a> (1964), also relied on by the majority, compels a different result. The statutory provisions there involved, unlike those in this case, were indeed “so interwoven as to be inseparable”. The judicial surgery here suggested, on the other hand, would not be so radical as to eviscerate the statute; rather, it would save the legislative purpose and directive as a viable instrument for regulation of the chiropractic profession.</p>

I am unable to agree. The Court has previously held that a statutory direction that the Superintendent of Public Instruction pass on the merits of petitions for the creation of independent school districts “from an educational standpoint” was not unconstitutionally vague or uncertain. <em>Weaverland Ind. School District Case, </em><a href="/pa/378/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="378 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1250857" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0449-01">378 Pa. 449</a>, 455, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.2d%20812" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="106 A.2d 812">106 A. 2d 812</a> (1954). The standard here in issue would certainly be no less precise than that employed in the <em>Weaverland </em>case. It would be reasonably related to the objects of the legislature, would militate against arbitrary or capricious action by the Board and permit judicial review of the Board’s action.

I would therefore indicate disapproval of the adjudication of the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners to the extent that it was based on the provisions of Section 15 of the Chiropractic Registration Act of 1951 as originally enacted and prior to severance of the unconstitutional portions. Accordingly, I would affirm the order of the Superior Court, which affirmed the order of the Court of Common Pleas dismissing the appeal from the State Board adjudication.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
