Appellant was indicted for murder and voluntary manslaughter by a grand jury in September, 1966. Eighteen months later, on March 11, 1968, appellant’s case was listed for trial. Prior to trial, appellant’s counsel filed numerous pretrial applications for relief including an application to quash the indictment for failure to af<a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>ford Mm a speedy trial and a challenge of the array of jurors.</p>

He first repeats his allegations that he was denied a speedy trial and that he was denied an impartially selected jury. In arguing that he was denied a speedy trial, appellant emphasizes the twenty-one month delay between his arrest and trial and contends that all of this delay was the fault of the Commonwealth. We do not agree with appellant’s view of the facts. We believe that much of the delay between his arrest and trial was of his own maMng.</p>

An appeal was taken to this Court and was quashed by per curiam order on November 28, 1967, on the grounds that an appeal was premature. <em>Com. ex rel. Bittner v.

    <p id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.6",282,[196,671,1148,860]]]'>Each petition necessitated an answer by the prosecution and many required the holding of evidentiary hearings or oral argument before resolution. In considering whether appellant was afforded a speedy trial, it must be remembered that “the essential ingredient [of the constitutional right to a speedy trial] is orderly expedition and not mere speed”. <em>Smith v. United States, </em><a href="/us/360/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="360 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="8890" data-case-paths="/us/360/0001-01">360 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/360/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="360 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="8890" data-case-paths="/us/360/0001-01">79 S. Ct. 991</a> (1959). Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Stukes, </em><a href="/pa/435/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="435 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="1924324" data-case-paths="/pa/435/0535-01">435 Pa. 535</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=257%20A.2d%20828" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="257 A.2d 828">257 A. 2d 828</a> (1969). As we said in <em>Stubes, </em>“In large measure because of the many procedural safeguards provided an accused, the ordinary procedures for criminal prosecution are designed to move at a deliberate pace”. (At page 545.) In view of the many procedural steps followed by the appellant, we believe he received an orderly, expeditious disposition of the charges against him.</p>
    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.7",282,[193,1544,1145,688]]]'>Appellant’s contention that the court below committed reversible error in refusing appellant’s challenge to the array of the jury panel is actually a contention that the statute governing jury selection is unconstitutional. The challenge is directed specifically to Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of May 11, 1925, P. L. 561, §§6, 7, 17 P.S. 1276, 1277, which require the jury commission to select jurors from a “li^t of taxables”. It is appellant’s contention that this statute discriminates against nonproperty holders since the holders of personal or real property are, according to the appellant, the only group “assessed for taxation” in the language of Section 6.</p>
    <p id="b282-7" data-blocks='[["BL_282.8",282,[193,2252,1144,101]],["BL_283.1",283,[175,354,1149,597]]]'>A three-judge statutory count in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>recently considered and rejected a constitutional attack on the same statute. <em>Clark v. Ellenbogen, </em><a href="/f-supp/319/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="319 F. Supp. 623" data-case-ids="3178904" data-case-paths="/f-supp/319/0623-01">319 F. Supp. 623</a> (W.D. Pa. 1970). We need not decide the question. Although appellant raised the matter pretrial, the issue was not presented in the post-trial motions and the court en banc, consequently, had no opportunity to review and decide the question. We have long held that where the court below has not had proper opportunity to decide a question, we will not decide it on appeal. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/439/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="439 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1931004" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0381-01">439 Pa. 381</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20756" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="266 A.2d 756">266 A. 2d 756</a> (1970), and cases cited therein.</p>
    <p id="b283-3" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[176,964,1148,648]]]'>Appellant also argues -that -the court committed reversible error in repeatedly stating in its charge and in its answer to a question from the jury that the jury could infer first degree murder from the fatal use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body. The appellant does not contend that this statement of the law is incorrect. It is, instead, his contention that the repeated use (eight references, six in the charge and two in the answer to the jury’s question) constitutes “a definition in law and imposed upon the appellant the burden of proving qualifying circumstances, thereby destroying his presumption of innocence.”</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[177,1622,1149,537]]]'>It should be noted that no objection was made to the charge immediately after it was given, but a general exception was recorded after the jury retired. The first specific objection was noted by defense counsel only after the trial court’s response to the jury’s question. This would indicate that the appellant’s counsel noticed no undue emphasis in the charge when he first heard it. The instructions to the jury “must be read and considered in their entirety”. <em>Commonwealth v. Lopinson, </em><a href="/pa/427/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="427 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1910385" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0284-01">427 Pa. 284</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=234%20A.2d%20552" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="234 A.2d 552">234 A. 2d 552</a> (1967).</p>
