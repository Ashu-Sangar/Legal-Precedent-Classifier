Viola’s will, in our judgment, undoubtedly contains a residuary clause, and this is particularly true when the testamentary language is considered in the light and construction of clause (10) and its application or inapplication. The will (we repeat) specifically states: “I give, devise and bequeath <em>all </em>of the <em>rest, residue </em>and <em>remainder </em>of my estate as follows: . . . .” We believe, that testatrix’s basic intention was to dispose of all of the rest, residue and remainder of her estate and that she inadvertently overlooked providing for the 10 per cent share here in dispute. Under these circumstances, we believe that (with certain exceptions) the Legislative intent was (1) to avoid an intestacy when the will contained a residuary clause sufficiently broad to include, by a liberal interpretation, lapsed, void and undisposed of devises and bequests in the will,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">*</a> and (2) in that event such lapsed, void and undisposed of devises and bequests “shall pass to the other residuary devisees or legatees ... in proportion to their respective shares or interests in the residue.” Cf. <em>O’Malley Estate, </em>5 Fid.
