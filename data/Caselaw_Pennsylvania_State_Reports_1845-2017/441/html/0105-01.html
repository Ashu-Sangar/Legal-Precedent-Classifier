Aronson, Esquire, and Kenneth W. Béhrend, Esquire, the appellant, both lawyers, to prosecute a claim in trespass for <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>damages against the Yellow Cab Company, the appellee, in consideration of Warman’s agreement to pay to Aronson and Behrend forty per cent of any sum realized by settlement, suit or otherwise. Thereafter, War-man allegedly released Yellow Cab from all liability in return for $1,000 and Yellow Cab’s promise to pay on Warman’s behalf all medical and related expenses and “reasonable attorney’s fees.” Following Warman’s settlement with Yellow Cab, Behrend, as plaintiff, brought this suit in trespass, alleging that Yellow Cab had tortiously induced Warman to breach his contract with Behrend; Behrend was represented in this action by his partner, Aronson. The appellee filed preliminary objections to Behrend’s initial complaint, the complaint was amended, and appellee filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, contending that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>

The court <em>en banc </em>determined that there was no basis to appellant’s action, because the appellant had specifically averred in his complaint that the defendant had promised to pay Warman’s reasonable counsel fees as part of its settlement. Thus, in the court’s view, the appellee had recognized the validity of the appellant’s contract with Warman to furnish legal services. Bather than inducing a breach of contract or representing to Warman that the power of attorney was invalid or that he had no obligation to Behrend, appellee, by appellant’s allegations, had recognized and assumed the obligation created by Warman’s contract.</p>

The power of attorney running from Warman as client to Messrs. Behrend and Aronson as attorneys did not deprive Warman of the power to settle any claims he had against Yellow Cab. See <em>Wahl v. Strous, </em><a href="/pa/344/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="344 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1211013" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0402-01">344 Pa. 402</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.2d%20820" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="25 A.2d 820">25 A. 2d 820</a> (1942); Restatement 2d, Agency, §449 (1958).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It provided only that Messrs. Behrend and Aronson should be entitled to “forty per cent (40%) of any sum realized by settlement, suit or otherwise.” Appellant’s first amended complaint alleged that Yellow Cab promised to pay, on Warman’s behalf, reasonable counsel fees. This is not an allegation of a tortious inducement of breach of contract, but rather <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>of an. acceptance of Warman’s contractual burden by Yellow Cab.. As such,, it might provide a basis for a claim by appellant for attorney’s fees owed him pursuant to the power of attorney, but it does not support a claim in tort for damages, punitive or otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[183,623,1148,648]]]'>The undertaking as to counsel fees is the sole contractual duty imposed upon Warman by the terms of the power, and Warman’s payment of that fee would complete his performance of the contract. By the same token, appellee’s assumption and payment on War-man’s behalf of appellant’s lawful fee would complete Warman’s performance of the contract. The payment of-the fee, therefore, cannot be equated, as the dissenting opinion attempts to do, to payment of damages for some unidentified breach of contract; there is. no breach of contract indicated by the pleading, and no questidn of damages.</p>

But liberality of pleading does not encompass a duty in the courts to allow successive amendments when the initial pleading indicates that the claim asserted cannot be established. The view of the court <em>en banc </em>that the instant case presented such a claim was fully warranted in view of the pleadings then of record; it is further confirmed by the'plaintiff’s proposed second amended complaint which was prepared .subsequent to and with the benefit of the majority and dissenting opinions of the <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>

      <em> </em>That proposed complaint contains the allegation that the defendant Yellow Cab “promised Walton C. Warman that his obligation under written agreement with plaintiff would be discharged by them.” If anything, this is a more explicit undertaking to take care of Warman’s counsel fee liability than that set forth in the pleading before the court <em>en banc. </em>An action for tortious inducement of breach of contract could not be maintained in the face of such an allegation.</p>

In that case there was no suggestion that the defendant assumed the donor’s contractual burden as to counsel fees, and <em>Bichette </em>is therefore manifestly distinguishable from the case at hand.</p>
