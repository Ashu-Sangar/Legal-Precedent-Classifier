In addition the City agreed to enforce the collection of the water rentals and charges, and in the event they were not paid, to take all. necessary steps to reduce the charges to liens and to enforce the collection of such liens.</p>

Although on paper the Authority leased back the water system to the City, and was thus in a position to have the City.acting as its agent, the facts reveal that the Authority exercised <em>no control </em>over the City’s operation of the water system. Tn fact the City operated the water system after the creation Of the Authority precisely as it did before the implementation of the “sale and lease-back” financing technique. The lease required only that minimum water rates be charged so that the Authority could meet its cost of financing expenses. The City fixed the maximum, had the rents set aside in a Water Reserve Fund, kept the records, carried the insurance, and was generally responsible for the operation and maintenance of the water system.</p>

In reversing the Commission, the Court held that a municipal corporation could establish water rates for consumers outside its corporate limits which differed from water rates for consumers within its corporate limits, provided it did not give undue or unreasonablé preference to or create unfair discrimination to the inside-municipality class of consumers. It is of interest to note in <em>Ambridge </em>that the Court recognized that a court of common pleas sitting in equity had the competence to entertain an action brought by consumers within the corporate limits of the municipality to enjoin the collection or imposition of rates which would require them to contribute to losses incurred in furnishing water outside the corporate limits of the municipality. <a href="/pa-super/137/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="137 Pa.

Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, <a href="/pa-super/152/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="152 Pa.

Cf. Ambridge Borough v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, <a href="/pa-super/137/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="137 Pa.

Subsequent thereto, the legislature enacted the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945 (Act of May 2, 1945, P. L. 382 et seq. 53 P.S. §2900zrl et seq.) to negative the effect of State College Borough v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, supra. Section 4 of this Act, 53 PS §2900z-5(h), provides: ‘. . . The court of common pleas shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness and uniformity of rates and other charges fixed, altered, charged or collected by an Authority.’ It is true that the legislature has not by specific amendment of the Public Utility Law either removed municipal authorities from the definition of ‘municipal corporation’ as contained in the Public Utility Law (Section 2[15] Act of 1937, P. L. 1053, Art. I, §2, 66 PS §1102[15]) or delimited the scope of its jurisdiction and power (Section 301 of the Public Utility Law, supra, 66 PS §1141). It is apparent, however, that §4B(h) of the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945, supra, is wholly inconsistent with the above mentioned sections of the Public Utility Law.” The Court concluded and, I believe properly, that the Municipality Authorities Act imposed a definite limitation upon section 301 of the Public Utilities Code and that courts of common pleas had <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction to <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>inquire into the reasonableness of rates charged by any Authority beyond as well as within the corporate limits of the municipality which created it. <em>See Yezioro v.

The argument of the City and Authority, accepted by the majority, that by virtue of the “lease back” arrangement between them, the City, and not the Authority, has the rate fixing power, that, therefore, section 4B(h) of the Municipality Authorities Act is inapplicable under the circumstances and that the exclusive jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of water rates was in the <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>Public Utility Coimuission and not in the courts disregards the clear and unambiguous language of the statute.</p>

Until changed by legislative action, the Public Utility Commission will continue as the tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction to pass upon the reasonableness of water rates fixed by a municipal corporation for consumers outside its corporate boundaries and courts of common pleas have exclusive jurisdiction to pass upon the reasonableness of water rates fixed by an Authority, whether the latter acts in the capacity of a lessor or lessee of the water system.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[182,1312,1150,427]]]'>True it is that the Authority, through the medium of the “lease back” arrangement, sought to pass on to the City, and the latter willingly accepted, the power to fix the water rates and did, in fact, fix the water rates herein questioned. However, the question arises whether the Authority had the right to delegate its power to fix rates to the City. It is precisely at this point that I part company with the majority.</p>
    <p id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.7",480,[177,1751,1151,530]]]'>It was the legislative intent that an Authority be neither a nonentity nor a device simply to enable a municipality to avoid statutory debt limitation but rather an active and operating body, whether in the capacity of lessor or lessee, within the purport and purposes of the Municipality Authorities Act.

      <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>My examination of the instant “lease back” arrangement indicates that the Authority has surrendered its rate fixing power and that such surrender is in violation of that portion of section 4B(h) which provides for <em>“uniform rates to be determined exclusively by it </em>[the Authority].” The court below well stated: “Bates, it could be argued, could be determined in either of two ways. First, limits could be set within which rates charged would have to fall, or secondly, the specific rate could be fixed. The lease (copy of which is attached to the preliminary objections) which delegates certain matters from Authority to Lancaster in Section 3 covering water rentals and charges, sets forth the lower limit of rates as follows: ‘. . . the total of such rentals and charges . . . shall be at least such that the amounts . . . will be sufficient... to provide funds for the payment of . . . (a) the annual expenses for the operation, maintenance . . . repair ... and (c) to provide a margin of safety of at least 5% of (b) (annual rental).’ It will be noticed immediately that Authority set the lower limit but said nothing about an upper limit. Authority obviously has retained no control over maximum rates and therefore has surrendered all control over increased charges. Under these circumstances it is impossible to say that Authority has ‘determined’ or ‘fixed’ the rates as required by the Act. Yezioro v. North Fayette County Municipal Authority, Appellant, <a href="/pa-super/193/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="193 Pa.

The Act does not prohibit Lancaster from adopting an ordinance setting forth the rates but it is a statutory mandate that the rates set forth in the ordinance must first be set by Authority. This has not been done. It would be perfectly possible for Lancaster to supply its operating expenses to Authority so that Authority <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>could determine proper rates. It is of no avail to say that Authority might not set proper rates because Lancaster itself as a user or consumer could bring an action against Authority similar to the one before the court at the present time.”</p>
    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[196,612,1147,650]]]'>As noted by the majority, as well as the court below, the “lease back” arrangement provides only for a minimum amount of water rates to be charged but it makes no provisions whatsoever for maximum water rates to be charged and the Authority has completely surrendered its right to fix or control the maximum amount of the water rates to be charged. In my view, the Authority lacked the power to delegate to the City its legislatively mandated power to fix the water rates. <em>Cf. Forsht v. City of Altoona and Altoona City Authority </em>(Blair County Court of Common Pleas) (unreported).</p>

The fact that the City, rather than the Authority, took upon itself the fixing of such rates does not divest a court of common pleas of its jurisdiction over the actions of the Authority. The court below properly concluded that jurisdiction to pass upon the reasonableness of the rates, under the circumstances, lay in the court of common pleas and not in the Public Utility Commission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>
