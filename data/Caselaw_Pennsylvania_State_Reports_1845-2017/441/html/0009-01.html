The PUC states it is bringing this appeal under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23 §1, 12 P.S. §672, since the jurisdiction of the subject matter of this action lies exclusively in it.</p>

Under section 2407 of The Borough Code, Act of February 1, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1656, 53 P.S. §47407, a borough which is maintaining waterworks has the authority to supply water outside its geographic limits. The PUC granted the certificate and so gave appellee the privilege of furnishing water service within a certain designated area of West Earl Township.</p>

On May 30,1967, appellee filed with the Commission a motion to dismiss based on the theory that the Commission lacked jurisdiction and power to require it to extend its service area against its will beyond the area described in the certificate. The Commission denied that motion and set a hearing for August 30, 1967.</p>

This action was filed <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>pursuant :to section 1111 of the Public Utility Code, Act of May 28, 1937, P.

The Commission filed preliminary objections to the complaint which stated, inter alia, that it had the exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether or not to compel appellee to extend its service.

This is not a case in which alternative tribunals could grant the same relief. Equity does not have the power to order appellee to extend its services beyond the certificated area, and it can not directly deny Zimmerman the relief he seeks. It only has the power under section 1111 to issue an in<a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>junction against the PUC in an action questioning the latter’s jurisdiction, but by a specific statute (although section 1111 is written in the negative) equity is given jurisdiction in matters in which a serious question as to the Commission’s jurisdiction is raised.

It also concedes that the PUC has jurisdiction to supervise its activities within the certificated area. It argues, however, that under section 202(g) of the Public Utility Code, 66 P.S. §1122(g) (Supp. 1970), which states: “Upon the application of any public utility and the approval of such application by the <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>commission, evidenced by its certificate of public convenience first had and obtained, and upon compliance with existing laws, and not otherwise, it shall be lawful: (g) for any municipal corporation to acquire, construct, or begin to operate, any plant, equipment, or other facilities for the rendering or furnishing to the public of any public utility service beyond its corporate limits,” neither a municipality nor the Commission can decide unilaterally that service is to be provided to a previously noncertificated area.

      <em>Reigle, </em>supra, is said not to be controlling because it involved the question of service to additional customers in an area already being served by the municipality.

Sections 401 and 413 of the Public Utility Code and the cited cases do not clearly give the Commission this jurisdiction, power and authority. Therefore, whereas the Commission’s claim of jurisdiction is not frivolous, appellee has raised a serious question as to the existence of that jurisdiction.
