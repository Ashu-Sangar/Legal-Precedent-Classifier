He further instructed the jury that if they felt the Commonwealth had proved any of the crimes of murder, they could find a verdict of guilty on the voluntary manslaughter charge. This portion of the charge was objected to, even though defendant’s attorney called it a “general” exception, but the objection was overruled and defendant granted an exception.

Hoffman, </em>439 Pa., supra, the Court said (pages 358-359): “In Commonwealth v. Kellyon, <a href="/pa/278/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="278 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="1080547" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0059-01">278 Pa. 59</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.%20166" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="122 A. 166">122 Atl. 166</a> (1923), the Court discussed the doctrine at some length and elucidated its origins. First, the Court recognized that manslaughter was at common law, as it is today, an offense less than and included in the crime of murder, the distinguishing element being the absence of malice in vol<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>untary manslaughter. [Footnote omitted.] It is also noted that a jury has the power to find a defendant guilty of a lesser included offense and that this power permits the return of a verdict of voluntary manslaughter on a murder indictment. Because manslaughter is a lesser offense than murder, the Court concluded that a defendant could not properly complain of a verdict finding him guilty thereof on evidence which would show him to be guilty of the greater offense. The emphasis in our subsequent cases on the necessity of passion and provocation to reduce an intentional killing to voluntary manslaughter in no way alters the fact that voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder.”</p>
    <p id="b591-3" data-blocks='[["BL_591.4",591,[144,1096,1150,597]]]'>We once again reaffirm the aforesaid principles. However, the present case does not fall within said principles or the aforesaid decisions. Although voluntary manslaughter is a lesser criminal offense which is included in the offense of and in an indictment for murder, murder is not a lesser criminal offense which is included in the offense of voluntary manslaughter or of a voluntary manslaughter indictment. A criminal offense which is greater than the lesser criminal offense for which a person has been indicted or is being tried, is not included in the lesser offense.</p>

The trial Judge’s very lengthy charge to the jury with respect to first-degree murder and second-degree murder <em>was expressed in such a manner and in such language as to befuddle the jury, </em>even though at one point the Judge told the jury that defendant could not be found guilty of murder and that they could not bring in a verdict for anything more than voluntary manslaughter. Nevertheless, considered as a whole, we be<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>lieve that the manner and language in which the charge concerning murder was expressed in this case constituted prejudicial error.</p>
