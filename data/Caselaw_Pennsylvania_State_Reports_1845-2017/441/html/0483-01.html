A prison sentence was imposed immediately following the jury’s verdict. No appeal was then filed. Throughout the foregoing proceedings, Anderson was represented by court-appointed counsel.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.8",547,[155,993,1149,711]]]'>In May 1968, Anderson sought post-conviction relief alleging: (1) denial of his <em>“Douglas” </em>rights; and (2) denial of the assistance of effective trial counsel. After an evidentiary hearing, at which Anderson was represented by new court-appointed counsel, the court dismissed the petition, but permitted an appeal to be filed from the 1967 judgments of sentence as if timely filed. Such an appeal was entered in the Superior Court and resulted in an affirmance of the judgments without opinion. Judge Spaulding filed a dissenting opinion in which Judges Hoeeman and Cercone joined.

Neither counsel requested that a record be made, and the court did not order it to be done.

See Act of May 1, 1907, P. L. 135, §2, as amended, 17 P.S. §1802. The Commonwealth correctly argues that tMs statute is not self-executing and contends that in the absence of a request that the proceedings be recorded, the statutory right is waived. But is the right also one of constitutional dimension? If so, the waiver issue must be viewed in a different perspective. For the record is barren of facts upon which an effective waiver may be found, and the only relevant evidence is Anderson’s uncontradicted testimony at the PCHA hearing that he was not aware of his right in tMs regard and was not informed thereof by either the court or Ms counsel. And, as has been stated many times before, a waiver of a constitutional right to be effective must be intentional and knowing and will not be presumed. See <em>Johnson v.

Instead,, there has been a continuous careful hedge about adequate alternatives to a transcript.

The Supreme Court [that of Ill.] <em>may find other means </em>of affording adequate and effective appellate review to indigent defendants. For example, it may be that bystanders’ bills of <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>exceptions or other methods of reporting trial proceedings could be used in some cases.” The same note of caution is sounded in Justice Frankfurter's concurrence : “When a state not only gives leave for appellate correction of trial errors but must pay for the cost of its exercise by the indigent, it may protect itself so that frivolous appeals are not subsidized and public moneys not needlessly spent. The growing experience of reforms in appellate procedure and sensible, economic modes for securing review still to be devised may be drawn upon to the end that the State will neither bolt the door to equal justice nor support wasteful abuse of the appellate process.” 351 U.S. at page 24.</p>

Moreover, the actual record (if appellate counsel could have it to inspect) might disclose issues substantial enough to constitute probable or possible “plain error” even though trial counsel was not aware of their existence; and the indigent should have the same opportunity as the wealthy to urge that plain error should be noticed on appeal. In short, a conscientious counsel freshly entering the case at the appellate stage normally is likely to conclude that a full or partial transcript of the trial proceedings will be indispensable if the requisite “dependable record” is to be obtained as a basis for evaluating the case.’ ” <a href="/us/375/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="375 U.S. 277" data-case-ids="11719292" data-case-paths="/us/375/0277-01">375 U.S. at 280-81, n.3</a>, <a href="/us/375/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="375 U.S. 277" data-case-ids="11719292" data-case-paths="/us/375/0277-01">84 S.

Both appellants claimed a denial of due process of law because the trial was not stenographically reported forcing them on appeal to rely on a statement of proceedings and evidence. In both instances the claims were rejected, the <em>Williamson </em>court saying: “We know of no authority holding that due process of law requires that all criminal trials be stenographically reported. If a defendant has a right of appeal, he must be assured of appropriate means to present his claims of error on appeal. A stenographic transcript is not the only means by which this can be done.

[and] we do not interpret it as requiring that every criminal defendant must have his trial stenographically reported, whether or not his counsel makes a request therefor. Neither do we interpret it as holding that if no transcript is available a defendant is ipso facto denied the right of an effective appeal.” <a href="/a2d/234/0805-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="234 A.2d 805" data-case-ids="8096253" data-case-paths="/a2d/234/0805-01">234 A. 2d at 807, 808</a>.

There appellant was arraigned on a charge of rape, waived counsel, plead guilty and was sentenced to life. There was no recording of the proceedings by a reporter though there were the clerk’s minutes, a rather sketchy account of the proceedings. In a habeas corpus proceeding petitioner Martinez averred that he was unaware of what rights he agreed to forego due to his lack of ability in the English language. The court held that where the habeas corpus record failed to show a waiver of the recording of the proceedings and there is no explanation for the failure to have a recording of such proceedings, petitioner was deprived of constitutional due process.
