The sole question is whether it must include the gain on the sale of certain securities in the income reported by it to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Commonwealth) for that year.</p>
    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.9",193,[158,1034,1148,655]]]'>ACF is a New Jersey corporation with its headquarters in New York City. It is registered to do business in Pennsylvania. During the year in question, its activities in Pennsylvania included the manufacture of railroad and tank cars, the repair of freight and tank cars (its own and others), the manufacture of pressed steel and pressure vessels and the sale of some products made outside the state. It also carried on these activities, as well as certain aerospace and nuclear engineering operations, outside of Pennsylvania. It concedes that its business enterprise is a unitary one for corporate net income tax purposes.</p>

The purchase came about as a result of information acquired by a director of ACF who also served as a director of Bankers Trust Company of New York with Paul Moore. Bankers Trust did business with Republic, and Moore served on Republic’s board and frequently mentioned the company. When Moore died, Ms colleague on Bankers Trust board made the availability of the stock known to ACF. Since ÁCF had business dealings with Republic, it was interested in exploring an acquisition of Republic’s assets or a <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>merger -with. Republic and felt there was little risk in acquiring the stock. It consummated the purchase at a price of $24 a share.</p>
    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.5",194,[199,524,1147,757]]]'>Following the purchase, a joint committee was established to explore the acquisition or merger possibilities. In May, 1961, this committee rendered a negative report. ACF then decided to dispose of its Republic stock; and on August 29, 1961 (sixteen months after purchase), it sold all of the shares through a secondary offering at a net price of $47,875 a share. This sale produced a net capital gain of $5,058,299. ACF excluded all of this gain in reporting its corporate net income to Pennsylvania for the year of sale on the theory that this income was from an asset unrelated to its Pennsylvania activities. The Commonwealth disagreed and, after the lower court sustained the Commonwealth’s position, the present appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[268,1293,1028,44]]]'>Apart from the above, certain other facts appear:</p>
    <p id="b194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_194.7",194,[195,1348,1147,647]]]'>First, in order to finance the purchase of the Republic stock, ACF had to use borrowed funds. In 1958 it had entered into a loan agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company whereby the latter agreed to lend ACF $25,000,000 (half on April 30, 1959, and half on April 30, 1960) for general business purposes. The second half of this loan was taken down by ACF 12 days prior to its purchase of the stock, and in order to use part of these funds for the purchase it obtained Prudential’s consent to a modification of certain restrictions in the loan agreement which otherwise would have prevented ACF from so using the funds.</p>
    <p id="b194-7" data-blocks='[["BL_194.8",194,[195,2007,1144,371]]]'>The loan agreement with Prudential called for final repayment by ACF on May 1, 1979, with an annual retirement of $1,000,000 beginning May 1, 1962. ACF made the annual payments from cash generated by its general business activities and, in fact, prepaid the entire remaining balance on the loan on April 30, 1965 (fourteen years early).</p>

      <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>Second, ACF handled the Republic stock on its financial statement as a separate item “Investment in common stock of Republic Aviation Corporation” and referred to it as a transaction not related to its normal business operations. It carried on all of its activities relating to the stock at its New York City office. The testimony indicates that the stock was not used as collateral for loans, was not associated with other assets or the reserves of the corporation and produced more than sufficient dividends to pay the interest on that part of the Prudential loan used to acquire it. ACF’s tax manager testified that net gains on the sale of stock in no way influenced ACF’s business activities or financial planning. Both the dividends and sale proceeds were commingled with ACF’s other funds.</p>
    <p id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[145,1168,1149,543]]]'>Third, before and during ACF’s ownership of the Republic stock, it engaged in several joint business activities with Republic. In 1958 Republic was awarded a prime government contract to build and supply F-105 fighter planes to the Federal Government. In a separate award ACF obtained a prime government contract to build and furnish flight simulators to train pilots to fly the F-105 planes. In connection with these separate contracts Republic furnished ACF with data regarding the F-105.</p>
    <p id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.6",195,[148,1720,1149,587]]]'>In April, 1960 (prior to the stock purchase), ACF and Republic submitted a joint bid to NASA involving flight testing of nuclear rocket propulsion systems. This bid was rejected on July 29, 1960. From time to time ACF submitted joint bids on federal contracts with other companies. According to the testimony, ACF never acquired stock in any of the other joint bidders, did not consider it necessary to do so in order to influence the award of a government contract and did not obtain the Republic stock in an effort to influence NASA.</p>

Furthermore, it rejected the testimony just mentioned and stated that “certainly an underlying purpose of purchasing the stock was to further these common efforts” of ACF and Republic in dealing with the Federal Government.</p>

The only difference is in the nature of the tax measure and the impact of this on the question asked. In the former the tax is measured by the apportioned value of the capital stock, and the question is whether the business or asset .in question contributes or is related to the exercise of the franchise in Pennsylvania. In the latter the tax is measured by the apportioned net income, and the question is whether the business or asset in question contributes or is related to the conduct of its income-producing activities here. Actually, these two questions are the same, the goal being to. tax a proportion of valué or income reflecting the value of the Pennsylvania franchise.</p>

Both have been sustained in the past, and both must be distinguished from the rejected “separate accounting” concept best illustrated in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Frank G.

L. 208, 72 P.S. §3420b, contains the folio-wing provision: “Where a corporation in any tax year beginning on or after the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred fifty-six, engages in U separate business outside of Pennsylvania, or owns property having a situs outside of Pennsylvania, which business or property bears no relation to the exercise of the Pennsylvania franchise, the department, with the approval of the Auditor General, may determine the base for the tax imposed by this act for the tax year by excluding from the net income of such corporation as returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government, the.net income from the business or property which bears no relation to the exercise of the Pennsylvania franchise. The deduction allowed by this section for dividends received from any other corporation shall be limited to those dividends which remain in the net income after the exclusion hereinbefore authorized in this paragraph. The net income which remains, after the exclusion and deductions authorized in this paragraph, shall be subject to allocations and apportionments as provided in this section using only those factors which pertain to that portion of the net income being allocated and apportioned.” This provision was added to section 2 short<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>ly after our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. American Telephone and Telegraph Company, </em>supra, in which, former Chief Justice Stern, writing for the Court, held that the purpose of the multiform and unrelated asset concepts was to avoid an impermissible taxation of value or income by Pennsylvania, that their application required action by an aggrieved taxpayer and that the Commonwealth could not raise the issue if the taxpayer was satisfied with a unitary settlement. While this provision has never been specifically construed by us and while ACF here makes a strong argument that it can only be construed constitutionally by reading the word “may” as “shall”, we do not and need not reach this issue here.</p>

In so doing, we reaffirmed the principle of the <em>Quaker Oats </em>case, supra, that contributions of unrelated activities to the corporate whole do not vitiate a claim for exclusion, that it is the interrelationship between the activities themselves which is the critical factor.</p>

Baxter, Kelly &amp; Faust, Inc., </em>53 Dauph. 73 (1942), was similar to the <em>Mundy </em>case except that the unrelated securities and the company’s principal office were in New York, not Pennsylvania. Thus, the one weakness of the <em>Mundy </em>situation—the presence of the company’s commercial domicile in this state—was absent; and the court’s decision excluding the unrelated securities (i.e., they were not held or used as reserves for corporate functioning) is justified.</p>

      <em>Commonwealth v. United Biscuit Company, </em>56 Dauph. 163 and 182 (1944), involved a multiform business activity claim for both franchise tax and corporate net income tax purposes. The company operated through sixteen divisions, three of which conducted activities in Pennsylvania; and it sought to pay tax only on the value of and income from these three divisions. The lower court denied the claim although the facts indicated that each division operated independently of the other in its purchasing, bookkeeping, advertising, packaging, production and marketing activities. Reliance was placed on the uniform corporate policy imposed with regard to price schedules, Federal Wage and Hour laws, Social Security procedures, handling of taxes and insurance and central executive office management. We view this decision somewhat skeptically today because the factors relied upon to characterize the enterprise as unitary are precisely those things which do <em>not </em>involve the interrelationship between operating divisions but rather the interrelationship between each division and the corporate superstructure— factors which would likely appear in every case, no matter how independently each division operated from the other.</p>

      <em>Commonwealth v. Eaglis Corporation, </em>56 Dauph. 227 (1945), involved the franchise tax of a Delaware corporation conducting business much like <em>Mundy Corporation. </em>It conducted a real estate business and held securities for investment. All of its business was transacted from a Pennsylvania office except that several directors’ meetings were held outside the State. The court held for the Commonwealth, however, because the certificate of authority granted to the corporation by Pennsylvania authorized it to carry on not just its real estate business (the only authorization granted to Mundy) but also an investment and holding company <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>business. This addition was critical, according to the court. We tend to agree with the result, more particularly, however, because of what we said above about <em>Mundy </em>to the effect that all of the company’s actual business activities were centered in this State.</p>

Baker-Whiteley Coal Co., </em>60 Dauph. 434 (1950), exceptions dismissed, 62 Dauph. 207 (1951). This West Virginia corporation with its principal office in Maryland engaged solely in the business of mining coal in Pennsylvania. Outside the State it carried on a tugboat business. Except for a <em>de minimis </em>use of its coal on its tugboats, the company’s two businesses were completely separate in operation; and certain common corporate expenses were prorated. The court excluded from Pennsylvania tax the net income derived from tugboat activity.</p>

While we are not prepared at this stage (and need not in this case) to go as far as Hellerstein in permitting exclusion of a business activity outside the state identical to one carried on inside the state where each operates independently of the other (as he says appears in the case of <em>Superior Oil Co. v.

We note, also, that in the <em>Superior Oil </em>case, non-California assets were used to obtain funds to support California operations and non-California operating funds were transferred to California to finance projects there. To this extent we have customarily found an interdependence of business activities and have not considered such factors simply additional “centralized operations” properly carried out by the corporate executive office (as we agree are the legal, accounting and research activities) without infringing on otherwise multiform activities.</p>

Fairly taken, it reveals an isolated investment designed to motivate study of a possible corporate combination, undertaken without substantial risk and disposed of as soon as the purpose was completed, albeit wthout positive action. In no way is the lower court’s conclusion that the acquisition of Republic’s stock by ACF was designed to further their common business efforts justified. The F-105 contracts were totally unrelated events and were entered into two years prior to the stock purchase. The NASA bid was submitted a month before the stock purchase and rejected three and one-half months later, but ACF held the stock until the merger possibilities were eliminated a year later. Other joint bids led to no similar purchases. In short, the factual inferences supported by the record are completely contrary to that stated by the court below.</p>

There hardly would have seemed available to ACF any other use for the proceeds once it disposed of the stock in this isolated undertaking. Moreover, it is the use of the stock itself which is critical. Absolutely nothing indicates that this asset—the stock—was used in any way which was related to or contributed to ACF’s business in Pennsylvania. Because the facts indicate just the opposite to be true, we can only conclude that this asset was unrelated to the exercise of ACF’s Pennsylvania franchise and that the sale proceeds should be excluded from its income and apportionment fractions in computing ACF’s corporate net income tax for the year ended April 30, 1962.</p>
