        "text": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nIn 1947, John J. Gilmer was convicted of first degree murder. Gilmer, through counsel, filed post-trial motions. These motions were later withdrawn and Gilmer was sentenced to life imprisonment.\nApproximately twenty years later, Gilmer filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County a petition for post-conviction relief wherein he alleged that \u201calthough he [Gilmer] knowingly and voluntarily agreed to the withdrawal of certain post-trial motions filed by his counsel, he did not know that this would waive his right to appeal after sentence was imposed.\u201d The court below, without a hearing, dismissed this petition. On appeal, concluding that Gilmer was entitled to a hearing on his petition, we reversed and remanded the matter to the court below. See: Commonwealth v. Gilmer, 435 Pa. 569, 257 A. 2d 548 (1969).\nA hearing was then held in the court below. At that hearing, Gilmer testified that he did not know and had not been advised of his right to appeal and Gilmer\u2019s then only surviving counsel testified that he could not remember whether Gilmer had been consulted either in regard to the filing of post-trial motions or his right to appeal. After hearing, the court below found: \u201cAfter reviewing the evidence before us, we cannot conclude that [Gilmer] fully understood and knew of his rights, both to an appeal and to the assistance of counsel in connection therewith\u201d and that \u201c[Gilmer] ought to be afforded the opportunity to appeal.\u201d However, the court below, acting upon the erroneous belief that it lacked competency to grant an appeal as though timely filed, instead of granting Gilmer the right to file an appeal, dismissed Gilmer\u2019s petition and \u201creturned the case\u201d to our Court.\nThe record clearly demonstrates that Gilmer did not knowingly and understanding^ waive his right to appeal. As we noted in Com. v. Faison, 437 Pa. 432, 436 n. 4, 264 A. 2d 394, 396 n. 4 (1970) : \u201cIn cases where no post-trial motions have been filed, the hearing court upon finding that a petitioner has been denied his Douglas rights should transfer the case to the trial court with instruction to appoint counsel for the petitioner (if indigent) and to permit the filing and arguing of post-trial motions.\u201d\nThe order of the court below is reversed and the matter remanded to the court below so that Gilmer, with the assistance of counsel, may file post-trial motions and, in the event the court below after due consideration dismisses such motions, that Gilmer be permitted to file an appeal from the judgment of sentence as though timely filed.\nMr. Justice Eagen took uo part in the consideration or decision of this case.",
