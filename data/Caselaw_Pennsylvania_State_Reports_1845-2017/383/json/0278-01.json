        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMe. Justice Musmanno:\nAt the age of 17, Michael Hudak entered the coal mines in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and since then has known scarcely any occupation other than that of toiling in the subterranean depths of the earth, extracting the \u201cblack diamonds\u201d which America for many decades has worn in the diadem of her economic wealth. In 1939, 28 years after descending for the first time into the deep caverns, Hudak encountered the fate which hangs like a black cloud over every coal miner\u2019s destiny. Since then he has been permanently disabled.\nOn November 30, 1952, his wife died, entitling him, under the intestate laws to the major portion of her estate. The Orphans Court of Allegheny County has decreed that he shall not participate in the estate and has awarded all of it to collateral heirs, citing as authority Sec. 6 (a) of the Intestate Act of 1947 (20 P.S. Sec. 1.6) which reads: \u201cForfeiture, (a) Husband\u2019s share. A husband who, for one year or upwards, previous to the death of his wife, shall have wilfully neglected or refused to provide for her, or who for that period or upwards shall have wilfully and maliciously deserted her, shall have no title or interest under this act in her real or personal estate.\u201d\nThe majority of this Court has affirmed the decision of the lower Court and has adopted its opinion disposing of the case. I have a high regard for the writer of that opinion and regret that I must disagree with his view that one who is totally and permanently disabled can b\u00e9 regarded as having \u201cwilfully neglected or refused to provide\u201d for his wife. Nor can I agree that whatever Michael Hudak did prior to 1943 shall be accepted as conclusive proof of his intentions in 1951, a year prior to his spouse\u2019s death. To project into the future a wilful intent which Father Time has already shovelled into the grave of the past is to formulate a species of ex post factoism in reverse. Moreover, there is evidence that the separation between husband and wife was a consensual one.\nThe case of Buckley Estate, 348 Pa. 311, cited by my learned friend in the Court below, is scarcely applicable to the facts in the case at bar. As Justice Allen M. Stearns pointed out, Buckley was a \u201cpersistent criminal\u201d and \u201cat the time of the audit he was still serving from 2 1/2 years to 5 years in prison following his most recent sentence, on February 8, 1940, on the charge of burglary.\u201d It is obvious that in excluding Buckley from his wife\u2019s estate, this Court was guided by the fact that Buckley\u2019s failure to support his wife was an act of volition on his part since it followed upon his conviction for a crime which he voluntarily committed. Thus, Justice Stearne said: \u201cWhile the incarceration of the husband for a year and upwards might not of itself establish either wilful desertion or non-support, yet in the facts of this case the persistent course of criminal conduct and the various imprisonments since 1926, in this and another state, raise a presumption that during such period, and particularly since 1940, the husband failed to support his wife.\u201d\nNo such presumption should arise in the circumstances of the- case at bar, because Hudak\u2019s injuries (and consequent inability to support his wife) were the result of an accident over which he had no control.\nMichael Hudak is not a criminal. Apart from disagreements with his wife and quarrels with his in-laws, his life, so far as the record shows, has been that of a law-abiding citizen and a humble worker, hoping through the years to find amid the dust of the mines one shiny pebble of good luck. He never found it, and the decision in this case would appear to have thrust that possibility over the precipice of impossible performance into the abyss of the nevermore.\nAll italics mine.",
