Sowers, in equal shares, share and share alike, during their Ufe time.\n\u201cIn trust upon the death of my said children, including my adopted child, as each one shall be deceased to pay over to the lawful issue of such child or children the full part of the principal fund of which the deceased parent was receiving the income, in equal shares, share and share alike; and further, in case any child shall die before the death or re-marriage of my said beloved wife, Minne E., then upon such death or re-marriage, to pay over to the lawful issue of such deceased child or children, including issue of my adopted child, the full one-fourth part of one-third of said principal fund from which my said beloved wife was receiving the income as herein provided.\u201d\nIt is obvious that the will was unskillfully drawn in two important contingencies \u2014 it expressly provided what testator wished to happen to the one-third part of the net income which was payable to his wife, in case of the re-marriage of his wife, but (a) it does not expressly provide what testator wished to happen to saicl income in the event of his wife\u2019s death and (b) consequently to the one-third part of the principal from which she was receiving the income, except \u2014 and this is a very important exception \u2014 namely, if one of his children died before his wife\u2019s death or re-marriage such deceased child\u2019s lawful issue should be paid a full one-fourth of the principal from which his wife was receiving the income. His will would clearly have given to his named children and their lawful issue in any and every eventuality the income and the principal of the one-third share set apart for his wife, if the words \u201cdeath or\u201d had not been omitted in one sub-paragraph of paragraph 5.\nThe Court below held that an intestacy resulted after the wife\u2019s death in one-third of the corpus and income, even though an intestacy could not possibly result as to this principal if a (named) child died before the re-marriage or death of testator\u2019s wife leaving lawful issue, since in that event one-fourth of said principal was, we repeat, expressly payable to the lawful issue of such deceased child. If an intestacy of principal were declared as to testator\u2019s children in event of his wife\u2019s death, but no intestacy of principal as to their issue, the situation which would arise would be both anomalous and absurd.\n\u201cThe pole star in the construction of every will is the testator\u2019s intent: Woelpper\u2019s Appeal, 126 Pa. 562, 17 A. 870; Mulert Estate, 360 Pa. 356, 61 A. 2d 841; Byrne\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 513, 181 A. 500.

Oliver, 352 Pa. 244, 247-248, 42 A. 2d 602.\u201d\nTo summarize: Mr. Sowers\u2019 intent is clear in the following particulars: (1) he willed one-third of the net income of his residuary estate to his wife for her life or so long as she remained his widow, and the remaining two-thirds of said residuary net income to his three named children and his adopted daughter in equal shares during their respective life time; (2) as each of his children and his adopted child died, he directed his trustees to pay over to the lawful issue of such deceased child \u201cthe full part of the principal fund of which the deceased parent was receiving the income?\u2019, and (3) \u201cand further, in case any child shall die before the death or re-marriage of my . . . wife . . . then upon such death or re-marriage, to pay over to the lawful issue of such deceased child . . . including issue of my adopted child, the full one-fourth part of one-third of said principal fund from which my said beloved wife was receiving the income . . .\u201d.\nApplying the aforesaid principles to this will, we are confronted with a. narrow and very difficult question: Can we say from the language and scheme of testator\u2019s will that the words \u201cdeath or\u201d were clearly omitted by mistake in the following sub-paragraph of paragraph 5 of his will, viz: \u201cIn trust, in case of the [death or] re-marriage of my said wife, to pay over her said one-third part of such net income unto my children, John E. Sowers, Marmaduke Sowers, Catherine E. Sowers and my adopted daughter, Josephine R. Sowers, in equal shares, share and share alike, during their life time.\u201d To hold otherwise would, we repeat, produce the absurd result that there would be an intestacy as to one-third of the principal so far as his children were concerned but no intestacy of principal if a child died before the death or re-marriage of his wife, in which event the trustees were directed to pay over to the lawful issue of such deceased child \u201cthe full one-fourth part of one-third of said principal fund from which my said beloved wife was receiving the income\nIn this dilemma we are convinced that the testator\u2019s intention would best be fulfilled and the interest of Justice best be served by holding that the words \u201cdeath or\u201d were omitted inadvertently and by mistake in the aforesaid sub-paragraph of his will. Such a construction ties in with and harmonizes all the other paragraphs and provisions of testator\u2019s residuary estate trust both as to income and principal.\nThe Court below correctly refused to allow counsel fees to be paid out of the trust to counsel for the except-ants. No new assets or additional funds were created by the filing of exceptions to the executors\u2019 or trustees\u2019 account. All of the assets of the estate were included in the Fiduciary Account and the only question was whether they should be retained as part of the trust or distributed, and if so, how.\nIt is only in very exceptional cases that an except-ant to the account of an executor, administrator or trustee in tlie Orphan's\u2019 Court will be allowed counsel fees out of the fund. The rule in such eases is that the exceptant must pay his own counsel fee.\nWhere the fund is in the hands of the court and in no jeopardy, except from the possible mistake of the court in dealing with it, and an exceptant is merely protecting his own interest, he will not be allowed counsel fees, although through his efforts others may also be benefited.

Corp., 334 Pa. 107, 114, 5 A. 890.\nThe Court below likewise correctly decided that upon the death of each of his children and his adopted daughter, Josephine, the principal of the trust fund created for his said grandchildren should be paid to them including the grandchild\u2019s share of the stock of the Sowers Printing Company, which was disposed of in the sixth paragraph of testator\u2019s will. The direction therein as to sale is subordinate to an absolute gift of the principal of the trust. \u201c. . . an absolute gift cannot be limited or fettered by restrictions on sale or alienation.\u201d Stineman v. Stineman, 382 Pa. 153, 157, 114 A. 2d 137.\nHowever, appellant is correct in contending that a lower Court is without power to file a revised schedule of distribution after an appeal from the decree of said Court has been taken to an Appellate Court. \u201cMoreover, as we said in Gilbert v. Lebanon Valley Street Ry. Co., 303 Pa. 213: \u2018At common law a court of first instance is without jurisdiction to proceed with a cause after the record thereof has been removed to an appellate court. This rule still applies in the absence of a statute providing otherwise.\u2019 Here, there is no such statute. So, also, we said in Ewing v. Thompson, 43 Pa. 372, 376: \u2018The effect of that writ [certiorari] was to stay further proceedings in the court below, and to remove the record of the case into this court. That such is the effect of a certiorari, except in cases where the legislature has made a different rule [which here it has not], is the doctrine of all our cases. It is not itself a writ of supersedeas, but it operates as one by implication.\u2019 \u201d Harwood v. Bruhn et ux., 313 Pa. 337, 341, 170 A. 144.\nJohn A. Gernert, Jr. is a son of testator\u2019s deceased daughter, Rebecca, and obviously the grandchild of the testator. He is unprovided for in the will unless he comes in as a member of a class under paragraph 8 of the will. He claims that he is entitled to take as an \u201cother\u201d grandchild, since Josephine R. Sowers died without lawful issue. Paragraph 8 reads: \u201c8 \u2014 I order and direct that if any of my said children, including my adopted child, Josephine R. Sowers, should die without lawful issue, the share in the principal of the trust fund hereby created, which is bequeathed to the lawful issue of my said mentioned children, shall in such event be divided equally among my other grandchildren living at such time, share and share alike.\u201d\nIt is not clear what testator meant by the words \u201camong my other grandchildren\u201d, but it is clear that in every paragraph and sub-paragraph of the residuary trust he makes provisions only for his three children, naming them, and his adopted daughter, Josephine, and their respective lawful issue. We believe that the scheme of testator\u2019s entire will plainly shows his intention to exclude John and to give the principal of his estate to the lawful issue of his four named children, and that in paragraph 8 he was following said scheme of distribution and intended the principal share of a child who died without lawful issue to be divided among the other (living) grandchildren of his named children.\nThe decree of the lower Court is reversed and a new schedule of distribution and a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court shall be entered in accordance with this opinion. Costs shall be paid out of the estate.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nWe are familiar with authorities which hold that the fact that he had excluded John Gernert in his will would not prevent John from taking in the event of an intestacy. \u201c. . . even though an heir be expressly excluded by a will, he takes, nevertheless, if an intestacy results, since his taking is not by reason of the will but, under the intestacy, by operation of law: Bruckman\u2019s Estate, 195 Pa. 363, 45 A. 1078; Gibbon\u2019s Estate, 317 Pa. 465, 468, 177 A. 50, 51; Habecker\u2019s Estate, (No. 1), 43 Pa.
