        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nThese two annexation cases were argued together and the appeals, involving a single legal question, will be disposed of in one opinion. The annexations were by ordinances of the City of Lancaster, each of which was introduced before the city council on December 2, 1952, and purported to be adopted on December 5, 1952. They must be declared void.\nThe Third Class City Code, as amended by the Act of 1951, P. L. 662, \u00a710, 53 PS \u00a712198-1012, provides in part: \u201cNo bill shall be passed finally on the same day on which it was introduced. At least three days shall intervene between its introduction and its final passage. \u201d (Italics supplied).\nSustaining the validity of the ordinances, the court beloiv relied on the Statutory Construction Act of 1937, Article III, \u00a738, 46 PS \u00a7538, which provides: \u201cWhen any period of time is referred to in any law, such period in all cases,. . . shall be so computed as to exclude the first and include the last day of such period . . .\u201d\nBut the Legislature could not have used clearer words than in the quoted provision of the Code. Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, \u00a7391, states that \u201cwhen so many \u2018clear days\u2019 or so many days \u2018at least\u2019 are given to do an act, or \u2018not less than\u2019 so many days must intervene, both the terminal days are excluded.\u201d (Italics supplied). See also Gregg\u2019s Estate, 213 Pa. 260, 62 A. 856, in which this Court excluded both terminal days under the Wills Act requiring that to be valid charitable bequests must be made \u201cat least one calendar month before\u201d death. The Court there stated at page 263: \u201cThe meaning of the words \u2018at least\u2019 is \u2018in the smallest or lowest degree; ... at the smallest number ... In declaring that \u2018at least one calendar month\u2019 must elapse between the execution of a will containing a charitable bequest and the death of the testator, the manifest meaning of the statute is that such a month must fully elapse between the dates of the two events.\u201d Webster defines the word \u201cintervene\u201d as \u201cto occur, fall or come, between points of time and events.\u201d This is also the etymology of the word \u201cintervene,\u201d i.e. \u201c to come between.\u201d We cannot but hold that in using the words, \u201cat least three days shall intervene,\u201d the Legislature here intended that nothing less than three days must elapse between the date of introduction and the time of passage of the ordinance.\nThe exact question was properly disposed of by Judge Stewart in Foering v. City of Bethlehem, 20 D. & C. 331, relying upon Gregg\u2019s Estate213 Pa. 260, and Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, Section 391, in which the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County rendered judgment in accordance with the instant opinion. See also Derringe v. Walton, 13 D. & C. 82. The Foering case construed \u00a71012 of The Third Class City Law of June 23, 1931, P. L. 932, which was identical with the Third Class City Code, \u00a710, 53 PS \u00a712198-1012. In other words, both terminal days must be excluded from the computation.\nThe Statutory Construction Act itself, in \u00a7\u00a731 and 33, 46 PS \u00a7\u00a7531 and 533, expressly provides for such result, \u00a731 stating that \u201cin the construction of the laws . . . the rules set forth in this article shall be observed, unless the application of such rules would result in a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the Legislature\u201d; and \u00a733 stating: \u201cWords and phrases shall be construed according to . . . their common and approved usage . . .\u201d When the Legislature requires that at least three days must intervene between introduction and final passage of an ordinance, the meaning cannot be otherwise than that three full days must come between the two days mentioned, both terminal dates to be excluded. Cf. Coleman v. Keenan, 71 Ill. App. 315.\nIt follows that the two orders of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lancaster County involved in Appeals Nos. 337 and 338 January Term, 1955, must be reversed, and the ordinances are hereby declared null and void; the costs to be paid by the City of Lancaster.",
