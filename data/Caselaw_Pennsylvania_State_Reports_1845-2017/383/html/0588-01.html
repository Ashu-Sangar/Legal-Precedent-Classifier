Delevan Mc-Cafferty, a stepson, filed (1) a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto, which was dismissed by the Court below, and (2) a motion for a new trial, which was granted by the Court below.

Would you state to the court under what circumstances this document was drawn and prepared? A. I had been doing some legal work for Mrs. McCafferty prior to July 3, 1951, and at one time she had inquired of the possibility of making a new will. She informed me that she .had made a previous will jointly with her husband. She exhibited to me what I understood to be a certified copy of that prior will. She asked my opinion as to the provisions of that will. I explained to her the provisions of that will as I understood them. She then discussed with me the matter of the provisions of a new will which she contemplated making. <em>She discussed the various persons whom she might or might not consider in her will.</em>

Well, as a part of the discussion, Mrs. MeCafferty considered or mentioned the possibility that she might leave <em>a third of her property to her stepson, </em>a third to her nephew, Matthew Slattery, and a third to Mrs. Violet Slattery, the wife of Matthew Slattery.

Q. Mr. McVay, would you say that in your conversations with Mrs. MeCafferty on these different occasions, whether they might have been legal matters or otherwise, that she was a person of <em>keen perception? </em>A. In my opinion she was. We sometimes on a couple of these occasions discussed the matter of <em>disposition of her home and the contents of it, the matter of whether there was sufficient fire insurance coverage on it, sufficient public liability coverage </em>in the event someone fell on the sidewalk, different matters of that kind. Some of those matters I suggested to her and others she brought up herself and asked me about. . . . Q. Did you discuss the preparation of this will with anyone prior to the time it was prepared? A. <em>The only person </em>with whom I had any discussion concerning this will prior to the time of its preparation <em>was with Mrs. MeCafferty herself. </em>. . . Q. At whose request was this will prepared? A. <em>At the request of Minnie S. MeCafferty. </em>...

He testified that Mrs. Slattery asked him in May 1951 if he would draw a will leaving her a “slice” of Mrs. McCafferty’s estate for her services. He replied that he would draw such a will provided the amount was reasonable for her services and if Dr. Russell told him that Mrs. McCafferty was competent to make a will. On cross examination he testified that he would have drawn a will leaving Mrs. Slattery whatever Mrs. McCafferty desired to give her, if Mrs. McCafferty asked him to do so.
