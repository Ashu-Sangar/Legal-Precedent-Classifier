Under clause 6 of the agreement between the owner and contractor it is provided: “Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless Owner from any and all liens, claims, obligations or liabilities which may be asserted against Owner or its property by reason of or as a result of any acts or omissions of Contractor, his employees, representatives, licensees, or subcontractors, in connection with or related to the performance of this contract. . . .”</p>

Appellee filed an affidavit of defense to the <em>scire facias. </em>A rule was entered on the appellee-owner to show cause why judgment should not be entered for appellant-subcontractor. Upon answer with issue joined, argument was had before the court in banc. Judgment was entered in favor of appellee-owner and the lien was stricken from the record. This appeal followed.</p>

One of the covenants in that agreement is found in Section 6. It provides that the contractor agrees to indemnify and save harmless the appellee-owner, <em>inter alia, </em>from all liens. Construing the agreements together, as we must, it follows that there existed an enforceable covenant not only binding upon the contractor, but also upon the subcontractor, not to file a lien against the owner’s property. But of even greatter, if not controlling, significance is the clause in Section 5 of the contract between the general contractor and appellant-subcontractor, which provides <em>that nothing in such contract shall create any obligation on the part of the appellee-owner to pay any sums to any subcontractor.. </em>By such a provision the subcontractor agreed to look solely to the general contractor for payment. It is crystal clear, since it was agreed that the owner was not to be liable to the subcontractor for any payment, no valid lien can be filed to secure a payment of money not due. Hence, in terms, these clauses unequivocally constitute an effective waiver of the right to file a lien. With Such plain language as this, it is difficult to comprehend why the subcontractor could not clearly observe that no liens were to be filed. We agree with the learned court below that <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>this constituted an effective waiver of the right to file liens.</p>
    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[253,441,1151,490]]]'>We note the presence of certain provisions in the contract relating to the withholding of moneys under indemnity provisions. As the litigation now before us relates exclusively to whether or not there was an effective waiver of the mechanic’s lien, and such issue being joined in an amicable <em>scire facias </em>proceeding under the Mechanics’ Liens Act, the question of the right to withhold funds under the indemnity provision is not now before us and, consequently, is not passed upon.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[323,941,921,45]]]'>The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>
