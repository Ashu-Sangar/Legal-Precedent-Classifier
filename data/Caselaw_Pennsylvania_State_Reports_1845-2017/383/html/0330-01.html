Jowett, and Jonathan Jowett, the father of Lee A. Jowett, are the plaintiffs in this action. Lee was killed and Jonathan burned by a bolt of electricity from the wires of the defendant, the Pennsylvania Power Company. The Jowetts lived in a house on the east side of Mill Street, in Clarksville, Mercer County, extending 36 feet along the street and of a depth of 18 feet; the distance from the ground to the peak of the roof was approximately 22 feet. Along the street was a line of poles on which were strung four wires belonging to the defendant company and two to <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>the Bell Telephone Company. Of the defendant’s wires the top ones, which were primary or distribution wires, carried a charge of 7200 volts; the lower ones were service lines supplying the street lighting in Clarksville and carried only about 115 volts. Defendant’s wires were installed in 1938 under permission of an ordinance of the municipality; they were at a height of about 39 feet above the ground and 22 feet above the peak of the roof of the house.</p>
    <p id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.4",384,[234,832,1159,1257]]]'>At some time during the Christmas week of 1951 the Jowetts installed an aerial on the south side of their house. It consisted of two pieces of ordinary galvanized pipe one and a quarter to one and a half inches in diameter; one of the pieces was 21 feet long and the other 26 feet 6 inches, and they were connected by a threaded coupling one and three quarters inches in length. The overall length of the pipe being 47 feet 6 inches it therefore projected some 25 feet above the roof; the coupling was a foot below the ridge of the roof. The pipe was placed on a piece of slag in a hole about a foot and a half below the surface; it was fastened against the side of the house by two metal clamps or “U” bolts, one midway between the ground and the roof, the other at or immediately below the roof. Near the top were the cross-pieces or prongs of the antenna which made up the receiving apparatus and each of which extended out 4 feet 7 inches. The entire aerial was secured in its erect position by the two clamps and by four guy wires, one to each corner of the roof; these were fastened to the aerial about 3 feet below the bottom of the antenna or some 8 feet below the top of the mast.</p>
    <p id="b384-5" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[234,2109,1152,212]],["BL_385.1",385,[200,339,1152,1102]]]'>On January 18, 1952, as the result of a severe windstorm the southeast guy wire was torn loose from the aerial, and two days later the two Jowett men set out to repair it. Since the prospective reattachment of the <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>guy wire to the antenna would have been at a considerable height above the roof the Jowetts planned to lower the antenna so that it could be the more easily reached; to this end they planned to lift the pipe from out of the ground and move the bottom of it away from the wall until the top would be brought down sufficiently for their purpose. They loosened the lower of the two clamps but neglected to remove the upper one. They extended the size of the hole in order to facilitate the raising of the pipe and were in the act of lifting it and drawing the butt away from the wall when it broke at the coupling immediately below the roof. It appeared later that the two lengths of pipe had been coupled together in an extremely defective fashion in that, while one of them extended into the coupling an inch and a quarter, the other had been screwed in only about a quarter of an inch. Who had coupled the two pieces together in the first instance or to what extent, if any, the Jowetts had knowledge of the defect does not appear in the testimony.</p>

It appeared that Jonathan Jowett, the father, 52 years of age, had been engaged for 25 years in the business of installing neon signs and therefore accustomed to working with electricity, while Lee Jowett, 31 years of age, had also been 7 years in the neon sign business. Jonathan Jowett, the survivor, testified that he did not know that the two top <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>lines which ran in front of the house were high voltage lines.</p>

Plaintiffs do not claim that the wires were in undue proximity to the.house or that they should have been insulated; (it was-testified that such insulation would have been impracticable). The only ground on which they assert a liability of defendant was its failure to warn them that two of its wires were carrying so high a voltage that contact therewith would have been extremely dangerous if not fatal. It was brought out in the testimony that defendant had written a number of letters to various property owners having antennae above their roofs warning them of the proximity of the high tension wires and of the possible danger of the antennae breaking or being blown over by a storm into contact with defendant’s lines, and plaintiffs contend that defendant should have given similar notice to them after it knew or should have known of the location of their antenna. In that connection they attempted to show that one of defendant’s meter readers, who incidentally was charged with the duty of reporting any construction that might be considered a hazard, actually or presumably saw plaintiffs’ antenna á couple of weeks before the accident happened. Defendant denies this, but even if we were to assume that it did know, or should have known, of the existence of the aerial, was there any <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>duty upon it to give the warning claimed by .plaintiffs? Being at a distance of some 22 feet from defendant’s lines, the antenna was apparently well out of harm’s way under all normal and likely conditions. What defendant might have been bound to take into consideration was the possibility that the antenna might, through some natural cause or agency, come into ■ contact with their wires, but it was certainly not obliged to anticipate that <em>human </em>intervention, aided by the existence of a careless defective coupling, would bring about an accident such as that which happened.</p>

Thus in <em>Geroski v. Allegheny County Light Co., </em><a href="/pa/247/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="247 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="1009464" data-case-paths="/pa/247/0304-01">247 Pa. 304</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20A.%20338" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="93 A. 338">93 A. 338</a>, it was held that an electric company maintaining heavily charged wires 29 feet from the ground and 12 feet from a building could not reasonably be held to anticipate that the janitor of the building in attempting to hoist a flag on a pole by means of a copper wire would manipulate the wire from his position on the ground in such manner as to bring it in close proximity to the electric wires, thereby resulting in a shock causing his death. There are several cases cited in the opinion in that case of somewhat similar nature in which a defendant electric company was likewise exculpated from liability. In <em>Mirnek v. West Penn Power Co., </em><a href="/pa/279/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="279 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1083571" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0188-01">279 Pa. 188</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20769" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="123 A. 769">123 A. 769</a>, it was held that the defendant was not required to foresee that that which had been safe would become harmful by reason of the action of a third party, and that, in the erection and maintenance of its poles, wires, and other appliances, it was bound to anticipate only such com<a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>binations of circumstances, and accidents and injuries therefrom, as it might reasonably forecast as likely to happen. Thus, in <em>Trout v. Philadelphia Electric Co., </em><a href="/citations/?q=286%20Pa.%20506" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="286 Pa. 506">286 Pa. 506</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20967" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="84 A. 967">84 A. 967</a>, where a boy, endeavoring to detach a kite from an electric wire strung some 4 feet from the cornice of his house, threw a string over the wire in order to pull it towards him and received a shock which resulted in his death, the court said (p. 509, A. p. 968) : “The act of the boy in getting hold of the wire was wholly unrelated to any act of the defendant in connection therewith. Had the wire been so close to the house that the boy might naturally have come in contact with it while playing about the roof, it might be contended that its condition was the proximate cause of his death. But such was not the case; . . . The boy could have run and played all over the roof without the possibility of his coming in contact with these wires. It was an original independent act of the deceased which could not reasonably have been anticipated that brought about this most sad accident, and the act was not induced by or did not follow as a natural sequence to any negligence of the defendant in connection with its wires. Under such circumstances there could be no recovery, and the defendant was entitled to binding instructions as requested.”</p>

The present, however, is not such a case. Indeed, concerning defendant’s duty of warning the Jowetts, it is clear that even if such a warning had been given the result would have been the same, because Jonathan Jowett frankly admitted that while, if he had known of the danger of contacting the more highly charged wires he would, in <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>preparing to take the antenna down, have put a hand line on it and tied it to the east side of the house so as to pull the antenna away from the wires, he would have done the same thing if he knew the wires carried a charge of only 500 or even 115 volts; obviously the reason he failed to take any such precaution was because he either was unaware of the defect in the coupling or, knowing of it, carelessly ignored the danger it created. Even if, therefore, there had been any duty on the part of defendant to warn the Jowetts under the circumstances of this case, the failure to give such a warning was not the cause of the accident that occurred. It is true that while the ordinary person is held to know that it is dangerous to come in contact with, or in close proximity to, electric wires and it is his duty to avoid them so far as he may, <em>Haertel v.

But there was necessarily <em>some </em>degree of danger to be recognized by the Jowetts and averted by them as far as possible when they undertook to repair their aerial, and nevertheless they did not act with wise judgment and all possible care in the manner in which they sought to lower the antenna to the roof of the house. In view of the fact, however, that it was not proved that it was they who had coupled the two portions of the pipe when the aerial was originally erected, or that they knew of its condition, it cannot, perhaps, be said that the way in which they at<a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>tempted to repair the antenna was so obviously careless and ill advised that they should be held guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> What is entirely clear is that the actual and proximate cause of the accident was the defective condition of the coupling, which, without proved negligence on the part of either party, broke under handling by the Jowetts and thereby brought about this wholly unanticipated and fortuitous fatal occurrence.</p>

Nevertheless when the two came to repair it, knowing that the guy wire at the southeast corner was loose and that possibly it might faU toward the power lines, they proceeded to lift, one on each side of the pipe. Because three of the wires remained fastened, tension and a drawing of the aerial toward the power lines was bound to ensue as the resultant of forces. The two men did more than lift. They drew the butt of the pipe out from the wall. There was no point in raising the pipe unless they also drew it out from the wall so that the tip would be lowered to a point where it would be within reach of the roof so as to permit reattachment of the guy wires. This induced two new kinds of strain. First the weight of the antenna on the end of the long pipe and the pipe itself would tend to break the pipe as it reached a position near the horizontal; Second, the U bolt at the peak of the roof was not removed or, as far as is disclosed by the evidence, even loosened. To pull the butt of the pipe out and up would require that the clamp bend or break and would add to the strain caused by the weight of the antenna. The pipe actually broke about a foot below the clamp.”</p>

Something comes on at 5:00 kids like.” The repair job was a simple one: it meant lowering the antennae to the roof of the house so that a new guy wire could be attached and anchored, the lead-in wire re-connected, and the aerial re-hoisted. In order to accomplish this operation, Jonathan and Leé lifted the base of the aerial pipe out of the ground, intending to move it horizontally a sufficient distance so as to lower the crest of the aerial within reaching distance on the roof.

Certainly it was not followed in the case at bar, for I cannot assent that it is inconceivable that on any reasonable and legal hypothesis it was impossible for culpable negligence to have been present here. The granting of a nonsuit is one of the most drastic procedures accomplished in a courthouse, and, in my opinion, it should not be invoked unless the plaintiff’s case is so obviously opposed to reason, natural law, and the immutable sequence of cause and effect that it would be folly to consume time deliberating on it. A nonsuit shuts off one-half of the case which, even though coming from the opposing side, might still supply illuminating facts which would assure the ideals of Justice that no one’s cause is being dismissed amid the shadows of indecision and the dusk of troubling doubt.</p>

I fear, however, that the Majority Opinion fails to analyze the case before us in the laboratory of objectivity but disposes of it entirely as a matter of dialectics. In studying this television case we might <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>first contemplate what happened first and then proceed to what happened last. The Majority Opinion I believe operates in the wrong channel of reasoning when it says: “What is entirely clear is that the actual and proximate cause of the accident was the defective condition of the coupling, which, without proved negligence on the part of either party, broke under handling by the Jowetts and thereby brought about this wholly unanticipated and fortuitous fatal occurrence.”</p>

A Mr. Kennedy who occupied one-half of the house inhabited by the Lee Jowetts testified that he thought the tension wires were telephone wires. Wayne Thomas, who often visited at the Jowett’s home was of the impression the high tension wires were the same as the service wires which entered the house. Rev. Johnson, minister of a church close to the Jowetts home, assumed that the high tension wires were no different from the docile wires which supplied the power for his own house.</p>

Yidal, division manager of the Pennsylvania Power Company, testified directly about the hazards of television aerials close to high tension wires: “Q. Is such an aerial remaining upright so long as it remains upright, is it a hazard? A. Yes. Q. Why? A. Because in falling, it might hit the wire.”</p>

Not only was the company passively negligent in this respect; it was actively negligent.

On January 18, 1952, only 12 days before the tragedy, he inspected the meter at the house occupied by Lee Jowett and family but failed to note the presence of the antennae. I submit that this failure on his part to note what was so obvious was a negligent act chargeable to the defendant company under the rule of respondent superior. Although Wiburt testified that he did not see the antennae, his meter book carried a notation on the back of the page dedicated to the house in which the Jowetts lived, namely, “TV Aerial.” This item of evidence was something to be presented to the jury for evaluation in connection with the question of the charge of negligence.</p>

These hypotheses are entirely irrelevant. A litigant may not ask for an adjudication in his favor by conjuring an exaggerated state of affairs and expect a decision on a purposeful hyperbole. We have a specific situation here <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>which, as I view all the facts, reveals, prima faciedly at least, indifference on the part of the defendant company to the safety of people lawfully about their affairs.

It would have been a very simple matter to notify all the company customers to keep their television antennae safely distant from transmission lines. A cheaply printed handbill could have been circulated by the meter readers to the power corporation’s clients, including the Jowetts. The defendant’s failure to take the precautionary measures which the circumstances so obviously dictated, raised, as I view it, a question of fact for the jury as to whether the company had met its responsibility of due care toward those who had the right to expect that due care.</p>

Even if, therefore, there had been any duty on the part of defendant to warn the Jowetts under the circumstances of this case, the failure to give such a warning was not the cause of the accident that occurred.”</p>

Now, Mr. Jowett, I ask you to assume that you know that within 22 feet of this television antenna as erected and as the situation was when you started to work on it with your son, had you known of this danger, how would you have gone about taking this antenna down? A. I would have put a hand line on it, a small rope and tie that other end of the small rope to the east side pulling over toward the east side of the house. Q. And the purpose of that? A. <em>That would never have left the television antenna go over into the wires.”</em>
