However that may be, it is clear especially since Berger v. Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/380/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="380 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="1255961" data-case-paths="/pa/380/0019-01">380 Pa. 19</a>, that generally, whether for the purpose of testing his credibility or to establish value or both, an owner may be asked on cross-examination what he paid for the property and the price at which he offered to sell it if purchase or sale was hot too remote.

In the Berger case the sale was made 3 years and 7 months prior to the condemnation. In that case the majority of <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>the court thought that the cross-examination of the plaintiff on his agreement to sell in July of 1947 for $36,000.00 ‘was particularly allowable . . . because West Brown, a real estate expert for the owners, testified that ... in 1948 . . . his appraisal was $75,000.00 . . . and that his appraisal was the same in 1951 (when the land was condemned) as it was in 1948,’ thus discrediting this witness’ testimony as to his 1951 valuation, since his 1948 valuation was obviously inflated as compared to the selling price in 1947, just one year before and hence clearly not too remote.</blockquote>

The defendant’s witnesses testified that the damage sustained was between $6,000.00 and $10,000.00. The Viewers awarded $13,500.00. In Crumrine v. Washington County Housing Authority, <a href="/pa/376/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="376 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1246193" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0234-01">376 Pa. 234</a>, 238, the court said that the circumstance that the verdict was practically the same as the Viewers’ award tended to show that the verdict was not excessive. In this case the verdict was 2 1/2 times the Viewers’ award which is, we believe, a circumstance tending to show that the verdict was excessive. The fact that a verdict is in excess of a Viewers’ award is not of itself sufficient to support a conclusion that it is excessive. For example in the case of Fisher v. Allegheny County, <a href="/pa/324/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="324 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="1171391" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0471-01">324 Pa. 471</a>, the verdict was sustained although it was approximately 6 times the Viewers’ award. Nevertheless in considering whether or not a verdict is excessive the fact that it greatly exceeds the Viewers’ award is an important circumstance to be considered. We are all familiar with the land which was condemned by the School District in this case and we have read the testimony with care. We are of the opinion that a verdict of $33,750.00 was excessive and was against the weight of the evidence and that in order to accomplish a right and just result the plaintiffs should remit that portion of the verdict in excess of $25,000.00, which we believe would be ample compensation for the damages sustained.</blockquote>

Certainly the testimony supports the trial judge’s statement that the value of the plaintiffs’ property consisted not in its adaptability for a factory site or for farming purposes but for residential building lots. As we see it, there is no conflict between this statement on the part of the trial judge and his affirmation of the defendant’s points for charge which correctly stated the rule of law as to the measure of damages being the difference between the fair market value of the whole tract before and after condemnation and that the Jury are to value the tract as a'whole and not to determine how it could best be divided into building lots and the price at which each lot could be sold.</blockquote>

As we have seen, the plaintiffs purchased the condemned land in 1943-in the name of a corporation known as the Home Construction Company, which was ivholly owned by them. Later, after the effective date of the Act, the plaintiffs had the corporation make a conveyance of the property to them as individuals. It appears from the testimony that plaintiffs’ attorney, without the knowledge of the plaintiffs, made an affidavit showing a nominal consideration at the time the deed from the Home Construction Company to the plaintiffs was offered for record. This was done because the transfer was a ‘straw man’ transaction and no real consideration passed between the grantor and the grantees. It will be noted that the plaintiffs did not offer the deed from the Home Construction Company to themselves in evidence, relying upon the fact that in the defendant’s condemnation resolution of June 2nd, 1952, the plaintiffs were named as owners of the land. This resolution was introduced in evidence.
