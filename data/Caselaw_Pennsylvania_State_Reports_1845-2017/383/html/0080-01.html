An auctioneer was employed to advertise and sell the property, a public sale was held and plaintiff became the purchaser.

Plaintiff bad tbe title examined and made preparation for settlement but defendants refused to accept a tender of tbe balance of tbe purchase money and to deliver a deed for tbe premises.

Both tbe auctioneer (called as plaintiff’s witness) and tbe husband defendant testified that tbe property was not knocked down to plaintiff at tbe auction on bis bid of $8,000, but that tbe auctioneer, tbe plaintiff and tbe husband conferred privately and plaintiff then agreed to pay $8,100 which was tbe least tbe husband would accept. However, tbe chancellor found as a fact that tbe property was knocked down to plaintiff at tbe sale <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>on Ms bid of $8,000, and that Ms subsequent agreement to pay an additional $100 was a voluntary act on bis part. In view of that finding of tbe court tbe transaction must accordingly be regarded as an auction sale and therefore governed by tbe law applicable to such sales. Unfortunately for plaintiff, however, this does not afford him any relief, because it is universally held that sales by auction are within tbe provisions of tbe statute of frauds to tbe same extent as any other sale or contract of sale relating to land: 37 C.J.S. 17, §122; <em>Kurtz v.

Even assuming, however, all these “inferences” to be facts, (although there would seem to be strong evidence to tbe contrary), they never-. <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>theless do not, either individually or collectively, permit of the entry of a decree of specific performance against the wife on the ground of estoppel, since the principle of estoppel may not be invoked against the operation of the statute of frauds: <em>Miranville v.

If not so bound, no theory of estoppel could be set up as an inducement to a chancellor to enter a decree compelling her to convey.’ See also Biesz’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/73/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="73 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="1032307" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0485-01">73 Pa. 485</a>; Burk’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/75/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="75 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1036747" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0141-01">75 Pa. 141</a>. A fortiori, a theory of estoppel may not be set up to divest the wife’s interest where, as here, the property is owned by the entire-ties.” Nor does any general agency arise from the marital relationship or any presumption flow therefrom that either spouse has authority to convey real estate held by the entireties without the other’s joinder therein <em>(Schweitzer v.
