L. 1120) requiring the employment of certain minimum-numbered crews on railroad trains operating in this State. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company (hereinafter to be referred to as the Railroad) saw unconstitutionality in certain sections of the Act and accordingly on June 2, 1937, filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, a Bill in Equity calling for the nullification of Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The Dauphin County Court took extensive testimony on the subject and after due consideration declared that the Railroad was correct in its contentions regarding the enumerated sections. Accordingly it held: “The provisions of Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the said Act of June 1, 1937, P.

      <em> </em>Whether the striking down of the whole Act was simply a <em>lapsus calami </em>or an intentional movement, the action of the Court was clearly a legal error. No Court can invalidate an entire statute because of certain unconstitutional features within' it, when the unconstitutional sections can be severed from the constitutional. Moreover, the Full Crew Act contained a specific severability clause. And then, when the case came up on appeal, this Court said: “As the decree of the Court below strikes down <em>only </em>the sections of the Act noted, there is no need to consider the question of severability.”</p>

In fact it emphasized that point: “It is sufficient for us to hold that Sections <em>2-, </em>4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Act of June 1, 1937, P. L. 1120, as applied to appellee violate Sections 1 and 9 of Article 1, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” However, with the same incomprehensibility aseribable to the action of the lower Court, this Court also enjoined the enforcement of the entire Act, committing an error which glares from the pages of the State Reports as conspicuously as an ink blot. This mispronouncement remained on the records uncorrected for 16 years when on June 8, 1955, the present Attorney General of Pennsylvania, the Honorable Herbert B. Cohen, filed in this Court a Bill of Review praying that this Court “review, modify and amend its <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>final order entered in the above-entitled cause so that the restraining effect thereof shall apply to only those portions of the Act of June 1, 1937, P.

I do not know why. If a court had said that the total of 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 equalled 15, it would be obvious that an error in arithmetic had occurred and the judicial eraser would be brought into play without ceremony and without pause. Throughout the course of the entire litigation, which endured for two years, it was repetitiously asserted that only six of the fifteen sections of the Act were under attack. Everyone agreed that the remaining nine sections were constitutional and effective. But the Court of Dauphin County, after spelling out in so many words that six sections were unconstitutional and nine sections constitutional, threw out quite inexplicably the whole fifteen sections. No one had asked for the jettisoning of the entire cargo of the Act. On the contrary, all parties were of one mind that only six sections were to be condemned.</p>

And it does not even do this unambiguously. It declares that an issue should be framed around Sections 3, 9 and 10 of the Act. This procedure is one which does not add prestige to the Court. The present state of the record imperatively calls for a pronouncement on the constitutionality of the nine controverted sections. Why not now determine that constitutionality?</p>

Thus the same question which is now before us will return, crying for decision, but in the mean-, while much further time will have elapsed, unnecessary expenses will have been incurred, and the law, like a train without an engineer, will be running crazily through danger signals and closed switches, to the bewilderment of the legal profession and the consternation of the lay world.</p>

The Majority advises that the Railroad may present any defense it desires to the action to be launched by the Attorney General, but what defense would it want to present except the very cogent one that this Court has already in an unchanged judgment outlawed Sections 3, 9 and 10?

It argues that the passage of time since the promulgation of the original decree has in itself already made whatever correction the facts may have demanded. In other words the Eailroad proceeds on the theory that time cures all ills. It is true that time may assuage the pain of grief and that scars may dim with the passage of years, but a broken bridge is not repaired with a calendar or repaired by idlers from the land of sloth. If there is an error of substance in a decision of this Court, the law demands and justice dictates that a correction be made, no matter how many years have passed over the crippled viaduct of indifference. It is unthinkable that in criminal law a prisoner would be compelled to serve an erroneous sentence because of a Court’s reluctance to correct records. It should be equally intolerable, if safety of life on the railroads requires, under law, that certain crews be employed, that this legal demand <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>should be ignored because an error has gone undetected, or at least unacted upon for years.</p>

It certainly should not require considerable argument to prove a point so simple. The fact that the error in this case has persisted for 16 years is historically interesting but not legally relevant.

When else does an issue of severbility arise except when only some of the sections of an Act are stricken down as unconstitutional? If none, or all, of the sections of the Act were found to be unconstitutional, the problem of severability would obviously not arise.” The answer to this observation is to be found in the Act itself, which says: “Section 13. <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>The provisions of this act are severable and if any of the provisions hereof are held to be unconstitutional the decision shall not be construed to impair any other provision of this act. It is hereby declared as the legislative intent that this act would have been adopted had such unconstitutional provision not been included herein.”</p>
    <p id="b639-4" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[169,741,1151,538]]]'>Piling paradox on paradox, the Railroad brief, after asserting that this Court’s decision in 1939 was entirely correct, and then declaring it was in error, then goes on to say that this error should not be held to invalidate the result because the Chancellor who made the decision “is no longer on the scene.” It would be most anomalous indeed if justice depended on the immortality of the judges! The law is presumed to be something entirely apart from the personality of the judges who write it.</p>
    <p id="b639-5" data-blocks='[["BL_639.5",639,[170,1300,1154,1046]]]'>A judicial error of far-reaching consequences is involved in the proceedings before us. It would scarcely be consonant with our concept of responsive government for this Court to adopt the rationalization of Lady Macbeth: “What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?” This Court should have <em>sua sponte </em>made the necessary adjustment. Failing in that self-directed rectification, it should not now compound the error by declining to take action when the Commonwealth itself asks for relief from the effects of a blunder made by the highest Court of the Commonwealth. Mr. Justice Simpson spoke well when he said in <em>Erie City’s </em>Appeal, <a href="/pa/297/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="297 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1118204" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0260-01">297 Pa. 260</a>, 270: “The law is a practical science, and, in the absence of statutory inhibition, our courts may take such steps, regarding matters properly before them, as will promote the administration of justice.” The administration of justice calls for the revision indicated. Since this Court refuses to take that action, I dissent.</p>
