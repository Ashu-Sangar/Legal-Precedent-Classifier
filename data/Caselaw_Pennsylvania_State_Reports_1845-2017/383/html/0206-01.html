    <p id="b260-4" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[214,448,1158,1041]]]'>The land was taken under authority of the State Highway Law of 1945, P. L. 1242, 36 PS §670-101, -301, -303, -304, which provides, inter alia: “Before the department [of highways] shall undertake the construction ... or improvement of any State highway, wherein a change of width or of existing lines ... is necessary, and damage is likely to result to abutting property, it shall notify the county commissioners . .. Whenever the county commissioners do not consent to or approve of any such change . . . [the secretary of highways] shall, when possible, enter into an agreement with the <em>owner or owners </em>of said property ... If such agreement cannot be made, the <em>owner or owners </em>. . . may present their . . . petition to the court . . . for the appointment of viewers to ascertain and assess such damages . . . The damages, when ascertained, shall be <em>paid by the Commonwealth </em>...” (Italics supplied). In the instant case, the commissioners did not agree to the change.</p>
    <p id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.5",260,[211,1502,1153,541]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that it is under a duty to compensate only for private property so taken; that the school district is merely an agency of the state holding its property in a public or governmental capacity, and as such may receive compensation only as a matter of grace and not of right; and that the Act did not grant such right to it. That is, since the Legislature in the Act did not “spell out” the school district’s right to compensation, it intended a taking of school property without the duty of payment therefor.</p>

    <p id="b261-3" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[182,629,1155,1045]]]'>In the interpretation of the words “owner or owners” in the Act, certain well-established principles are applicable. We have repeatedly held that, as provided in Sections 51 and 52 of the Statutory Construction Act of 1937, P. L. 1019, 46-PS §§551, 552, “the object of all interpretation and construction of laws is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the Legislature,” <em>(Commonwealth v.

In addition, §33 of the Act, 46 PS §533, provides that “words and phrases shall be construed <em>according to their common and approved usage.” (Otto Milk Company v. Washington City, </em><a href="/pa/363/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="363 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1221649" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0243-01">363 Pa. 243</a>, 249, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="69 A.2d 399">69 A. 2d 399</a>.)

    <p id="b261-5" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[181,1686,1153,373]]]'>It is to be noted at the outset that Section 703 of the School Code, 24 PS §7-703, provides that lands may be acquired by school districts and title thereto may vest in the district in fee simple. Thus it cannot be questioned that this School District is the “owner . . . of said property damaged” by the taking for highway purposes.</p>
    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[180,2073,1152,271]],["BL_262.1",262,[242,360,1155,598]]]'>The Act of 1945, supra, does not contain any provision specifically declaring that compensation shall be paid only to private owners of property,. nor does it anywhere limit the meaning of “owner or owners.” It grants the right to <em>all </em>owners, without distinction <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>or exception. The school district satisfies all of the requirements of status as “owner,” according to its “common and approved usage,” and must be compensated for its loss. To hold otherwise would lead to a highly absurd and, to the district, costly results. We cannot believe, for example, that school buildings costing many thousands of dollars can be destroyed for highway purposes and yet the Legislature not have intended that the loss be paid to the district. The Act imposed upon the Commonwealth liability for payment to all owners, including this school district.</p>
