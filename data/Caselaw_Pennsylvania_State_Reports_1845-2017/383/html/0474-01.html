At 6:45 p.m. on that day the Trial Judge completed his instructions to the jury without having had to use the two alternates. It became his duty, then, at that moment, to discharge the alternates, as the Act mandatorily directs. Prom that instant the alternates had no more right to sit with the jury than did the spectators in the courtroom. The two alternates in this case never really formed part of the jury. They were, as it were, vice-jurors, and could not function as jurors any more than vice-presidents or lieutenant-governors may act in an executive capacity unless their principals die or are disabled.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.7",528,[231,1960,1151,265]],["BL_529.1",529,[172,354,1156,1589]]]'>It needs no citation of authority to show that a case is “submitted” to the jury when the Judge completes his charge. The Judge, therefore, properly declared at the termination of his instructions that the services of the two alternates “will no longer be required on <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>this jury.” At this point the two alternates were no more privileged to participate in the trial than plumbers have the prerogative to remain to dine and socialize with the family after they have completed the repair work for which they were called. But the learned Trial Judge here, instead of thanking and bidding the alternates good-night and good-bye, as he should have done, invited them — unquestionably in a spirit of hospitality, cordiality and good nature — to have dinner with the jury. This was error. He then compounded the error by adding that: “I am certain that they [the alternates] will be interested in the outcome that will be arrived at by their colleagues in the jury box.” As a matter of reality, the original twelve were no longer colleagues of the two alternates. With the ending of the trial, the law intends that the jury shall disappear behind a curtain which is to be impenetrable not only to alternates but to the entire world as well. By declaring that the alternates would “be interested in the outcome,” the Judge suggested, unintentionally of course, that the alternates had a <em>right </em>to have that interest satisfied. But, so far as the law is concerned, the interest of the alternates could arise no higher than the general curiosity of the public, of which they were now an intermingled part. The fact that the Judge said: “Do not discuss the case until you retire to the jury room” did not scrape off the patina of authority which covered his declaration that the alternates were “interested in the outcome.”</p>
    <p id="b529-4" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[171,1966,1153,376]],["BL_530.1",530,[235,355,1151,364]]]'>Did the two alternates take advantage of the fraternization with the twelve at dinner to ascertain what that outcome was to be? The record does not state how long the dinner lasted but it does not seem that the overall deliberations of the jury were very lengthy since the verdict was returned at 11 p.m. Nor was there any formal truncation of the association between <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>the alternates and the jurors. The alternates were authorized to go to dinner with the jurors, but no one in authority supervised the dinner, and no one specified the time that the alternates were to depart. This obviously was a very loose manner in which to handle a vital matter which concerned the liberty of a person on trial.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[236,740,1151,598]]]'>What happened at the dinner? For eight days the two alternates had associated with the jury. In eight days a very friendly relationship can and does usually develop among Americans who are engaged in a common enterprise, somewhat detached from the rest of the workaday world. Can it be said, in view of this type of camaraderie, that on the last day, as the fourteen sat at the friendly dinner table, they all sealed their lips on the subject which had been their constant source of profound interest for the preceding eight days?</p>
    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[235,1351,1153,866]]]'>Knowing human nature as we do, can it be said that as the fourteen companions buttered their bread, salted their soup, ketehuped their meat, and peppered their vegetables, no one added the spice of a comment on the case which had been their fare for eight days? And during those last few moments at the table, as the two alternates drained their coffee cups and pushed away the dessert plates, is it consistent with everyday experience to assume that not a word was spilled on the drama they had been witnessing, and in which to a great extent they had participated for eight days? And if there was only one reference to the case, the defendant is entitled to a new trial because the two former alternate jurors were no more entitled to speak to the twelve jurors on the case than were the waiters who served them their food.</p>
    <p id="b530-6" data-blocks='[["BL_530.6",530,[235,2239,1151,99]],["BL_531.1",531,[176,339,1157,1481]]]'>Moreover, the granting of a new trial does not depend on proof that the two alternates actually did dis<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>cuss the case with their former colleagues. It is enough to vitiate the trial that they had the <em>opportunity </em>to discuss it. In the monumental case of <em>Commonwealth v. Krick, </em><a href="/pa-super/164/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="164 Pa. Super. 516" data-case-ids="465681" data-case-paths="/pa-super/164/0516-01">164 Pa. Superior Ct. 516</a>, 521, two alternate jurors went into the jury room with the other twelve and remained there ten minutes. It was argued in that case that there was no proof that the two had improperly discussed the evidence with the original twelve, but in ordering a new trial the Superior Court very fairly and courageously said: “We have no way of knowing whether the alternates deliberated with the other twelve during those ten minutes or in any way influenced their decision, but we cannot say with fair assurance that the error was harmless ... To allow the alternates <em>any opportunity </em>to deliberate with the others after the case had been submitted was a direct violation of the Act, and constitutes reversible error.” It cannot be denied and it is not denied that the alternates here had the <em>opportunity </em>to discuss the case with the original twelve. Therefore, unless the <em>Krick </em>case is overruled, which it is not, it is incomprehensible to me how the decision in this case can stand. The facts before us on this appeal are even stronger than they were in the <em>Krick </em>case since the jurors here spent at least an illegal hour with their former colleagues whereas in the <em>Krick </em>case the improper commingling was limited to ten minutes.</p>
    <p id="b531-3" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[174,1842,1154,489]],["BL_532.1",532,[243,345,1148,100]]]'>Under the ruling in the case of <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Darcy v.

With a cloak thus drawn over their conversations, it is as logical to assume that the alternates and jurors did the normal thing and did discuss the case at mealtime as it is to assume that they closed their minds and their mouths on the subject. Certainly it is unfair to deny attorneys the right to ñnd out ex<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>actly what happened and then conclusively hold that the alternates did not speak to the twelve on the case.</p>

Since this Court now holds that the alternates may remain with the jurors even after the termination of the Court’s instructions, the legal profession must assume that the Supreme Court now rules a case is not submitted to a jury at the end of the charge, but that the submission may wait until the jury has dined. And if, for any reason, the instructions end at a late hour and the dinner comes still later and the jury retires for slumber, beginning their deliberations the following morning, will it be proper for the two alternates to sleep in the dormitory with the other jurors until the next morning? And if submission of a case no longer coincides with the ending of the Court’s instructions, does this now mean that the trial remains open after the Judge’s charge — even to the extent that the parties may yet introduce further testimony?</p>

As soon as the Judge completed his charge, the jury took over. Under the decision in this case, however, the line of demarcation has dimmed and perhaps disappeared entirely. Are we to understand that there will now be an interregnum between the two jurisdictions? Is there to be an interval where the Court has lost control and the autonomy of the jury has not yet begun? And does it mean that during that twilight zone any<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>one can dine with the jury, talk to the jury, or play with the jury?

The accused had the right to be tried on his own record and not on what the entire Republican Party might or might not have done in 69 years.

Since the witnesses would be testifying against the various defendants on trial, of whom Roy Dixon was one, it could only be inferred that the killers would be the defendants or other killers operating in their behalf. This monstrous charge by the assistant district attorney could not possibly be cured by any instruction from the Court. Even so, as against this flagrant breach of propriety and this inexcusable imputation of conspiratorial murder, the Court merely cautioned the jury to “ignore the last few words spoken by Mr. Crippins.” What were the “last few words?” At this instant an imperious duty devolved upon the Trial Judge either to declare a mistrial or to explain in easily-understood language that the Assistant District Attorney was out of order, that <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>the Court would protect all witnesses, and that there was no evidence that the defendant would or could do the witnesses any harm.

There is scarcely a more serious charge that could be brought against any litigant in a court of laAV; and it must now remain an enigma in the State Reports how the Majority of this Court could allow so gross a dereliction to go uncorrected.</p>
