L. 1594, 31 PS §407 et seq., in that they had in their possession with intent to sell and have sold a product alleged to be an inferior simulation of ice cream. The product is known by the generic name of “ice milk”. Ice milk is made of the same ingredients as is ice cream except that the finished product (herein called Malt-A-Plenty base) normally contains 3% to 5%% butterfat by weight and does not contain any flavoring or coloring. The Tnini-mnm butterfat content for ice cream as required by the lee Cream Law is 10%.</p>

The chancellor found that Sun Ray Drug Company sells Malt-A-Plenty only as a dairy drink. To make the drink the Malt-A-Plenty base is combined with an equal quantity of whole milk, flavoring, and also, if the customer so desires, malted milk powder. These ingredients are mixed with a beater and served to the customer as a thick liquid drink called Malt-A-Plenty. The chancellor found, that there is no difference between the taste of a Malt-A-Plenty drink so prepared and a conventional milk shake made with ice cream. A Malt-APlenty drink costs 24 cents, and a milk shake made with ice cream costs 30 cents.</p>

Burt of Tulsa, Oklahoma, a past president of the National Association of Retail Ice Cream Manufacturers, who originated the drink. His testimony was undisputed. Burt has for some time been the president of a company which operates retail ice cream stores. He noticed that the sale of conventional milk shakes was falling off in his retail stores and determined that the reason was that the heavy milk fat content of milk shakes made with ice cream bloated the customer and made him feel uncomfortable. By experiment Burt discovered that if the milk fat content of the drink Avas decreased to the same milk fat content of whole milk, the bloating and discomfort disappeared. A formula Avas arrived upon which gave this desired result and the product was put on sale in Burt’s stores in 1937. Burt’s experience was that many customers preferred the Malt-A-Plenty drink because it was easier to digest and non-fattening. Starting in 1939 Burt began to sell generally the Malt-A-Plenty powder which is the basic constituent of ice milk. Milk drinks made from Malt-A-Plenty base became widely popular and by 1953 Burt sold enough <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>powder to make 8,000,000 gallons of ice milk and of course many times that many million ice milk drinks. Throughout the United States there were 17,000,000 gallons of ice milk sold in 1950 and over 45,000,000 gallons sold in 1951. The drink is healthful and nutritious, and there is in this case no contention that it is noxious in any manner.</p>
    <p id="b57-3" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[168,729,1161,1259]]]'>The Pennsylvania Ice Cream Law, supra, in defining ice cream, provides in Section 1: “. . . The finished product shall contain not less than ten per centum (10%) of milk fat by weight . . .”. Section 1 also defines “imitation ice cream” or “ice cream substitute” as “. . . (1) any frozen sweetened product regardless of the name under which it is manufactured, sold, or offered for sale, which is made in imitation or semblance of or is manufactured in a manner similar to the process used in manufacturing but is not ice cream, custard ice cream, french ice cream, frozen custard, sherbet, ice, fruit ice, frozen ice confection or frozen sherbet confection, as defined in this act, . . .”. The Act then requires custard ice cream, french ice cream, french custard and frozen custard to conform to the standard of ice cream as defined and in addition to contain not less than 1.4% of egg yolk solids. Sherbet is required to contain not less than 3% and not more than 5% of milk solids.

    <p id="b58-4" data-blocks='[["BL_58.4",58,[244,1065,1154,1040]]]'>In order to define the issue it is necessary to distinguish between the Malt-A-Plenty base and the Malt-A-Plenty drink. The base is manufactured by appellants Galletta and Nasuti in Philadelphia by adding skim milk powder, sugar and water to a mixture of Malt-A-Plenty powder and cream, and freezing the resulting compound. When delivered to retailers, such as appellant Sun Ray Drug Company, it is a solid or semisolid substance similar to ice cream in texture, consistency and appearance. The Malt-A-Plenty drink is what is commonly known as a milk shake and, as previously stated, is made by the retailer by adding to the base whole milk, flavoring, and, optionally, malted milk powder. This mixture is agitated with a beater and served as a thick liquid. The milk drink is called Malt-A-Plenty or Shake-O-Malt by appellant Sun Ray Drug Company, but is also known by various other names such as Shake-A-Mighty, Jumbo Shake, and Drink-A-Plenty.</p>

The evidence <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>discloses that the contents of a conventional milk shake vary with the desires of individual customers, and may include no ice cream or several dips of ice cream as specified by the customer. The chancellor found that the public expects a thick, rich soda fountain drink to be made with ice cream, and that the use of Malt-A-Plenty base in a milk shake may lead to deception of the customer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Ice Cream Law does not refer to milk shakes, ice cream milk drinks, or any liquid drinks whatever. There is in Pennsylvania no statutory definition of a milk shake or standard for its ingredients. Since the Ice Cream Law does not regulate in any manner the sale of milk shakes, it furnishes no basis for an injunction against the sale of a particular type of milk shake which is admitted to be wholesome and nutritious: Cf. <em>Mayo v. Rice, </em><a href="/citations/?q=160%20Fla.%20775" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="160 Fla. 775">160 Fla. 775</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20So.%202d%20705" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="37 So. 2d 705">37 So. 2d 705</a> (1948). The Commonwealth has laid great stress upon the possibility of deception in this case, and this contention will be considered at length later in this opinion. Although possibility of deception has no bearing upon the sale of milk shakes as a violation of the Ice Cream Law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> it is interesting <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>to note that there is absolutely no evidence of deception in this case concerning the sale of the Malt-APlenty drink. The cups in which it is sold describe it as “that Delicious Ice Milk Dairy Drink”, the price is 20% less than the price of a milk shake made with ice cream, and there is no evidence that any customer who asked for a milk shake or an ice cream milk shake was served a Malt-A-Plenty drink. Although the Commonwealth produced evidence that three investigators after ordering a Malt-A-Plenty drink questioned the counter girls and were told that the drinks contained ice cream, no confusion or deception resulted since these investigators already knew that the drink was made from the Malt-A-Plenty base and not ice cream. It is significant that there is not a word of testimony as to any confusion resulting from the use of Malt-A-Plenty base in the preparation of the ice milk drink.</p>
    <p id="b60-4" data-blocks='[["BL_60.5",60,[243,1295,1152,598]]]'>We now must consider the application of the Ice Cream Law to the sale and possession of the Malt-APlenty base. Since Malt-A-Plenty base contains only 3% to 5% butterfat it is below the minimum standard for ice cream. It is also manufactured in a manner similar to the process used in manufacturing ice cream, and is kept by the retailer in a cabinet which contains Malt-A-Plenty base as well as ice cream. In these circumstances the Ice Cream Law, if applicable as held by the court below, would make the sale or possession of Malt-A-Plenty base illegal.</p>
    <p id="b60-5" data-blocks='[["BL_60.6",60,[242,1906,1148,98]],["BL_61.1",61,[162,344,1163,1931]]]'>Appellants contend that the Ice Cream Law, as applied to the facts of this case by the court below is <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>unconstitutional as an arbitrary taking of property rights in violation of Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. There is, of course, a presumption that the Ice Cream Law is constitutional: <em>Hadley’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/336/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="336 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1195629" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0100-01">336 Pa. 100</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20874" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 A.2d 874">6 A. 2d 874</a>. Appellees argue that in addition to the presumption, the constitutionality of the Ice Cream Law was judicially determined in <em>Commonwealth v. Crowl, </em><a href="/pa-super/52/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="52 Pa. Super. 539" data-case-ids="432846" data-case-paths="/pa-super/52/0539-01">52 Pa.

S. 153</a>, which considered the constitutionality of the Act of March 24, 1909, P. L. 63, the statutory predecessor of the present Ice Cream Law. The Act of 1909, supra, prohibited the sale of ice cream with less than <em>8% </em>butterfat content. That case involved a conviction under the statute for selling hokey-pokey, an imitation product, <em>as- ice cream. </em>In discussing the application of the police power to the legislative determination of standards for food products, the Supreme Court of the United States said (p. 159) : “. . . Laws designed to prevent persons from being misled in respect to the weight, measurement, quality or ingredients of an article of general consumption are a common exercise of the police power. The legislature defines the standard article or fixes some of its characteristics; and it may conclude that fraud or mistake can be effectively prevented only by prohibiting the sale of the article <em>tmder the usual trade </em>name, if it fails to meet the requirements of the standard set. . .”. (Emphasis supplied). In the instant case there was no sale or attempt to sell Malt-A-Plenty base as “ice cream”. The <em>Growl </em>case is, therefore, not determinative of the constitutional issue presented in this appeal, and it must be considered as a case of first impression.</p>

      <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>The scope of the police power of the Commonwealth is necessarily very broad.

There is, therefore, no unqualified right to acquire, possess, and enjoy property if the exercise of the right is inimical to the fundamental precepts underlying the police power. . .”. However, the basis of every exercise of the police power must be to promote or maintain the health, safety or general welfare of the public: <em>White’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/287/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="287 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1099652" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0259-01">287 Pa. 259</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.%20409" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="134 A. 409">134 A. 409</a>. Since it is admitted by all the parties to this appeal that Malt-A-Plenty base is a healthful, nutritious product, the validity of the Ice Cream Law as here applied cannot rest upon its effect as a health or safety measure. In order to render restraint of the sale or possession of the Malt-A-Plenty base constitutional, such action must be in the public interest in the furtherance of the common good or general welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth.</p>

The question whether any particular statutory provision is so related to the public good and so reasonable in the means it prescribes as to justify the exercise of the police power, is one for the judgment, in the first instance, of the law-making branch of the government, but its final determination is for the courts’ ”. In the <em>Cott </em>case this Court also recognized the rule that the sale of an article may be wholly restricted by statute even though it is not harmful for public consumption if there is danger of fraud or deception of the public in substituting an imitation article for the genuine.</p>

As has been previously pointed out, <em>Commonwealth v. Growl, </em>supra, did not go that far. It merely sustained the legislation as constitutional on the assumption that it prohibited the sale of such products <em>as ice cream </em>where such products have less than the minimum butterfat content.

Where either of these conditions exist, the Legislature clearly may regulate or prohibit the sale of such products. In the instant case it is admitted that the product involved is healthful and nutritious so that protection of the public health cannot provide the basis here. Nor is there any confusion on the part of the retailers who purchase the Malt-A-Plenty base. They order it as such and it is delivered in containers plainly labeled as to the contents. It is sold to the public only as a constituent part of a milk drink. There is no evidence in this record of sale or attempts to sell Malt-A-Plenty base to a customer in that form as ice cream. However, the contention of the Commonwealth is that some unscrupulous retailers <em>may </em>sell the base as vanilla ice cream. In order to do so, it of course would be essential that there be sufficient similarity in the taste of the base and the ice cream.</p>

He made no finding as to the taste of the base. He did find that Edward Reese, a chemist, and expert witness for the Commonwealth and the intervenor, <em>testified </em>that he could distinguish Malt-A-Plenty base from vanilla ice cream only by making a chemical analysis. This does not resolve the question as to the taste of the Malt-A-Plenty base. Reese also testified that the taste of the base and vanilla ice cream were very similar but the chancellor made no specific finding on this point. It is highly significant that appellees presented no testimony by customers or consumers of ice cream as to the taste of Malt-A-Plenty base. The taste of an article of food in common use, such as ice cream <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>or ice milk, does not require expert testimony. In tlie absence of any customer testimony on the question of the taste of Malt-A-Plenty base, the chancellor properly refrained from basing a finding of similarity in taste solely upon the testimony of the expert witness. Mr. Burt, witness for appellants, testified that in the absence of flavoring or coloring in the Malt-A-Plenty base, it was impractical to use it in any way other than in the milk drink where flavoring was added. In a footnote to the adjudication the chancellor stated that he had personally examined and tasted the Malt-APlenty base, and commented upon the similarity in appearance, texture and consistency of the base to vanilla ice cream, but again did not refer to its taste. In the same footnote the chancellor stated that the base could readily be substituted for vanilla ice cream “in a mixed dairy drink”. It is therefore clear that the findings of the chancellor are limited to possible confusion in the use of Malt-A-Plenty base in a milk shake. In these circumstances and in the absence of evidence of any sales of the Malt-A-Plenty base as ice cream, this Court must conclude that since flavoring must be added to the base in order to use it in a milk drink, the absence of flavoring would so affect the taste that any attempt to sell the base qua base as ice cream would be readily detected, and therefore there is no such possibility of deception or confusion on the part of the public as to justify employment of the police power of the Commonwealth to restrain appellants in the sale of this product. In the absence of a reasonable basis for the restraint upon the exercise of private property rights, a statute which is construed to restrict those rights must be held to be unconstitutional as so construed: <em>Weaver v.

In the absence of any evidence of customer confusion between Malt-A-Plenty base and ice cream and of any sales of Malt-A-Plenty base as ice cream, its possession or manufacture may not be restrained. The police power may be exercised only in the public interest and may not be used as a device to restrain fair competition.
