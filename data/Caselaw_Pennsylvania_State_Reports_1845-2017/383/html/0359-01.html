On several occasions prior to March 10, 1953, he had talked with plaintiff relative to payment of the note, and did not then deny authority. He was advised in writing by plaintiff’s attorney on March 10, 1953, that he had his “judgment note . . . for collection [which] provides for an attorney collection fee . . .

Gagnon and agreed to pay an additional $15,000 for 18,000 bushels of potatoes. This sea of potatoes spread through a large warehouse in Newfield Junction, Pennsylvania, but, like any other extensive mass, offered only its surface to inspection and appraisement. When Kuzneski prepared to haul away his acquired goods, he discovered that the lower layers of potatoes were in a state of advanced deterioration and quite different from what had met his eye in looking over the outer expanse of what he had purchased. The deeper he penetrated into the twelve-foot depth, the worse he found the tubers to be. He asked Gagnon for an adjustment based on an acknowledgement of the inferior product he had sold him. Gag-non conceded that he hadn’t thought the potatoes were “that bad” but referred Mm to his partner Warren Anderson who, after several conversations, referred him back to Gagnon who then observed that Anderson “is just pushing the buck on me.”</p>

A hearing was held on the rule to show cause, and considerable testimony was taken, but. the lower Court refused to open the judgment. The majority of this Court has affirmed the action of the Court below. I believe this to be error.

    <p id="b422-6" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[233,788,1158,1033]]]'>Clifton Erway, farmer for 30 years, testified “Q. Do you know what a frozen potato looks like? A. Yes. Q. Will you tell us if potatoes are near the surface of the ground or in the ground prior to harvesting when there is a freeze, does it affect the potato? A. Yes. Q. What is that effect? A. It softens them, they decay. Q. Are they then marketable as potatoes? A. Not as eating potatoes.” He described the potatoes as a “wet mess” and, like Kosa, asserted it was impossible to grade them. Pie carted away about 600 bushels to feed to his cows, but even the cows declined to accept the article as fit for bovine sustenance and rumination: “I tried to clean them up, and at the last they gave me all the seconds and thirds and we took them to the creek and tried to wash them and get the rot out of them and after I washed them I put them in the bin in the barn but if I didn’t get them fed within a week, they weren’t good because they would rot within a week.”</p>

And what did you see exactly? A. Well, it looked as though you took a sack of lime and wet it and dumped it on top of them and run down over them — that’s as close as I could tell you. It was just a sticky mess. They had their gloves on and it was a wet, nasty mess. Q. Prom what you saw could they be sold on the market as potatoes? A. Well, I never could sell any such thing. Q. Would <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>you be able to say that any part of wbat you saw was gradeable, that is economically gradeable for sale? A. No absolutely not — you couldn’t tell what was good from what was bad.”</p>

    <p id="b423-6" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[189,888,1153,211]]]'>Eichard Billings, farmer for 40 years, testified that it was his estimate that 60% of the potatoes were frozen. He described the frozen potatoes as “soft and they were like a rot.”</p>
    <p id="b423-7" data-blocks='[["BL_423.6",423,[189,1111,1154,269]]]'>My study of the record leads me to the observation that the plaintiff Edward F. Gagnon did not sell the defendants potatoes — what he sold them was a lawsuit; but the action of the Majority of this Court has deprived the defendants of even that precarious boon.</p>
    <p id="b423-8" data-blocks='[["BL_423.7",423,[188,1392,1155,487]]]'>The Majority asserts that there is nothing in the case which calls “for any alteration of its [the bill of sale] terms by oral evidence.” What we are concerned with here is whether Gagnon lived up to the implied warranty of merchantability of the goods he sold. And in this respect, as pointed out in <em>Frigidinners v. Branchtown Gun Club, </em><a href="/pa-super/176/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="176 Pa. Super. 643" data-case-ids="723068" data-case-paths="/pa-super/176/0643-01">176 Pa.

    <p id="b423-9" data-blocks='[["BL_423.8",423,[191,1892,1152,436]]]'>In that same case the Court said: “For the purpose of the rule to open judgment the appellee was only required to show that it had good defense in whole or in part of the claim in which the judgment was founded. Once this requirement was met, it became the duty of the Court below to open the judgment and allow the appellee to definitely prove its case by proper evidence before a jury.”</p>

      <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>The parol evidence rule on which the Majority relies in this connection is not so inflexible as the Majority infers. Williston’s Contracts (Yol. <em>2, </em>sec. 643, p. 1244), speaks to the subject as follows: “The basis of the parol evidence rule is that it must be assumed that when the parties contracted in regard to a certain matter and reduced their agreement to writing, the writing expressed their, whole agreement in regard to that matter. <em>This reasoning is obviously inapplicable to a situation where an obligation is imposed by law irrespective of any intention to contract. </em>Such is frequently the case with warranties. Therefore, if a buyer is induced by positive statements of fact to enter into a written contract for the purchase of goods, there seems no reason why these statements should not be admitted in evidence.”</p>
    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[226,1220,1151,367]]]'>The defendants in the present proceedings do not ask for Outright liberation from their judgment note. They only seek an opportunity to present facts which will show that they were deceived into spending $30,-000 for potatoes that never had a chance. It would appear, insofar as this case is concerned, that the defendants have encountered the same fate.</p>
