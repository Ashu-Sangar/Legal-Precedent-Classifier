In consideration of this loan, defendant agreed to purchase from plaintiff exclusively all gasoline and oil used or sold at the service station in question for three years. Defendant subsequently sold his garage and service station, and plaintiff sued for the loss of profits it would have realized on the sale of gasoline and oil to defendant from the date of the breach of contract to the end of the period it had yet to run. The defense was that the agreement to purchase gasoline and oil made the contract usurious. This Court said on page 55: “The present contract was clearly for the mutual benefit of both parties, plaintiff anticipating a profit from the sale of the gasoline and oil to defendants, and defendants, in turn, anticipating a profit from the sale of the same products to their customers. <em>Contracts of this character are usual in this </em>State, and, so far as we have discovered, no one has heretofore questioned the mutuality of obligations incurred by the respective parties Under our view of the case, as <em>expressed above, these are mutual covenants which furnish a valid considerar tion </em>for the contract aside from the loan of money, and, accordingly, the argument that the contract is necessarily usurious if damages for its breach are recovered must fail. Apart from the loan, therefore, the contract was complete, mutual and sustained by ample consideration. <em>The mere fact that one who loans money with interest is induced to do so by an independent contract relating to collateral matters does not render the loan usurious, </em>even though the borrower would not have entered into the collateral contract except on condition that the loan be granted.
