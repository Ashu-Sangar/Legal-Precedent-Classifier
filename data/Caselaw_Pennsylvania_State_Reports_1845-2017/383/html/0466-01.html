Houston died intestate, January 25, 1953, survived by her three children, Joseph D. Houston, Matilda A. Haw, and Margaret Clemens as hér heirs-át-law , . . Letters of Administra<a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>tion on the decedent’s estate were granted on February 5, 1953 to First National Bank in Greensburg . . . The administrator duly proceeded with the administration of the estate and on September 18, 1953, filed its account showing a balance for distribution of $26,286.75. Anna R. Houston, by a written Bill of sale dated March 1, 1941, duly signed, sealed and witnessed, and reciting a consideration of 'natural love and affection and other valuable considerations and the sum of One ($1.00) Dollar’, transferred to her son, Joseph D. Houston, her one-half interest in a partnership, known as Latrobe News Company . . . The value of the one-half interest of Anna R. Houston was $11,000.00 at the time of the transfer to Joseph D. Houston . . . The profits of the partnership due to Joseph D. Houston after March 1, 1941 were paid by checks to his order but by arrangement between Joseph D. Houston and his mother, Anna R. Houston, she received her support from the income from the business ... On the same date as the transfer of the partnership interest to Joseph D. Houston, March 1, 1941, the decedent went to the office of an attorney, George H. McWherter, Esq. and gave instructions for the drawing of her will. The draught of the will Avas mailed to her by the attorney. This proposed will was offered in evidence. . . . The decedent took the form for her Avill to neighbors, told them it Avas her will and had them sign it as witnesses and placed the paper in her safety deposit box. She never signed this paper . . . The proposed Avill of the decedent did not mention the transfer of her interest in the partnership to her son, Joseph D. Houston. This proposed will devised the decedent’s home property to her two daughters, Matilda A. Haw and Margaret J. Clemens and bequeathed the first $9000.00 of personal estate to the two daughters and the balance if any to the three children, Matilda A. Haw, Margaret J. Clemens, and Jo<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>seph D. Houston, equally . . . The decedent made many statements to disinterested parties and to her daughters, at the time of the transfer of the partnership interest to Joseph D. Houston and the incomplete execution of the proposed will, that she had settled her estate and that her son’s share was the interest in the Latrobe News Company and that she had left the house to her daughters . .. The decedent believed that [the paper] was a valid will as shown by her declarations to her daughters and her friends as to the contents thereof, by the fact that she showed the paper to her daughter Margaret as her will and she told her son he was named executor therein.”</p>

In its strict technical sense the law of advancements relates exclusively to cases of intestacy. See Intestate Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 80, sec. 9, 20 PS 1.9.

He contends that since he agreed to be responsible for one-half the debts and losses of the business the transfer was for a valuable consideration and hence constituted a sale. It is to be noted that though the value of the transferred interest was fixed by the parties at $11,000, the income and profit from such share amounted annually to between $3,000 and $4,000, all of which the donor received until her death twelve years later. It is significant that no beneficial interest was, therefore, enjoyed by the son until his mother’s death. It is apparent that the value of the half share of business transferred to the son approximated one-third of the <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>estate. Tbe division of tbe balance of tbe estate between decedent’s two daughters was, therefore, in accordance with tbe presumption that decedent intended an equal distribution among her children. There is no evidence in this record which adequately rebuts this presumption.</p>
