The court decided that no substantial dispute existed upon any material fact.</p>

L. 1163, 20 PS 2080.101 et seq. Section 745 of art. YII of the Act provides that where a substantial dispute shall arise in a will contest the right to a jury trial is a matter of right. In Section 746 (c) of the Act, it is enacted: “Effect of verdict. The verdict of the jury in the orphans’ court shall have the same ef<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>feet as the verdict of a jury in a case at law in a court of common pleas.” The Act, however, does not change the well-established principle that before an issue <em>devismit vel non </em>is granted there must be a judicial determination that a substantial dispute exists. The question of construing Section 746 (c) of the Act of 1951, supra, relating to jury trials, is not now before us.</p>

We have read and considered the evidence with great care. We are unable to profitably add to what Judge van Roden has correctly decided in his opinion refusing the grant of an issue.</p>
