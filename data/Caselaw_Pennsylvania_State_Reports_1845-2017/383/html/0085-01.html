Plaintiff, upon reaching the age of thirty, received from the trustees his one-third share of the principal <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>of the trust, amounting to approximately $40,000. He entered into an oral agreement with his brother, the defendant, whereby the latter agreed to accept in trust such monies and securities as plaintiff might turn over to him from time to time, supervise the investment thereof, and deliver the securities in which the money had been invested to plaintiff at any time upon demand. Plaintiff is a British subject and an officer in the Boyal Navy and was on duty in Bermuda for several years; from time to time he turned over to defendant sums aggregating in excess of $104,000. Defendant, having allegedly converted to his own use all these monies and the securities in which they were invested, absconded and his present whereabouts are unknown. He reached the age of thirty on March 31, 1955, and on March 30 and again on March 31 plaintiff served upon the surviving trustee a writ of foreign attachment, seeking to attach defendant’s share of the principal of the Elizabeth Howe Sproul trust. At the same time he filed a complaint in equity against defendant for an accounting. The trustee, as garnishee, filed preliminary objections to the attachment, as did also defendant appearing by counsel de bene esse. They contended that, since the funds payable to defendant had not yet been turned over to him by the trustee, they were not attachable in the latter’s hands, and they therefore prayed that the writ of foreign attachment be quashed. The court dismissed the preliminary objections and the trustee and the defendant appeal.</p>

Likewise there is no doubt but that the principal of such a trust may be similarly safeguarded during such period, it being obvious that otherwise the payment of income to the bene<a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>ficiary could not be assured. But there arises the question as to the exact time when the period of such protection terminates and beyond which it may not be validly extended. Thus, in the present case, did the immunity of the share of the principal payable to defendant automatically end when he became entitled to receive it upon attaining the age of thirty years, or did it extend until the time when it would be actually paid to him by the trustee?</p>

It was held that, since the termination of the trust would necessarily vest the absolute dominion and ownership of the property in the husband and give him the right to have it conveyed to him, it was subject to his creditors notwithstanding the spendthrift trust provision.</p>

As soon as the son arrived at the prescribed age the trustees were to grant and convey to him the entire principal of the trust estate free from any trusts or limitations whatsoever. On the day after he reached his thirty-fifth year a creditor entered judgment against him on <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>a note; an attachment execution was issued on the judgment and served on the trustees as garnishees. The son contended that his father’s will protected the principal of the trust fund as well as the income from his debts and engagements and from attachment by his creditors. It was held, however, that while the spendthrift clause protected the corpus from execution or assignment during the period of the trust during which the income was to be paid to the beneficiary, there was nothing in the will which indicated an intention of the testator to subject the principal to a spendthrift trust nor any provision for protection of the corpus in transmission to the beneficiary at the end of the trust.</p>

It was held that as far as the corpus of the trust fund was concerned the will did not restrict its alienability, it being clear that the testator was not seeking to protect her interest in the trust against creditors after she came of age but rather against demands and importunities of her father.</p>

The court, in an opinion by Judge Ladner, held that this language made it clear that the testator intended to prohibit anticipation or aliena<a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>tion only until the beneficiary attained the prescribed age and not to continue such restraints .until the shares of the principal were actually paid into .their hands; it was pointed out that the testator did not, as in <em>Hays’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/201/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="201 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="925650" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0391-01">201 Pa. 391</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.%20775" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="50 A. 775">50 A. 775</a>, in terms prohibit the payment to anyone other than the beneficiary, “and such additional restriction ought not to be implied in face of the period of the duration fixed by testator’s express language. Without such a clause mere postponement of enjoyment until a given age would not of itself protect the fund until actually paid to the distributee. ... all he [the testator] intended was to guard against possible improvidence until the age of discretion, which he fixed to be 25 years, was reached.” Quoting from <em>Ritchie’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20Pa.%20D.%20510" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="24 Pa.

In <em>Hartman’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/31/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="31 Pa. Super. 152" data-case-ids="864380" data-case-paths="/pa-super/31/0152-01">31 Pa.

      <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>Without entering further into the details of these and other applicable authorities the general conclusion to be derived from them is, as already stated, that ordinarily the principal of a trust fund, the right and title to which has vested in the beneficiary and which has become payable to him, is subject to attachment by his creditors, and that it is only when the donor or testator who created the trust has by clear language expressed the intention that the immunity from attachment or alienation is to continue until actual payment of the principal to the beneficiary that such protection in transit will be accorded legal support. Analyzing the provisions in the will of Mrs. Sproul, there is no such clear language as would indicate an intention on her part to protect defendant’s share of the principal of the trust estate after he had become entitled to receive it by attaining the age of thirty years. What the testatrix evidently desired was to safeguard from creditors the income of the beneficiaries during their formative years, not their shares of the principal payable to them upon their reaching what she regarded as the age of maturity. The shares were to be conveyed to them “free and discharged of all <em>trusts” </em>(not free from the <em>debts and obligations </em>of the beneficiaries as was the provision, for example, in <em>Riverside Trust Co. v. Twitchell, </em><a href="/pa/342/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="342 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1206957" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0558-01">342 Pa. 558</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20A.2d%20768" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="20 A.2d 768">20 A. 2d 768</a>). That the receipts of the beneficiaries for the money paid them should be a full acquittance and discharge of the trustees was obviously intended merely to protect the trustees themselves against further claims. It would seem clear that as soon as the defendant’s right to receive his share of the principal accrued it became his property and he could immediately thereupon have compelled its conveyance to him; the trust thenceforth was a dry trust and neither the defendant nor the trustees could thereafter defeat the rights of creditors with re<a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>spect to the principal of the trust merely by allowing it, deliberately or otherwise, to remain in the trustees’ hands. The rights of the creditors depended on defendant’s interest in the property, not on his possession of it.</p>
