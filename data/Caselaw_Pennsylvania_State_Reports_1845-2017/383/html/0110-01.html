The complaints charged various acts of negligence. The defendants, who were sued as owners and operators of the Hotel, denied liability.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.4",164,[255,609,1151,422]]]'>The trial Judge, sitting without a jury, found, inter alia, that two of the defendants, namely, Samuel Elgart and Clinton Management, Inc., were negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the fire; and concluded that the Act of June 12,1913, P. L. 481, 37 PS §61 et seq., did not preclude a recovery for such losses. Each defendant seeks a judgment non obstante veredicto.</p>
    <p id="b164-5" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[248,1051,1157,764]]]'>The case turns on the interpretation of the Act of 1913. Under Section 1 an innkeeper who provides (specified) safe deposit facilities for the custody of money, bank notes, jewelry, articles of gold and silver manufacture, precious stones, personal ornaments, railroad mileage books or tickets, negotiable or valuable papers, and bullion, and posts copies of the section in ten conspicuous places in the hotel shall not be liable for the loss of such valuables unless the innkeeper has refused to accept them from the guests for safe deposit and to give a receipt therefor. The section also limits the innkeeper’s liability for the enumerated classes of property to $300., even if he receives them for safekeeping.</p>
    <p id="b164-6" data-blocks='[["BL_164.6",164,[247,1828,1154,367]]]'>Section 2 permits an innkeeper to make any special arrangements in writing with his guests covering any property received “for deposit in such safe or vault”, but provides he may not relieve himself of liability for any loss of the above-enumerated articles where loss results from his own theft or negligence or that of his servants.</p>

      <em> </em>It provides that the innkeeper shall not be liable for the loss of or injury to property unless <em>actually delivered </em>to him or his servants. It does, however, impose liability on the innkeeper for loss or injury occasioned by his negligence or that of his servants or employees. The provisions as to negligence contained in these sections are strikingly different from the provisions in Section 4.</p>
    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[210,908,1155,544]]]'>Section 4 in pertinent part reads as follows: “The liability of the keeper of any inn or hotel, whether individual, partnership, or corporation, for loss of or injury to personal property placed by his guest <em>under his care, </em>other than that described in the preceding sections, shall be that of a depository for hire, <em>except that in case such loss or injury is caused hy fire, not intentionally produced </em>by the hotel proprietor or innkeeper or his servants, <em>such hotel proprietor or innkeeper shall not he liable: . .</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b165-5" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[208,1472,1154,767]]]'>Section 1 obviously has no application to the instant case for the reason that plaintiffs’ claims do not include any of the enumerated classes of property, i.e., money, bank notes, jewelry, etc., which were delivered to the proprietor to be placed in his safe deposit box or vault. Section 2 is likewise inapplicable since there was no special arrangement in writing covering property received “for deposit in such safe or vault”. Section 3 is likewise inapplicable inasmuch as the property for which claims are now being made was admittedly located in the plaintiffs’ rooms at the time of the fire, and not delivered to the proprietor “for safekeeping (elsewhere than in the room assigned to such guest).”</p>

      <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>We therefore come to the 4th Section and the question it poses, viz., whether property left in a guest’s room constitutes, as appellants contend, property placed “under his [innkeeper’s] care.” Considering this section together with the three prior sections of the Act, we are convinced that the language can have no other meaning. This was likewise the conclusion reached by the Superior Court in <em>Kelly v. Milner Hotels, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-super/176/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="176 Pa.

In the <em>Kelly </em>case the Superior Court pointed out that if Section 4 did not refer to property left in a guest’s room the Section would be meaningless.
