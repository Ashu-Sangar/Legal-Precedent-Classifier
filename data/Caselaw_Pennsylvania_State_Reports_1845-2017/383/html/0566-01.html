He is unprovided for in the will unless he comes in as a member of a class under paragraph 8 of the will. He claims that he is entitled to take as an “other” grandchild, since Josephine R. Sowers died without lawful issue. Paragraph 8 reads: “8 — I order and direct that if any of my <em>said </em>children, including my adopted child, Josephine R. Sowers, should <em>die without lawful issue, </em>the share in the principal of the trust fund hereby created, which is bequeathed to the lawful issue of my said mentioned children, shall in such event be divided <em>equally among my other grandchildren </em>living at such time, share and share alike.”</p>
