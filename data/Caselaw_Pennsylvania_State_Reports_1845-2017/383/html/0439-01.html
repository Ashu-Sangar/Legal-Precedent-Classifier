At the former trial the document was erroneously excluded. That decree was reversed. The record was remanded to the court below <em>“. . . </em>limited solely and exclusively to a determination of the admissibility and validity of the document . . . and, if admissible, its effect on the ultimate result”: <em>Rauenzahn v.

It will suffice to state that James L. Waggaman and Emma F., his wife, upon admission into a fraternal home, fraudulently concealed their assets. A niece of the wife, Ethel M. Sigman, appellant, came into pos<a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>session of the concealed assets. She claims title to the assets under an alleged <em>inter vwos </em>gift from Mrs. Waggaman. The validity of the ivritten document, described in the reported case, is the sole issue now before us.

To establish the genuineness of the signature, appellant relies upon comparison of handwriting made by a handwriting expert. The specimen or standard used in such comparison must be sufficiently proved. To accomplish this, appellant offered in evidence four checks endorsed by the alleged donor, all of which the bank had paid. Mr. M’Cool, appellant’s handwriting expert, testified that he had no means of knowing whether or not it was Mrs. Waggaman, the payee, who had endorsed the checks. He expressed, however, an opinion that the signatures were those of the payee. Appellee’s handwriting expert, Mr. Melcher, considering the above evidence and from other writings in the record bearing Mrs. Waggaman’s purported signature, testified that he likewise was unable to form an opinion that the signature in question was genuine. It is a well settled principle of law that in order to authorize a comparison of handwritings, the genuineness of the document offered as a standard for comparison must be sufficiently established. Nothing short of evidence by a person who saw the party sign the standard, or of an admission by such party of its genuineness, or evidence of equal authority, is sufficient: <em>Baker v.

The chancellor properly struck out her evidence as incompetent. The Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, section 5(e), 28 PS 322, provides “Nor, where any party to a thing or contract in action is dead . . . and his right thereto or therein has passed ... to a party on the record who represents his interest in the subject in controversy, shall any surviving or remaining party to such thing or contract ... be a competent witness to any matter occurring before the death of said party. . . .” Under the terms of the statute, appellant was clearly incompetent as a witness since she was the surviving or remaining party to the alleged agreement or transfer: <em>Gongaware’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/265/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="265 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1051843" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0512-01">265 Pa. 512</a>, 514, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20276" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="109 A. 276">109 A. 276</a>; <em>Keyser's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/329/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="329 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1181416" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0514-01">329 Pa. 514</a>, 523, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20125" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="198 A. 125">198 A. 125</a>; <em>Buttorff’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/329/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="329 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="1181481" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0561-01">329 Pa. 561</a>, 563, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%2030" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="198 A. 30">198 A. 30</a>; <em>Estate of Agnes Blaszcak, </em><a href="/pa-super/90/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="90 Pa.
