As he approached the intersection of Brighton Road and Westborn Street, he observed minor-appellant standing on the foot-walk at the northeast corner. Appellee reduced his speed from thirty to fifteen to twenty miles per hour and proceeded through the intersection with the traffic control signal in his favor. The minor on the sidewalk was looking in appellee’s direction. When appellee was nearly through the intersection, the minor left the curb, passed in front of the appellee’s automobile and was struck. The appellee admitted that he did not sound his horn and that he did not keep his eyes continuously on the minor-appellant while passing through the intersection.</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[188,1353,1155,646]]]'>It is contended by appellants that the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence and, therefore, the trial court’s refusal to award a new trial constituted an abuse of discretion. This contention is without merit. There was a substantial conflict in testimony which was resolved by the jury in favor of the appellee. The refusal of a motion for a new trial will not be reversed except for a clear abuse of such discretion: <em>Koch v.

The court charged: “. . . The child, under 7 years of age, cannot be guilty of contributory negligence on account of her age. . . . Between the ages of 7 and 14 she can <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>be guilty of it. If in your opinion she helped bring about this accident, or caused the accident, you have to take into consideration what you have seen of her, what you have heard about her. Take into consideration the state of her education, the situation where she lives and what kind of a girl she is. . . .” No specific exception was taken to this portion of the charge. The court granted a general exception. It is argued that such language is so inadequate as to constitute fundamental error. In <em>Patterson v.
