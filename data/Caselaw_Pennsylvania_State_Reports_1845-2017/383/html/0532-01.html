    <p id="b586-5" data-blocks='[["BL_586.7",586,[230,566,1152,713]]]'>This appeal will have to be quashed. The defendant was indicted for fornication and bastardy. The prosecuting witness testified positively that the defendant had had intercourse with her and was the father of her child. The defendant did not testify, but introduced a written report of blood tests which, in the opinion of the doctors making the report, showed that the defendant could not be the father of her child. In spite of this evidence the jury convicted him. The court granted a new trial in the interest of justice, after which the defendant took an appeal, contending, in substance, that the blood' test statements were conclusive, and that he was entitled to be discharged.</p>

Commonwealth, 16 S. &amp; R. 318, a writ of error was quashed when it appeared that the defendant though convicted, had not been sentenced. The Supreme Court said: ‘It is time enough to permit him to arrest the course of the criminal law, when he has shown that he has suffered actual injury.’ The Acts of June 24, 1895, P. L. 212, 17 PS 111, and May 19, 1897, P. L. 67, 12 PS 1133, make no provision for an <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>appeal to this court in criminal cases except from a sentence or final judgment.

Haimbach, </em>supra, at page 584, the Court stated: “On the trial [on charges of embezzlement] defendant offered' no evidence but submitted a point for a directed verdict of not guilty which was refused. After verdict defendant moved, both for a new trial and for the ‘discharge of the defend-, ant,’ on the ground ‘that there is no evidence here which would sustain a conviction.’ The Act of April 22, 1905, P. L. 286, did not extend the entry of judgment non obstante veredicto to criminal prosecutions. A defendant by presenting a point for binding instructions, questioning /the sufficiency of the evidence to support a.conviction,, may put himself in. position for a review of that question by excepting to the refusal to so charge. Com. v. Jones, <a href="/pa-super/100/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="100 Pa. Super. 121" data-case-ids="691314" data-case-paths="/pa-super/100/0121-01">100 Pa. Superior Ct. 121</a>. But the court cannot- reserve that point and enter judgment for the defendant after verdict of guilty either on the point for binding instructions, or non obstante' veredicto. <em>The remedy in the court below if it concludes that error was committed in refusing to direct a verdict in favor of a defendant, is to grant a new trial. </em>Com. v. Heller, <a href="/pa-super/147/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="147 Pa.

L. 585, 19 PS §871, the defendant may make a motion in arrest of judgment on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the charge. But the sufficiency of the evidence must be tested according to the Commonwealth's evidence. This amply sustained the charge and the court was without power to discharge the defendant.</p>
