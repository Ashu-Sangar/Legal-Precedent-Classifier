River Drive, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, extending through to 4500 Ridge Avenue. Defendant, Waiters and Waitresses Union, Local 301, is an unincorporated labor organization. In December, 1948, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board conducted an election among the waitresses em<a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>ployed by Anchorage in order to select their collective bargaining representative, as a result of which the Board, by a final decree in February, 1949, certified Local 301 as such representative; this decree was sustained by the Court of Common Pleas on appeal. Meanwhile negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement proceeded between the Anchorage and the Local; the latter demanded a contract with a closed shop provision which Anchorage refused, whereupon on March 18, 1949, the Local called a strike. Nine of the waitresses responded to the call and on the following day, March 19, 1949, commenced picketing plaintiff’s establishment. The Local claims that the picketing was only for the purpose of inducing the non-union employes to join the Union and of publicizing the strike and the fact that Anchorage was a non-union establishment. Anchorage, on the other hand, contends that the real object was to compel it to enter into a contract providing for a closed shop.</p>

We earnestly request our friends and sympathizers not to patronize. Local 301, Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union, Affiliated with A. F. of L.” The certification of Local 301 as the collective bargaining representative expired on December 28, 1949, but the Local still continued thereafter to demand that Anchorage bargain with it and agree to institute a closed shop. In March, 1951, Anchorage filed with the Labor Relations Board a petition seeking the determination and certification of a lawful collective bargaining representative of its employes in a more comprehensive unit than merely the <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>waitresses. The Local, demanding that Anchorage reinstate six of the waitresses who had gone out on strike, filed with the Board a charge that Anchorage was. committing unfair labor practices by refusing to make such reinstatements and to bargain with the Local as the alleged representative of the employes. The Board dismissed these charges and the Local’s appeal from its order was dismissed by the Court of Common Pleas in September, 1852. Thereupon the Board proceeded to a hearing on the petition of Anchorage for an election but the Local withdrew from the proceedings. and admitted that, at least since March, 1951, it did not represent the majority of the employes in the unit for which an election was to be held, but only the striking waitresses; accordingly the Board, in February, 1953, dismissed the petition of Anchorage for the reason that the question as to representation no longer existed. Anchorage then filed its complaint in the present case to enjoin the picketing which, as already stated, had proceeded without interruption since March, 1949.</p>

The Union insists that none of its officials made any demand on Anchorage for a labor contract after September, 1951, but such illegal purpose may be established even in the absence of evidence of a direct demand by the Union for recognition: <em>Baderak v. Building and Construction Trades Council, </em><a href="/pa/380/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="380 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1256046" data-case-paths="/pa/380/0477-01">380 Pa. 477</a>, 483, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20170" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="112 A.2d 170">112 A. 2d 170</a>, 173; <em>Sansom House Enterprises, Inc. v.

The <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>picketing had begun during the period when the Local was the certified collective bargaining representative and therefore was entitled to seek an agreement providing for a closed shop, so that at that time it obviously could not have been designed to organize the employes. And even after the Union, as already stated, had ceased to be such representative it continued its demands for a collective bargaining agreement and its counsel claimed as late as the hearing before the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board in November, 1952, that the Local was the certified collective bargaining representative and made the complaint that Anchorage had refused to bargain collectively with it. The banners carried by the pickets all through the five years indicated very clearly that the purpose was not primarily to organize the employes but to coerce the employer — by causing him otherwise to suffer grave economic loss — to bargain with it, accede to its demands for a closed shop, and force the employes to join the Union, thus compelling Anchorage to commit the unfair labor practices specified in the Labor Relations Act. Certainly the request on the banners that the friends and sympathizers of the Local should not patronize plaintiff’s restaurant had no relevancy whatever to an appeal to the employes to join the Union but could be intended only to damage or destroy the business of the employer until it should succumb to the Local’s demands. Incidentally, the legend on the banners that employes were on strike was false, or at least became so years later when the waitresses who had gone out on strike had admittedly taken and remained in other positions as good as or better than those they had had at Anchorage, and which positions they still hold. While the relationship existing between employer and employe is not necessarily ended by a strike there certainly comes a time when it must be regarded as terminated.<a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> And a final proof that the purpose of the picketing was coercion of the employer and not to organize the employes was the fact that, until enjoined by the court, it continued uninterruptedly for a period of approximately five years. It is, of course, true that picketing which is lawful does not necessarily become unlawful merely by the extended duration of time during which it may be carried on, but its persistence during such an extraordinary period is at least an evidential factor pointing inevitably to the conclusion that its real object was the harassment and oppression of the employer and not to carry on for so many years an attempt to induce the employes voluntarily to join the Union, which, if not successful within a reasonably limited period certainly could never succeed at all. Nor is there any evidence that at any time throughout the years of picketing any. officer, agent or member of Local 301 ever approached the waitresses employed by Anchorage or otherwise contacted them or sought to persuade them to become members of the Union.</p>
