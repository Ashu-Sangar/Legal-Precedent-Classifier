She was called as a witness upon behalf of the defense, and she testified that she had several conversations with Mr. McCarthy during the lifetime of her husband, with regard to business matters between her husband and Mr. McCarthy. Two particular conversations to which she testified I shall refer to briefly. She testified there were a number, but she particularizes two. The first that I recall is when she testified that she went with her husband on one occasion to Wilkes-Barre, and that between ■ there and McCarthy’s house, somewhere on the street, on the road, they met Mr. McCarthy, and that the conversation between them turned to this note, and that Mr. McCarthy then and there promised to bring the note up to her, as I infer from her testimony, however, that is a matter for you, for the purpose of delivering it up to her, surrendering the note.

She also testified to some circumstances tending to show the manner in which Mr. McCarthy and her husband did business with each other. She testified that on one occasion Mr. McCarthy gave her $500, said it was rent that Mr. Scanlon had paid on the property. She also testified that they furnished, that is that she and her husband furnished the money to pay the sheriff’s costs on a sale by virtue of an execution that was issued on one of the claims that Mr. McCarthy had against her husband. You will remember the record was offered in evidence, the judgment note and the execution showing the sheriff’s sale. She testified that instead of McCarthy, the plaintiff in the case, and who was a purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, paying these costs, that she and her husband paid them.

In answer to the allegation that the transaction between himself and Mr. Scanlon had never been done in good faith, that no money had actually ever passed between them, he testified that in 1886 he purchased property from Mr. Scanlon, and that he paid him $5,000 in cash for it, that he paid for it in cash through the bank, by means of a check, and he produces a check which purports to have been passed through the- bank, with Martin Scanlon’s signature on the back of it, evidence tending to show that he actually paid Mr. Scanlon the $5,000 cash at that time. (By cash payment I mean cash drawn out of the bank by meto of a check.) That, at that time, while he did purchase this property, he agreed with Mr.-Scanlon to transfer it back to him at the end of five years, in case Mr. Scanlon was ready to take <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>it, and. that, as a matter of fact, he actually did transfer the property back to Mr. Scanlon in 1888, and was paid back the money by Mr. Scanlon. He also testified that in February, 1887, he loaned Mr. Scanlon $600, and took as security for that loan one of the judgment notes which has been offered in evidence ; that on February 7, 1888, he loaned him $650 more, and took as security for that another judgment note for that amount, which note has also been offered in evidence. And he further testifies that, in July, 1888, on the 13th, he made him another loan of $1,000, and as security for that loan he took this judgment note which has been offered in evidence, and which is in dispute here. . . .</p>

    <p id="b287-8" data-blocks='[["BL_287.15",287,[152,1393,1176,598]]]'>This case was very loosely tried by both sides, the witnesses apparently being allowed to tell whatever they thought bore on the dispute without reference to its relevancy or their own legal competency. Although therefore the check and judgment notes, exhibits B, C and D, had no apparent connection with the note in suit, yet the assignments of error to their admission cannot be sustained because the plaintiff had been allowed to testify all about them and had been cross-examined on them without regard to their relevancy or to the fact that Scanlon by whom they were given was dead. Though their admission was. not strictly regular, yet the objection came so late that we would not reverse for that cause.</p>

The defendant’s counsel offered to prove that the note in suit was given without consideration, and “ to protect Scanlon (the maker) from any creditors he might have, especially from a judgment he expected to be obtained against him by one RyanN But this part of the offer, whatever might have been the éffect of such evidence on the defendant’s case, was excluded, and <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>the testimony confined to the question of consideration. The defendant in testifying did give a conversation in which she alleged that the plaintiff had said that there “was nothing in it (the note), it was simply given for the protection of- Martin and his children in this case of Ryan’s.” This however was not her own testimony to the fact, but to an admission of plaintiff against his present claim, and at the most does not show that Ryan had anything more than a claim. There is no evidence in the case what the nature of his claim was, or that he was, or ever became a creditor, and there is not a suggestion that there was any other creditor that Scanlon was seeking to hinder or delay. It was clearly apparent that the transactions between the parties were not the ordinary dealings of borrower and lender, and it is equally manifest that the witnesses on neither side were telling the entire truth. The jury seem to have been convinced that there was no consideration for the note, and therefore decided against the plaintiff on his claim. In the absence however of any explanation why the note was given at all when no money passed, they found an easy solution in the suggestion that it was to defraud Scanlon’s creditors. Perhaps they were right in fact, but we cannot say so, or permit them to say so without evidence. It would be at best only a good guess. The result is that plaintiff has a judgment on a ground that he expressly repudiated, and in the face of an explicit finding by the jury against Ms claim, wMle the defendant has a judgment against her notwithstanding a finding of the main fact of the defense in her favor.</p>
