This statute was enacted by our lawmakers for a wise purpose; it is an old statute passed in 1785; experience and observation had taught the lawmakers that it was necessary that a time, within which parties having a right should assert that right, should be limited, and in respect to real estate the right to enter and take possession of real estate is limited to twenty-one years.

    <p class="summary" id="ADU" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[221,719,1173,1578]]]'>Our courts have construed the meaning of this statute of 1785, and have defined the character of the possession necessary to give title under it. That possession, they have said, must be adverse, that is, it must be against the real owner. It must be an actual possession, it must be a visible possession, not covert, secret. A person by going upon a piece of woodland, away from habitations, and building a shanty where no person would see him, where the owner would not see him, could not acquire title to property by keeping it any length of time. It must be a visible possession; it must be -notorious, that is such as would be known by those observing it. It must be exclusive, an exclusive possession as against the owner, not in connection with the owner, but exclusive of the owner. And it must be continued, unbroken for the statutory period of twenty-one years. Any interruption of the continuity of the possession, for any length of time, would prevent the running of the statute against the owner. And bjr interruption we do not mean a casual leaving of the property, but if the party abandoned or left the premises with the intention of remaining away for any length of time, surrendering the possession, that would prevent the running of the statute against the true owner, and when he returned, the statute would commence again at the time of his return, and the former possession could not be tacked upon the latter possession to make the twenty-one years. The presumption of law is that a person who is an intruder upon property, and he must first be an intruder, intends to hold it for himself, and this presumption remains until it is rebutted. If a party talcing possession intends to hold subject to the will of the owner, then the possession is not adverse. Possession by permission of the owner is not adverse. The intruder must claim and act as if he owned the property.</p>

It is in evidence in this case that sometime during the time when these defendants allege they held the possession of this property, they moved out of the house; they left it a certain time in consequence of the overflow of the brook, as was testified to by Mrs. Barrett, but that they subsequently returned; that during the time they were away they kept horses there, and perhaps some articles of personal property, I do not recollect exactly what the witness testified upon that subject. But, if that be true, that would he a sufficient retention by the parties such as not to break the continuity of possession, which they might acquire by reason of holding this property in the manner which has been testified to. Actual residence upon the property is not necessary to constitute an adverse possession. An adverse possession may be by cultivation; by inclosing the property, maintaining an inclosure around the property, or by any other open and visible means by which the owner may know that the person asserts ownership and exercises acts of ownership over the property. And use of the property or premises in common with other people, in common with the public, such as for crossing and recrossing, does not constitute adverse possession. A certain well defined use might give a prescriptive right to continue such use; this is not, however, what is meant by adverse possession, as applicable to this case.</p>

Further the plaintiffs expressly released their grantor “from any and all claims of every kind and nature whatsoever on account of any such encroachments upon the land hereby conveyed, or any claims of the aforesaid J. J. Gordon, Catherine Blewitt and Ellen Barrett and those claiming under them or the claim of any other persons with reference to a right of property in and to any portion of said land.” The claims of the defendants by adverse occupancy and possession of the land in dispute were also expressly excepted from the operation of the warranty clause of the deed.</p>
    <p id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.8",270,[247,1679,1169,654]]]'>It thus appears not only that the plaintiffs took their deed with express notice of the claim of title by the defendants to a part of the land conveyed to the plaintiffs, but also with express notice that this claim of adverse possession was fully known to their grantor, the Iron &amp; Coal Company, and that the company refused to include it within the operation of their deed, or to warrant any title to it on their part. In view of this positive recognition of the adverse title of the defendants, and their very long acquiescence in it, and of their never having brought any action of ejectment to recover it, it is difficult to perceive any ground for the assertion that the title of the defendants was held by the permission of the Coal &amp; Iron Company and not adversely to them.</p>
    <p id="b270-7" data-blocks='[["BL_270.9",270,[292,2342,1121,42]],["BL_271.1",271,[175,368,1176,1533]]]'>Nor did the testimony show any such state of facts. An <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>effort was made to prove that there was by a legal implication such a permissive occupancy, having the force of subserviency to the title of the Coal &amp; Iron Company, as to the land in dispute, but it was entirely abortive, and'the offer of the testimony was properly rejected by the court below. It was an offer to prove that there was a memorandum on the Coal &amp; Iron Company’s sales book, followed by an account on their ledger, to the effect that there was a sale on September 1, 1851, to Barrett and Gordon of a lot fifty feet on Carbon street and fifteen feet on the rear. Of course a contract for the sale of land cannot be proved in any such manner as that, but even if the evidence had heen admitted, it could not possibly have justified any inference that the defendants took title to the land in dispute here, which was no part of the land referred to in the memorandum, in subserviency to the title of the Coal &amp; Iron Company. ' Moreover the contract, whatever it was, became merged in the deed which was subsequently made, and which was given in evidence on the trial. Hence the plaintiffs had all the benefit they could have had if the memorandum on the sales hook had been received in evidence. We cannot however accept the proposition that where a deed is taken for land which is part of a larger tract belonging to the vendor, the vendee cannot acquire by adverse possession land outside of his deed which was a part of the tract from which his purchase was made. Granting that he knew that such outside land belonged to his grantor, we cannot understand why he might not occupy it adversely, and if such occupation was permanent, continuous, visible and notorious, and was at all times in hostility to the right of the owner, and was maintained during the full period of twenty-one years, we know of no reason why such a possession will not confer a good title.</p>
    <p id="b271-3" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[180,1909,1170,504]],["BL_272.1",272,[249,368,1167,249]]]'>The learned court below in the charge to the jury explained this entire subject carefully, minutely and with entire correctness, and the jury found by their verdict that a good title to the land in question was acquired by the defendants by adverse possession. That the whole matter was exclusively for the jury is too plain for argument. The testimony to a continuous occupation of the land in question by the defendants and those under whom they claimed, for purposes of residence in part, and for domestic uses for a period of nearly or quite forty years, without interruption was voluminous, precise, definite and positive. <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>It was amply sufficient not only to warrant its submission but to justify tbe verdict. It would have been most serious error to withdraw it from the jury and we can see no reason to question the propriety of the verdict. We cannot sustain any of the assignments of error.</p>
    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[295,625,356,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
