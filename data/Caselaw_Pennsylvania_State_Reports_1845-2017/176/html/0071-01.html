Ryan, under the deed of trust is complete and was irrevocable by Joseph Fraley, the settler, although the transaction was purely voluntary, and the fact that the grantee reserved an interest during life in the proceeds of the property, and gave a future benefit to other persons lie named, gives no implied right to revocation. It contravenes no rule or policy of law, but executes the intention of the grantor. That when the creation of such a trust as the present has been rendered necessary by the folly and extravagance of the settler, and he has voluntarily and intelligently executed such a deed, equity will not set it aside, though it convey practically his whole estate, without reserving any power of revocation, or of support for himself beyond his incidental rights as a member of his wife’s family. It appearing from the deed of trust in this case that it vested in Mary Brillhart a right to $10.00 per year, during the lifetime of said Joseph Fraley, such interest operated to make this deed of trust irrevocable. And where a deed conveys, as this one does, a present interest for life to the grantee, the fact that it contain provisions to take effect by way of contingent remainder upon the death of the grantor, during the life of the grantee, does not convert it into a will or make it testamentary. Such limitation cannot be revoked by the grantor, or by operation of law for life, even upon his subsequent marriage: Fellows’ App., <a href="/pa/98/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="98 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="496961" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0470-01">98 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/98/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="98 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="496961" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0470-01">470</a>; </em>Merriman v.
