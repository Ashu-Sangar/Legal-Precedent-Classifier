    <p class="summary" id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.4",562,[251,466,1165,352]]]'>The exceptions to the report of the auditor, filed on behalf of the plaintiff, raise two questions, viz: 1st. Was the lien of Huclcestein filed within six months after the completion of the work done under the contract attached to the hen as filed on June 9, 1887? 2d. Was the description of the buildings and premises set forth in the lien sufficient to properly identify the property and give notice to other parties dealing with the owner?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[251,823,1168,1514]]]'>In regard to the first question, the lien was filed on June 9, 1887, and states upon its face that the work was done under the contract, and was commenced on June 29, 1886, and finished on December 13, 1886. No motion has been made to strike this hen off. It is contended upon the part of the plaintiff in this proceeding, that all the work done under the contract is embraced in the items Avhich are given without date in the bill of particulars, Avhich is attached to the lien, and that •this work was finished before any of the items (the dates of which are given) were furnished. That the items which have dates are all for extra work. The contract requires Huclcestein to “Erect and finish all the excavation, concrete, stone and brick work required in the foundations for the buildings and machinery for the new steel plant and rolling mills .... all agreeably to such drawings as may be hereafter furnished.” Under the terms of the contract, the Columbia Iron &amp; Steel Company had the right to change the plans and specifications and require the contractor to do the work in accordance with such changes. One of the items charged on December 13,1886, is for “ Cutting one inch off bearing block of 28"X 48" engine.” This is for work done on the top stone of the foundation, and is manifestly for Avork done within the contract, and which the steel company had a right to change and require to be done to their satisfaction. But the lien expressly states when the work under the contract was completed; and in the absence of any motion to strike off and any evidence to impeach, we must hold the lien in this respect valid. The question of the sufficiency of the description of the buildings contained in the lien is not Avithout difficulty, which proper care in the preparation of the lien would have avoided.</p>

If the hen had been filed against the large building alone and not against the plant as a whole, the inclusion in the bill of particulars of items for work alone on the boiler house would not be enough to save the hen of the mechanic as to those items: Bevan v. Thackara, <a href="/pa/143/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="143 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="978522" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0182-01">143 Pa. 182</a>.

At the time the hen was filed the construction of the plant had not been completed. Other buildings were erected upon the land in 1887. It does not satisfactorily appear in evidence that any buildings other than the main mill and boiler house had even been commenced at the time of the filing of the mechanic’s hen in question. At the time the hen was filed the machinery for the main building and the boiler house was not in place although much of it was upon the grounds. Huckestein had completed his contract for the foundations of the main building and the boiler house, and his six months for filing a hen had almost expired. The iron superstructures of those buildings had been erected and the construction of the plant had been carried forward until the machinery was upon the ground. The description of the plant in its unfinished condition was somewhat difficult. If the description of the buildings contained in the bill of particulars is of any avail it is as, full as could have been given, except that it does not state the height of the buildings. The building was a rolling mill, and such erections are usually but one story high. To describe such a building as a rolling mill, the superstructure of <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>which is of iron, is ordinarily sufficient. ' Almost two years after the filing of the mechanic’s lien in question, the mortgage, under which the mortgagee claims adversely to the lien, was executed and recorded. Considering the state of the record of the lien at that time, we cannot understand how the mortgagee could have failed to identify the property. Taldng the whole record, including the bill of particulars, the mortgagee must have recognized the fact that property included in the mortgage was the same referred to in the lien.

The sale was under proceedings upon a mortgage. The only claimants were the mortgagee and a mechanic’s hen creditor. The hen was filed June 9, 1887, and judgment was obtained upon it March 30, 1892. The mortgage was recorded April 30, 1889. The auditor reported that “ the evidence as to the time when the contract was completed is very meager, but the lien as filed states that it was not completed until December 13, 1886, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary this is conclusive.” There was in fact no evidence upon the subject, and the finding of the auditor is based entirely upon the statements contained in the hen. Work to the amount of nearly $34,000 was done under a general contract and the claim for work and materials in addition to the contract price was $469. At the end of the hen is a statement: “We began work on the same on the 29th day of June, 1886, and completed the same within the last preceding six months, to wit: on the 13th day of December, 1886.” The last date for work done and materials furnished is December 13. Was this sufficient as against a mortgagee whose mortgage had been recorded before judgment was obtained on the mechanic’s hen to establish as a fact that the hen was filed in time ?</p>

In the opinion filed by Shabswood, J., in the <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>district court of Philadelphia and adopted as the opinion of this court in Norris’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/30/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="30 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="415572" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0122-01">30 Pa. 122</a>, he said: “In a contest between mechanics and others for a fund in court, a judgment obtained by a méchame on a scire facias is as to other claimants res inter alios acta and not even prima facie evidence. As a judgment it ranks merely from its date. To come in as a lien it must be proved so as to entitle it to relate to the commencement of the building.” This case was distinctly recognized and followed in McCay’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/37/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="37 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="418863" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0125-01">37 Pa. 125</a>, and Hahn’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/39/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="39 Pa. 409" data-case-ids="996295" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0409-01">39 Pa. 409</a>. The averments and dates in the lien were not aided by the judgment on the scire facias, and they were not in themselves sufficient to sustain the finding that the lien was filed within six months of the completion of the work.</p>
    <p id="b567-3" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[132,1000,1169,299]]]'>The finding of the learned auditor as to the time when the work was completed was excepted to, but it does not appear that the question whether the lien was evidence was raised before him. That no injustice may be done an opportunity should be given the appellees to prove if they can such facts as will establish their right to participate in the distribution.</p>
    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[134,1307,1171,507]]]'>The lien is very inartificially drawn, but it is not fatally defective for want of a proper description of the buildings. The work was for the foundations, and the buildings were not completed at the time when it became necessary to file the lien. The description we think is sufficient to identify the property. The assignments of error relating to this subject are overruled. The remaining assignments are sustained, and the record is remitted to the common pleas in order that further testimony as to the time of the completion of the work may be taken and i eported upon by the auditor.</p>
