The owners of the four junior judgments released one of the lots from the lien of their judgment. The owner erected upon the lot thus released certain buildings against which mechanics’ liens were filed. Both lots were subsequently sold by an assignee for the benefit of creditors. Held, (1) that in the distribution of the proceeds the mechanic’s lien creditors had an equitable interest in the proceeds of the lot released superior to that of the four judgment creditors who had released the lien of their judgments from it; (2) that the existence of the mechanics’ liens prevented the junior creditors from requiring the senior judgment creditor to resort to his lien upon the lot released in aid of the judgments of the junior creditors.</p>

Several dwelling houses and a greenhouse were erected on one of them, and the other seems to have been unoccupied. Hostetter had a judgment against Bitner which was the first lien on both lots. Then followed four other judgments which were liens on both lots. Bitner undertook to erect several new greenhouses on the second lot, and at about the time he began operations he procured from the four judgment creditors whose liens were subsequent to that of Hostetter a release of that lot from the lien of their judgments. Mechanics’ liens were afterwards entered against the new greenhouses and the lot on which they were erected. Bitner assigned both lots for tire benefit of his creditors and they have been sold by his assignee.</p>
