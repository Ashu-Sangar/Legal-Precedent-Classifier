There has been some testimony offered here, produced before you, from which the counsel for the defendants would have you infer that there was a settlement of this case. You heard what that conversation was between Mr. Nolde and Mr. Irwin. It seems at the time the conversation was had the criminal court was in session here; that two cases had been returned by the grand jury, one for assault and battery and one for forcible entry and detainer. They were criminal suits, and had nothing whatever to do with this civil suit. The parties had met, it seems, with the counsel. Samuel II. Reynolds was one of the counsel in this case at that time, and the witnesses were also present at that criminal trial and heard a conversation between Mr. Nolde and Mr. Irwin, in which one of them said: “ All these cases are now settled, and you can go home.” Now did Mr. Nolde and Mr. Irwin mean that the settlement included this civil case ? He did not say so. “ All these cases are now settled, and you <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>can go home.” Could you put any other construction upon it than that he meant all these criminal cases, because they only were under consideration at that time ? You can infer that he meant cases outside of those cases that were then going on. It is my duty to leave this matter to you as a question of fact; but I have a right to give you my opinion. . My opinion is, that it had nothing to do with this civil case. But you can have a different opinion upon it, if you think so. I shall leave it as a question of fact for you. If you think at the time these criminal cases were being tried and the witnesses were sent home, that the expression made there by Mr. Nolde in the hearing of Mr. 'Irwin, “ Now, all these cases are .settled,” and Mr. Irwin said, “ Yes, but not to my liking,” was meant by both Irwin and Nolde to apply to his case, there, can be no recovery here; but if it applied to the criminal cases only, it had nothing to do with this case, if it did not refer to this case. If it did refer to this case as a settlement, it is singular that the learned counsel did not go to the prothonotary’s office, pay the costs and release it.

But this case is different from ordinary cases. This man Nolde claimed himself to be a trustee, and there was a dispute about the trusteeship for a number of years, and, therefore, Mr. Nolde may have thought he was doing right when he entered upon this field and ousted this tenant; and, therefore, in this case it would not be right for you to give more damages tbq.u one half of the value of the crops. It is presumed that the crops that were taken off by Mr. Nolde were turned over to the society by him as a de facto trustee, and, therefore, if you find Mr. Nolde was a trespasser, then you would be warranted in giving the plaintiff a verdict for the full amount of one half of the value of the crops, and you have the right to take into consideration and add the interest on that amount from the time the crops were harvested, as part of the damages; but you must put that in your verdict as a whole, as a lump sum, and say, we find for the plaintiff so much — whatever it would be.] [5]</p>

The action was in trespass for forcibly putting the plaintiff out of possession of two fields of a farm of forty acres which he had rented of the society.

In taking possession of the fields he was acting under a claim of right, and was not guilty of a malicious or wanton trespass; and the extent of his liability was to make just compensation for the injury done the plaintiff. The learned judge so instructed the jury, but the difficulty was in determining the proper measure of compensation. The plaintiff claimed the full value of the crops which the defendant raised on the fields. The defendant contended that as to the field in which corn had been planted a few days before he took possession he was liable only for the value of the crop at the time of the trespass, and that the rental value of the acres taken was the measure of damages for the talcing of the field in which no crop had been planted.</p>

This rule applies to the destruction or removal of crops, and in estimating the value the actual value at the time of the trespass is to be taken. The <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>conflict in the decisions where the property taken has been increased in value by the defendant, and the plaintiff claims the benefit of the increase without any allowance for the labor expended, is due to some extent to the technical rules applicable to the actions of trover, replevin and trespass. In Sedgwick on Damages, sec. 503, it. is said: “ But by the prevailing view the defendant, if he acted in good faith, is allowed the value of his labor; that is, the measure of damages is the value of the property as it was just before the defendant’s wrongdoing began.” Forsyth v. Wells, <a href="/pa/41/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="41 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="480006" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0291-01">41 Pa. 291</a>, is cited as the leading case upon the subject. In the opinion in that case the Chief Justice said: “ Where the defendant’s conduct, measured by the standard of ordinary morality and care, which is the standard of the law, is not chargeable with fraud, violence or wilful negligence or wrong, the value of the property taken and converted .is the measure of just compensation. If raw material has, after Appropriation and without such wrong, been changed by manufacture into a new species of property, as grain into whisky, grapes into wine, fur into hats, hides into leather or trees into lumber, the law either refuses the action of trover for the new article or limits the recovery to the value of the original article.”</p>
    <p id="b620-5" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[238,1489,1172,808]]]'>This action was in trespass for ousting the plaintiff of his possession of a part of a farm which he held as a tenant from year to year. The trespass which resulted in an ouster was but a single trespass, and until another entry had been made by the plaintiff he could recover for the single trespass only: Sedgwick on Damages, sec. 924. The damage was not to his crop, but to his leasehold, and it should be measured by the diminution in rental value. It should not be measured by the rental value of the fields taken, but by the injury to the whole. The loss of a single field by disarranging the operations of a farm as a whole may cause an injury much greater than the rental value of the acres taken. The real loss is the value of the use of the part taken in connection with that which remains, and it is measured by the difference in rental value. This measure is reasonably free of uncertainty, it is easy of ascertainment and of general application.</p>
    <p id="b620-6" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[240,2305,1167,91]],["BL_621.1",621,[181,364,1168,659]]]'>The learned judge was not asked to instruct the jury to apply this rule, and no evidence of the diminution of rental value was <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>offered. The instruction on the measure of damages asked by the defendant could not have been given, and in the absence of any evidence applicable to the correct rule for the ascertainment of damages we do not consider it our duty to send the case back. The crops had been harvested and their value ascertained before the trial, and this value was a guide, if not the best, the best which the evidence furnished, for the jury. The general instruction on the subject, limiting the recovery to compensation for the loss sustained, was correct and full, and substantial justice seems to have been reached by the finding of the jury. While not approving all that was said as to the measure of damages, we have with some hesitation decided to allow the judgment to stand, and it is accordingly affirmed.</p>
