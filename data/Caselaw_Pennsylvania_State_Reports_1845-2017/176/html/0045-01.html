In that case a ticket was issued in Philadelphia by a New Jersey corporation operating a railroad in that state, and the plaintiff’s trunk was delivered to the defendant in Philadelphia, and it did not appear where it had been lost. The liability being admitted, the question was whether the laws of Pennsylvania limiting the amount of liability applied. It was held that as the service was to be rendered by a New Jersey corporation in New Jersey the laws of the place of performance controlled. It was said in the opinion by Shajjs'WOOD, J.: “ The negligence of which the defend<a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>ants are presumed to have been guilty was in the course of the exercise of their franchises as a New Jersey corporation, and the extent of their liability is therefore to be determined by the laws of that state.”</p>
