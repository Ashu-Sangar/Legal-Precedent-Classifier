    <p class="summary" id="b343-10" data-blocks='[["BL_343.14",343,[180,1197,1174,863]]]'>The parties from Illinois deduced title from their brother and uncle, Charles Bryant, who was born at North Bridgewater, Massachusetts, but who was taken by his parents in his infancy to the west. The date of his birth, as ascertained by the public records of the town, was November 10, 1831. In some way, during the progress of the journey westward, which was performed in wagons, the child disappeared, and his history thenceforth was a blank although his parents survived until 1868. In this instance, even the slight clue which was furnished by the daguerreotype was wanting — the child of two or three years being hardly discernible in the man of thirty-five. The claimants rested their case upon what they term record evidence— the town register and, the United States certificate. It was unfortunate for them that these papers were mutually destructive of the theory of identity, because the person described in the certificate must have been at least eight years, older than the person named in the register. The claim is dismissed.</p>
