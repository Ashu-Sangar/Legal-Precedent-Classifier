Accordingly, on the 23d of December, 1895, it was decreed that W. P. Bigley and Sarah E. Bigley, two of defendants, and these relator plaintiffs, be required to remove the fiatboat within sixty days, and further, be enjoined from maintaining the same in front of the lots.</p>

The next day, the recognizances were tendered to Judge White for approval; he refused to approve them, but directed, that before defendant’s appeal should operate as a supersedeas, they should enter into recognizance in sum of #2,000, conditioned for payment of damages as well as costs, and stating, apparently, as the reason for enlarging the penalty in the bond, that defendants persisted in continuing the nuisance.</p>

On the 12th of February, 1896, we awarded an alternative mandamus. To this, return was made by Judge White, in part as follows:</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.4",513,[148,502,1172,1369]]]'>“ At the trial of said cases, it was clearly proved that the plaintiffs in the two cases had large iron establishments on the banks of the Allegheny river, with titles extending to said river; Adams on the lower side of a street running to the river, and the steel company on the upper side, their lands abutting on the street; that the defendants had a large float or flatboat, opposite the mouth of the street, and extending a considerable distance above and below, in front of plaintiffs’ properties; that this float was fastened to stakes in. the banks of the plaintiffs’ properties, and had a board passageway to the street, used by teams for hauling coal, sand, and other materials to and from the float; that they had an office on said float, and also stable or shed where they kept their horses or mules ; that in addition to the float, the defendants had always barges or boats tied to their float, bringing and taking away material, and these always seriously interfered with the plaintiffs’ land, and sometimes entirely obstructed the landing in front of plaintiffs’ properties, and entirely at all times prevented them from any landing at the street; that the defendants for some years had used their float and barges as a regular place of business for delivering coal and sand in the city, and for collecting and shipping manure, and greatly to the injury of the plaintiffs in their business. One great source of damage was the accumulation of river drift at the float, which obstructed the influent pipes to plaintiffs’ works, causing delay and expense, and which, if continued might stop the works for awhile, most disastrously to plaintiffs’ business. . . .</p>

The court found as facts: There was no street along the river between the river and the lots; that Fourteenth street is forty feet wide, and led to the river between the lot of Adams, on one side and the Shoenberger Steel Company on the other; that defendants’ boat was one hundred and seventy feet long, and extended across the street and along the front of each property, and by so placing it the plaintiffs were deprived of the possession and enjoyment of their lots; that they had, as riparian owners of these lots, and as against defendants, the exclusive right to such possession. Clearly, the subject of litigation was the right to real property. We do not, in this proceeding, pass on the finding of facts by the learned judge of the court below, nor do we review his conclusions of law; the time for that is <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>on the hearing of the appeal. What we do determine, is, that manifestly from the pleadings, proofs and decree, the controversy was over the possession of real property. The effect of the execution of the decree is to oust these defendants from what the court found to be a defiant, wrongful possession of this realty, and to cause a redelivery of such possession to plaintiffs. The petitioners ask that this order be stayed pending the appeal; their case then comes under the fourth condition of the act of 17th of March, 1845. That condition reads thus:</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[148,799,1172,608]]]'>“4. If the decree or order appealed from direct the sale or delivery of the possession of any real property, the issuing and execution of process to enforce the same, shall not be stayed until a bond be given with sureties as hereinbefore directed, in such penalty as the court of common pleas shall deem sufficient,' conditioned that during the possession of such real property by such appellant, he will not commit or suffer any waste to be committed thereon; and in ease such appeal be dismissed or discontinued, or such order or decree be affirmed, such appellant will pay the value of the use and occupation of such property, from the time of such appeal, until the delivery of the possession thereof, pursuant to such order or decree.”</p>
    <p id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[149,1416,1171,453]]]'>The reasons given for exacting the additional amount, by the learned judge of the court below, as heretofore quoted, are covered by the words of this condition; therefore he did not exceed the power the act conferred. If he had directed the condition of the bond to be for the value and occupation by defendants of plaintiffs’ property pending the appeal, as is the language of the act, as well as for costs, it would only have expressed the same thought as “ damages ” to plaintiffs from the possession by defendants of the property during the same interval.</p>
