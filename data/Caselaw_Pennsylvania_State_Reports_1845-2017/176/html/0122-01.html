His will consists of eleven items and a codicil. In the first item he gives a life estate, in a part of his real and personal estate, to his wife, using the -words, “ Rents, issues and profits,” and in case the provision made was not sufficient to maintain her in comfort, his executors were to furnish out of the proceeds of sale of his personal or real estate sufficient means for that purpose. In the second item he empowered his executors to “ sell or lease the William Green tract of land,” and to make a deed in fee simple ; but the tract was not to be sold for two years after his decease, unless for a certain price, and to be paid one fourth part in cash and the residue in annual payments, or in short periods. In the third item he “ devises in fee, etc., to C. to possess immediately after the death of my wife, if C. be then living,” etc., a certain property. In the fourth clause he “ devises to F., my granddaughter, in fee to possess, if she be then living, immediately after the death of <em>my </em>wife.” In the fifth item he devises “in fee severally to my granddaughter, A., to possess immediately after the death of my wife, if then living, and to E., to possess, if then living, immediately after the death of my wife,” giving to each by name a separate and distinct part by metes and bounds “ to hold in severalty, with the right to use, in common, the well in the rear of the buildings; ” then follows a bequest of a specific sum to each, in case the devise should be defeated. In the sixth clause he devises to his daughter A. “ the proceeds of the contract of sale I have made with J., of my lot,” etc., authorizing and directing lfis executors to make a deed of conveyance to J., the purchaser. He also “ gives and bequeaths to her, the said A., the one equal half part of the net rents, issues and profits ” of a farm “ to be paid to her, half yearly, until she receives her share of the proceeds <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>of sale ” of the William Green tract, then said half part to cease to be received by her, “ but if the gift of the half part of said ■ proceeds should fail, then she is to receive semi-annually, in lieu thereof, the sum of $100.00,” until she shall receive “her share of the proceeds of sale ” of the William Green tract, and no longer; but when she receives any part of her share from said William Green tract, her share of the rents, issues and profits of said semiannual payments shall be reduced by an amount equal to the interest, at six per centum per annum, of the part she shall have received of “ said proceeds of sale ” of the William Green tract. In item eight he devises “ in fee to my three daughters, Eliza, Ann and Amelia, as tenants in common, to take effect immediately after the death of my wife, my homestead where I reside, above described, devised to my wife for life, with the appurtenances.” In item ninth he devises “ to my granddaughter E., and sister F., as tenants in common, in fee, to possess immediately after the death of my wife, if they, or either of them, be then living,” my lot, etc. (one of the houses, the rent of which was given to his wife during life, in first item of the will), but if from any cause this devise should fail, and be defeated, then they were to be paid the sum of $50.00 in lieu thereof.</p>

I do not understand that it is contended by either side that there is a general intent, or scheme, in the will of the testator which controls, or governs the construction to be placed upon the tenth item. I have examined it carefully, and it seems to me, however, that there are expressions in the will which throw some light on the way in which the tenth item is to be construed. This will has been before the Supreme Court of this state twice, and portions of it passed upon by that tribunal. In the case of Brisben’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/70/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="70 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1028236" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0405-01">70 Pa. 405</a>, it is said by Shajrswood, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, “ That the testator (Hugh Bellas) was a lawyer of distinguished learning and ability — one of the foremost men at the bar in northern Pennsylvania, and that his will was drawn with great care and skill, and is so clearly expressed, at least, as to the questions raised upon this record, as to leave no doubt as to his intention. Indeed, he has left construction no room for work, and for that reason it has not been found easy to frame any contention upon the subject.” In the case first cited great importance was given to the distinction made by the testator in the use of the expressions, “proceeds of sale or lease,” and “proceeds of sale,” and “rents, issues and profits,” and the court further said, “ Technical words are always to be construed according to their technical meaning, unless there be some ex<a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>pression which clearly Indicates a contrary intention; and surely this is a rule which ought to be applied to the will of a lawyer.” In the will before us the testator devised life estates, estates in fee, estates in remainder, postponed the enjoyment of the same in some instances, provided for annuities in the event of a failure in a devise, and in each case with clearness of expression, so that it must be conceded that he was not only acquainted but familiar with the meaning of the technical expressions he used. In the sixth clause of the will he speaks of one of his devisees, who is named in the ’residuary clause as follows : “ But when she receives any part of her share from said William Green tract,” her share of the rents, issues and profits, etc., shall be reduced, etc., and, “ of the part she shall have received of said proceeds of sale of the William Green tract,” and again, “until she receives her share of the proceeds of sale of my said tract at the town of Shamoldn, in the name of ‘William Green,’ ” and again, in the eleventh item of the will, in the event of only one executor acting, the power of sale given “ shall be executed by him, but only on the mitten request of my three daughters, or some two of them.” These three daughters are the residuary legatees or devisees, and the special object of its bounty. And again, in the codicil he gives all the estate of one of these residuary legatees or devisees to trustees, and they “ are required to apply all the proceeds and profits thereof to her personal use, and support, and benefit, from time to time, as she may have need and require, when by her demanded, in writing, for herself and her children, but not to be applied or used otherwise.” It seems to the auditor that the fact that the testator has nowhere given the sons or daughters of the legatees or devisees under the residuary clause in the will a voice, or in any manner considered any claims they might have under that clause, if construed as contended by their counsel, but, on the contrary, gives to his legatees or devisees by name under that clause a fee, which carries with it full control of the estate devised, and in the codicil, in the case of one, stating clearly that she is to have it when by her demanded, in writing, for herself and children, is strongly persuasive, if not conclusive, that it was the intention of the testator to give to his daughters a fee as expressed in the technical language used, and that the language used subsequently is not sufficiently clear to cut down the fee to a life estate. Familiar <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>as lie was with the technical language he used, and other clauses in the will, showing clearly that he knew just what language to use to create a life estate, a remainder and a fee, that it would have been the most natural thing for him to have used language that clearly would have indicated his intention to cut down the fee already given, if that had been his intention. I think it amounts to no more than a mere request, and that it was his intention to devise a fee, I think is clearly expressed in the codicil. It is true, the court has declared the trust a passive one, and to that extent a failure to carry out the testator’s intention, so far as an active trust was intended; yet I think it is an expression of the light in which the testator looked upon the devise in the tenth item. If a fee was not given, why attempt to fetter it with a trust, with no disposition after the donee was dead and the trust thereby ended?</p>

If anything is intended, it is a restraint upon the estate given.

The second, because even a clear intention of the testator cannot be permitted to contravene the settled rules of law depriving an estate of its essential legal attributes.” Whilst the cases relied upon recognize, and others clearly establish, the principle contended for in the first proposition of counsel for contestants, yet some of them are adversely decided, for the reason that the facts do not bring them within the principles of law laid down, and it seems to me that just here is where the trouble is in the case at bar. The facts do not bring it within the principle sought to be applied to it. Redfield on Wills is standard authority in America on many subjects connected with wills, but on the question at issue it is not, for the reason that the rule has not been adopted here.</p>

That the rule of law is as is contended, for in this proposition, is well settled. Does the language of the will bring it within that rule ? Bearing in mind the fact that the testator was a distinguished lawyer, and that he made use of phrases and technical terms throughout his will, which conclusively show that he was familiar with the nicer distinctions of the law, he must be presumed to fully understand the technical terms he made use of in his will. If he did, and that must be conceded, what did he mean by the subsequent words, made use of after the giving of the fee in the tenth item ? There does not seem to be a general scheme in the will by which there was to be a fixed period after the happening of some event, or a period of time after which this residuary estate was to be distributed except that necessarily required for the payment of the debts, and the period of the death of the widow. There was no provision for the application of the income of this residue to the donees (except as provided for one of them in his codicil) during their lives; no provision that thejr should not dispose of it while they lived, and no specific disposition made of it after the death of the donees. The language used seems to me to be the expression of a desire upon the part of the testator that the donees should malee a certain use of his bounty. It is contended that this request is mandatory, and amounts to a devise. This would be so if made use of in a direct devise, but the rule is different when having made a disposition he expresses a desire that the donee should make a certain use of Ms bounty: Burt v.

Tins is conceded. It must, however, clearly appear by some expression that the intent of the testator was contrary to the technical words used, and the true test is whether the intent is to give a smaller estate than the meaning of the words of the gift standing alone would import, or to impose restraints upon the estate given. The former is always lawful and effective; the latter rarely, if ever (Good v.

It was held that the donee took a fee. That not a word indicated an intention to qualify or change the absolute devise which he had made to her. It was, also, said that where a testator gives an estate in fee simple, and subsequent parts of the will unequivocally show that he means the devisee to take a less estate only, the prior devise is to be restricted accordingly, but such restriction will not be affected by' words importing merely an intent or desire of the testator to withhold legal incidents of the estate already given. This case was decided adversely to the principle contended for, because the facts failed to bring it within the rule. It seems to me that this case is a much stronger one than the case at bar, and if the language used did not unequivocally show that the testator meant to cut down the fee to a less estate, then certainly the language used by the testator in the case at bar could not be held to cut down the fee previously given to a smaller or lesser estate. It certainly does not unequivocally appear that he did intend to cut down the fee. I cannot say that there is anything in the will, or the tenth clause, that would lead me to think, much less to conclude, that the word fee, in the first part of the tenth item of the will, was inadvertently used, nor can I see how the clause could be transposed so as to change the meaning, or effect, of the technical language used.

Whilst it is true that the question decided was as to the validity of the trust, yet incidental to that question was the question as to what estate the donee took under the tenth clause of the will, in connection with the attempted creation of a trust by the codicil. The donee in that contest stood in the same position as to the estate she took, as the donees in this contest. It was there held that the trust was passive, and the cestui que trust was entitled to a conveyance of the property, because under the tenth clause in the will she took an absolute estate; in other words, a fee.</p>

The court, in rendering the decision, say that there is “no limitation over, either of <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>income or of principal of the -estate, to any person. There are no other estates or interests to be preserved.” No ultimate purpose of any kind, requiring the continuance of the trust, is expressed in the will, or can it be implied from its terms, except the mere payment of the income to the cestui que trust.</p>
