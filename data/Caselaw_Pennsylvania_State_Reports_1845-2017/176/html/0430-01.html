They practically admit, in their answers and testimony, their failure of performance, and among other things allege, by way of defense, that the water stipulated could not be procured in quality and quantity, and that strict performance was impossible.</p>

That from the making of the contract up to the bringing of this suit, during the dry seasons of each year, the defendant water company has not furnished an adequate supply of water to the borough of Du Bois and its inhabitants. The standing pressure of the water during said periods, at the intersection of Long and High streets, has not been eighty pounds pressure per square inch, and at higher elevations the pressure was proportionably lower. At some points water was only to be had in the mornings, and at others none at any time.</p>

In pursuance of said contract the water company put down water pipes, with the hydrants stipulated for, in the borough, and from thence ran pipes to springs on the designated lands of John E. Du Bois. Pure water was thus procured in sufficient quantity at the outset during the wet season, but which utterly failed during dry seasons. These pipes were subsequently extended to other springs and streams, but without success. Water in sufficient quantities, with all the efforts put forth was not obtained from said designated lands. Subsequently, for a time, the supply of water from the springs was supplemented by water pumped into the reservoir from the artesian well of John E. Du Bois in the borough of Du Bois, but it was impure and unwholesome water, and was not of the character stipulated for. Still later, to wit: after this suit was commenced the water company expended a large sum of money to wit: $ <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>in endeavoring to procure water. They sank three shafts, from the bottom of which they drilled wells. These were connected, and water from them pumped into the reservoir, and from thence it flowed to the borough. These shafts were not on the lands designated in the contract, but were on the low lands of the valley of Sandy creek. Water thus obtained in sufficient quantity, but not of the quality stipulated for in the contract. It is impure, deleterious to health, and unfit for domestic use.</p>

These are material and essential elements of the contract, and constitute substantially the whole consideration the borough was to receive for the covenants entered into and privileges granted by it.</p>

The contract as originally made was not subsequently changed or supplied by the parties, nor were any of its provisions waived by the borough or any of its officials or representatives by its authority. It is true certain negotiations were had between the defendant water company and a committee appointed by resolution of the town council of the borough after the bringing of the suit, with a view of adjusting or avoiding the difficulties between them, which may have and probably did encourage the former to expend money in securing water elsewhere than from the springs designated in the contract, yet nothing was said or done to encourage the company to conclude that a supply of water from other sources would be received as performance under the contracts unless it was of the quality as well as of the quantity stipulated for, which it was not.</p>

Pancoast, <a href="/pa/30/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="30 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="415536" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0089-01">30 Pa. 89</a>, it was said by Stbong-, J., “ Inadequacy of price, improvidence, surprise, and mere hardship have each been held sufficient to stay the active interposition of a chancellor. Yet no one of these, nor all combined, furnishes an adequate reason for a judicial rescission of a contract. For such action something more is demanded — such as fraud, mistake or illegality.” In Rockafellow v. Baker, <a href="/pa/41/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="41 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="480066" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0319-01">41 Pa. 319</a>, it was said, “ our interposition is invoked, not to carry out- and accomplish what the parties have begun, but to undo what the parties have accomplished. How narrow the grounds are upon which a court of equity will interpose for such a purposemd how cautious and reluctant its steps will be in that direc<a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>tion, were fully shown in Graham v. Pancoast, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Pa.%2097" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="30 Pa. 97">30 Pa. 97</a>, and Nace v. Boyer, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Pa.%20109" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="30 Pa. 109">30 Pa. 109</a>. Nothing but fraud or palpable mistake is ground for rescinding an executed contract.” And in Stephens &amp; Wife’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/87/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="87 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="1057794" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0202-01">87 Pa. 202</a>, it was said, “No fraud or mistake, or turpitude of consideration and circumstances entitling her to relief on the principle of quia timet are proven. Nothing less than one of these, clearly established, would justify the court in ordering the rescission of an executed contract.” No case has gone beyond these, and while we do not say that a willful and obstructive refusal to perform a contract, under circumstances which practically prevent the party aggrieved from entering into another, may not afford ground for equitable cancellation, yet some such special grounds must appear in order to take the case out of the general rule that 'remedy for mere breach must be sought at law.</p>
    <p id="b455-3" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[182,1133,1176,1275]],["BL_456.1",456,[236,369,1162,145]]]'>Tested by these settled principles there is no case here at all for the court’s interference. Neither the bill nor the findings of fact under it charge any fault to the defendants. They show a want of strict performance, but they also show that strict performance was impossible, not from any lack of effort on the part of the defendants, but because the contract limits the source of supply to springs on the Du Bois land, and those springs are inadequate to furnish the needed quantity of water. The utmost that is made out by the bill and the evidence is that the contract calls for the performance of an impossibility by reáson of a mistake of fact as to the capacity of the stipulated source of supply. But this mistake was no more the fault of defendants than of plaintiff, and the parties cannot be put back in statu quo. If the defendants have, to their misfortune, made a contract whose full performance is impossible, they may be unable to recover the stipulated rental, either in whole or in part. But this is a matter of defense in an action at law, and affords no ground for the cancellation of the contract. Certainly there is no equity in putting the entire loss arising from a mutual mistake upon one party, with no consideration for the injury to its plant and franchise, and no allowance for the money already expended thereon without fault. The case is preeminently one for mutual concession and amicable adjustment on a fair basis, either by reduction of the rental, or by enlargement of the permitted source of supply. But failing this action by the parties <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>themselves, equity will not help one of them to put the whole loss on the other, but will le'ave them to such remedies as they may have in a court of law.</p>
    <p id="b456-4" data-blocks='[["BL_456.4",456,[230,523,1170,1574]]]'>Reference was made in the court below and here to the act of April 29, 1874, sec. 34, cl. 3, P. L. 94 (Purdon, 12 ed. 955, pi. 4), relating to gas and water companies, by which the courts of common pleas are authorized on bill filed by any citizen using the water, alleging impurity or deficiency, to compel the water company to correct the evil complained of, and to mate “such order in the premises as may seem just and equitable.” The learned judge below was of opinion that this remedy did not apply to cases of contract, but only to water rights acquired by eminent domain under the act of 1874, and it has been argued here by appellees, citing Lehigh Water Company’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/102/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="102 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="502708" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0515-01">102 Pa. 515</a>, and Freeport Water Worts Co. v. Prager, <a href="/pa/129/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="129 Pa. 605" data-case-ids="568041" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0605-01">129 Pa. 605</a>, that this section applies only to private citizens and does not include municipal corporations. Both these views however are erroneous. , What was decided in those cases was that the exclusive privilege of furnishing water, given by the act to the first company erecting works, does not prevail against a city or borough building waterworks in its municipal capacity and under its general powers. In the present case the borough is not the builder or owner of waterworks but a mere consumer under contract, and stands upon the same basis as any private citizen in regard thereto. The remedy given by the act is intended to be adequate, and we see no reason why it may not be made so. The whole subject is put under the control of the court in the broadest terms, and being one which concerns the public interests maybe treated with regard thereto, to the extent necessary, even to the reformation of the contract upon a basis just and equitable to both parties, where, as here, it was made in mutual mistake as to an essential fact, and a remedy for the difficulty may be found without violation of the main intent of both parties in the original instrument.</p>
