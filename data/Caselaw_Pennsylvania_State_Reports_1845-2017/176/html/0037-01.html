He furnished a statement to the defendant showing the amount of cash due for the balance. Defendant tendered the amount stated and a conveyance of two houses. Plaintiff refused the tender, claiming certain defects in the houses, and that he had made a mistake in his statement, and that a larger amount of cash was due. The evidence showed that the defects were in trivial matters, and could have been remedied at a trifling cost. <em>Held, </em>that neither the trivial defects in the buildings nor the refusal to pay the disputed balance justified the plaintiff in refusing to take the houses, or entitles him to a recovery of the whole consideration in money.</p>

The amount of the plaintiff’s claim for the work he did was $2,508. The two houses were to be taken at the price of $650 each, subject to two ground rents, a ground rent on each house.</p>

No objection was made to the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that designates that particular house as one of the houses which the plaintiff was to take, because the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant was not made until the 3d day of September, 1892.. The testimony shows that at that time the house was under .roof and had been plastered, so that when the plaintiff made this contract on December 30, 1892, he was perfectly ¡familiar with that thing which had occurred before. He knew whether he was to take that house, and the house seems to be standing yet, and the building inspector tells you he found nothing the matter with that wall which would require its being taken down.</p>

But in this case the plaintiff has' simply declined to take the <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>houses, that is he has declined to accept the deed for the houses, although he had before really taken possession of one of the houses and sold it and put in possession his vendee.] [1]</p>

I have either to take that view of the case, which I think is the more favorable to the plaintiff, or I would have to charge you absolutely for the defendant. But as I see in the contract it sets up the amount of work done, and sets up the contract between Mr. Cassidy and the plaintiff, I think I shall give a liberal construction to the paper and treat it as though it were a suit brought by the plaintiff against the defendant for the value of his services rendered by the plaintiff in the carpenter work on these fifty-six houses,, and not treat it simply as. a suit for damages for the failure to* convey the houses, because if I treated it simply as that, there-would be nothing for you to do but to find a verdict for the defendant, because the plaintiff admits that the deed was tendered to him, the deed is put in evidence; the plaintiff says the defendant tendered him the deed, and, so far as it would be- a question of the conveyance of property, your verdict would have to be for the defendant, because that is a matter sworn to by both sides.</p>

Gentlemen, if you find that was the case, if you find that Mr. Hahn undertook this work and the completion of' these buildings on the basis of that paper signed by the plaintiff, then as. between Mr. Hahn and the plaintiff, you must take the statements in that paper as being true. That paper says that there were certain amounts of money received by the plaintiff on account of the work which he did and was to do on these houses, and you must take those figures as being true. If, however, you should find — and I leave that question to you, although the evidence I can hardly say throws much light on that subject — if you should find the plaintiff did not know the purposes for which that paper was to be used, that it was to be handed to Mr. Hahn and to be made the basis of Ms accepting or not accepting the work of the completion of the houses, the plaintiff would not be bound by the figures in that paper.

If, however, you believe that, and take the paper, then you will find that there would be one other question of dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant so far as the amount of money is concerned, <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>and that is the question whether or not the plaintiff was to pay the defendant $30.00 for lumber which the defendant gave the plaintiff for the erection of the summer kitchen of these two houses.</p>

Ordinarily, when one man would ask another to do a service for him, or to furnish material, the law would presume he was to pay what the services were reasonably worth, or what the material was reasonably worth.

Starting with that amount of $314 you will say whether or not you shall deduct from that the $80.00 to which I have referred, the $55.00 and the $25.00 which by that paper the plaintiff stated he had received, or whether you will not deduct that amount, and also whether or not you will deduct the amount of $30.00.

    <p id="b62-8" data-blocks='[["BL_62.11",62,[227,1274,1161,758]]]'>The plaintiff agreed to do the carpenter work necessary in the erection of a number of houses for a fixed price, and to accept in part payment thereof a conveyance of two of the houses, the balance to be paid in money. Some payments were made as the work progressed. This suit was brought to recover in money the whole of the price agreed upon, less the payments made during the progress of the work. The plaintiff alleged that the houses were not completed and conveyed, and that the whole of the money consideration was not paid. The dispute as to the amount of the payments was referred to the jury, and no question relating to them is before us. The learned judge, being of opinion that the plaintiff -had not shown an adequate reason for refusing to take the houses as agreed, instructed the jury that there could be no recovery except for the balance due in money under the terms of the agreement.</p>
    <p id="b62-9" data-blocks='[["BL_62.12",62,[227,2040,1160,348]],["BL_63.1",63,[207,352,1158,864]]]'>It was not disputed that a conveyance of the houses was tendered to the plaintiff. Pie had some months before taken possession of one of them, sold it, received a part of the purchase money and put the vendee in possession, and he had exercised acts of ownership over the other house. There was no testimony to show that the houses were not substantially completed ; the defects were in trivial matters and could have been <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>remedied at a trifling cost. When the defendant offered to convey the houses he also offered to pay the balance of the money which appeared by a written statement signed by the plaintiff to be due, less an amount which he claimed for lumber sold to the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that there was an error in the statement which he' had rendered, and that the lumber had been given to him by the defendant. Practically the dispute was about these two matters. A refusal fo pay the disputed balance was not such a breach of the contract by the defendant as to justify the plaintiff in refusing to take the houses and to entitle him to a recovery of the whole consideration in money. He had misled the defendant by the statement which he had rendered, and the counterclaim for the price of the lumber was made in good faith. As the case was treated at the trial and submitted to the jury the verdict does not estop the plaintiff from claiming a conveyance of the houses, and this under the testimony is all he is entitled to.</p>
    <p id="b63-4" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[251,1225,475,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
