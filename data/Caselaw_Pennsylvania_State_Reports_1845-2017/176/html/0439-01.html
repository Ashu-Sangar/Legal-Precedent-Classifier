Du Bois at a given pressure at a certain point in the borough, and that it was impossible to supply the water from that source. That the water was not there to be had. This impossibility of performance may have existed at the time the contract was entered into and in all probability did so exist. In fact there is no other conclusion that can be reached than that the impossibility existed at the time the contract was entered into, but there is nothing on the face of the contract to indicate any impossibility of performance. The <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>breaches of the contract are of matters material and vital to its existence. With these removed from it nothing of essence -will remain. The impossibility of performance was certainly their misfortune. By agreeing to furnish pure and wholesome water of a certain quantity from specified springs and lands they practically set up themselves as experts and should have known or ascertained whether such water could be had. Their losses resulting from error of judgment must be borne by themselves. This results not from their failure to do that which was impossible, but from their agreeing to do it. They could have protected themselves by a stipulation in the contract, if agreeable to the other contracting parties, but the contract in question contains no such stipulation, and the rights of the parties are to be judged of under the contract as it is. The fact that both parties may have been ignorant as to the extent of the water supply will not excuse either from performance. . . .</p>

A defective, negligent and worthless performance is the same as no performance at all. Had there been substantial performance and had the defendant borough accepted the benefits accruing from the same, and thereby encouraged the water company to proceed therewith, resulting in the expenditure of money and effort therein, it could not have plead entire discharge from liability, but would have been liable on the quantum meruit, that is to say, would be liable to pay such reasonable amount as would be just and right under the circumstances.</p>

It is true that there may be implied contract under certain circumstances, under which a borough may be held liable to pay to another for services received or for property taken and used by its officers, even without authority from its town council, but certainly it cannot be said it would be liable for acts directly prohibited by it. If it could be so made liable, then the authority of the borough would not exclusively be vested in a town council, but it might be made hable by a congregation of people at a conflagration at the time of great excitement, or by the action of a fire company, or in any other way. A borough cannot be held liable, under ordinary <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>circumstances, except by authority from its town council. Having elected to rescind the contract and having given notice to the superintendent of the fire department, and he in turn to the fire companies or their officers not to use the water, their use of it was unauthorized and would not have the effect of making the borough liable therefor, even under an implied contract. A contracting party cannot set up his own failure of performance, even though it be on account of inability or impossibility, as an excuse for an entire performance or to justify him in claiming a quantum meruit. He can only thus recover when his failure is caused by the acts of the other party, and there is no evidence here of such acts.</p>

There is nothing in the evidence to show that this action was ever annulled, or that the borough subsequently authorized any of its officials or other persons to use the water for fire or any other purpose for which rental was to be paid, and any use that may have been of it in an emergency was unauthorized.</p>
