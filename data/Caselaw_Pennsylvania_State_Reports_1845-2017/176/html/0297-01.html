O. Thompson, as receiver under certain proceedings in New York, to Jas. A. Mundy, John M. Sharp and Clarence M. Busch, but bills of sale for said property were made to H. A. Y. Post, as trustee for said vendor, to hold the title as collateral security for the payment of the unpaid purchase money. In June, 1891, the purchasers formed a corporation entitled the Philadelphia Dredging Company, to which they transferred, and which took possession of this property and used it in removing islands in the Delaware river opposite Philadelphia, under a contract between the <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>firm of Jas. A. Mundy <em>&amp; Go. </em>and the United States government. While engaged in this work the vessels were stationed in the river. On February <em>2, </em>1892, Mundy, Sharp and Busch, describing themselves as sole stockholders of the Phila. Dredging Co., sold said property to C. Amory Stevens. The contract was signed by these parties individually and also by the “Phila. Dredging Co., Jas. A. Mundy, Prest.” In pursuance of this purchase Stevens took actual and exclusive possession of the plant and operated it. He occupied the office formerly occupied by the Dredging Co. He did not put up any sign. It did not appear whether he removed the sign of the Dredging Co. or not. He ordered coal from the defendant, using for that purpose the blank orders formerly used by the Dredging Co., which in the upper corner contained their title, and in the lower corner their printed signature. Across the latter he stamped his own name in red letters. The bills of lading for coal made out by the railroad company and signed by the captains of the vessels who received' it continued to be made out in the name of the Dredging Co., which also was charged with the coal by the defendant and bills rendered in that name. Stevens paid said bills with his own checks accompanied by vouchers made out in his own name.</p>

It is urged that whatever might be the rights of Stevens, the purchaser from the vendee, such rights are not in issue in the present case; that the original vendor, or his trustee, cannot rely upon Stevens’ title, but must rely upon his own; that as between him and the attaching creditors that title is invalid. There is some plausibility in this contention, but, in the opinion of the referee, it is not sound. The legal title reserved in the vendor, or in the trustee for his benefit, is a perfectly valid title. It is not void, but is good between the parties and as against volunteers. Under the law of Pennsylvania, however, it is invalid as to attaching creditors of the vendee. This right of the attaching creditor is an absolute one, irrespective of any actual fraud or notice. It can be asserted, however, only in case the attaching creditor has acquired a lien upon the property. The outstanding title in the vendor is not a fraud upon the creditor <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>as such. If before the levy of his attachment it is reduced into possession, it is valid as against him: Hineman v. Mathews, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20Pa.%20204" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="188 Pa. 204">188 Pa. 204</a>. It is not merely the fact that he is a creditor that gives him the right, but the fact that he has a hen acquired while the vendee was in possession as owner. It follows, therefore, that if before the levy of the attachment the vendee has parted with his entire title to a stranger, the right of the creditor to put himself in a position to contest the validity of the outstanding legal title is at an end. The interest of the vendee in the property being extinguished, the levy of an attachment by one of his creditors thereafter gives to such attaching creditor no lien whatever upon the property. There being no interest to attach there is nothing upon which the attaching creditor can acquire a lien. The existence of this hen is essential to enable him to contest the outstanding legal title. Without it he is a mere stranger. The only parties interested in the property at the time of the attachment were the purchasers from the vendee and the vendor who held the outstanding title as collateral security. No .creditor of the vendee could at that time acquire a hen by attachment, and the title of the vendor being a good title against all the world, except the holder of such a hen, must be sustained if asserted.

The property in question was in the Delaware river, being used in the work of dredging. The written agreement in evidence, and the evidence of Stevens and the other witnesses, although not very full, does show that Stevens, actually for a valuable consideration, purchased, took possession of, and thereafter exclusively operated the plant. There is no evidence that any of the officers or stockholders of the company continued around the work thereafter, or had apparently anything to do with its operation. So far as the testimony shows, the three stockholders of the Philadelphia Dredging Company, who were also its officers, operated the plant in the name of the company down to the purchase by Stevens, and after that date it was taken possession of and operated by Stevens alone. The fact that Stevens took actual and exclusive possession is conclusive against the contention that <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>the case is one of legal fraud, and leaves the rights of the parties to depend on the question of actual fraud, as to which the facts stated are only items of evidence which might, in connection with others, justify a verdict: [2] Hugus v. Robinson, <a href="/pa/24/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="24 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="9502916" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0009-01">24 Pa. 9</a>; Janney v.

    <p class="summary" id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[246,606,1165,861]]]'>The burden of proof is upon the creditors attacking the validity of the sale, and the facts which have been put in evidence by them, while, as has been said, they might be material in connection with other proof, if offered, to show fraud or failure to change possession, do not in themselves, in the opinion of the referee, justify him in finding that there was such fraud, or such failure to take possession, as would render the sale invalid as against creditors. That the plant was in the actual and exclusive possession of Stevens, and not of the Philadelphia Dredging Company, seems not to be seriously disputed, nor is there any evidence to show collusion between Stevens and the company, or that he occupied any other relation towards it than that of a purchaser for value of its plant. Under these circumstances it would require strong evidence of fraud or concealment of change of possession to warrant the referee in finding Stevens’ title invalid as against creditors, and in his opinion the facts do not justify such a finding. [3]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[244,1472,1168,913]],["BL_321.1",321,[155,365,1170,1477]]]'>It is contended by the attaching creditors that even if Stevens’ title and possession were valid, and even if they could not, while Stevens was thus in possession, have acquired by the levy the right to attack and defeat the outstanding legal title of the vendor, yet nevertheless, as the Philadelphia Dredging Company or its stockholders did, in point of fact, take possession again from Stevens, and as the levy was made while the property was thus in possession of the Philadelphia Dredging Company, that therefore their attachment gave them a lien upon it, which enables them to raise the question of the validity of the legal title. In the opinion of the referee the solution of this question depends upon whether the possession of the Philadelphia Dredging Company was a possession which gave them any title whatever which could be attached. The undisputed evidence in the case is that the taking of possession by the Philadelphia Dredging Company on August 15, 1892, was entirely tortious. It has been testified by Stevens that Mundy, Sharp and Busch wrongfully and forcibly took possession of the prop<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>erty, and the testimony has not been in any way contradicted. For the purpose of this case it must be assumed that without any shadow of right these three parties forcibly possessed themselves of the property and were in possession simply as any other wrongdoer would be in possession of property of which he wrongfully took possession, but which really belonged to other persons. If this be so, it is difficult to see how any attachment by creditors of the Philadelphia Dredging Company could possibly give a lien which would enable the plaintiffs in the attachment to contest the legal ownership of others in the property. As has already been stated, Post, the owner of the legal title, had a valid title. The only other person interested was Stevens, who had the equitable title, arising from the original contract to purchase and the assignment by the vendee to him. As between themselves, both titles were valid. It is difficult to see how any person by forcibly taking the property from either could give the creditors of such wrongdoer a right to contest the title of either. If an entire stranger to the transaction had stolen the property from Stevens, the creditors of such wrongdoer would have had no rights as against the holder of either the legal or the equitable title, and the fact that the person who so wrongfully took possession was a person who had at one time a title to the property cannot, in the opinion of the referee, affect the result. The referee is therefore of opinion that the possession of the Philadelphia Dredging Company being a wrongful possession, without any title, was not a possession which gave its attaching creditors a standing to contest the validity of the title of those who were really the owners of the property.

    <p class="author" id="A9d" data-blocks='[["BL_322.9",322,[548,1632,460,39]]]'>Mr. Justice Mitchell,</p>
    <p id="b322-6" data-blocks='[["BL_322.10",322,[263,1683,1168,505]]]'>The hinge of this case is the character of the sale to Stevens. It maybe conceded, as it was by the learned ref eree, that Mundy, Sharp &amp; Busch were vendees in possession, and that the outstanding legal title in Post being merely security to the vendor for the purchase money, could not prevail against an attaching creditor of the vendees. For the same reasons a bona fide purchaser for value if without notice would take a superior title and if with notice, though he would take subject to the legal title as security for the purpose named, yet his title would be good as against' all others.</p>
    <p id="b322-7" data-blocks='[["BL_322.11",322,[263,2196,1167,186]],["BL_323.1",323,[204,340,1171,403]]]'>The learned referee finds that Stevens “ actually, for a valuable consideration, purchased, took possession of, and thereafter exclusively operated the plant.” This puts an end to any question of constructive fraud. It is true that the location and use <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>of the property was not changed. It could not well be, as it was employed in the work of removing the islands in the Delaware river opposite Philadelphia, under contract with the United States, and had to stay where the work was. But a change of possession may be as well by the old owner going out and the new owner coming in while the property remains in the same place, as by the new owner taking it away to a new place. The difference is not in legal effect, but in facility of proof.</p>
    <p id="b323-3" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[204,750,1167,95]]]'>With this cardinal fact thus established, the solution of the three questions presented by the appellant is not difficult.</p>
    <p id="b323-4" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[202,854,1172,863]]]'>First, it is argued that even if Stevens’ title is good, it cannot be set up to help the plaintiff, Post. It is true that the rule in sheriff’s interpleaders is that the claimant must recover on his own title and not on one outstanding in a third person, but it has no application here because Post’s title is good against all the world but certain excepted parties, to wit: creditors of the Dredging Company having a lien by levy or attachment on the property, and such lien must be acquired while the property is in the ownership or possession of the debtor. The attaching creditor here had no such lien, for both title and possession had passed out of its debtor, the Dredging Company, before its attachment was levied. There was no title or interest of the Dredging Company left for the attachment to grasp, for it had all passed to Stevens prior to the levy. The attaching creditor was therefore not within the excepted class, and as already said, against all others, the legal title of Post was good and must prevail.</p>
    <p id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.6",323,[199,1726,1172,554]]]'>Secondly, the question of legal or constructive fraud in the sale to Stevens has already been disposed of. The referee finds that there was no collusion or fraud in fact. It is true the change of ownership was not made as apparent as would have been prudent in view of the circumstances and the dealings of the parties Mundy, Sharp and Busch from whom he bought, but there seems to be no doubt that Stevens paid a fair price and thereafter operated the plant himself, with his own money, including repeated payment of this very appellant’s coal bills with his own check. We think on the evidence that the referee was entirely correct in his view of the facts.</p>
    <p id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.7",323,[198,2289,1171,99]],["BL_324.1",324,[237,343,1166,655]]]'>Thirdly, the appellant argues that even if the title and possession of Stevens were valid, yet the Dredging Company hav<a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>ing retaken the property, and being in actual possession at the time of the attachment by its creditor, the latter’s lien must prevail. If this resumption of possession had been in pursuance of any contract or any right -which remitted the company to its prior title, or gave it a new one, the position would be sound. But it was not. The referee finds that it was “ entirely tortious,” and that “ without any shadow of right, Mundy, Sharp and Busch forcibly possessed themselves of the property and were in possession simply as any other wrongdoer would be in possession of property of which he wrongfully took possession, but which really belonged to other persons.” Of course such a possession could not give an attaching creditor of the wrongdoer any more right than the wrongdoer himself.</p>
    <p id="b324-4" data-blocks='[["BL_324.4",324,[281,1006,355,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
