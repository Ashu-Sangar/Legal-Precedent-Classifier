On the day after the fire the agent saw the plaintiff and arranged a meeting between the plaintiff and the adjuster. The adjuster found that the loss had been a total one, and in excess of the amount of the insurance. He assured the plaintiff that the latter had done everything that was necessary, and that the loss would be paid, and said that he would send to plaintiff the proofs of loss ready for his signature. Two weeks afterwards, plaintiff, not having received the proofs of loss, wrote to the agent who replied, denying the liability of the company on one policy, admitting it on the other, and requesting plaintiff to correspond with the New York office. In reply to a letter addressed by the plaintiff to the New York office the manager wrote that he assumed that the correspondence referred to the policy on which the liability was admitted, and “ on that assumption we beg to refer you to the printed terms and conditions of said policy, which give full instructions as to the mode of proceeding in the event of loss.” The plaintiff at once replied, saying that the letter he had received was very unsatisfactory, that his claim was on both policies, and asking for a more specific statement of the position of the company as to the responsibility for the mistake in writing the policy. With this the correspondence ended. <em>Held, </em>that there was sufficient evidence of a waiver of proofs of loss to sustain a judgment and verdict in favor of plaintiff.</p>

The adjuster of the company notified Dr. Davidson what day he would be there, and met him and went over the premises; and it has not been disputed in the testimony here that the property was totally destroyed, nor has there been any testimony offered <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>here to show that the value of that property was not greater than the total amount of insurance claimed in this case.</p>

This, it is claimed by the plaintiff in this case, was waived by the defendant company, when its officers, the agent and adjuster were present there and saw the condition of affairs, and consequently, it being, admittedly, a total loss, no proof of loss under that clause of the policy was necessary.</p>

But that at the same time he stated that there was no dispute about the matter; that the loss was total, and that the value of the property, as I have stated, was in excess of the amount of insurance. So that the plaintiff testifies — and the witness who was there at the time the adjuster was present and heard part of the conversation so testifies — that the contract on the part of the adjuster, and his declaration at that time, was to the effect that the company would pay the insurance; that there was no question about the amount of the loss or anything of that kind.</p>

So that, so far as that question is concerned, we instruct you that there is no difficulty here in regard to that.

The plaintiff here says that that policy was issued to him by the agent of this company, Mr. Shaner, pursuant to a practice that he had of providing him with insurance from time to time as prior insurance would expire, and that he accepted it for what, on its face, it purported to be — a policy of insurance for three years — paying the premium demanded of him when the agent called on him for that purpose, subsequently, on that policy, and didn’t know that there was any question about the policy running for the term stated in it; accepted it in good faith as a policy for three years, and acted upon it as such; that prior to the time and up to the time of the death of Mr. Rankin, a prior insurance agent who did business for the defendant in this case, he says that he had carried upon this property an insurance of $2,500; that at the time of the death of Mr. Rankin he received policies, when the policies <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>then in force expired, from two sources — one from the agent, Mr. Shaner, and the other from another agent named Campbell, and that this, I believe, was in 1889, and for a year or two at least held both policies, each, as I understood him for the same amount— $1,250 — on this property. But in the subsequent year he returned the Campbell policy and retained only the Shaner policy for $1,250, and that during the year 1890, and up until 1892 when this one-year policy in suit here was taken out, had but $1,250 insurance on this building. But he says that after the three year policy was issued, and during the first year, he made application to Mr. Shaner for additional insurance on this property — spoke to him, I believe he says once or twice, possibly twice, about it, and told him he wanted him to give him another policy of insurance for the same amount; that after having spoken to him first about it, not receiving it, when he saw him again he spoke to him a second time and reminded him that he hadn’t sent <em>it; </em>and that it -was not a policy taken out in renewal of this three year policy or any other policy, but as additional insurance upon this property, to create an insurance of $2,500 upon it, and that no question was ever raised to him, and he never heard anything about any difficulty about the policy, until after his loss had occurred. And upon that testimony, going to substantiate, as he alleges, his view of the case, he asks the jury to find that he is entitled to recover the insurance upon that policy as a valid policy in force at the time of the destruction of his property, for the amount specified in the policy.] [7]</p>

They allege, first, that that policy shows upon its face some alteration or erasures, particularly in regard to the year when it would expire, and call attention to the appearance of the figures where 1894 is written upon the face or inside of the policy, and also where the same thing is written on the outside or back of the policy. They don’t say that that alteration was made by the plaintiff in this case, and indeed, Mr. Shaner, the agent, .doesn’t say that he didn’t make it if such an alteration was made, but says he has no recollection of it, and doesn’t know how it came there, or the circumstances under which it may have gotten in that condition, and won’t deny that the policy was in that shape when he sent it to Dr. Davidson.</p>

      <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>In reply to that, the plaintiff says that the same facts are apparent on the other policy; that it appears that there was an erasure in that policy, and that therefore there is nothing to be shown by that, and that Dr. Davidson testifies that the policy is in the same shape it was when he received it, particularly as to the date on the back; and further, that on the face of the policy, the term for which it is to run is written out in words as well as the dates given when it begins and when it expires, so that the three years written in words would indicate that if there was a change made in the figures it was done to conform to the period covered by the policy, and not done by any one in an effort to deceive or defraud the company by a change in the term for which it was to run. But, beyond that, they say the practice of the agent had been, about the time a policy would expire, to send a policy in renewal without any particular consultation with, or -word from the insured party, or application on his part; that he had been insuring Dr. Davidson from 1889 up to this period, and that each year had granted him but a policy for one year on that property, and that the policies were all for the same amount — $1,250—and the premium all the same amount — one and a quarter per cent on the insurance provided for, and that that amounted to' $15.63; and that in July, 1891, as his policy which he had had the previous year would expire on the 1st of August, he made out and sent him this policy, intending it to be a policy covering the same property, for the same period — one year — and for. the same amount, and for the same premium; that he did so make out this policy, which seems now to be for three years, bub that if he did it, it was a mistake on his part in making it for that period; that it was intended simply for one year as a renewal of the old policy, and that he didn’t know any better — knew nothing to the contrary until after this loss occurred and it was presented as one of the papers insuring the. property destroyed; that when he sent it, he wrote to him that he had sent it in renewal of the policy that was to expire; that he afterwards met him in his office and was paid the premium — $15.63—and receipted on the back of the policy for it. And he denies that then or at any other time Dr. Davidson ever made any application to him for additional insurance upon that property, and says, on the contrary, nothing was said by him about any additional in<a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>surance, and that in the following July when he supposed this policy was about to expire as the former policies had done in a period of one year, he made out and sent him this very policy as a renewal for this three year policy, to run from August, 1892, to August, 1893; that the amount of the premium paid him was but the one year amount, and that Dr. Davidson, they argue, did know that it was intended but as a policy for one year; that he only paid the same amount of premium on it that he had paid before for policies running one year and covering the same amount of insurance, and that he received it in accordance with the custom between them in regard to the insurance upon that property. At the time these premiums were paid, it seems that both of these policies were together in Dr. Davidson’s office and there before them, and neither of them seems to have said anything, or had their attention called to the fact that on the back of it, it was marked to expire in 1894 instead of 1892.</p>

Now that is a fact that you will have to determine from the testimony. [If the jury find that that is a mistake there, that there had been — and it is not denied by Mr. Davidson — no application for insurance for any longer period than the one year which he had been receiving — that this was a mistake upon the part of the agent of the company, known as such upon the part of Dr. Davidson, or that as an ordinarily careful, prudent business man he should have known it from the circumstances attending the business <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>dealings he had had with this party — the custom in regard to the renewal of the insurance, the amount of the insurance, the amount of premium he had paid covering this policy, and all that, and he accepted it without saying a word to them, noticing that it covered a period of three years, he would not be entitled to recover on this policy. Because, if he noticed that that was a mistake, it was his duty to advise the company of that fact and have it changed, either by changing it to one year for which it was intended, or by paying for the full term of three years, whatever the premium for that period would be.] [8] [On the other hand, if it was actually a mistake on the part of the agent, and Dr. Davidson didn’t know it was a mistake and accepted it in good faith as a policy for three years, and paid the premium demanded of him, and should not, as an ordinarily careful, prudent business man have known better in regard to it, and would suffer loss in consequence of the seeking to have additional insurance placed on his property, and getting, as he claimed here, that policy for one year in addition, and the loss occurred without any neglect on his part, why he would be entitled to recover. That is, where it is the mistake of the company and not of the party, the company will have to stand the loss. If it is a mistake, and Dr. Davidson knew that, why he has no right to claim here at all. Or, if it was a mistake and he didn’t know about it, but should have known about it as an ordinarily prudent and careful man, he has no right to recover. But, if it was a mistake and he didn’t know it and should not have known it, he wouldn’t be bound by it, but the party who made the mistake in the first instance, the party who is the culpable one of the two, would have to bear the brunt of it, and that is the company.] [9]</p>

    <p id="b552-6" data-blocks='[["BL_552.9",552,[243,1223,1168,962]]]'>The plaintiff held two policies of insurance issued by the defendant company and covering the same risk. It was admitted that one of the policies was in force when the fire occurred. It was claimed at the trial that the other policy, although written for three years, was intended to be for one year only. The fire occurred March 28, 1893. The policy in question was for the three years beginning August 1, 1891, and ending August 1, 1894. The words “ for the term of three years ” were written in the body of the policy by the agent of the company. The numeral 4 in the date 1894 was written over an erasure. It was not alleged that this had been done by the plaintiff. The ground of defense was that when the plaintiff received the policy he had, or should have had, knowledge of the mistake made by the agent or his clerk, and that with a design to take advantage of the mistake he had retained the policy instead of offering to return it or to pay the additional premium for the full term; in brief, that it was not a contract for three years, and that the plaintiff had not been misled by the agent’s mistake to his injury.</p>
    <p id="b552-7" data-blocks='[["BL_552.10",552,[245,2193,1163,191]],["BL_553.1",553,[160,360,1164,197]]]'>It was incumbent upon the plaintiff to remove the suspicion which attached to the policy- by reason of the apparent alteration. This was done. Before it was admitted in evidence he testified that it was then in the same condition that it was in <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>when received by him, and that he had accepted it and relied upon it as a policy running for three years. The issues raised by the testimony were submitted to the jury with great care and with entire fairness to both parties.</p>
    <p id="b553-3" data-blocks='[["BL_553.4",553,[161,565,1168,1580]]]'>There was ample evidence both of an express waiver of proofs of loss and of facts from which an implied waiver could arise. On the day of the fire the plaintiff wrote to the agent through whom he obtained the insurance, and five days afterward to the general manager of the insurance company, informing them of the loss. On the day after the fire the agent visited the premises, and after examining the policies arranged a meeting between the adjuster of the company and the plaintiff. The adjuster, after ascertaining that the loss was total and in excess of the amount of the insurance, assured the plaintiff that he liad done everything that was necessary and that the loss would be paid, and agreed to prepare and send to the plaintiff the proofs of loss ready for his signature. At the end of two. weeks, not having received the proofs, the plaintiff wrote to the agent calling his attention to the agreement and asking if there was anything which he should do. The agent replied by letter, denying the liability of the company on one of the policies, admitting it as to the other, and requesting the plaintiff to correspond with the New York office. The plaintiff then wrote to the manager of the New York office stating that he had been advised to do so by Mr. Henry, the adjuster, and asking that' he be addressed in regard to the matter. To this the manager replied that he assumed that the correspondence referred to the policy for one year, and “ on that assumption we beg to refer you to the printed terms and conditions of said policy, which give full instructions as to the mode of proceeding in the event of loss.” The plaintiff at once replied, saying that the letter he had received was very unsatisfactory, that his claim was on both policies, and asking for a more specific statement of the position of the company as to the responsibility for the mistake in writing the policy. With this the correspondence ended.</p>
    <p id="b553-4" data-blocks='[["BL_553.5",553,[162,2154,1165,248]],["BL_554.1",554,[248,358,1167,653]]]'>The authority of the agent in Pennsylvania, and of the adjuster, to do all that they assumed to do is undenied. There was a distinct and specific agreement in relation to the proofs of loss which relieved the plaintiff from any duty in relation to them until they were presented for his signature. This agreement <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>was made at a time when the adjuster knew of the dispute as to one of the policies. The assent of the company to the agreement was never withdrawn. The liability of the company on one of the policies was at all times admitted, and the denial of liability upon the other was based upon specific grounds. “ The trend of our decisions has been to hold insurance companies to good faith and frankness in not concealing the grounds of defense and thus misleading the insured to his disadvantage. They may remain silent except when it is their duty to speak, and the failure to do so would operate as an estoppel; but having specified a ground of defense very slight evidence has been held sufficient to establish a waiver as to other grounds.” Freedman v. Fire Ass’n, <a href="/citations/?q=168%20Pa.%20254" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="168 Pa. 254">168 Pa. 254</a>.</p>
    <p id="b554-3" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[291,1022,477,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
