Failing to obtain counsel, and laboring under a misapprehension of her rights and responsibilities, she conducted the farms as her own, obtaining the proceeds therefrom and paying thereout the running expenses, and devoting the balance to the reduction of her husband’s debts. This led to difficulties, and when her account was filed the exceptions thereto were partially sustained, and she was surcharged $752.31, making the corrected balance $4,193.94.</p>

In the last case the title was to be in the wife, and the extreme doctrines there enunciated have been modified in subsequent cases. In Miller v. Baker the facts developed were quite different from those now under consideration. Justice McCollum on p. 420 says : “We think it is clearly sufficient to warrant a finding that the farm was purchased for the wife and with her money- upon an understanding between her and her husband that she should receive the title to it, and, further, <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>that the deeds were made to him without her knowledge, and by mistake.” In Crawford v.

Some time after his death, she applied to the orphans’ court for leave to sell the land as his, and for the payment of his debts. Leave was granted and the sale made, and approved by the orphans’ court. Now she claims to be entitled to the fund she has raised for her husband’s creditors, by virtue of a resulting trust in her favor growing out of the payment of the purchase money by her. The auditor held that upon the whole case the facts alleged as the basis for the resulting trust were not proved by evidence that was clear, explicit, and satisfactory, and he found against the existence. The orphans’ court has upon full hearing approved and adopted the findings of the auditor, and denied her right to the fund under the alleged trust.
