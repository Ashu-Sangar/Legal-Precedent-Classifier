There was a return of nihil habet, and on Au-' gust 20, 1892, judgment was entered for want of an appearance against the defendant for $16,604.35. On September 22,1892, however, a petition was presented to open the judgment and allow an appearance to be entered, for the reason that when the judgment was taken there was no affidavit nor evidence before the court to overcome the presumption of payment. A rule was granted, and, after testimony taken, the judgment was opened.

    <p id="b115-6" data-blocks='[["BL_115.9",115,[153,1022,1165,501]]]'>The several assignments of error in this case really raise but one question, and that is the sufficiency of the evidence to justify its submission to the jury. The plaintiff’s judgment was more than twenty years old. The defendant relied on the presumption of payment growing out of the lapse of time. The plaintiff attempted to rebut this presumption by the declarations of the defendant tending to show that it was not paid. This evidence was pertinent. Its persuasive value was for tho jury to determine. We see no error in its admission or in the manner of its submission, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
