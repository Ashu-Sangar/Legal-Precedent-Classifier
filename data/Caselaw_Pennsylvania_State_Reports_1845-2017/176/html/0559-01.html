In order that this proposed street might reach the point aimed at, it became necessary for the citizens to supplement the right thus given by the Chambers &amp; McKee Company by purchasing a thirty-foot lot from one Peter Gordon. This was done, and the title thereto was afterwards made to the borough of Jeannette. The two acquisitions together constitute what is called “Clay Avenue Extension.” Chambers &amp; McKee graded the street. It crossed the switches of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company at grade. Crossing plant were put in and Clay avenue extension has been continuously used ever since as a public street. It, in fact, is the only thoroughfare through which public travel coining up the valley from Penn and points west of Jeannette reach the town last named.</p>

An ordinance was passed by the council of Jeannette and signed by the burgess on the 18th of July, 1890, purporting to mate Clay avenue extension one of the public streets of the borough. It was opened up to public travel probably in the fall of that same year. The borough has maintained it at public expense continuously since its opening. The public user of it has been obvious and notorious and without the let or hindrance of any one. Both sidings of the complainant company were there and in use prior to the opening of Clay avenue extension, and, although not distinctly appearing from the evidence, it is nevertheless fairly inferable from the testimony of one of complainant’s witnesses that the crossings were put in by the railroad company. It does not appear that there were ever .any viewers appointed to assess damages; it does not appear whether any damages were ever claimed by the railroad company or whether it ever released damages for the crossing of its switches by Clay avenue extension. It does not appear whether or not the railroad company had any notice of the proposed adoption of the ordinance of July 18, 1890.

The glass company has the right to terminate the right and privilege given to the railroad company at any time by giving it ninety days’ notice of its intention so to do, and the railroad company is then forthwith to remove its property from the property of the glass company.

The reasons and authorities which we think compel that conclusion of law, from the foregoing facts, are as follows: In order that a ' way may become a public street it must have been dedicated to public use. But this can as effectually be brought about by a common law dedication as by the procedure under our statutes. Both forms are valid and they may supplement each other. Dedications of lands to public uses are divisible according to the authorities into two classes: (1) Statutory dedications; (2) common law dedications. . Statutory dedications are made, and only can be made, in strict compliance with the statute, and this compliance will dispense with the necessity of any assent or acceptance on the part of the public. Such a dedication vests an estate in the public by conveyance or grant. In common law dedication there is no express grant to a grantee upon consideration, but it operates by way of an estoppel in pais of the owner rather than by a transfer of an interest in the land. But the application of the doctrine of estoppel in pais to the principle of dedication has been severely criticised. It does not follow, however, that an acceptance by the public will not cure an incomplete statutory dedication, or that rights acquired under it by third persons will be impaired. In such cases it may operate as a common law dedication: 5 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, pages 896 and 39T.</p>

It is also true that it then and now claims to be owner in fee of that portion covered by the east siding. If the right of the railroad company is dependent on its being the owner in fee of the portion covered by the east siding it must establish that fact at law, or át least by proof in tins case. This has not been done, and we therefore <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>act on the assumption that at the time of the attempted dedication of the land by the Chambers &amp; McKee Glass Company, that company was the owner in fee, and had the right to so dedicate it. Assuming this right to be in the Chambers &amp; McKee Company, and for the present assuming that the railroad might have a right to compensation where its track is crossed by a public highway, it by no means follows that there is no highway by virtue of that dedication and the subsequent user by the public, because it has not been shown in this collateral proceeding that compensation was actually paid to the railroad company. If concurrence in the dedication made by a tenant, who had no right to make it, is to be presumed against the landlord (who alone had the right to dedicate), because “ of the notorious and uninterrupted use of the way by the public,” we certainly can assume the acquiescence of the railroad company in this case. This street has been notoriously and uninterruptedly used by the public for five or six years. Causeways, constituting part of the roadway, have been put in and maintained, across these sidings, presumably by the railroad company itself, and it has recognized the existence of the street in the very instrument which defines its own right to maintain the west siding.</p>

It is presumably for such a mode of use, with others, that the public expenditure has been made. Therefore if the railroad is estopped, as against the public, to deny its use of Clay avenue extension as a highway, it is of necessity estopped as against the proposed use of it by the street railway company. But the principle might go further, for “ the conduct and dealings of a man with others than the party with whom the contest exists may constitute a case of acquiescence, so as to preclude him from coming to the court for relief against a state of things to which his own conduct has led: ” Kerr on Injunctions, 19.</p>

Counsel for complainant contended that the proceeding is therefore fatally defective, and as to it totally void. To sustain this proposition they cite — (1) In re Palmer Twp., 11 W.

In this ease there was a report of viewers of damages for a road. The report did not show that there had been notice of the view given. After it was confirmed, and before the entire road was opened, the railroad company presented its petition, alleging want of notice and praying that the decree be opened and petitioner be given a hearing. The lower court refused the petition and the Supreme Court reversed it. This proceeding was under the road law.

This was a proceeding under the general borough law. The record of the proceeding to assess damages and benefits for the opening of a borough street did not show personal notice to the property owners of the passage of the ordinance laying out the street, or of the view, or that said ordinance had been published. There were also other questions in the case. On exceptions filed before final confirmation, wherein, among other things, the want of notice was alleged, the court set aside and quashed the report. This was affirmed, without opinion, by the Supreme Court.

The first case is not a proceeding under the acts relating to boroughs at all. In the second case there was a proceeding to assess damages under the act of 1856, and the alleged deficiency was in what was shown or not shown in the petition for the appointment of viewers and in their report. Assume for the present that no viewers are needed in this case, is it essential to the validity of the ordinance that it show that notice was given before council passed and the burgess signed it ? The case cited does not say so. What is the presumption of law, there being no proof on the matter ?

If there are no damages to assess it would seem to be a vain thing for the court of quarter sessions to appoint viewers The very case that is cited to sustain the affirmative of the proposition says: “ If the owner of private property on the line of the street, either for a consideration agreed upon, or without compensation, consent that the street be opened as laid out and ordained, the corporate authorities may at once proceed to open, and thereupon the street shall become a lawful public highway; otherwise, however, the corporation is obliged to resort to the courts for an assessment of damages according to law: ” Parkesburg Boro., <a href="/citations/?q=124%20Pa.%20523" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="124 Pa. 523">124 Pa. 523</a>.</p>

Therefore the appointment of viewers is only essential where consent is lacking. If the borough had attempted to open with-, out tbe consent of a person entitled to damage, the court would, on application, restrain the opening, for it is provided that they shall not be opened for public use until the damages shall be liquidated. The act, paragraph 3, section 27, also provides a hearing for any one aggrieved by the laying out and opening of a street. (See Purd. Dig. 253.) Has there been any complaint made since the laying out or opening of this street five or six years ago ? Has any injunction been asked for prior to the opening? We have already held that the opening was made with the acquiescence of the complainant, and that the knowledge of its open and notorious use and control by the municipal officers was possessed by it as well as by the public at large.</p>

At the granting of the injunction, on an ex parte application, the court assumed that the special equity set up in the affidavits read was also’ set up in the bill. An inspection of the bill since discloses the fact that the bill on which the application was made was one on winch a preliminary injunction had hitherto been granted by this court and after hearing (Hon.

Such practice, we think, could be fully sustained by the citation of cases if the necessities of this case required it.

If Clay avenue extension is referred to in this averment of the bill, it is in the bill alleged that the property of the complainant is “subject to the public easement,” the very thing which the affidavits deny, and which is therein set up as the reason why the proposed occupation of the street by the defendant company would be illegal. We think an inspection of the bill will clearly show that the special grievance here complained of is not there set up. The case we have here is one that finds its basis alone in the affidavits. These are not a substitute for a bill. No injunction can stand without a bill for its basis. If complainant had desired to do so it could have amended or supplied the bill filed so as to bring into the case the special facts here pressed on the attention of the court.

    <p class="author" id="AmM" data-blocks='[["BL_593.7",593,[408,761,459,39]]]'>Mr. Justice Mitchell,</p>
    <p id="b593-5" data-blocks='[["BL_593.8",593,[124,811,1162,194]]]'>These cases depending upon substantially the same facts and the same principles of law and having been argued together, may be treated practically as one case for the purposes of this opinion.</p>
    <p id="b593-6" data-blocks='[["BL_593.9",593,[119,1015,1167,661]]]'>The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, complainant and appellant, has failed to make out title to the bridge in question over its right of way. Though constructed and paid for by it the contract with the borough of Greensburg shows that it was so constructed as a part of the public highway, Pennsylvania avenue, and to be maintained as such by the borough. The only open point in the contract was the alternative to the borough that it should in consideration of such erection cause the grade crossing over the railroad at Plarrison avenue to be vacated, or failing to do so, should pay the railroad the cost of the bridge. To which alternative the borough is liable does not concern this litigation. In either case the bridge became part of Pennsylvania avenue and the title is in the borough.</p>
    <p id="b593-7" data-blocks='[["BL_593.10",593,[116,1682,1167,351]]]'>The next question is whether Clay avenue extension is a public highway, in such sense as to permit the defendants, in the absence of any right of eminent domain, to cross the sidings of appellant thereon. This is a question mainly of fact, and has been so fully examined by the learned judge below that nothing more heed be said than that we see no reason to question the correctness of the conclusion reached by him.</p>
    <p id="b593-8" data-blocks='[["BL_593.11",593,[115,2041,1165,247]]]'>There remain the two really important questions in the case, first, whether the defendant companies have any right to construct or operate railways along the routes or portions of routes in controversy, and secondly whether the appellant is in position to raise the question of such right.</p>
    <p id="b593-9" data-blocks='[["BL_593.12",593,[115,2296,1163,93]],["BL_594.1",594,[269,358,1168,1974]]]'>It is strenuously contended on the part of appellant that the act of May 14,1889, P. L. 211, under which the defendants were <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>chartered, gives no authority for the building of a passenger railway through boroughs, or over township or country roads, and especially through private property, but only upon streets, properly and strictly so called. Much reliance is placed upon Penna. R. R. Co. v. Montgomery Co. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/167/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="167 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="866789" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0062-01">167 Pa. 62</a>, to sustain this contention. But no such point was involved nor any such decision made in that case. On the contrary, while that proposition if sustained would at once and finally have disposed of the claims of the defendant passenger railway company to its asserted franchise, the decision was pointedly rested upon other grounds. The same may be said of the group of cases decided at the same time, Lehigh Nav. Co. v. Inter County Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/167/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="167 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="866862" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0075-01">167 Pa. 75</a>; Rahn Township v. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/167/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="167 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="866840" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0084-01">167 Pa. 84</a>, and Tamaqua Street Ry. Co. v. Inter County Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/167/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="167 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="866792" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0091-01">167 Pa. 91</a>; and of Homestead Street Ry. Co. v. Electric Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/166/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="166 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="864170" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0162-01">166 Pa. 162</a>, and some other eases not necessary to refer to in detail. What Penna. R. R. Co. v. Montgomery Co. Ry. Co. really decides and is authority for is first that the laying of railway tracks on a suburban road is an additional servitude which cannot be imposed upon the owner of the fee against his will by the mere consent of the township authorities ; and secondly that the franchise of a street railway passing through several localities is an entirety, and the necessary local or municipal consent for the whole route must be obtained, before it has a right to build any part. In the opinion in that case, and again in Rahn Township v. Ry. Co., supra, our Brother Williams reviewed the legislation-on street passenger railways, and gave some timely warnings to investors and to the other departments of the government as to the dangers of the investment of capital in lines not within the express authorization of the act of 1889, and the necessity of further legislation on the subject, in view of the numerous and extended enterprises of the kind in operation or in progress. But the decisions were rested on the propositions above set forth. While no case has yet called for an exact definition of the words “ street or highway ” in the act of 1889, or of the limitations in that respect on railways incorporated under that act, it is manifest that the narrow interpretation contended for by appellant cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b594-4" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[274,2350,1155,96]],["BL_595.1",595,[133,336,1167,1065]]]'>It is not necessary to go further in this case, as upon the next question we are of opinion that the appellant is not in <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>position to dispute appellee’s rights. The charter covers the route upon which the road is built, and the learned judge below has found that the appellee has the consent of the local authorities, of all the owners of property along the roads occupied and of those through whose property its line passes. To entitle appellant to question the prima facie right thus appearing it must show some interest in, or damage to itself, different from that of the general public. It has failed to do so. It is not the owner of the bridge, and the crossing over its right of way is upon a public highway, to all the rightful uses of which its property is subject. The bridge is part of the highway, and the consent of the borough authorities for the laying of the rails must be as effective on it as on any other part, or the borough would hold its municipal power to consent only in subordination to the will of every railroad which the highway happened to cross. The 18th section of the act of 1889 gives in express terms the right to cross railroads at grade, and a fortiori to cross overhead. In respect to a mere crossing, a railroad is not an abutting landholder to the passenger railway, as the plaintiff was in Penna. R. R. Co. v. Montgomery Co. Ry. Co., supra.</p>
    <p id="b595-3" data-blocks='[["BL_595.4",595,[127,1410,1173,964]]]'>As to the objections to the appellee’s route at other points, including the right to occupy township roads, and to buy or secure with the owner’s consent a way through private property, the appellant’s rights are no different in kind whatever they may be in degree from those of the general public. In regard to the latter objection, it is conceded, as was said in Rahn Township v. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/167/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="167 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="866840" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0084-01">167 Pa. 84</a>, 90, that passenger railways under the act of 1889 “may diverge for a short distance where the conformation of the surface or the positions of streams make it necessary in order to avoid discomfort or danger to the traveling public,” and it may be added to avoid grade crossings, or for any other reason amounting to necessity, or what is the same thing in such matters, great public convenience. The occasion'for such divergence and its extent are questions of location, and the decision of them primarily is within the discretion of the railway company. If the variance from the charter route is greater than is necessary, or the charter route itself is open to objection, the commonwealth alone can be heard to make it in the interest of the general public.</p>
    <p id="b596-3" data-blocks='[["BL_596.3",596,[268,349,1165,903]]]'>
      <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>The act of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1361, affords appellant no standing. No rights of appellant are violated or infringed upon. It is not prevented or interfered with in doing any act that its charter permits. That its interests are affected by a diminution of its passenger traffic is a different thing. It has no monopoly of that traffic, which it holds only by force of superior facilities and convenience to the public, and like any other business, it must take the chances of rivalry and change of methods and customs of travel. The act of 1871 applies to direct interference with rights, not consequential injury to interests, and the inquiry under it is limited in suits by private parties to the question of the charter right to do the act complained of. West. Pa. R. R.’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/104/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="104 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="452211" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0399-01">104 Pa. 399</a>. In Germantown Pass. Ry. Co. v. Citizens’ Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/151/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="151 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="836709" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0138-01">151 Pa. 138</a>, cited by appellant, the complainant had a track on German-town avenue, and its claim to relief was based on the fact that another track on the same street would interfere with its operations.</p>
    <p id="b596-4" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[268,1270,1169,850]]]'>The appellant did establish one point in which its rights were different from those of the public. The special danger to it and its passengers arising from the use of the bridge for a purpose for which it was not originally built gave appellant a standing to object to such use. It has a clear right to be protected from that danger. When this case was before some of the justices of this court at chambers on motion for special supersedeas, it was said in denying the motion, that the language of the decree below was not as precise as was desirable, and while it did not probably mean to leave the proper strengthening of the bridge to the uncontrolled discretion of the appellee, it was open to that construction. It was accordingly recommended to the court to amend it so as to leave no doubt that the court’s approval should be obtained before cars were actually run. So far as appears this suggestion was not noticed or acted on in any way, and what was then recommended we must now direct.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[272,2139,1164,245]]]'>Appeals dismissed, with costs, but the court below is directed to reinstate the injunction unless within sixty days it shall be made to appear, affirmatively, to the satisfaction of the court, that the bridge has been made safe for continued use by the cars of the respondents.</p>
