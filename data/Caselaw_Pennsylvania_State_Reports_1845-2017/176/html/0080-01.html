The act does not pretend to limit the borrowing capacity of municipalities to two per centum, and, therefore, is not in direct conflict with article 9, section 8, of the constitution, which fixes the limit at seven per centum. It simply means, therefore, in our opinion, that a municipality can only increase its indebtedness at any one time, at any one election, to an amount not over two per centum, by a vote of the people.

This would be a violent presumption; for statutes cannot be construed in that way. On the contrary, in our opinion, the presumption would be that the legislature purposely intended to leave the matter out; and, perhaps, they did so wisely, having in view the purpose of checking municipal extravagance and expenditures, which have grown to enormous limits.</p>
