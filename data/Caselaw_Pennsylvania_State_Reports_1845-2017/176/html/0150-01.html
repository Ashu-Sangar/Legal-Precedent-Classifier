Hopkins (the life tenant), which was entered in the common pleas of Lancaster county. The judgment became a lien on about 1000 acres of land on which there were already tMee judgments, one to Lightner, himself,' as guardian, and aggregating $9,400. The first and third judgments were held by Jacob Thome, a brother-in-law of Hopkins, said Hopkins being also a brother-in-law of Lightner, the trustee. The widow, the adult children and two minor children joined in the petition to the orphans’ court, asking permission <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>to make the investment. The third minor, the youngest of all, did not join. There was no evidence that the minors after arriving at age ever assented to or dissented from the loan, although they lived with their father on the premises and were conversant with the facts of the case. The trustee held this trust for nineteen years, during which time the judgments ahead of the trust judgment were regularly revived, and greatly increased in amount by accumulations of interest. The lands, which had been chiefly valuable because of furnace property, subsequently depreciated in value until after the death of the trustee, when his administrator issued execution upon the judgment; the liens ahead of it at that time aggregating about $35,000. The property was not worth more than $25,000 and the land was bought in by the holder of the first judgment for $8,000. The whole of the trust fund was, therefore, lost for the wife and children of Mr. Hopkins. The successor of Newton Lightner, the trustee, sought to charge his estate with the loss by reason of negligence and lack of authority to make the investment; on. the grounds, first, they were not invested by order of the orphans’ court; second, if so invested the order was improvidently made; third, that if invested by order of the orphans’ court it was at a time when property was of much greater value and the prior liens much less, and that the trustee was guilty of negligence in not collecting the judgment, through which neglect the trust estate has been put to a loss for which the individual estate of the deceased trustee is liable. As to the first point, the auditor found that the moneys were invested under the order of the orphans’ court. As to the second point he found specifically as follows:</p>

This is especially true in a case like the present, where the evidence as to the material points is very meager and leaves so much to be desired in enabling one to form a fair judgment. The peril into which this trust fund fell grew out of two facts, viz: The failure of Mr. Hopkins to keep down interest on the prior liens, and the depreciation of the lands.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[156,711,1172,1068]]]'>As to the interest there is no competent evidence before the auditor that Mr. Lightner had any information on this subject other than what he must be presumed to have gained from observing the accumulation of these liens at their successive revivals. So far as this record shows, Hopkins paid him the interest promptly on the prior lien which he himself held up to 1885, four years before his death. On Mr. Thome’s judgment for $5,200, the first revival in 1874 includes no interest. The revival in 1879 does include interest; so this would seem to be the first notice to Mr. Lightner on that judgment. On Mr. Thome’s judgment for $10,000, the first revival in 1874 contained notice that the interest was not being paid, and that in 1879 includes interest from 1871. In 1879, therefore, Mr. Lightner must have known that Mr. Hopkins was not keeping up the interest on these liens, and that they had increased by from $6,000 to $8,000. What special duty, if any, this knowledge laid upon Mr. Lightner depends largely upon the then value of the lands, and upon what Lightner knew, or was bound to know, of their depreciation if there had at that time been any. This is true, not only at that particular time, but as to knowledge of this character which he obtained at any time.</p>

We are practically left only with the assessment books as our guide.</p>

Whatever they were worth, it seems to be conceded that their value was considerably more at that time than the whole debt, which, including the trust judgment, was about $80,000.</p>

They were sold for $8,000, but owing to the peculiar circumstances of the situation, this can manifestly not be regarded as their actual value. But the testimony of the witnesses produced by the exceptant, ranging in estimates from $22,000 to $32,000, shows that in 1893, four years after the death of Mr. Lightner, the lands had much depreciated from their value in 1870, and that the margin of security for the trust judgment had then been wiped out. This testimony, however, gives us little or no aid in fixing their value at the time of Mr. Lightner’s death nor at any period during the trust; the witnesses testify in a general way that there was a gradual depreciation in farm lands in Mr. Hopkins’ neighborhood for about ten years prior to 1893, or about five years prior to Mr. Lightner’s death, and that these lands had thus depreciated; but there is no evidence showing the extent to which this depreciation had gone at any particular period or at the trustee’s death.</p>

This was an increase in the valuation of the lands of more than the growth of the prior liens, and would have indicated that notwithstanding the accumulation of interest on these, the trust judgment had still as large a margin of security as when entered.</p>

This had been done by applying the proceeds of a sale by Mr. Hopkins of one hundred and thirty-five acres, in the year 1883, at $50.00 per <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>acre. The Thome judgments had thus been brought down several thousand dollars lower than they stood at the former revival in 1879, while the assessment of the lands, even after the sale, continued at $27,665 until 1885, when it was reduced to $25,065. And while it is true that these reductions were made entirely by proceeds of land sold, the fact of a sale of such a tract of land without buildings at $50.00 per acre, and another smaller sale at the same price in 1885, would naturally be calculated to establish Mr. Lightner’s confidence, by seemingly fixing such a value for what remained as would still leave a margin for the trust moneys.</p>

The assessment at this time was $24,865, or about $15,000 less than the total debt, including the trust moneys. But in 1870, when the order of court was made, the assessment had been $12,000 less than the lien debts. And, therefore, judging alone from the valuations of the assessors, the depreciation in the margin of the security of the trust judgment would have seemed only about $3,000, notwithstanding the great increase in the prior liens.

It would have been proper, and in fact his duty, to examine and consider, among other things, the assessments in judging of the value of the lands, and we have already seen that, in so far as he may have relied upon these, they would have shown very little depreciation in his margin, even in the face of the earlier liens. There is indirectly some affirmative evidence that he was vigilant and inquiring on this subject furnished by the letters of W. W. Hopldns, one of the heirs interested in the trust. These letters, moreover, show that if Mr. Lightner still considered the trust secure he was not alone; for Mr. Hopkins, with the highest personal concern in the subject, himself a man of large experience, and presumably having heard these lands much discussed as private secretary to Mr. Thome, the holder of the earlier liens, as late as 1888 values these lands to Mr. Lightner at $55,000.</p>

It was invested in the lands of the person who had the life interest, and the only persons interested in the remainder were his own wife and children. The trustee was the brother-in-law and uncle, and naturally would be reluctant to sell away from the family their homestead unless the wisdom and necessity of doing so were very apparent, especially in view of the fact that he would be doing it to save a fund in which they had exactly the same interest as they had in the land itself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.6",177,[148,1215,1168,248]]]'>The family estate in winch the court had ordered the money was a very large tract of land, too large to be saleable to good advantage as a whole.

    <p class="summary" id="b177-6" data-blocks='[["BL_177.7",177,[148,1471,1166,387]]]'>Manifestly it was to the interest of this whole family that, so long as the investment was not absolutely in peril, this large body of land should not be pushed to a forced sale. Such a sale, unless the trustee stood ready to protect the lands by purchase, would in all probability simply have resulted, as it actually did when it was finally made, in transferring the title to a stranger, and thus end disastrously for all parties in interest.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b177-7" data-blocks='[["BL_177.8",177,[146,1876,1181,503]]]'>There is no evidence that they could ever, after the depreciation set in, have been sold as a whole, for enough to cover the liens, to any one but Mr. Thome or the trustee himself; and the inherent probabilities are against any such view. It is a • plain business proposition that the only practicable way of getting the full value of the lands, which was all the more important if the margin was doubtful, was to sell in smaller tracts. This the evidence shows Mr. Plopkins and his family were trying their best to do during the later years of the trust, with the knowledge, and presumably with the counsel, of Mr. Lightner.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b178-3" data-blocks='[["BL_178.3",178,[265,345,1163,539]]]'>
      <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>It must also be remembered that Mr. Lightner was a trustee for Mr. Hopkins as well as for his children. Presumably so long as the investment was safe beyond question these moneys were worth more to Mr. Hopkins and his family in their own lands than elsewhere. And when it became doubtful, if it did, Mr. Lightner may have properly considered that, with Mr. Hopkins and his family trying to sell the lands privately and meanwhile enjoying the whole income thereof, their interests all around were being better served than by forcing them to sale, unless it was clear that enough could be realized to pay the liens.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b178-4" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[264,903,1162,144]]]'>The situation was, moreover, further complicated by the great disadvantage at which the trustee would be in any forced sale, by reason of the large prior liens.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[261,1056,1163,803]]]'>He could only have purchased the lands by raising this large sum of money, which is practically equivalent to saying that he could not purchase at all; and that in consequence the lands would go to forced sale without protection, and almost inevitably fall into the hands of Mr. Thome. He was under no legal obligation to use his own funds to do this, if he had sufficient funds, and there is no evidence that the parties in interest ever offered him the funds to protect the lands. This practical disadvantage, it is true, was one of the necessary incidents of an investment made on a lien subsequent to such other large judgments. But it must be presumed to have been considered by the court when it made the order, and is, therefore, within the scope of its protection. But while it is an element of danger for whose existence the trustee is not to be held liable, he was nevertheless bound to recognize it as a fact in deciding upon what would be prudent and proper for him to do.</p>

It would also be easy to suppose that he probably knew that there was some depreciation going on in the real estate during the last few years of his life. But considering all the circumstances of the case, and the difficulties of his position, we think it would not be safe to affirm that it was so clearly the proper thing for him to force these lands upon the market at sheriff’s sale as to have made it gross negligence for him not to have done so. We think, on the contrary, that <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>it is doubtful whether such a course would have resulted in any good for the parties in interest; and, as the sequel has shown, would probably only have resulted in ruin and disaster both for Mr. Hopkins and his children, and in passing the title to Mr. Thome. As it was, Mr. Hopkins and such of his family who have lived with him have at least all these years continued to enjoy their home and the entire income of the lands.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b179-4" data-blocks='[["BL_179.4",179,[160,705,1163,351]]]'>The fact that these moneys were invested not in the land of strangers to the trust, but in family lands, in which the owners of the trust fund had, as the matter stood, the same interest as they had in the trust itself, is a circumstance which we cannot overlook. While this would not excuse Mr. Lightner from performing his duties as trustee, it would be a proper element for him to consider in judging of his duty.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[157,1064,1166,910]]]'>The same may also be said of the joinder of those who were of age in making the original investment, and the constant subsequent approbation of the entire family in its continuance, and in the conduct of the trustee with reference to it. Although they were all of age for the last fourteen years of Mr. Lightner’s life, and, so far as the testimony shows, in family relations with their father, and at least in as good position as the trustee to know his property, not one of them ever expressed a doubt to Mr. Lightner, nor a desire that he should force the land to sale. It would, of course, be easy to give too much weight to this fact, as Mr. Lightner was the person on whom the final responsibility for action rested, and not they. But it may at least be accepted and considered as some evidence going to show that they did not, while Mr. Lightner lived, look upon his management as grossly negligent. And, if so, it should now, in an effort in their behalf to hold his estate liable on this ground, after he is dead and unable to speak for himself, be given in a court of equity its proper weight.</p>

Hopkins upon the security of a large body of land owned by him subject to several liens already existing. This loan was made with the approval and under the order of the orphans’ court, and with the consent and approval of such of the remainder-men as were then sui juris. Hopkins and his family lived on the land, and it was regarded as ample security for all the liens against it. For nineteen years, until the death of Lightner, Hopkins was unable to pay him, or to pay the annual interest accruing on the previous liens; and at the end of this time the interest had accumulated to such an extent that the previous liens amounted with interest to more than could be obtained for the land or collected from Hopkins in any other manner. The descendants of Hopkins are now seeking to surcharge the estate of the trustee with the amount of the loan made by him to their ancestor, the life tenant. The ground on which this is urged is that it was negligence in the trustee to deal so generously with their ancestor, and not to have compelled him to do what it seems very clear he was unable to do, viz: to pay the interest annually on the hens that were prior to his own.</p>
