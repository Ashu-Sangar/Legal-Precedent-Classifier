        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThe verdict in this case was in such flagrant disregard not only of the evidence but of the law even as laid down by the trial judge, that it is difficult to see how the court below allowed it to stand.\nIn his application for insurance the deceased to the question \u201cHave you always been temperate?\u201d answered \u201cYes.\u201d The incontrovertible proof was that he had been very frequently drunk, and at least six times in the preceding five years, had required the services of a physician from that cause. He died in four months after the policy was taken out, and by plaintiff\u2019s own showing in the proofs of death, the remote cause of death was intemperance, and the immediate cause delirium tremens.\nThe defendant\u2019s second point was : \u201c The insured having in his application in answer to question 23 \u2018 Plow long since you have consulted any physician ? For what disease ? Give name and residence ? \u2019 answered \u2018 About one year, for light influenza, Dr. Jas. W. Keiser, Beading, Pa.,\u2019 and the plaintiff having, in the proof of death by the affidavit of Dr. Jas. W. Keiser, shown that during the five years preceding applicant\u2019s death, he attended said applicant for \u2018 vomiting and nausea, the effects of overdrinking, the duration being from 12 to 36 hours,\u2019 and it being the uncontradicted evidence of said .James W. Keiser that he had attended the said applicant within four months prior to the application and prescribed for vomiting and nausea induced by drunkenness, there can be no recovery in this case and the verdict must be for the defendant,\u201d and the facts being substantially undisputed, the learned judge reserved the point, but subsequently entered judgment on the verdict. Without going into the other matters assigned for error, the facts admitted in this point show snch a breach of a material warranty as to require the court to pronounce upon it as matter of law.\nJudgment reversed, and judgment directed to be entered for the defendant on the points reserved.",

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, Appellant.\nInsurance \u2014 \u25a0 Warranty \u2014 Materiality thereof.\nIn an application for life insurance the insured stated that he had always been temperate; that he had consulted a physician within about a year for light influenza. Pie died four months after the policy was issued, and his administrator, in the proofs of death, showed by the affidavit of the same physician that, during five years preceding the applicant\u2019s death, he had attended him for vomiting and nausea caused by overdrinking; and it was the uncontradicted evidence of the said physician that he had attended the applicant within four months prior to the application and prescribed for vomiting aud nausea induced by drunkenness.

Aid So. v. O\u2019Hara, 120 Pa. 266; Brady v. Ins. Co., 60 Fed. Rep. 727.\nThe court should withdraw the case from the jury when the undisputed evidence is so conclusive that the court will be compelled to set aside a verdict returned in opposition to it: D.
