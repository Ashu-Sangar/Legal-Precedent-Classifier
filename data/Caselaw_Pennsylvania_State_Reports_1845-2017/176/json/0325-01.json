    "head_matter": "Estate of Charles Bryant, deceased. Appeal of Daniel Bryant et al.\nArgued March 30, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 36, Jan. T., 1896, by Daniel Bryant, Richard Staples, Charles Staples and Mary Staples, from decree of O. C., Phila. Co., July T., 1894, No. 182, distributing the estate of Charles Bryant, deceased.\nBefore \u2022Stekrett, C. J. McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Pell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nDecree of court below affirmed on findings of fact of the \u2022auditing judge.\n. These appellants are known as the Illinois claimants.\nThe findings of the auditing judge, Ashman, J., is as follows:\nThe parties from Illinois deduced title from their brother and uncle, Charles Bryant, who was born at North Bridgewater, Massachusetts, but who was taken by his parents in his infancy to the west. The date of his birth, as ascertained by the public records of the town, was November 10, 1831. In some way, during the progress of the journey westward, which was performed in wagons, the child disappeared, and his history thenceforth was a blank although his parents survived until 1868. In this instance, even the slight clue which was furnished by the daguerreotype was wanting \u2014 the child of two or three years being hardly discernible in the man of thirty-five. The claimants rested their case upon what they term record evidence\u2014 the town register and, the United States certificate. It was unfortunate for them that these papers were mutually destructive of the theory of identity, because the person described in the certificate must have been at least eight years, older than the person named in the register. The claim is dismissed.\nThe other facts sufficiently appear in Bryant\u2019s Est., ante, p. 309.\nHrrors assigned, among others, were dismissing claim of the appellants and awarding balance of the distribution to the English claimants.\nJ. Howard G-endell, for appellants.\nThe findings of the auditing judge are but deductions from facts found by Mm and the effect of writings, and have no more weight with this court than his decisions on questions of pure law: Phillips\u2019 App., 68 Pa. 130; Hindman\u2019s App., 85 Pa. 470; Moyer\u2019s App., 77 Pa. 482; Cake\u2019s App., 110 Pa. 65; Kittel\u2019s Estate, 156 Pa. 445; Sproull\u2019s App., 71 Pa. 137; Kutz\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 75; Milligan\u2019s App., 97 Pa. 525; Sweatman\u2019s App., 150 Pa. 369: Fessenden\u2019s Estate, 170 Pa. 641.\nJuly 15, 1896:\nWilliam W. Ker, for appellee."
