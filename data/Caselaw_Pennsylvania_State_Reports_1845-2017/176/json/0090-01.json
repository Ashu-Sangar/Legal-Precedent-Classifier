        "text": "Per Curiam,\nAbraham Bitner was the owner of two pieces of land at and for some time before his assignment. Several dwelling houses and a greenhouse were erected on one of them, and the other seems to have been unoccupied. Hostetter had a judgment against Bitner which was the first lien on both lots. Then followed four other judgments which were liens on both lots. Bitner undertook to erect several new greenhouses on the second lot, and at about the time he began operations he procured from the four judgment creditors whose liens were subsequent to that of Hostetter a release of that lot from the lien of their judgments. Mechanics\u2019 liens were afterwards entered against the new greenhouses and the lot on which they were erected. Bitner assigned both lots for tire benefit of his creditors and they have been sold by his assignee.\nThe question now raised is whether the mechanic\u2019s lien creditors have an equitable interest in the proceeds of the new greenhouse lot superior to that of the four judgment, creditors who have released the lien of their judgments from it. The learned judge of the court below held that theirs was the superior equity. We think this was right. If the mechanics\u2019 liens were not in their way the junior judgments might require Hostetler to resort to his lien upon the new greenhouse lot in aid of their judgments; but the mechanics\u2019 liens are in the way. They have the superior equity.\nThe judgment is therefore affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Assigned Estate of Abraham Bitner and Wife. Appeal of Robert J. Houston.\nEquity \u2014 Marshaling assets \u2014 Judgments\u2014Mechanics' liens.\nFive judgments were liens upon two lots of land owned by the same person. The owners of the four junior judgments released one of the lots from the lien of their judgment. The owner erected upon the lot thus released certain buildings against which mechanics\u2019 liens were filed. Both lots were subsequently sold by an assignee for the benefit of creditors. Held, (1) that in the distribution of the proceeds the mechanic\u2019s lien creditors had an equitable interest in the proceeds of the lot released superior to that of the four judgment creditors who had released the lien of their judgments from it; (2) that the existence of the mechanics\u2019 liens prevented the junior creditors from requiring the senior judgment creditor to resort to his lien upon the lot released in aid of the judgments of the junior creditors.\nArgued. May 20, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 264, Jan. T., 1896, by Robert J. Houston, assignee, from order of C. P. Lancaster Co., Trust Book 14, page 222, confirming report of auditor.\nBefore Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to report of auditor.\nThe facts appear by the supplemental report'of M. Franklin Hall, Esq., the auditor, which was as follows :\nThe only question to be considered in this report is as to the distribution of the fund by the assignee in his account which was derived by the sale of the \u201c New Greenhouse Tract \u201d and the \u201c Eastern Tract,\u201d as they are designated in paragraph 8 of the original report.\nOn these two tracts of land the following judgments against Abraham Bitner were liens, to wit:\nD. B. Hostetter\u2019s executors, entered July 30, 1883 $3,469.31\nJohn D. Skiles, entered July 30, 1883 . . . 2,092.45\nC. A. Bitner\u2019s admins., entered July 30, 1883 . 3,324.48\nRobert J. Houston, entered Dec. 12, 1891 . . 5,800.00\nL. C. Eaby, entered Dec. 14, 1891 . . . 1,743.75\nRobert J. Houston, entered Nov. 3, 1892 . . . 5,600.00\nAnd these judgments were regularly revived from time to time.\nOn the 2d day of July, 1892, John D. Skiles, Chas. A. Bitner\u2019s administrator, Robert J. Houston, as to judgment entered December 12, 1891, and L. C. Eaby, four of the holders of the above judgments, by agreement in writing with Abraham Bitner, released from the lien effect and operation of their judgments the \u201cNew Greenhouse Tract.\u201d D. B. Hostetter\u2019s executors refused to release said tract from the lien of their above described judgment.\nAfter the aforesaid agreement had been signed by the aforesaid holders of the said four judgments, Abraham Bitner commenced the erection of seven new greenhouses on the above tract of land so released, and afterwards mechanics\u2019 liens as hereinafter stated were filed against the said greenhouses. . . .\nThe net proceeds of the \u201c Eastern Tract,\u201d according to paragraph 13 of the original report, were $8,822.17, and of the \u201c New Greenhouse Tract,\u201d according to paragraph 5 of the original report, were $2,385.\nThe assignee in his account distributed all of the proceeds of this assigned estate except a balance of $400 which is personal property. He appropriated the whole of the fund realized from the \u201cNew Greenhouse Tract\u201d to paying the Hostetter judgment, and the mechanics\u2019 liens received nothing. The balance of the fund realized from the \u201c Eastern Tract\u201d after the Hostetter judgment was paid in full was appropriated to pay the judgments of Skiles, Bitner\u2019s administrators, and Robert J. Houston, as far as the fund reached.\nThis distribution your auditor affirmed in his former report for the reasons there given by him. But by opinion of the court of common pleas aforesaid filed October 7, 1895, this distribution was declared error and, therefore, in accordance with said opinion your auditor submits the following distribution:\nNet balance as shown by former report for distribution among creditors as personal fund . . $99.87\nFrom which deduct costs of audit . . . $99.87\nThe following mechanics\u2019 liens were presented and all are allowed by your auditor, together with interest from the date of filing to August 21,1893, the date of confirmation of the sale of the New Greenhouse Tract, sold under the act of February 17, 1876.\nJ. M. Eckman, claim and interest . . . $ 67.66\nPeter Zeigler...... 473.80\nWilliam Wohlsen......471.15\nLancaster Planing Mill Company . . 264.44\nTotal......$1,277.05\nThe judgment held by D. B. Hostetter\u2019s executors for $3,469.31 was a first lien on the \u201c New Greenhouse Tract \u201d and on the \u201cEastern Tract,\u201d as against other judgments. The \u201c New Greenhouse Tract \u201d was sold for $2,385, and the net proceeds of the \u201c Eastern Tract,\u201d after paying prior mortgages, was $8,822.17. In accordance with the aforesaid opinion of the court of common pleas, instead of appropriating the whole proceeds of the \u201c New Greenhouse Tract\u201d to paying the Hostetter ' judgment, the auditor apportions the Hostetter judgment out of the two funds as follows, to wit:\nOut of the \u201c Eastern Tract\u201d .... $2,731.18\nOut of the \u201cNew Greenhouse Tract\u201d . 738.13\n$3,469.31\nThus leaving a balance of the \u201cNew Greenhouse Tract\u201d of $1,646.87.\nFrom which deduct amount of the above named mechanics\u2019 liens leaves $369.82 for subsequent lien creditors, which added to the balance of the fund of the \u201c Eastern Tract \u201d left, after paying its proportionate share of the Hostetter judgment, $6,090.99, mates a total for distribution among the subsequent liens on the \u201cEastern Tract\u201d of $6,460.81.\nThis is awarded as follows:\nTo John D. Stiles\u2019 judgment . . . $2,092.45\nC. A. Bitner\u2019s administrator\u2019s judgment . 3,324.48\nRobt. J. Houston\u2019s judgment, Dec. 12, 1891 . 1,043.88\n$6,460.81\nBut as the assignee has distributed the whole estate in his account and made no provision for the payment of the foregoing mechanics\u2019 liens the auditor surcharges the said Robert J. Houston, assignee as aforesaid, in accordance with the aforesaid opinion of the court, with the sum or amount due the several mechanics\u2019 liens, to wit, $1,277.05.\nAnd distributes said surcharges as follows:\nTo J. M. Eckeman .....$ 67.66\nPeter Ziegler...... 473.80\nWilliam Wohlsen......471.15\nLancaster Planing Mill Company . . 264.44\n$1,277.05\nExceptions to the supplemental report were overruled and a decree entered awarding distribution in accordance with the report.\nError assigned was above order.\nW. E. Beyer, for Robert J. Houston, assignee, appellant.\nIt is a principle of equity that a person having two funds shall not by his choice disappoint another having only one. The latter may be permitted to stand in the place of the former: Case of Olympic Theatre, 2 Browne, 284; Ramsay\u2019s App., 2 Watts, 228; Hasting\u2019s Case, 10 Watts, 303.\nThese equities existed in favor of the judgments of Skiles and others before the mechanic\u2019s lien claimants came upon the scene; prior in tempore potior in jure: McDevitt\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 377; Trickett on Liens, sec. 804; Devor\u2019s App., 13 Pa. 413.\nMay 28, 1896:\nA lien creditor may release part of a tract without incurring any responsibility to later lien holders unless they expressly notify him not to release. The entry of their liens is not such notice: Taylor v. Maris, 5 Rawle, 51; Horning\u2019s App., 90 Pa. 388.\nIt has been held that where a judgment creditor did not revive against all the land originally bound by his judgment, junior liens could not complain: Conrad\u2019s App., 11 W. N. C. 521: McIlvaine v. Mut. Assurance Co., 93 Pa. 35.\nThe same rule applies where the judgment is entered in two counties and it is postponed in one: Quakertown B. & L. Assn. v. Sorver, 33 Leg. Int. 359; Snyder v. Crawford, 98 Pa. 421.\nIn marshaling assets we must consider the older incumbrances as the first step : Robeson\u2019s App., 117 Pa. 628.\nIt is a mistake to suppose that mechanics\u2019 liens have superior equities over other liens : Knouf\u2019s App., 91 Pa. 81; Kendig v. Landis, 135 Pa. 612; Blank\u2019s App., 6 W. N. C. 25.\nGeorge A. Lane, George Wanman, B. F. Davis and John F. Snyder with him, for mechanic\u2019s lien creditors, appellees."
