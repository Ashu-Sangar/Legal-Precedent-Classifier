        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Dean,\nDeim, defendant, leased to Adam Dosch, father of plaintiff, by written agreement dated November 13, 1891, his farm in Leacock township, Lancaster county, known as the Groff farm, for the term of one year from April 1, 1892, at a cash rent for grass of $40.00, and one half of all crops. At the date of this writing Adam Dosch lived on the Berton farm, and his son Samuel who had just been married lived with him. At the trial in the court below, the plaintiff, the son, alleged and adduced much testimony tending to show that tiffs written lease was canceled by the consent of the parties to it, and that then Deim entered into a verbal contract with him to rent the farm to him on substantially the same terms as those in the written lease to the father. Further, that in the performance of this verbal contract he purchased farm stock and implements, and moved on the Groff farm on April 3,1892, the father\u2019s family going along and taking up their abode in the house with him, the son. Samuel proceeded to plant spring crops and do the work of a tenant on the farm; also, as he alleged, paid to Diem one quarter of the cash payment when it fell due, about the 1st of July following his occupancy. The cancellation of the written agreement with the father, the oral contract with the son and the payment of rent by the son as tenant ivere all flatly denied by Diem, and he adduced much testimony tending to sustain tiffs denial; lie alleged the father alone was his tenant, and that relation was created by the written contract.\nOn the 27th of July, 1892, Diem, the landlord, averring rent in arrears under the written agreement, made complaint thereof before a justice of the peace against the father, and in this proceeding judgment was entered in his favor for $299, rent in arrears, and that Adam Dosch, the father, deliver up possession of the premises to his landlord. After notice of this judgment to the father, the justice placed a warrant in the hands of the constable directed against Adam Doscb commanding him to execute the judgment by redelivery of the possession to Diem of the premises and collection of the costs. After two ineffectual efforts, on the third attempt, in September, the officer put Diem in possession.\nIn dispossessing the two Dosches, father and son, much damage resulted to the stock and goods. The evidence showed Diem present directing the movements of the officer and his posse in removing the families and goods. Samuel Dosch, the son, then brought this action against Diem for damages. The question on which the right of plaintiff to recover at all turned was whether at the time he was ejected he was the tenant of Diem; if not a tenant under the oral contract he had no right of action for damages. Nearly one hundred witnesses were called, many of them to testify to facts tending to prove or disprove the cancellation of the written contract with the father and the existence of the oral contract with the son. The learned judge of the court below submitted the evidence bearing on this question as well as that on the amount of damage to the jury, who under the instructions given found for defendant. We have now this appeal by plaintiff with fifteen assignments of error, eight to rulings on offers of evidence and seven to charge of the court.\nAs to the first three assignments of error, the plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that he had acquired the ownership of certain personal property which he alleged formed part of that thrown out of the farmhouse and levied on for costs. When this offer was made, the cross-examination of plaintiff when on the stand had disclosed an intention by defendant to deny plaintiff\u2019s ownership or title to nearly all the property on the farm. He had a right to prove his title to personal chattels by evidence of possession at the date of the alleged trespass ; but he was not restricted to this; he might go further and show how he acquired it. The objection that the record offered was of a feigned issue between him and other parties than Diem is not well taken. True, judgments are conclusive only as between parties and their privies; but this was not offered as an adjudication conclusive of plaintiff\u2019s title, but as evidence of the channel through which the property came to him, just as if he had offered a receipted, bill of sale of the property, and had proved its genuineness. Such evidence is not conclusive; it may be attacked and discredited; still it is evidence. Besides, the plaintiff went further and proposed to show that although the other nominal party of record to the feigned issue was not Diem yet that he was the real antagonist, and the suit was in fact carried on by him. The court rejected this offer; we think in this there was error.\nThe fourth assignment is to allowing defendant\u2019s counsel to ask Adam Dosch on cross-examination if after possession of the Diem property had been taken he had not taken out insurance on it in his own name. We think in view of the witness\u2019 testimony in chief as to the contract with his son made in his presence, this was allowable for purpose of laying foundation for attacldng his credibility.\nThe fifth assignment is to the admission of evidence tending to contradict the witness as to the insurance. There was no error in this, and therefore the fourth and fifth assignments are overruled.\nThe sixth, seventh and eighth assignments are really to the order in which the court admitted testimony. This is so much in the discretion of the court below that a very gross abuse of that discretion would have to be manifest to induce a reversal. While there was some irregularity here, it is not of that character which could have seriously injured the appellant; therefore these assignments are not sustained.\nThe ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth assignments are to those parts of the charge referring to the conduct and declarations of the father indicating that he was the lessee of the farm, and not his son. We think the complaint as to each of these assignments is well founded. The court seems to have fallen into the error of treating the father and son as conspirators in collusion to defraud Diem, the landlord, and on this theory to have treated the acts and declarations of the father in the absence of the son as evidence against the son\u2019s title. The father could not by his independent acts and declarations affect the son\u2019s title to the property and his rights as a tenant. To affect the son, he must be proved to have participated in these acts; to have assented to the truth of the declarations of the father. To show that the son at times heard of these declarations of his father made to third parties did not impose upon Mm the duty of denying them and accusing his father of falsehood; and certainly they could not have the effect of destroying his title if it was otherwise good; the father could not talk away his son\u2019s property, and we think the jury should have been plainly so instructed. In giving undue weight to the conduct and conversations of the father, and in failing to caution the jury as to the proper effect to be given them, we thmk that the learned judge of the court below erred; therefore, these four assignments are sustained.\nThere is nothing of merit in the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth assignments of error, and they are overruled, but for those sustained, the judgment must be reversed. It is reversed accordingly, and v. f. d. n. awarded.",

Diem.\nPractice \u2014 Evidence\u2014Landlord and tenant.\nIn an action to recover damages for goods destroyed in an alleged wrongful eviction, the plaintiff may be permitted to introduce in evidence in support of his title to the goods the record of a feigned issue in which the goods were adjudged to him, and this is especially the case where he offers to show that the defendant was the real party in interest in the feigned issue, although not a party of record.\nIn an action to recover damages for an alleged wrongful eviction, the plaintiff claimed that he was in possession of the premises under an oral lease. The defendant claimed that plaintiff\u2019s father was in possession under a written lease. Plaintiff\u2019s father testified that he had heard plaintiff and defendant make the oral lease. On cross-examination the father was asked whether he had not taken out insurance on the property on the premises in his own name after possession had been taken. Held, that the question was allowable for the purpose of laying a foundation for attacking the witness\u2019s credibility. Held also, that it was proper to admit evidence tending to contradict the witness as to the insurance.\nLandlord and tenant \u2014 Evidence\u2014Wrongful eviction.\nIn an action to recover damages for a wrongful eviction where the plaintiff claims under an oral lease from the defendant, and the defendant claims that plaintiff\u2019s father was in possession of the premises under a written lease, declarations of the father made in the absence of the son are not evidence as against the son\u2019s title. In such a ease, to show that the son at times heard of the declarations of his father made to third parties did not impose upon him the duty of denying them and accusing his father of falsehood ; and. such declarations could not have the effect of destroying the son\u2019s title if it was otherwise good.\nPractice, G.

Smoker and wife, September term, 1892, No. 47, to be followed by proof that the judgment out of which that suit in interpleader arose was to the use of John K.

[3]\nWhen Adam Doseh was on the stand defendant asked the witness, for the purpose of testing his credibility, if in May, on or about May 28, 1892, after they were on this property of Diem whether he, Adam Dosch, didn\u2019t have an additional insurance put on the contents of the barn and the contents of the house on the farm of John K.

He did; as shown by said entry on page 129 of said book, which I identify by my initials in the margin, and which is lettered \u201c B.\u201d As I recollect he said he wanted the additional insurance because he had moved to a larger place and had more property on that account. [5]\nHenry B. Leaman, being recalled by the defendant and examined by Mr. Eshleman testified as follows :\nQ. How long have you known Samuel Dosch ? A. Seven years. Q.

Bill of exceptions signed, sealed and filed for the plaintiff.\nA. I certainly would not believe him on oath. [8]\nThe court charged in part as follows :\n[For the purpose of contradicting the father \u2014 because the father swears the contract was made with his son after the cancellation of this contract \u2014 they produce a written lease showing the fact that they had been on the farm for three or four months at the time of the change; that the father had made changes in that original lease and accepted the premises, and that Samuel knew that he had done so. Now that was for the purpose of contradicting the old gentleman, and for the purpose of showing also that Samuel, the plaintiff in this case, knew that his father had signed the lease. If that be the ease, then it would be safe for you to say that Samuel could, not have been the tenant, but that Adam Dosch was the actual tenant.] [9]\n[Squire Slack said when they met he read over this long agreement, item by item, and made the changes that were made in that agreement, and that Adam Dosch then signed the agreement. Adam Dosch said he signed the agreement. He does not deny it. And if he did that, and his son knew that he went there for the purpose of making those changes in the lease, then it would be safe for you to say that Adam Dosch was the tenant, .and the son Samuel was not the tenant.] [10]\n[After they moved to the Diem farm, the evidence shows to you conclusively that the father had the insurance increased 1650, and the insurance was taken in the father\u2019s name again. Now that would be evidence to show to you that the father was the tenant and not Samuel Dosch. But shortly before this writ of dispossession from Squire Slack was issued, Samuel goes over there \u2014 I think his mother was present, and the agent, Mr. Buckwalter, says he believes the father was present \u2014 Samuel says his mother was there \u2014 all these goods were insured then in the name of Samuel, for which he holds the policy. Now that is strong corroborative evidence on the part of the defendant\u2019s case, if you believe it, to show that Samuel was not the tenant.] [11]\n[You have also the testimony of a number of neighbors around the community there, some of whom are craftsmen, one was a blacksmith and another a miller, the parties with whom Adam Dosch had had conversations, who say positively that Adam said he was the tenant on that farm.] [12]\n[Now it is for you to say, when you come to weigh this testimony, to which party you will give credence, in order to arrive at the truth and justice in this case. For, if the plaintiff has trumped up a case of this character for the purpose of endeavoring to steal a portion of the proceeds of this farm, then I say that his case should be kicked out of court.] [13]\n[There is another ingredient that ought to be taken into consideration by you, and that is, whether the son could have accumulated that large amount of money by that time, and whether he did accumulate that large amount of money.] [14]\n[Whatever your verdict may be, by giving the case careful and deliberate consideration it will end the case. We will not try it over again.] [15]\nVerdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nErrors assigned were, (1-8) rulings on evidence, quoting the bills of exceptions; (9-15) above instructions, quoting them.\nII. M. Houser and W. U. Hensel, with them J. Hay Brown, for appellant.\nSamuel Dosch cannot be prejudiced or affected in any way by the conversations or declarations of Adam Dosch to which he was not a party. Even if Adam Dosch had set up a claim adverse to Samuel\u2019s and had contended for it, Samuel would not have been bound by his mere knowledge of the circumstances.\nThe charge of the court was misleading and unfair: Winters v. Mowrer, 163 Pa. 239; Com. v. Bowman, 37 W. N. C. 229; Kauss v. Rohner, 172 Pa. 488; Coxe v. Derringer, 82 Pa. 236; Heydrick v. Hutchinson, 165 Pa. 208; Cauffman v. Long, 82 Pa. 72; McFadden v. Reynolds, 20 W. N. C. 314; Bughman v. Byers, 21 W. N. C. 494; Gehman v. Erdman, 105 Pa. 371; Reber v. Herring, 115 Pa. 599; Shaver v. McCarthy, 110 Pa. 339; Schwenk v. Kehler, 122 Pa. 77.\nB. F. Davis and B. Frank Eshleman, for appellee.\nThe record of a judgment can affect only parties and privies: Shulze\u2019s App., 1 Pa. 251; Giltinan v. Strong, 64 Pa. 242; Chandler\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 262; Timbers v. Katz, 6 W. & S. 290; Coffman v. Hampton, 2 W. & S. 377; Cochran v. Sanderson, 151 Pa. 591; Williams v. McNeal, 3 Kulp, 37; Hoffman v. Coster, 2 Wharton, 453; Graham v. Smith, 25 Pa. 323; Bellas v. McCarty, 10 Watts, 13; Withers v. Livezey, 1 W. & S. 435.\nWe had a right to inquire into the insurance to affect the credibility of an obviously untruthful witness: Markley v. Swartzlander, 8 W. & S. 172; Bank v. Fordyce, 9 Pa. 275; Huoncker v. Merkey, 102 Pa. 462 ; Bohan v. Avoca, 154 Pa. 404.\nThe order of testimony is with the court below, and the Supreme Court will not reverse for that reason: Amrhein v. Clausen, 155 Pa. 93.\nThe whole of the charge must be taken together when a charge of inadequacy or unfairness is made against it, and we think, considered in that way, it was a fair presentment of both sides: Evans v. Evans, 155 Pa. 572; Burr v. Sim, 4 Wharton, 150; Brinser v. Longenecker & Bausman, 169 Pa. 51. At best the complaints of appellant as to expressions of opinion by the trial judge are not grounds for reversal; the jury were left free to form a different conclusion : Didier v. Penna. Co., 146 Pa. 582; Follmer v. McGinley, 146 Pa. 517.\nJuly 15, 1896 :"
