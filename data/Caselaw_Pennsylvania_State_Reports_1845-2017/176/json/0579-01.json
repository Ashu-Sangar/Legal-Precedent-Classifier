        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe policy of insurance upon which this action was brought contained the usual stipulations with regard to furnishing proofs of loss, and the defense was based mainly upon the failure of the insured to comply with the requirements of the policy in that particular.\nThe plaintiff, who lived in Camden, New Jersey, had insured with the defendant company a dwelling house and stable situated in Elk county, Pennsylvania. On August 25, 1894, both buildings were entirely destroyed by fire. He at once notified the agent, and was informed by him that he had notified the proper officers of the company. On September 21, he received a letter from the adjuster, Mr. Clinger, requesting him to go to Williamsport and \u201c go over the loss.\u201d In order to do this he would be obliged to travel some two hundred miles from his home, and on the 29th he wrote to the adjuster, objecting because of the expense and loss of time it would entail, and asking whether it was \u201c unavoidably necessary.\u201d On October 10, the adjuster replied by letter: \u201c If you think it a hardship to meet me at Williamsport do not comply with the request, but comply strictly with the policies you hold.\u201d On C'ctober 11, the plaintiff wrote to the insurance company stating (1) that he had a policy issued by it, giving its number, date and amount, and describing the property insured; (2) that the property had been totally destroyed on August 25 by a fire which originated on the property of a neighbor and had been carried by the wind to his buildings; (3) the amount of insurance in another company ; (4) the amount it would cost to replace the buildings. He further stated that he had notified the company\u2019s agent and that their adjuster had examined the property and found the buildings entirely consumed. He then recited the substance of his letter to Mr. Clinger and continued: \u201c I enclose herewith copies of both his letters. The last one dated Oct. 10, \u201994, is written in a mysterious manner alluding to a strict compliance of the policy, but does not explain in what way I omitted to strictly comply with the policy. I have read both policies and cannot find anything where I have failed in strictly complying with the conditions of these policies, but if there is anything further to be done I wish you would please inform me and also inform me whether it was unavoidably necessary to answer the summons of Mr. Clinger or not, and by so doing you will greatly oblige\u201d etc. To this letter the defendant replied: \u201cThe matter is in the hands of our representatives in Pennsylvania and strict compliance with the conditions of the policy will be required:\u201d\nThe plaintiff had distinct notice that the requirements of the policy would be insisted upon. Although intended for the protection of the company these requirements were conditions precedent to the right of action, and he was bound to comply with them in order to recover on the policy. On the other hand, if in good faith he had attempted to comply, it was the duty of the company to notify him of any objections to the proofs furnished. This has been repeatedly decided. In Gould v. Ins. Co., 134 Pa. 588, after a careful review of the cases it was said by Mitchell, J., \u201c If the insured in good faith and within the stipulated time does what he plainly intends as a compliance with the requirements of the policy, good faith equally requires that the company shall promptly notify him of their objections so as to give him the opportunity to obviate them; and mere silence may so mislead him to his disadvantage, to suppose the company satisfied, as to be of itself sufficient evidence of waiver by estoppel.\u201d\nThe plaintiff\u2019s letter of October 11 was intended to furnish the information required. No other conclusion is possible. He stated what he knew about the insurance on the building, the circumstances of the fire and the extent of the loss. This he afterwards testified was all the information it was possible for him to give. He did not have such a knowledge of the buildings as to enable him to state their dimensions or the details of their construction. Referring to Mr. Clinger\u2019s letter he said: \u201c The last one is written in a mysterious manner. . . . but does not state in what way I omitted to comply with the policy. I have read both policies and can\u2019t find anything where I have failed in strictly complying with the conditions, but if there is anything further to be done I wish you would please inform me.\u201d If in the opinion of the officers of the company this was not a substantial compliance, or if they wished further information, it was clearly their duty so to inform him.\nThe insured if required was to furnish a certificate of a magistrate or notary. He was not required to furnish one. It cannot be said that the notice to comply with the conditions of the policy was notice to furnish the certificate. The company could insist upon the certificate, but the insured was under no duty to furnish it unless required to do so. The arbitration clause was similar to, if not identical with, that considered in Boyle v. Ins. Co., 169 Pa. 349, in the opinion in which case it was said by Williams, J.: \u201c When one clause in a fire insurance policy provides that in case of loss an estimate shall be made by the insured and the company, and another clause provides that in case they differ the subject is to be referred to appraisers selected as therein provided, the remedies are successive, and neither party can insist upon the second who has not shown himself willing and ready to enter upon the first.\u201d\n' The defendant company, by letter of November 3, distinctly denies its liability on the policy, basing its refusal to pay upon the failure of the plaintiff to furnish proofs of loss within the time specified. As the testimony was undisputed, and nearly all of it, in fact all that was material in making out the plaintiff\u2019s case, was in writing, we see no error in the peremptory direction given by the learned judge.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

The adjuster replied, \u201c If you think it a hardship to meet me, do not comply with the request, but comply strictly with the policies you hold.\u201d On the day after the receipt of this letter the assured wrote to the insurance company, giving the number of his policy, its date and amount, and describing the property insured; stating that the property had been totally destroyed two weeks before (giving the date) by fire originating on the property of a neighbor. He also gave the amount of insurance in another company, and the amount it would cost to replace the buildings.

Answer: As the loss in this case was a total destruction of the building, we are of opinion the notice given to the company was sufficient. [1]\n2.

Answer: Refused. [3]\n4. The policy sued on having been made and accepted on the following express stipulation and condition, forming a part of the consideration thereof, to wit: \u201c This company shall not be liable beyond the actual cash value of the property at the time any loss or damage occurs, and the loss or damage shall be estimated according to such actual cash value, etc.; said ascertainment or estimate shall be made by the assured and this company, or, if they differ, then by appraisers as hereinafter provided; \u201d and, \u201c in the event of disagreement as to the amount of loss the same shall, as above provided, be ascertained by two competent and disinterested appraisers, the insured and this company each selecting one, and the two so chosen shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire; the appraisers together shall then estimate and appraise the loss, stating separately sound value and damage, and, failing to agree, shall submit their differences to the umpire; and the award in writing of any two shall determine the amount of such loss; the parties thereto shall pay the appraisers respectively selected by them and shall bear equally the expenses of the appraisal and umpire : \u201d Such specific method, provided by the policy for determining the amount of loss, is exclusive; and the policy further providing that the loss shall not become payable until sixty days after the notice, ascertainment, estimate and satisfactory proofs of loss have been received by this company, including an award by appraisers when appraisal has been required; and further providing that no suit or action upon this policy shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity until after full compliance by the insured with all the foregoing requirements; and the undisputed evidence showing that the amount of loss under said policy has never been ascertained and determined, either by agreement of the parties, nor by appraisers as provided by said policy, the plaintiff by the express terms of said policy has no right or cause of action in this case and cannot recover.
