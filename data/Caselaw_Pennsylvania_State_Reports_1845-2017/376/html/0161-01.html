In Grothe’s Estate, supra, Justice Mestbezat said, p. 192: ‘. . . if it was an oversight, the courts have no authority to insert a provision . . . under the assumption that it was the intention of the testator. It is only when the language of the will expressly or by clear implication discloses the intention of the testator that the courts may carry it out. It will not do for the courts to undertake to guess at the intention of a testator and declare that to be his will. If he sees fit for any reason not to dispose of any part of his estate, or such is the result of ignorance or oversight, the courts cannot supply the gap or hiatus and reconstruct the will. To do so would be a perversion of the functions of the court, and deprive a testator of the right to dispose of his property.’ See: Morrison Will, <a href="/pa/361/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="361 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="476380" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0419-01">361 Pa. 419</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20384" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="65 A.2d 384">65 A. 2d 384</a>, and cases therein cited.”</p>

He said: <em>“I am therefore supplying the necessary phraseology to efectúate the intent to benefit her grandchildren, whether they were the children of one or both of her sons. . . </em>.” (Italics supplied) In <em>Sowell’s Estate, </em>
      <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>supra, the judge said: “. . . we are frankly supplying something which the testator omitted, . . It will be noted, however, in the present case, that the auditing judge <em>also </em>said: “I therefore find that there is an implied gift to the issue of Clement R. Wainwright, Jr., Francis King Wainwright having died without issue”. Of course, if the court supplied an omission the gift would not have been <em>implied, </em>but it would have been an express gift. In the <em>Howell </em>case, supra, it is important to observe that the judge <em>also </em>said (p. 336) : “There is another feature of this will which we think easily disposes of the matter. The final clause of the will gives the entire fund to collaterals if <em>both </em>Edgar and Lillian should die without issue. It is familiar law that a gift over in default of issue implies a gift to the issue if they exist. This gift is by implication only, but it is such a compelling inference that the courts have never hesitated to make it: Beilstein v.

Should A leave issue, it is a well established canon of construction that there is an implied gift to such issue. This canon of construction is discussed and cases cited in <em>Rouse Estate, </em><a href="/pa/369/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="369 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="1232327" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0568-01">369 Pa. 568</a>, 571, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20281" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="87 A.2d 281">87 A. 2d 281</a>. There is respectable authority that, similarly, where there is a gift for life to two individuals and if they leave issue then to such issue, but if they leave no issue then to another, and one life tenant leaves issue and the other does not, the entire fund, as an <em>implied </em>gift, passes to the issue of the person so dying. In <em>Crossman’s Estate, </em>24 Dist. 600, two of Pennsylvania’s most eminent orphans’ court judges so ruled, viz.: Judges Clement B. Penrose and John Marshall Gest. In that case testatrix directed that upon the death of her husband, a son and a grandson were to share the income for their lives and in case both her son and her grandson left issue the corpus should be divided between them and if neither left issue then the estate was passed to her heirs. One left issue and the other did not. It was held that a <em>gift by implication </em>passed to the issue <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>of the one so dying. Judge Gest, for the court in banc, said (p. 601) : “The testatrix failed to provide in <em>express terms </em>for the contingency that actually happened. . . . We agree with the auditing judge. Every will should be construed to avoid an intestacy if possible, and in this will the testatrix has indicated the precise event in which she intended her estate to pass to her ‘heirs-at-law,’ viz., in case neither Albert nor Walter should leave a child or children who lives to be twenty-one years old. That event did not take place, and, consequently, no intestacy can result by reason of any express direction therefor. On the other hand, the implication is so strong as to be inevitable, that the gift to the heirs-at-law, in case neither Albert nor Walter should leave child or children who live to be twenty-one years old, is equivalent to a gift to such child or children of either.” (Italics supplied). Judge Penrose, in his adjudication, (which may be found in the record in the orphans’ court) confirming the above, said: “As the limitation to the heirs of the testatrix only takes effect in the event that neither the son nor the grandson leave issue ... it is clear, . . . that the trust to protect such limitation is no longer operative; . . .”</p>
