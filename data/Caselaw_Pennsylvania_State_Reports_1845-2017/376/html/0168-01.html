His head banged against the side of the car, his back, hip and head were injured and he had bruises <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>or cuts on Ms face, arm and leg which were of minor character. As a result of this collision, plaintiff claims that he had and still has severe pain in his back; that he is nervous; that he had dizziness and headaches which persisted until the trial; that he had running ears; and that he was permanently injured and unable to work. He was confined to bed for about three months. He Avas 51 years of age at the time of the accident, with a life expectancy at the time of the trial of 16.72 years.</p>

Wargo at the time of the accident had been doing whatever odd little jobs he could pick up. He had had a regular job assisting a priest at Mass and for these services he got one dollar for each Mass. However “he had to leave that job in 1947 on account of religion”, so that his only job at the time of the accident was as a janitor for the Holy Ghost Church, for which he was paid $85. a month. He testified that he averaged from the janitor and odd jobs about $50. a week. In his youth plaintiff had worked as a machinist; then <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>he got a job in Childs’ Restaurant, from 1928 until 1931; then he went on W.P.A. While on W.P.A. in 1934 something caved in on top of him in a 20 foot ditch and his back got hurt. He received Workmen’s Compensation for approximately ten years — from 1934 until 1944 — during which time he admitted he was unable to work except as he put it “a little occasional part-time job for the Shadyside Mission which his family took care of.” From 1934 until 1940 or 1944, the record isn’t clear which, he wore a brace for his back. Since 1944 he had a number of odd jobs including one for a short time helping dig graves. He is now unable to bend over without pain and claims he cannot do any work without pain. Defendant’s doctor admitted plaintiff could not do anything since the accident except light work.</p>
    <p id="b275-4" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[158,1221,1153,809]]]'>Dr. Zubritzky saw and treated plaintiff immediately after the accident on February 18, 1948. He visited him 10 times at his home and thereafter saw him once a week at the doctor’s office until September, 1948. His bill was $206. Plaintiff’s main complaint, according to Dr. Zubritzky, was an extreme backache in the sacroiliac area. The doctor prescribed heat and a liniment, together with codeine or novocaine when the pain was severe. He testified that plaintiff’s dizziness and headaches came from the accident but gave no testimony as to how long they continued, although plaintiff testified they continued until the time of the trial. The doctor testified that as far as work requiring plaintiff to bend over was concerned, he was permanently disabled.</p>

When asked whether there was any relationship between plaintiff’s back injury which he received in 1934 and the back injury plaintiff claims to have gotten in the present accident, Dr.. Zubritzky <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>testified that lie did not know exactly what injury plaintiff got in the first accident but that bis present injury was in exactly tbe same anatomical region and that <em>he could not say whether the accident aggravated the first injury or not. </em>He further testified that plaintiff now has a chronic myositis (a chronic muscular disease of the large muscles of the back) and with his age, some generalized arthritic condition of the back, and that he did not know whether that was what the plaintiff had in the period between 1934 and 1944.</p>

Under the testimony of plaintiff’s family physician, Dr. Zubritzky, it is extremely doubtful whether plaintiff is entitled to recover anything for his back condition, because the doctor frankly admitted that <em>he could not say whether the accident aggravated the first injury or not. </em>In <em>Nestor v.

The admission of this testimony was error and the assignment is sustained. In Vorbnoff v.

On cross-examination, Dr. Sherman admitted that there was no way of telling from the x-ray report how long plaintiff’s back condition had existed. He admitted there were arthritic changes of a marked degree in plaintiff’s back and said: “. . . <em>I think that there was back injury that could have easily caused this in 193 J/. </em>. . . Q. Yes; but if he was laid up with it for ten years, that is what he said, <em>that would indicate that any improvement icould probably be out of the picture; </em>wouldn’t it? A. <em>Yes; </em>at the site of injury; yes, sir. Q. Yes. So that if he is unable to work now there is no way of telling whether that condition was in any way caused by this recent accident; is there, the street car accident? A. <em>I will admit that in my opinion the street car accident did, not cause the injury. </em>... Q. You would have no way of telling, you as a physician, would you, whether this accident had even aggravated it or not? A. <em>Only from the patient’s remarks and clinical history. </em>Q. Yes. You would have to rely on what he told you in determining— A. That’s right. Q. —whether it had been aggravated? A. That’s right, sir. ... Q. The <em>arthritis </em>that seemed to be in his back, would you say <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>as a physician that that was the result of either of these two accidents <em>or would it be the result of age? </em>A. <em>I believe age, wear and tear. </em>Q. Wear and tear and age? A. Yes. I will admit that.”</p>

From the testimony of plaintiff’s physicians it is impossible to do anything but guess as to how much, if any, of plaintiff’s present back condition is due to the present accident instead of to his original back injury and arthritis !</p>

Plaintiff first complained to Dr. Zubritzky of his ears in <em>April, 191/8. </em>Both ears were draining and the doctor found it was an eczema or external condition and stated that it <em>could not have resulted from a blow to the head or other similar injury, </em>but 'could have been caused by the introduction of slag, particles or debris or foreign matter into the ear. There was no evidence that at the time of the accident slag particles or debris or other foreign matter got into plaintiff’s ears. Dr. Zubritzky sent plaintiff to Dr. Nicolette, who is an ear specialist, in April, <em>191/9. </em>Dr. Nicolette treated him for eczema about 25 times and submitted a bill for $145. Plaintiff at the time of the trial had a loss of hearing of about 70% in both ears. On <em>direct examination </em>Dr. Nicolette testified that <em>the cause of plaintiff’s ear condition was unknown </em>and in answer to the question, “From the history of this case and your diagnosis what would you say caused it? A. I <em>couldn’t answer that. </em>... A. <em>Well, I really don’t know what the cause is in this particular case. </em>This could be hereditary or it could be acci<a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>dental, I don’t know.” Although the jury was permitted to find that the condition of the ears was caused by the accident, this was basic error; it is as obvious as anything can be that plaintiff failed to prove that the drainage or other condition of his ears was due to the accident.
