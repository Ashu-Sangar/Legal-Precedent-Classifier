And you were present when all of these signatures were affixed to this paper? A. I was present when those were affixed. Q. On April 8,1943, which is the date of this document, when did you first see Mr. Orndorff and Mrs. Horne? A. When I arrived home from work. Q. Will you describe to us what occurred? A. They were sitting in the living room , as I went in and after the usual pleasantries of meeting someone, they started discussing a proposed marriage between the two of them, and Mrs. Horne stated that she would under no circumstances marry Mr. Orndorff unless there was a paper drawn whereby he would relinquish any right to sharing in her estate because she had a daughter, Dorothy Horne, that she wanted any estate that she might have in its entirety to go to her. Q. What was Mr. Orndorff’s comment upon that, Mr. Stump? A. Mr. Orndorff’s comment upon that was that he was not interested in her estate, that he agreed that Dorothy Horne should have any interest in her estate, if anything should happen to her, that he was not interested in her estate or any part of it. Q. What did they want you to do? A. They wanted me to write an agreement that in the event of her death after her marriage to Mr. Orndorff, he would not share in any part of her estate. Q. And what was your reaction to that request? A. My reaction was that I was a business man, not a lawyer, and if they wanted any such thing drawn, they should go to a lawyer, that they should get a lawyer to draw any <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>paper that would be binding on both parties. Q. How long did you discuss this? A. I would judge over a period of two hours. Q. And finally, what occurred? A. Finally, they kept asking and one or the other asked me — I think it was Mrs. Horne — ‘Well, don’t you have a typewriter in the house?’ I said, ‘Yes, I have a typewriter.’ ‘Well, you are a business man; you have seen lots of agreements. Could you not draw up such an agreement?’ Well, after being prevailed upon for two hours, I finally said, ‘Well, I will be glad to do the best I can to draw up such an agreement.’ Q. And this Exhibit No. 3 is the agreement— A. It is the agreement that I drew up and typed.” He also testified: “Q. Was there any comment by either party upon their willingness or nonwillingness to sign such an agreement? A. As a matter of fact, Mr. Orndorff indicated that he was willing to sign any agreement or paper which would provide that he did not expect or did not want or had no interest in any property or any estate that Mrs. Horne may leave after their marriage. Q. Was there any objection by either of the parties to this agreement? A. None whatsoever. Q. Was there any pressure upon either party to sign this agreement, of any sort? A. None whatsoever, except that Mrs. Horne insisted that she would not marry Mr. Orndorff unless he relinquished his right to her estate, if you can call that pressure, then my answer would be — Q. Was Mr. Orndorff in full possession of his faculties as far as you observed? A. Yes, undoubtedly.”</p>

The evidence did not affirmatively show that there had been a full and fair disclosure of the extent and value of his proposed wife’s property and of her financial worth, prior to the husband’s execution of the release.

    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[165,1289,1152,977]]]'>The testimony in the present case clearly reveals that Eldred Orndorff at and prior to the date of the release was acquainted with the fact that his proposed wife was a woman of substantial means, even though he did not know and was not told the extent or value of her property. At the time of the making and execution of the release his proposed wife informed him that she would not marry him unless he agreed to relinquish all rights in her estate in order that her daughter by her former marriage might inherit her entire estate. Mr. Orndorff acquiesced and stated that he was not interested in Mrs. Horne’s (later Mrs. Orndorff \s) estate or any part of it and agreed that on her death the entire estate should pass to the daughter. It is plain that when Eldred Orndorff executed the release he knew exactly what he was doing and intended to execute the release according to its terms.</p>
