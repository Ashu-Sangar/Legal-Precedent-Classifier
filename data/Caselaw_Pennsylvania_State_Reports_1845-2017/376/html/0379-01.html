At the very outset it is only fair to plaintiff to state that, admittedly, she is utterly opposed to Communism and is in all respects loyal to the principles of our government, and, further, that the performance of the duties of her position was at all times entirely satisfactory. She was, however, of the conscientious belief that her rights under the Constitutions of the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would be infringed if she were compelled to take the prescribed oath of loyalty. After her dismissal and after appealing in vain to the Civil Service Commission, she filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Common Pleas seeking reinstatement, but judgment was there rendered against her. From that judgment she now appeals.</p>

She also complains of an alleged vagueness in the terms of the oath which, she asserts, renders it impossible for one, even with the best of intentions, to know whether he is making an untrue statement and thereby committing perjury.</p>

That being so, the oath prescribed by the 1951 Act is obviously justified for the purpose of informing the appointing authority as to whether the employe is in fact a member of an organization which he knows is subversive in character and therefore is not a fit person to be entrusted with the duty of supporting and advancing the interests of the. very government whose, destruction: he is. seeling to accomplish." ■ ■_ ;■ . ■</p>

But this argument loses weight in view of the fact that the oath here in question proscribes membership in an organization which the employe <em>knows </em>is one that advocates the overthrow of the government by force or other unconstitutional means; criminal prosecution for the making of a false oath would not be maintainable unless the false swearing was wilful and corrupt, and therefore the employe cannot suffer the danger of incurring a criminal penalty if innocent of any criminal intent: cf. <em>Screws v.

But our own statute is subject to no such infirmity <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>because it does not interdict innocent membership; it is only the deliberate and purposeful joining, with knowledge of the organization’s objectives and activities, that is within the contemplation of the statute;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the test is whether the loyalty statement, even if in fact erroneous in its denial of membership in an organization which is in fact subversive, is made in honest ignorance of that fact and therefore in good faith. As to the phrases “other unconstitutional means” and “deny other persons their rights under the Constitution of the United States or of this Commonwealth,” it might be said, as in <em>American Communications Assn., C.I.O., v. Douds, </em><a href="/us/339/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="339 U.S. 382" data-case-ids="362716" data-case-paths="/us/339/0382-01">339 U.S. 382</a>, 412, that “There is little doubt that imagination can conjure up hypothetical cases in which the meaning of these terms will be in nice question.

While the maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes may be obtained by lawful means is a fundamental principle of our constitutional system <em>(Stromberg v. California, </em><a href="/us/283/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="283 U.S. 359" data-case-ids="434002" data-case-paths="/us/283/0359-01">283 U.S. 359</a>, 369), certainly the constitutional rights thus asserted by appellant do not extend to freedom to meet with others, knowingly and deliberately, for the discussion of plans to overthrow the gov-<a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>eminent by force or violence. Appellant argues that, not being able accurately to ascertain whether any given organization is in fact subversive, she would be obliged, in fear or making a mistake in that regard, to refrain from joining associations that in fact might be wholly legitimate, and therefore the right of peaceable assembly was being denied to her. The argument thus propounded seems highly strained, but, even if the possibility it conjures up were real, it would not militate against the constitutionality of the loyalty oath because the constitutional rights which appellant invokes are not so wholly sacrosanct as to be immune from the slightest modification under any and all circumstances. It was said in <em>United Public Workers of America (C. I. O.) v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/us/330/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="330 U.S. 75" data-case-ids="353818" data-case-paths="/us/330/0075-01">330 U.S. 75</a>, 95: “Of course, it is accepted constitutional doctrine that these fundamental human rights are not absolute . . . The essential rights of the First Amendment in some instances are subject to the elemental need for order without which the guarantees of civil rights to others would be a mockery.” So, in <em>American Communications Assn., C.I.O., v. Douds, </em><a href="/us/339/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="339 U.S. 382" data-case-ids="362716" data-case-paths="/us/339/0382-01">339 U.S. 382</a>, 399, it was said: “When particular conduct is regula,ted in the interest of public order, and the regulation results in an indirect, conditional, partial abridgement of speech, tlie duty of the courts is to determine which of these two conflicting interests demands the greater protection under the particular circumstances presented. . . On the other hand, legitimate attempts to protect the public . . . from present excesses of direct, active conduct, are not presumptively bad because they interfere with and, in some of its manifestations, restrain the exercise of First Amendment rights.” And in <em>Thorp v. Board of Trustees of Schools for Industrial Education of Newark, </em><a href="/nj/6/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="6 N.J. 498" data-case-ids="117753" data-case-paths="/nj/6/0498-01">6 N.

The particular guarantee of freedom of thought and opinion by the First Amendment is not free of all qualification. Government has the inherent right of self-protection against the forces that would accomplish its overthrow by violence. It is of the very nature of the social compact that the individual freedoms at issue here are subject to reasonable restraint in the service of an interest deemed essential to the life of the community . . . The question is whether the statutory proscriptions bear a reasonable relation to the apprehended public evil. Where a regulation in the interest of public order results in an indirect partial abridgement of civil rights, the inquiry is as to which of the two conflicting interests demands the greater protection in the circumstances. The incidental limitation of personal freedoms is justifiable where necessary in the seiwice of an overriding public interest.”</p>

In the <em>Douds </em>case, supra, where the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 denied certain privileges to labor organizations the officers of which failed to file affidavits that they were not members of the Communist Party or any other subversive organization, such provision was held not unduly to infringe freedoms protected by the First Amendment.

The court said (p. 720) : “We think that a municipal employer is not disabled . . . from inquiring of its employees as to matters that may prove relevant to their fitness and suitability for the public service.” Such “matters” were held to include the loyalty of the employe.</p>

It is of course true that the searching out of disloyal employes may be more necessary in the case of teachers than of other public servants, but it cannot be said that the Legislature acted arbitrarily in not drawing a more restricted and discriminating classification. No employe of a governmental agency, whether teacher, nurse, or anyone else, should be allowed, while in such employ, to disseminate disloyal and seditious doctrines or encourage their spread by membership in a subversive organization.</p>
