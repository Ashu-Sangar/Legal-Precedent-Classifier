The gathering up of the opened hatbox with its contents on the railroad platform was part of plaintiff’s duty. He was also required to clean tip, with his broom, the vomit spewed upon the platform. After performing these duties, apparently between 10:30 and 11:00 in the morning, plaintiff carried his dirty broom and hatbox from the platform down the steps and through the corridor or tunnel beneath the tracks. At the end of the tunnel, instead of turning to the left and handing the hatbox to those in charge of defendant’s Lost and Found Department, plaintiff turned to the right and entered a locker room where cleaning supplies were kept and placed the hatbox on top of a locker in full view. The police officer observed plaintiff thus entering the locker room with the hatbox, followed and arrested him, and charged plaintiff with larceny. Plaintiff unavailingly explained that the reason he had gone into the locker room first instead of turning in the hatbox at the Lost and Found Department was that he did not think he could take the dirty broom into that department, and therefore decided to wait until • he could wash it and also to take time out to eat a sandwich (not having eaten breakfast• that morning).</p>

It was a most tenuous thread on which to hang a charge of theft because an employe with a theretofore unimpeachable record, in performing duties he was employed to do, turned to the right instead of the left, after making a journey with the hatbox in full view of passengers and employes in a busy railroad station and without the slightest concealment. He placed the box on top of a locker in plain view. He then gave the officer an account of why he had postponed turning it in to the Lost and Found Department. Under these circumstances the action of defendant’s police officer was with unwise haste and exhibited a lack of deliberation or care. The arrest and the handcuffing of plaintiff and carrying him off to defendant’s office for search and delivery to the city police were without sufficient justification.</p>

The police officer acted with undue haste and on insufficient grounds. Judge Bok accurately said in his opinion, sustaining the verdict: “As for malice, which the jury expressly found, . . . [pjlaintiff had a good reputation after seven years employment. He was handcuffed and taken openly to headquarters, several miles away; there he was questioned for three hours and taken, with or without his permission, to the place where he lived. That place was searched for an hour, obviously not for the contents of the hatbox but just in case plaintiff had been stealing anything else, although the railroad had no other suspicions about him whatever. This pressure took place after the arrest, not before. Aside from the inference of malice that may be drawn from the lack of probable cause, if not rebutted (cf. the <em>Miller </em>and <em>Simpson </em>cases, supra), it is clear, reading through the jury’s eyes, that there was factual evidence of malice; the quick arrest, the public handcuffing, the long interrogation, the effort to get plaintiff’s written permission to search his house and then going without it, the search of the house for stolen property — both the public’s and the railroad’s — without any more to go on than the suspicion arising from the hatbox. This appears ample to support the verdict.”</p>

Alessandroni. </em>After the jury returned a verdict of “not guilty” the trial Judge had Iiugee, who is the present plaintiff, stand at the bar of the Court and said: “The Court: You have every reason to feel grateful to your attorney and the jury. <em>If I was on the jury, I would have found you guilty. . . .”</em>

P.R.R., </em>371 Pa., supra, where this Court reversed the judgment of the Court below, and entered judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto, this Court said (page 317) : “It is to be noted that plaintiff was held for court by a justice of the peace and indicted by a grand jury. It is everywhere held that the actions of each of these judicial bodies are affirmative evidence of probable cause: Restatement, Torts, §§663(2) and 664(2). No suggestion has been made that either the justice of the peace or the grand jury was imposed upon in any way or that the evidence was distorted in presentation to them. What appeared to each of them to be probable cause for prosecution may well have appeared in the same light <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>to the defendant railroad.” The instant case is much stronger for the prosecution because Judge Alessandroni also believed plaintiff was guilty. How then is it possible to say, without ignoring or distorting ■ all our prior decisions, that defendant’s officer, acting as a reasonable man and on the basis of the facts as they appeared to him at the time, lacked reasonable grounds to believe the cleaner was trying to steal the hat box and its contents.</p>

It is true that such an inference of the existence of malice is permissible, but it has rarely been sufficient unaided by some showing of private motive, . . . Plaintiff in the present case introduced no evidence at all to prove malice or to overcome the defendant’s evidence that this prosecution was part of a bona fide effort by the railroad police to protect the railroad property from further depredations by bringing the offenders to justice.”</p>
