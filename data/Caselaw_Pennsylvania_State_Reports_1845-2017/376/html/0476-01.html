Its solution depends upon the construction to be given the statute which confers the right to a refund of taxes erroneously paid the Commonwealth as applied to the undisputed facts of the case.</p>

For the fiscal year ending July 31, 1946, the Commonwealth assessed against the plaintiff a corporate franchise tax for which it was not legally liable. The assessment was made, however, because the plaintiff itself had erroneously filed with the Commonwealth a franchise tax report instead of a distillers capital stock tax report to which latter tax it was property subject. The franchise tax report which the plaintiff filed for the fiscal year in question was in blank and showed an estimated tax of $1500 due which the plaintiff paid forthwith. A few months later, the plaintiff supplemented its blank franchise tax report with a detailed report showing a total tax due of $2579.53 and, at the same time, paid the balance of the tax which it thus admitted to be due. Approximately a year later, the tax for the year in question was settled by the Commonwealth’s fiscal officers at $4742.63. The plaintiff then petitioned for a reset<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>tlement of the tax which was resettled at $4426.45 on April 26, 1949. The petition for resettlement did not question the propriety of the imposition of a franchise tax upon the plaintiff but merely the valuation placed by the Commonwealth’s fiscal officers on the stock of the corporation. On May 6, 1949, the plaintiff paid the additional tax in the sum of $1846.92, as determined by the resettlement and, on January 9, 1951, filed with the Board of Finance and Revenue its claim for a refund in the sum of $4393.38, being the difference between the franchise tax of $4426.45, which it had paid, and a tax of $33.07 for which it was liable under the Distillers’ Capital Stock Tax Act of July 15, 1897, P. L. 292, 72 PS §1872. The Board of Finance and Revenue awarded the plaintiff a refund, in the nature of a credit, of $1846.92 which was the only sum paid by the plaintiff within two years immediately preceding the filing of its claim for refund.</p>

The defendant filed preliminary objections to the complaint. After argument, the court below sustained the objections and entered an order dismissing the complaint This appeal by the plaintiff followed.</p>

L. 343, as amended, 72 PS §503 (a), which provides, with respect to the time allowable for the filing of petitions for refunds of taxes, that “All such petitions must be filed with the board [of Finance and Revenue] within two years of the payment of which refund is requested, or within two years of the settlement in the case of taxes or bonus, whichever period last expires . . . .” These words are clear and free from all ambiguity.

    <p id="b585-3" data-blocks='[["BL_585.4",585,[180,638,1150,1269]]]'>Accordingly, we may not supply words which are not to be found in the statute and so give to it a meaning which it otherwise does not have. The Act plainly states that the petition for refund must be filed within two years of <em>the payment </em>of which refund is requested, or within two years of the <em>settlement </em>of the tax. As there was obviously only one payment by the appellant made within the two years preceding the filing of the petition for refund, it necessarily follows that such is the only <em>payment </em>of which refund could be requested. Likewise, as to the word “settlement”, the tax was settled more than two years prior to the filing of the claim for refund. But, because it was resettled, on the appellant’s petition, within the two-year period, the appellant would have us interpret the word “settlement” to include “resettlement” which we may not do. To achieve the result which the appellant seeks, the Act would have to provide that “All petitions for refund must be filed with the board within two years of the <em>last </em>payment <em>of the tax </em>of which refund is requested, or within two years of the settlement <em>or resettlement” </em>of the tax. We, of course, have no rightful power so to alter the statute under the guise of construing it.</p>
