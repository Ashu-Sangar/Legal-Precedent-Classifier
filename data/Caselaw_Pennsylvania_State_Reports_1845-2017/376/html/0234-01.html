The ■owner intended the land to be used for the building of homes, and plotted most of the area for that purpose. The portion taken includes buildings, which rented for $25.00 per month, and most of the level part of the premises, the remainder being not very suitable for building lots. The sole dispute between the parties is the value of the land, or the loss suffered by the owner.</p>

The jury, after testimony taken and after a view, returned a verdict of $25,070. Plaintiff fixed the value of $40,000 before condemnation, with a loss of $35,000, and his expert witnesses determined the loss to be $31,000, $33,000 and $35,000 respectively.

This is not a case where, as in personal injury cases, the jury considers pain and suffering and loss of earning power, and where no evidence can be taken to fix the dollar value of the loss. The simple question here is: Under the evidence taken, what was the loss to the plaintiff for the taking of his land? We repeat: the court stated that it could not find “that the verdict is contrary to or not supported by evidence.” It did not say that it found against the credibility of the plaintiff’s witnesses. It did say that “while it is not in . . . [the court’s] province to determine the amount which should be awarded, . . .

(Italics supplied). The three judges of the court en banc, none of whom viewed the premises and only one of whom heard the testimony, have indicated that they believe that the award, including detention money, should be $20,000. Since the jury had only the opinion evidence, supported by a view of the premises, — and the court had only the opinion evidence and did not participate in . the view, — and since no capricious dis<a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>regard of testimony by the jury is shown, there is no justifiable basis for the court’s order. In fact, the court itself held that the verdict was not contrary to, but was supported by, the evidence. As in <em>Ray v. Philadelphia, </em>supra, the learned court below “took from the jury its exclusive right to determine the credibility of the testimony and the weight and effect to which it was entitled.” However good the intentions of the court may have been, it cannot usurp the power of the jury. The verdict bore a reasonable resemblance to damages proved, and it is not the function of the court below, nor of this Court, to substitute its judgment for that of the jury. See <em>Paustenbaugh v.

Such conclusion, in the absence of amplification, could well serve as a cloak or shield for abused judicial discretion. Since the learned court below in the present case failed to give its reasons for granting defendant’s motion for new trial, stating only its conclusion that ‘the interests of justice require a retrial,’ we are obliged to examine the entire record to determine whether any valid reason exists for disturbing the jury’s verdict. . .
