[and if] for sale to persons residing within the Borough . . . the rate of tax . . . shall be four (4) per centum.” The ordinance further provided that if the taxpayer should refuse or neglect to pay the tax, or to file a report, a penalty of 50 per cent, would be added.</p>

It determined further that the penalty was unreasonable and excessive and therefore invalid.</p>

It clearly sets up a tax. but fails to indicate what is being taxed. “ ‘Where a statute is “so vague, indefinite and uncertain that the courts are unable to determine, with any reasonable degree of certainty, what the legislature intended, or is so incomplete or conflicting and inconsistent in its provisions that it cannot be executed, it will be declared inoperative” ’.” <em>Willcox v.

The defendant contends that it is a tax on the privilege of using its streets; but the difficulty with this is that the ordinance does not so state.
