That item makes provision for testator’s son, Henry. The phrase reads: “if he survives my wife and me”. Upon the audit of the trustees’ account the auditing judge ruled that the phrase had reference only to the son’s <em>life estate </em>and all other dispositions in the item were effective, <em>even though the son did not survive testator’s widow, the son’s stepmother. </em>The court in banc overruled the auditing judge and decided that the phrase made the bequest to the son <em>conditioned </em>upon his surviving testator’s widow, and since the son did not so survive, an intestacy resulted as,to this share. The executor and trustee, under the son’s will and certain of the son’s appointees under his power of appointment have appealed.</p>

Henry was fifty. Henry, died in 195.0 at the age of sixty-nine and testator’s widow at- her decease had attained ninety-eight years of age: Should we accept appellees’, contention that the-entire bequest to the son is conditioned and therefore' fails because. the son did not survive testator’s widow,. it would result, considering testator’s general stirpital testamentary scheme, in an obviously unnatural and absurd disposition: <em>Bender v.

      <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>Appellees, in support of their contention, point to the provision for testator’s daughter, Margaret, in the ninth item. This item gives the daughter her one fourth equal share <em>absolutely </em>“provided [she] is then living”. By the eleventh item it is provided that should Margaret <em>not </em>survive, <em>but leave issue, </em>the trustees were to hold such grandchildren’s share of principal and pay them the income <em>for life. </em>The item also gave them power of appointment over the principal. It is argued that if testator had not intended Henry’s share to be conditioned on his surviving his father and stepmother, testator would have phrased the tenth clause in the same manner as he did in that portion of the eleventh item. But this does not necessarily follow. Henry was only to enjoy a <em>life estate </em>after the death of testator’s widoiv. His bequest was unlike his sister Margaret’s, which was <em>absolute. </em>After the gift of a life estate to Henry, testator provided for <em>life estates </em>to Henry’s <em>surviving issue, </em>if any, and in default to Henry’s <em>appointees. </em>A testator is not required to make an equal division of his estate. This frequently is the very purpose for making a will. A testator may exclude any one without stating his reason therefor: <em>Wharton Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/373/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="373 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="1240368" data-case-paths="/pa/373/0360-01">373 Pa. 360</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20A.2d%20104" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="96 A.2d 104">96 A. 2d 104</a>.
