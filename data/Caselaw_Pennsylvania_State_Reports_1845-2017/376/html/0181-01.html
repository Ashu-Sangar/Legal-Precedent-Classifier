    <p id="b287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_287.7",287,[157,459,1152,1025]]]'>The appeal raises the question whether or not a commercial bank is absolved from liability to its depositor because of its payment of a depositor’s check after the bank had received notice from the depositor not to pay it. The depositor, in seeking to stop payment of Ms check, had executed and left with the bank a printed paper (supplied by the bank) titled “Request to Stop Payment of Check”. Among the terms of the paper was a provision which constituted a release of the bank from all liability where, in violation of such notice, the bank pays the check through <em>“inadvertence, accident or </em>oversightPayment of the check was made by the bank under those circumstances. The proceeding is in the nature of a Case Stated as provided by Rule 1007 (3) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. The court below decided that the bank was liable and entered judgment for plaintiff. On appeal the Superior Court reversed the judgment. An allocatur was allowed.</p>

Thomas, the plaintiff, is a depositor. The depositor drew a check on his account October 12, 1950 and on October 13, 1950 went to defendant bank to stop payment, whereupon a clerk handed him a printed paper marked “Request to Stop Payment of Check”, which he signed and left with the bank. In the paper requesting the bank to stop payment aré the words: “. . . Should the check be paid through inadvertence, accident or oversight, it is expressly agreed that thé Bank will in no way be held responsible. The Bank receives this request upon the express condition that it shall not he in any way liable for its act should the check he paid by it in the course of its business. The undersigned <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>agrees to be legally bound hereby.” On October 16, 1950, despite the notice, the check was paid by the bank “through inadvertence, accident or oversight” and the amount of the check charged against plaintiff’s account. Plaintiff demanded that defendant refund this amount, which defendant refused to do.</p>

Payment by the bank of the check after notice to stop its payment was failure to exercise due care, precaution and vigilance. This constituted negligence, even though the failure to exercise proper care had been due to “inadvertence, accident or oversight”. There are many definitions of negligence. Perhaps the one most frequently quoted is that of Judge Cooley in his work on Torts (3d ed) pp. 1324-25, viz.: “. . . the failure to observe, for the protection of the interests of another person, that degree of care, precaution and vigilance which the circumstances justly demand, whereby such other person suffers injury”. This Court has cited this definition with approval: <em>Caulton v. Eyre &amp; Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/330/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="330 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1182938" data-case-paths="/pa/330/0385-01">330 Pa. 385</a>, 389, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.%20136" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="199 A. 136">199 A. 136</a>.

The difference in view is whether or not such agreements are founded upon <em>consideration. </em>Judge IIikt in his opinion in the Superior Court discusses this question at length, citing eases. He accurately states, however, that under the Uniform Written Obligations Act of May 13, 1927, P. L. 985, 33 PS 6, lack of consideration is removed as a ground for avoiding the release. But it is to be observed that the present agreement is under seal and even in the absence of the Act consideration would have been imputed.

The United States Government and the Commonwealth respectively stipulate how banks under their respective jurisdictions shall be incorporated and organized.

The <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>United States insures deposits in banks up to a stipulated amount. If a person desires to deposit money in a bank, necessarily, he is relegated to a governmental or state regulated banking institution. The situation of a depositor is quite analogous to that of a passenger on a public carrier who is required to accept such means of transportation and to purchase a ticket in the nature of a contract. This Court has consistently decided that it is against public policy to permit a common carrier to limit its liability for its own negligence: <em>Coleman v.

Levin, the payee, went to Arkin while Arkin was asleep and extracted the check from his pocket. When Arkin awoke and found the check missing he thought - he had lost it and so notified plaintiff. Plaintiff, the maker of the check, directed the bank to stop payment, signed a paper handed to him by the bank, stated that he requested the bank to stop payment “as courtesy only” and released the bank from negligent payment. The court, in holding the agreement valid, stated (p. 42): “At the time the-stop- payment order was given to the bank the officers of -the institution were-.told that the check-had -been lost-,-that it was intended for Levin and. that Arkin- had lost-fit.

      <em>another check for a larger sum including, however, the amount of the first check, and by reason of both these checks being presented and paid a subsequent check given by the plaintiff was dishonored. </em>Hence this suit. We see no reason why, under the circumstances in the case, the plaintiff should not be bound by the terms of the stop payment order. We do not say that such an order would protect a bank <em>under all circumstances. </em>We think it does in this case. The reason the payment was stopped was because the check was lost. It was to prevent any one but the payee using the lost check, if found, and drawing the money. <em>When the real payee of the check presented it the bank might infer that the reason for stopping payment had disappeared,, </em>at least the payment of the check after such facts appeared would not render the bank liable in view of the provision of the stop payment notice. The plaintiff was not required to use the form of order but since he chose in writing to ask the bank to stop payment as an act of courtesy and not as a matter of right, he cannot now complain if the bank be relieved from liability by reason of the terms of the order which he gave. We think under the facts as developed in the case the bank cannot be held.” (Italics supplied). The facts in that case are <em>sui generis </em>and inapposite to those now before us.</p>
