He stopped at Mascher Street for a red light. At that time he was in the side or right-hand lane of Roosevelt Boulevard on the east side thereof. When the light changed to green plaintiff made a left turn into Mascher Street and stopped again for the light, which was then red for Mascher Street traffic. Roosevelt Boulevard consists at this point of three lanes, about 200 feet wide, a wide center lane for north and south bound traffic, a right-hand lane for north bound traffic, and a left-hand lane for south bound traffic. Except at street crossings these three lanes are divided by a green strip.</p>

The seat was bent, the floor was bent, the windshield Avas broken, the glass was knocked out of the door and the chassis had a bend in it of about 6 inches. There was no evidence of the speed of defendant’s car. Plaintiff admitted that he could see a distance of at least two city blocks to the right from which direction he Avas hit, and one-half a block ¡to the left.
