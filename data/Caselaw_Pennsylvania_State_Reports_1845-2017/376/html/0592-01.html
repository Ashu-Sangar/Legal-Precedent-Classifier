One appeal is by the executor (a co-devisee and co-legatee) from a decree allowing a family exemption of |750 to the surviving widow, under the Fiduciaries Act of April 18, 1949, <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>P. L. 512, art. II, sec. 211, 20 PS 320.211, out of specifically devised real estate. The other appeal is by the 'widow from decrees ordering her to surrender to the executor possession of the real estate awarded to her as the “family exemption”. The surrender was decreed in order to permit the executor to operate a beer garden business on the premises pending the outcome of this litigation. John Stachnick, the testator, died October 24, 1950. His will was probated October 30, 1950. He left surviving his widow, Kathryn Stachnick, but no issue. By the will testator made various devises and bequests which need not be recited as they are not involved in this litigation. Testator by the fifth item of his will devised premises 317 Vine Street, in the Borough of Old Forge, together with the beer garden thereon and its furniture and fixtures, to Walter Ferrett and Boman Ferrett. He charged this devise and bequest with the payment of specific sums of money to various named individuals. Walter Ferrett was appointed sole executor to whom letters testamentary were granted.</p>

Appraisers appraised the premises at $3,500. By decree of March 9, 1953, the court awarded the premises to the widow in settlement of the statutory family exemption, subject to the payment by her of $2,750 — the difference between the amount of the appraisement of $3,500 and the $750 allowance. The decree also provided with respect to •the payment of $2,750 that: “. . . <em>one-half thereof [he paid] unto [the widow] and the other one-half thereof unto [the executor] for the benefit of the heirs and </em>

But a surviving spouse who elects to bake against a will where there is no issue is entitled to one-half of the real and personal estate of testator: Wills Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, sec. 8, 20 PS 180.8. As the record discloses no forfeiture of this right she takes one-half of her husband’s estate as if he had died intestate. No question with respect to the widow’s <em>election to take against the toill </em>is before us, except as to payment by her of $1,375, being one-half of $2,750 as above recited.</p>

The Liquor Control Board apparently awarded the license to the executor, but for the benefit of the estate.

There is no testimony as to whether or not the conduct of the business would require occupancy of the whole premises or only part thereof. We agree with appellant that nowhere in this record does it appeal* how the estate would be benefited by reviving or resuming a business which has been discontinued and where the premises on which the business was conducted has been vacant for such a long period. No inventory or account has been filed by the executor.
