Strip mining, as the term indicates, is the stripping away of the earth surface and the horizontal withdrawal of the mineral deposits at hand. Shaft mining involves the sinking of a verticle shaft into the ground and the developing from that point of tunnels and galleries which serve as vantage points from which to withdraw and lift the coal through the shaft. Shaft mining does a minimum of damage to the outer crust of the earth; strip mining does a maximum of damage.

It was largely underlain with bituminous coal which defendant had been deep mining for 15 years but which he then started to strip mine, which was the only method by which the surface coal could be removed. The Court held that the reservation of the mineral rights included the right of strip mining, and speaking through Chief Justice Stern said (pages 426-427, 428-429-430) <em>: . </em>Defendant, as assignee of the grantors under the deed of 1855, acquired the ‘full, entire, complete and exclusive ownership’ of the coal ‘in or upon any part of’ the land with the right to ‘dig, excavate or penetrate any part of the said premises’. There is no restriction limiting that right nor any provision as to the method of severing the coal. What was said in Richardson v. Clements, <a href="/pa/89/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="89 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="1063236" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0503-01">89 Pa. 503</a>, 506, is applicable here, viz.: ‘The language used indicates no intention to deny the use of such improved process as science may discover or mechanical ingenuity invent. . . .’ Plaintiff admits that the coal which defendant seeks to obtain by stripping operations cannot be recovered by any other process. True it is that strip mining was not used in 1855 in the case of bituminous deposits although it was the earliest known method in Pennsylvania of mining anthracite coal and was originally performed by hand; the invention and use of power shovels for the removal of the overburden was, of course, a later development, .but there is no rule of law which would preclude defendant, having, the right to mine the coal, from using.methods for that purpose made.possible by •modern machinery and inventions.. -. .. .• No .principle .of law is more firmly established in. this.

The owner of the surface may, however, by contract or by waiver, relinquish the right, although such relinquishment should not be implied in the absence of language clearly indicating the intention of the parties to that effect. In this case the deed of 1855 did, in our opinion, impliedly release to the grantors the obligation of surface support. . . . Whether a deed impliedly releases the right of surface support must depend in each instance upon its terms; here the cumulative effect of its provisions would seem fairly to give to the grantors, and their assigns, who reserved the ownership and authority to excavate the coal, the right to remove all of it whether upon the land, or near the surface, or lying deep within it, and by any method, old or new, appropriate and necessary for the purpose. . . . The tract in question is unimproved mountain land; any damage caused to its surface would be merely of a temporary nature in view of the provisions of the Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Conservation Act of May 31, 1945, P. L. 1198, as amended by the Act of May 23, 1949, P. L. 1730, which provides that before any operator shall engage in open pit mining of bituminous coal he must file a bond conditioned for the faithful performance of all the requirements of the Act, one of which is that he must, within one year after the operation is completed, place sufficient overburden or earth in the open cut to cover the exposed face of the unmined coal, and, within three years after the operation is completed or abandoned, plant trees, shrubs or grasses upon the land affected thereby. ...”</p>

Furthermore, I do not agree that the <em>use </em>which the grantee makes of the surface of the land conveyed has any place in the interpretation of the written clause of reservation. But even if it does, the Commonwealth’s use of this large tract of land should be given tremendous weight. In addition to its recreational value, it is being reforested, is necessary for soil conservation and retention of surface water for the prevention of floods and is needed as a water storage area in case of drought. The importance of such use to the United <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>States Government and to the various states is well known.
