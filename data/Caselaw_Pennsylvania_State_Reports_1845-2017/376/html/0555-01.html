They brought separate actions in equity to enjoin the defendant school districts from carrying out the provisions of certain agreements made by and between the defendants and three other school districts establishing a joint secondary school, and from entering into and carrying out the terms of a proposed lease agreement between the school districts forming the joint school and the North Penn Joint School Authority of Montgomery County. Belief was asked for on the ground that the defendants’ participation in the proposed agreement of leasing and the performance of the joint school agreement would be violative of Article IX, Sections 8 and 10 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and of the <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>School Code. The defendants filed preliminary objections in the nature of demurrers in each case and attached thereto admittedly true and correct copies of the agreements referred to in the plaintiffs’ complaints. The learned chancellor sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaints, and from the decree entered in each case the present appeals are taken. The cases were argued in this Court at the same time and will be considered together as they were in the lower court.</p>

More specifically they contend that defendants’ demurrers were bad as speaking demurrers and that the lower court was in error in finding that a speaking demurrer is proper under the present Rules of Civil Procedure. While we cannot agree with this conclusion of the learned court below, we do not believe the preliminary objections in these cases may be adjudged speaking demurrers. The time honored principle that in passing on a demurrer a court cannot consider matters collateral to the pleading opposed but only such matters as arise out of the statement of claim or complaint itself, is still preserved under Pa. R. C. P. 1017. (See Goodrich-Am-ram Civil Practice §1017 (b) -11). In the instant case, the plaintiffs’ causes of action were predicated on the unconstitutionality and illegality of the agreements entered into and about to be entered into by the defendants. Since the plaintiffs averred the existence of these documents and relied on them to establish their claims, the defendants could properly annex the agreements to their demurrers for they were in every sense of the term factual matters arising out of the complaints themselves. The instruments formed the very foundation of the suits and were properly considex’ed by the <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>court below in determining whether the plaintiffs alleged any facts justifying the equitable relief sought.

The school districts caused the North Penn Joint School Authority to be incorporated and requested the Authority to make certain alterations and additions to the present Lansdale High School building with money borrowed by the Authority. A proposed lease agreement, dated as of October 1,1953, was drawn up whereby title to the buildings would be conveyed to the Authority, which in turn would lease the buildings to the school districts at an annual rental deemed sufficient to pay the interest and amortize the principal of bonds issued by the Authority.</p>

This was precisely the situation in the case of <em>Kelley v. Earle et al., </em>supra, and this Court in construing the lease, stated at p. 349: . . Here a capital asset, as it has been termed, is not received in the present, though payments on the lease are to be made from time to time. What the State is undertaking is not the outright purchase of an improvement, but a lease of an improvement on the payment of a moderate annual rental. The State pays as it goes and receives consideration for each payment as it falls due. There is no purchasing here on the credit of the future; for each payment made there is a present benefit to the State. . . .”. Although the lessees entered into an agreement among themselves as to how their respective interests in the property would be apportioned when the lease ended, this would in no way bind the lessor Authority, which was not a party to that agreement.</p>

The source of the receipt is not important. . . .”. In the case at hand the rentals will be sufficient to meet the principal and interest on the bonds and those rentals will be derived from the current revenue of the school districts. Complainants do not aver or contend that the current revenues of the school districts are insufficient in this regard. This method of financing was specifically approved in the <em>Greenhalgh </em>ease, where we said at p. 552 that “. . . a school building project under the instant Authority Act is self-liquidating if the annual rentals for the building, payable by <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>the School District from current revenues, are sufficient to discharge, over the period of years fixed by the lease, all debt service and the entire debt incurred by the lessor in the construction of the project. . . .”. The project being self-liquida ting within the definition promulgated by this Court, its legality is not tainted because there are other funds available for expediting the liquidation of the project.

Such contemplated future appropriation may lawfully be made, as hereinafter pointed out. The school districts are not obliged to sell, and a sale is a prerequisite to the appropriation. There is no pledge of capital assets. Under Section 19 of the lease, in the event of a default on the part of the school districts, the appointment of a receiver is provided for to take possession of the property conveyed for its operation and maintenance. The lease gives notice to the bondholders that they are to look to the rentals alone for their security.

L. 2188, 53 PS §2900z-10), the school districts are authorized to convey or pay over to any Authority any interest in real or personal property, or any funds available for building construction or improvement purposes.

The reasons assigned for the alleged invalidity are that the jointure was entered into pursuant to a county-wide plan for the merger of school districts which cannot be effected without submission to and approval of the electorate; that the jointure contract is vague and illusory and so indefinite in its terms as to be unenforceable, and that it is illegal and unenforceable in that it deprives future school directors indefinitely of the right to exercise their discretion in the management of school affairs.</p>

There is nothing in the School Code to prevent subsequent merger of school districts after their creation of a joint school. The question is what does the agreement between the districts create. Section 1701 of Article XYII of the Public School Code of 1949 provides, inter alia, that “The board of school directors in any two or more school districts may . . . establish, construct, equip, furnish, and maintain joint elementary public schools, high schools, consolidated schools or any other kind of schools or departments provided for in this act. . .</p>

Appellants concede, as they must, that the term “immediately” is not too indefinite for that would necessarily imply the date of the agreement itself. It is their contention that the language following the semicolon brings about the indefiniteness because it indicates the joint school will not begin to function until all buildings have been completed. We believe it is readily discernible that the joint school was to commence simultaneously with the execution of the agreement. Exactly when the joint school situs would be transferred to Lansdale could not be ascertained with certainty until construction was completed, but this factor in no way affected the contract’s validity, for the initial date of its operation was definitely established and its termination date was 20 years after the completion of the Lansdale improvements. It may be assumed that these improvements will be completed within a reasonable time, for the whole purpose of the jointure was to centralize the activities of the joint school at Lansdale. The fact that there is a provision for withdrawal by any school district 20 years after the completion of the Lansdale improvements indicates that the contract is thereafter no longer binding and this establishes a definite duration, subject to voluntary renewal. Therefore, it cannot be seriously contended that the jointure was to continue perpetually, and this is appellants’ complaint. Since the jointure was not to endure perpetually, it follows that the freedom of action of future boards is not improperly encroached upon for they have the power at the end of the period named in the agreement to continue or discontinue membership in the joint school.
