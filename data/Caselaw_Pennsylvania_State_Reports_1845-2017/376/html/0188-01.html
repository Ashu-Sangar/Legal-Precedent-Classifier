Its property ran for a distance of about 729 feet along Rugby Street and extended in depth toward Woolston Avenue for a distance of approximately 115 feet. In 1948 it constructed on its land a 15 foot driveway extending between Phil-Ellena Stréet. and Vernon Road and paralleling, at a distance therefrom of three feet, the boundary line between the Dratch property and the Woolston Avenue property to the rear. It then con<a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>structed 39 houses along the Rugby Street frontage and sold them to various home buyers, among whom were the present plaintiffs.

Plaintiffs claim that Dratch told them it was for their protection so that the occupants of the Woolston Avenue properties in the rear would not be able to use the driveway but would have to build a separate one for themselves. How plaintiffs would be better protected in that regard by having Dratch Construction Company retain title to the strip instead of deeding it to plaintiffs is not apparent. Dratch denies having made any such statement. In 1950 Dratch Construction Company sold and conveyed the three foot strip to Cora E. Milligan, who then owned the remaining half of the block, by a deed which contained the following grant: “Together with the free and common use, right, liberty and privilege of said Fifteen feet wide driveway as and for a passage<a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>way, driveway and watercourse at all times hereafter forever, for any buildings hereafter built by the purchaser, or nominee, his or her heirs and assigns, on Woolston Avenue between Yernon Road and PhilEllena Street or on the Northwesterly side of PhilEllena Street between Woolston Avenue and said Fifteen feet wide driveway, this use to be for its entire distance from Phil-Ellena Street to Yernon Road. . . .” In 1951 Cora E. Milligan conveyed the three foot strip together with all the rest of her ground to defendant Parkman Homes, Inc. by a deed which contained this same grant of the right to use the driveway. Parkman Homes, Inc. and defendant Fishman and Park, builders, began constructing houses along Woolston Avenue and, in connection with that operation, started using the driveway to bring in the necessary building materials. Thereupon plaintiffs filed a complaint in equity seeking an injunction to restrain those defendants from using or trespassing on the driveway and praying also that plaintiffs’ deeds be reformed by deleting therefrom the right reserved by Dratch Construction Company to grant the use of the driveway to any persons to whom it might thereafter convey all or any part of the remaining ground owned by it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court entered a decree granting their prayer to reform the deeds and issuing the injunction requested.

This language is not ambiguous, and it must therefore be construed according to its clear and literal terms and not as colored or amended by any oral conversations between Dratch and the plaintiffs or by any alleged intention of Dratch, secret or revealed.

    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.4",298,[241,899,1154,373]]]'>It is first to be noted that, as all the parties agree, the reservation of the right to grant the use of the driveway to persons becoming the purchasers of other ground owned by the grantor was not the reservation of a right to grant an easement in gross but only an easement as an appurtenance to such other ground: <em>Ulrich v. Grimes, </em><a href="/pa-super/94/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="94 Pa. Super. 313" data-case-ids="679918" data-case-paths="/pa-super/94/0313-01">94 Pa.

    <p id="b298-5" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[235,1285,1159,1091]]]'>What was the “remaining ground” then owned by the Dratch Construction Company? It owned the Bugby Street half of the block, and it is obvious that, as it sold off lots from out of this area to home buyers and gave to each of them an easement for the use of the 15 foot driveway over the properties of the other purchasers, it was naturally obliged to reserve in each deed the right to grant to such other purchasers the use of the driveway over the lot of the grantee in that particular deed. In addition to the Rugby Street ground remaining in its ownership Dratch Construction Company, having retained title thereto, owned the three foot strip to the rear of the driveway; therefore the use of the driveway — for what such easement might be worth — became appurtenant to that strip also. No other ground was owned then, or indeed at any later time, by Dratch Construction ■ Company, and therefore to no other, ground than as thus státed did the reservation of the right to grant the use of the driveway apply.</p>
    <p id="b299-3" data-blocks='[["BL_299.3",299,[175,336,1151,1408]]]'>
      <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>Did the acquisition by Cora E. Milligan of the title to the three foot strip, thereby adding it to her ownership of the half of the block fronting on Woolston Avenue, entitle her to the use of the driveway as an appurtenance not only to that strip but to all such other ground? In the deed to her from Dratch Construction Company it undertook to grant the use of the driveway “for any buildings hereafter built by the purchaser, or nominee, his or her heirs and assigns, on Woolston Avenue. . . .” But did it have the right to make such a grant and did Cora E. Milligan have the right in turn to convey it to defendants? Clearly, the answer to that question must be in the negative. It is elementary law that an easement cannot be extended by the owner of the dominant tenement to other land owned by him adjacent to or beyond the land to which it is appurtenant,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> for such an extension would constitute an unreasonable increase of the burden of the servient tenement. It is clear, therefore, that these defendants had no right to use the driveway for the purpose of their operations in connection with the building of houses on Woolston Avenue, nor do the purchasers of the lots on Woolston Avenue have any such right by virtue of their ownership and occupancy of those lots and the buildings thereon.</p>

      <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>The Parkman defendants contend that the' court should not have granted the injunction because they have been constructing houses on Woolston Avenue at a cost of over $400,000 and because it will be a great hardship on the purchasers of those houses to be obliged to construct a driveway of their own on the rear of their properties, whereas the benefit that the plaintiffs will derive from the injunction is comparatively slight. Since, however, plaintiffs have a right of property it makes no difference that the right may be insignificant in value to them as compared with the advantages that would accrue to defendants from its violation. Even though greater injury may result from granting than refusing an injunction, a plaintiff is entitled thereto if the defendant’s act is tortious: <em>Sullivan v.

Defendants also invoke the doctrine of laches, but they did not begin to construct the houses on Woolston Avenue and to use the driveway until the end of February, 1952 and plaintiffs filed the present complaint in equity only sis weeks later, so there is no ground for an accusation against them of undue delay.</p>

      <em>for the purpose of better protecting them. </em>Such a contention is absurd. Dratch, as the owner and common grantor, could have reserved, as has been done thousands of times before, the right to grant the use of this driveway to others in each deed it made to the purchaser of each of its lots fronting on Rugby Street, without the necessity of reserving to itself the title to a 3 foot strip of land or any land whatsoever. The majority opinion points out that plaintiffs’ contention is unreasonable and absurd; yet strangely decides that that is what the reservation in effect meant. The majority hold that the developer (grantor) who owned Ihe 3 foot strip, even if it bought the property adjoining the 3 foot strip, could not allow subsequent purchasers of that property to use the driveway. The effect of the majority’s opinion is to make the ownership and reservation of the 3 foot strip — with its right to grant to a subsequent purchaser the use of the 15 foot driveway — absolutely useless, meaningless and absurd, for it is obvious and indisputable (1) that no building of any kind could be erected on a 3 foot strip of land; and (2) that the grantor, <em>by viHue of owning the remaining ground with Rugby Street frontage, </em>could grant such easement to all subsequent purchasers of that land without reserving to itself the oAvnership of this 3 foot strip of land. What possible use was there, therefore, for this 3 foot strip of land except the use contended for by Dratch and the other defendants herein? What possible good could that 3 foot strip of land be to Dratch if it did not intend either (a) to purchase the ground on the other side of the 3 foot strip which fronted on Woolston Avenue, divide it into lots and allow the purchasers thereof to use this driA^eAvay, or (b) to sell the 3 foot strip to the owner or owners of the adjoining contiguous land, granting him or them in turn the right to use the <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>driveway. Any other construction is so unreasonable as to be unbelievable. This reservation is explicit and clear as crystal. Where a contract is clear, its meaning must be ascertained by the Court from its language; it must receive a reasonable interpretation; and if it is susceptible of two interpretations, a construction will not be adopted which is unreasonable or absurd or which will produce a result that is unreasonable or absurd.

Furthermore, the fallacy of applying such a principle to the facts in the instant case is, on analysis, clear, because the burden is not <em>increased </em>by this extension, <em>for </em>(according to the majority) <em>no burden can exist at all </em>by virtue of the 3 foot strip ownership. Moreover, when an easement is granted or reserved, the fact that the burden of the servient tenement will be increased by future use is immaterial if the language of the grant or reservation is broad enough to permit, as here, such use.</p>
