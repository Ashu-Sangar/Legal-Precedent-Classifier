The plaintiffs were paying passengers of the defendant railroad company. The plaintiffs sued the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for injuries sustained when the train collided with a truck, heavily laden with steel at Wolf’s <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>Crossing.

In refusing judgment n.o.v. the Supreme Court said at pages 512; 513: . . But the question still remains — considering the fog and the position of the truck when the flasher lights went on, was the defendant’s warning timely and sufficient?’. <em>. </em>. If plaintiff’s evidence clearly showed that the truck driver saw the flasher lights and ignored them, the railroad would have given timely and sufficient warning of the train’s approach, the negligence of the truck driver would have been the proximate cause of the accident, and the Railroad Company would be entitled to a judgment n.o.v. The evidence on this point was confused, but we believe was sufficient to allow the jury to legitimately infer that the flasher lights could not have been seen by the truck driver; and therefore the court below properly refused defendant’s motion for judgment n.o.v.’</p>

S. Highway Route 36 in the westerly outskirts in the town of Uhrichsville, Ohio, came up behind a truck of the defendants’ in a thick [very dense] fog and followed it for a distance of two to three miles at a speed of ten to twenty miles an hour until it approached Wolf’s Crossing. The highway at this-point runs north and south and the railroad east and west. The highway and the railroad meet at an angle of <em>24 </em>degrees 30 minutes. There are two railroad tracks and the eastbound train was on the second or southerly track. The truck flashed the rear marker lights signaling stop and did stop at a point before entering the tracks beyond the point of the flasher lights, at which time the flasher lights began to operate. The driver of the truck looked both ways and started the truck proceeding in creeper gear. The train was being operated at a speed of 70 to 75 miles an hour and activated the flasher lights at a distance 3510 feet from the crossing. The truck proceeded over the crossing and when at a point on the east-bound southern track was struck by the train causing a blinding flash. No hell or whistle or any warning device was given by the train prior to the collision. The area was blanketed by a thick fog. The distance from the flasher signal on the north side of the crossing to the east bound track is a distance of 71 feet. The usual speed of the train at this point was 60 miles an hour. The red flasher lights were 21 candle power and the headlight of the locomotive was 550,000 candle power. The locomotive headlight could be seen when it was a <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>distance of about 75 feet from the crossing. The jury could have found from all the evidence that the driver of the truck had passed the first flashing signal before it commenced to flash. There was no evidence why the truck driver could not see the flashing signal on the other side of the tracks. There is no question of contributory negligence involved in these cases.</p>

Mr. Lewis was a bus driver for the Pennsylvania-Greyhound lines operating a bus on a run from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Columbus, Ohio through Uhriehsville, Ohio, a town two and one-half or three miles from Wolf’s Crossing. He testified that when he was leaving the western city limits of Uhriehsville he saw a truck loaded with steel. He drove behind it going about 10 to 20 miles per hour through a dense thick fog. The lights were on the bus and the truck as both proceeded on Route 36. When he came up to the crossing the flasher lights were working, and the truck driver, at about the same instant, flashed his marker lights indicating he was going to stop. The truck made a dead stop. Mr. Lewis could see the driver in the cab looking both ways and then proceed across the track when a blinding flash occurred. <em>. . . ‘Q. </em>About how far were you from the track where the train came at the time that this signal went on? ... A. I figure I was back 150 feet from the crossing, the nearest rail to me approximately 150 feet. That would be the north bound rail. I figure that is about how far I was back. . . . Q. Now, Mr. Lewis, can you tell us whether that truck when it stopped was between you and the flasher lights or not? A. I don’t know whether it was between me and the flasher lights or not. Q. Can you tell whether that truck when it stopped was short of the railroad tracks or was on the railroad tracks? A. I said it was somewhere short of <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>the tracks between me and the railroad tracks.’ . . . 'Q. Mr. Lewis, when your bus was brought to a stop and the truck stopped you weren’t able to tell whether the cab of the tractor had passed the flasher lights or not, were you? A. No. I don’t know where his cab was with respect to that.’... 'Q. How much distance did you say was between the front of your bus and the rear of the trailer when you were both stopped? A. Well, I estimated about 32 to 35 feet, a bus length. Q. Didn’t you at the previous trial of this case testify as follows: wasn’t the following question asked you and didn’t you make this answer: “Q. About how far would you say, Mr. Lewis, that you were from the track that the train was on at the time you came to a stop? A. Approximately 125 feet. Q. About how far in front of you was the truck when you came to a stop there? A. Oh, I would say about 75 feet to 100. Q. About 75 feet to 100 in front of you? A. Yes. Q. Did if stop? Which stopped 'first, the truck or your car? A. I would say we both stopped momentarily, about the same time.’ ” 'Did you testify to that effect in the prior trial? A. I can’t remember, but if I did I just gave them as estimates. Q. Would you say that that testimony that you gave at the former trial, is that a correct statement? A. Approximately the feet I gave is about right, yes.’</p>

I would estimate two bus lengths, about 75 feet.’ . . . 'Q. It could have been a little less, might have been 100 feet, is that correct? A. Yes. Q.
