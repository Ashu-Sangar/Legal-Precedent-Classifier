This action of the court was not in pursuance of its appellate jurisdiction because there was no entry of judgment on the verdict by the court bélow and therefore no judgment from which an appeal could have been taken. But the court, after calling attention to its powers of the King’s Bench, said (pp. 127, 128, A. p. 460) that since, under the Acts of 1722 and 1836, it could “minister justice to all persohs,” it could thus protect the rights of the defendant “by speedy and summary interposition.” And in <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>

Defendant’s petition alleged that physicians appointed by the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania advised that court that defendant’s condition would not permit him to withstand the strain of a trial, as the result of which his case was severed from that of his co-defendants, and it was for that reason that he has not been brought to trial for alleged violation of the federal Smith Act. The petition further pointed out that although defendant was convicted in August, 1951, he was not called for sentence in the court below until November, 1953, although he was at all times available for sentence dur<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>ing that intervening period of more than two years, but in September, 1953, he suffered a stroke due either to an embolism or a coronary thrombosis and it appears that he is at present a patient in the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York. Under such circumstances defendant should be at least entitled to prove the allegations in support of his petition by the testimony of the competent authorities of the Rockefeller Institute Hospital as to whether it is true that he would be in grave danger of a fatal heart attack should imposition of sentence upon him be insisted upon prior to bis discharge from that institution.
