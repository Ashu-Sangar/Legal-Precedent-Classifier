One suit was brought by the operator of a tractor-trailer for personal injuries sustained by him, and the other by its owner for damages to the vehicle. In the latter action, defendants joined the operator as an additional defendant. Verdicts were rendered in favor of both plaintiffs. A third verdict was also rendered in favor of the operator as the additional defendant in the owner’s case. Defendants filed motions for judgment n.o.v. and new trial, which were dismissed by the Court en banc. Prom the judgments entered on the verdicts, defendants now appeal.</p>

    <p id="b331-7" data-blocks='[["BL_331.9",331,[182,1619,1147,322]]]'>Plaintiff Brusis was operating on November 4, 1949 at about 12:30 o’clock A.M. a tractor-trailer owned by plaintiff States in an easterly direction on Street Hoad, Bucks County, Pa. The vehicle at its widest point was 7% feet wide and 42 to 45 feet long over all. The gross weight of the loaded vehicle was 30,500 pounds.</p>
    <p id="b331-8" data-blocks='[["BL_331.10",331,[182,1952,1146,374]],["BL_332.1",332,[247,350,1155,1863]]]'>Street Road is a macadam paved highway eighteen feet in width bounded on each side by dirt shoulders or berms. Brusis was traveling at a speed of about twenty-five miles an hour as he approached a curve bearing to his left. When one hundred to one hundred fifty feet from the curve, he saw an automobile without lights parked at the curve partly on the paved por<a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>tion of the highway and partly on the south shoulder. Brusis swung the tractor-trailer to the left and in passing the car, drove off the road on to the berm on the north or left side and immediately felt the left front wheel of the tractor sink in the shoulder, which he said was soft mud. The left front wheel started to sway and swing. Brusis, trying to get off the berm, kept his foot on the gas for a distance of approximately 50 feet when he crashed into a utility pole on the berm, with the result that the tractor-trailer turned over and Brusis was injured. The defendants, in order to install a ten inch gas pipe, had been excavating and back-filling a trench along the north berm of Street Road for a distance of about 8 miles. The trench was 18 inches wide and the southern edge was 15 inches to 2 feet north of the paved portion of the highway. The trench had been properly filled in by defendants 30 days prior to the accident. Plaintiff’s witness, who was in charge of this work for the Commonwealth, testified that defendant had placed (a) “Road under Construction” signs along the entire route, and (b) signs along this 8 mile highway every 200 feet with the words “Soft Shoulders” printed thereon, so that they could be easily seen by vehicles approaching on the right side of the road where the pipe was laid. This evidence must be disregarded because the plaintiff himself said he saAV no signs. The paved portion of Street Road has a Avhite center line which divides the highAvay for eastbound and Avestbound traffic and is, we repeat, 18 feet in Avidth. Even if the parked car had not been parked partly on the berm, it Avould have left ample space for a carefully driven tractor-trailer to pass by on the other side of the macadam paved highway.</p>
