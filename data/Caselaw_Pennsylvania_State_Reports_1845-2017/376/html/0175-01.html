    <p id="b281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_281.6",281,[182,416,1147,372]]]'>Appellant-plaintiffs are the owners of six parcels of ground situate on the east side of Stenton Avenue at its intersection with the north side of Johnson Street in the City of Philadelphia. The lots have a total frontage of 185 feet and a depth of 100 feet. Plaintiffs sought and were refused a variance — hence this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.7",281,[183,803,1146,486]]]'>Plaintiffs purchased this property on March 30, 1935, at which time it was and still is zoned “C” Residential. Under “C” Residential Zoning, the land can be used for detached or semi-detached dwellings or multiple dwellings. Plaintiffs sought a variance in order to erect six 2-story structures on this property, the ground floor of each to be used for (a variety of) commercial retail stores, with a second floor to be used as an apartment for a single family dwelling.</p>
    <p id="b281-6" data-blocks='[["BL_281.8",281,[184,1302,1148,426]]]'>The east side of Stenton Avenue between Johnson Street and Barringer Street (the southern half of which is owned by plaintiffs) is a big vacant lot overgrown with weeds. On the rear of plaintiffs’ property is a driveway about 10 feet wide, and beyond the driveway new attractive houses have been built on the remaining portion of this large block. All of this entire city block is zoned “C” Residential.</p>
    <p id="b281-7" data-blocks='[["BL_281.9",281,[187,1743,1144,364]]]'>The west side of Stenton Avenue, between Johnson Street and Barringer Street, was rezoned Commercial “A” on December 1, 1944, and a number of commercial stores have been erected in this block. To the north, on the east side of Stenton Avenue, across Barringer Street are residences and the zoning is “C” Residential.</p>

This contention overlooks the fact that plaintiffs will be compensated for the value of their property if and when taken.</p>
    <p id="b282-4" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[251,859,1151,200]]]'>Two years ago City Council either refused or failed, after request, to change the zoning of the square or block in which is located plaintiffs’ property, from Residential to Commercial.</p>
    <p id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.5",282,[249,1078,1156,483]]]'>Because of the confusion which permeated this case on the subject of rezoning it may be wise to point out that this is not an attempt to or petition or proceeding to “rezone” the property, but merely to obtain “a variance” which the Board of Adjustment and in turn the Court of Common Pleas have power to grant where unnecessary hardship is proved or in cases of practical necessity where the reasons are substantial, serious and compelling.</p>

The Board of Adjustment refused to grant a variance among other reasons (1) because of the proximity of new dwellings to the rear of plaintiffs’ property, believing that the commercial activities would be noisy, dirty and possibly odorous; (2) because plaintiffs’ proposed plan would violate the set-back requirements from Johnson Street and the open-air requirements on another street, and thus cut off light and air from the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>dwellings surrounding appellants’ property; (3) because the erection of additional stores with insufficient parking space on already heavily trafficked Stenton Avenue, would greatly increase the already hazardous traffic situation; (4) because the variance would be unfair to surrounding property owners who had built their residences and developed their property as residential in accordance with the zoning requirements; and (5) because plaintiffs proved nothing but a large financial hardship.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[178,896,1151,1306]]]'>Plaintiffs appealed from the refusal of the Zoning Board of Adjustment to grant the variance, to the Court of Common Pleas, which took additional testimony. The Court of Common Pleas had the power to hear the appeal and likewise had the power to hear evidence and to make such decision as, under the evidence and the applicable principles of law, was just and proper: <em>Rolling Green Golf Club Case, </em><a href="/pa/374/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="374 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1241461" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0450-01">374 Pa. 450</a>, 458, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.2d%20523" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="97 A.2d 523">97 A. 2d 523</a>; <em>Dooling’s Windy Hill v.

The lower Court affirmed the action of the Board of Adjustment and dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal. The lower Court pointed out that there must be a line of demarcation somewhere between commercial stores and residential properties; that Stenton Avenue was a wide street, and the fact that stores were allowed on one side did not justify the erection, of stores on the other side of the street in a neighborhood which was still residential; and the fact that appellants could sell their land at a far higher price if the zoning were changed or if a variance was granted was not an unnecessary hardship or a sufficient reason to grant the variance) See: <em>Junge’s Appeal (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa-super/89/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="89 Pa.

The power to authorize such a variance is to be sparingly exercised and only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances, for otherwise there would be little left of the zoning lav/ to protect public rights; prospective purchasers of property would hesitate if confronted by a tribunal which could arbitrarily set aside the zoning provisions designed to establish standards of occupancy in the neighborhood. Indeed, if such power were to be interpreted as a grant to the board of the right to amend or depart from the terms of the. ordinance at its uncontrolled will and pleasure, it might well be challenged as being an unconstitutional - delegation of legislative authority to a -purely administrative tribunal.”</p>
