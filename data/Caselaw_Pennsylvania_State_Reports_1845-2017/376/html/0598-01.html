A trial court must give reasons for its action. Conclusions alone, such as “interests of justice”, are insufficient: <em>Beal v. Reading Company, </em><a href="/pa/370/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="370 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="1234511" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0045-01">370 Pa. 45</a>, 49, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20214" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="87 A.2d 214">87 A. 2d 214</a>.</p>

See <em>Harris v. Ruggles Lumber Company, </em><a href="/pa/376/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="376 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="1246153" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0252-01">376 Pa. 252</a>, 254, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20917" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="101 A.2d 917">101 A. 2d 917</a>. When such a reason is assigned, it is the duty of an appellate court to examine the testimony in order to determine whether or not the court abused its discretion. In <em>Decker v. Kulesza, </em><a href="/pa/369/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="369 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1232396" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0259-01">369 Pa. 259</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20413" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="85 A.2d 413">85 A. 2d 413</a>, the reason given by the court below for granting a new trial was that the verdict was against- the weight of the evidence. Mr. Justice Chidsey said (p. 263) : “While an award'of a new- trial is an inherent poAver of the court and its exercise a matter of discretion, the discretion is not an absolute one and it is the duty of this Court to review and -determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion : [citing cases] ... .” The judgment in that case was reversed because of the conflicting testimony;-the issue Yas for the jury.'

The allegation of negligence was the assertion “that the rubber matting on the step”, in which the wife-plaintiff caught her foot and was thrown to the ground, “was loose and defective”. The accident occurred on a clear morning, at about 8 o’clock. When the bus stopped at Mt. Pleasant Avenue and Lincoln Drive, in Philadelphia, the wife-plaintiff proceeded to get off. In descending the steps she caught her heel. There were only three other passengers on the bus besides the driver. All were called to testify at the trial. For the plaintiffs there is only the wife’s own uncorroborated and vague testimony. She asserted that the alleged imperfection in the rubber matting was on the top of the steps. She marked a cross on the photograph exhibited at the trial which showed the location of the allegedly defective mat to be on the <em>floor </em>of the bus at the doorway. The bus driver was called to testify for the plaintiffs as under cross-examination. He said the matting was in good condition. He was asked what the scuff marks were on the risers of each of the steps. In answer to this question he said “That is where people catch their heels getting out”. He thus clearly indicated that the heels of the passengers, in alighting from the bus, sometimes rub up against the back of the step causing the scuff marks. He further testified: “I said they catch their feet, the risers on the back of the steps rub against <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>the heels, rub against the risers on the back of the steps and that [the risers in the photograph] is what you are showing me”. Appellants would have us construe this testimony as corroborating the wife-plaintiff’s testimony. But the wife-plaintiff definitely asserted the alleged defect was on the <em>top of the stairs </em>while the driver testified about the condition of the risers <em>of the steps </em>where there was no evidence of a defective condition.</p>
    <p id="b706-4" data-blocks='[["BL_706.4",706,[231,842,1157,707]]]'>The testimony given by the plaintiff, in her attempt to prove that the rubber mat was worn and shredded, was unconvincing. The testimony of all the other witnesses indicated the facts to be otherwise. Sufficient doubt was raised as to the factual strength of the plaintiff’s case to justify the trial court to award a new trial. Two of the passengers and the driver testified that the rubber mat was in good condition. The other passenger testified that she did not see anything wrong. Only one passenger actually saw the wife-plaintiff stumble and catch the pole near the door. No one but plaintiff herself testified that the rubber matting was permitted to exist in a negligent state.</p>
    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.5",706,[230,1561,1153,153]]]'>From a review of the entire record, it is clear that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in. ordering a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b706-6" data-blocks='[["BL_706.6",706,[300,1727,452,34]]]'>The order is affirmed.</p>
