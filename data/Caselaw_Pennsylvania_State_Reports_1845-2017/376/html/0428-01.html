Chief Justice Kephart, speaking for an unanimous Court, at p. 573 said: “As a basis for appointment it is <em>not unreasonable </em>to select war veterans from candidates for office and to give them a certain credit in recognition of the discipline, experience and service represented by their military activity. <em>No one should deny that these advantages are. conducive to the better performance of public duties, where discipline, loyalty, and public spirit are lilcetoisé essential. . . </em>.”.

In the <em>O’Neill </em>case it was held unconstitutional to prefer veterans over nonveterans for advancement to higher public positions as distinguished from original appointments, because it placed too high a valuation on past military service, and, through loss of incentive on the part of nonveteran employes equally skilled and qualified for promotion, the preference created was in fact prejudicial to the public service. The Act of 1935 now under consideration cannot be said to appreciably affect the incentive of other employes. They enjoy, presently and potentially, the same positional status and efficiency rating as the reservists, with equal opportunity for advancement. Since we held in the <em>Schmid </em>case that preference to veterans as to initial appointments as to government employment was justified because the advantages of discipline, experience and service incident to the past military activity of veterans could be expected to enure to the benefit of the public, clearly it must be held that the <em>current </em>intensive military training of a reservist similarly contributes to his efficiency as a public employe. And since the taxpayer thus benefits, the two weeks of military training granted to reservists without loss of pay cannot be held to be a mere gratuity falling within the prohibition of Section 18 of Article III of the Constitution. ;</p>

The public had no assurance of benefiting from his military experience.

In the opinion of the Court in the <em>Kurts </em>case it is stated: “. . . As nearly every individual is subject to occasional illness, sick leaves become an inevitable incident to all employment. If the state as an employer chooses to grant such leave with pay, for limited periods (such laws are usually for ten days or two weeks annually) this action does not involve an unconstitutional misuse of public funds. When a person enters into the service of the state at a weekly or annual salary he contracts to give his employer all the service required of him during working days, subject only to occasional interruptions by the illnesses common to man. Vacations and sick leaves reasonable in length of time, without deduction of pay, are now generally recognized as implied in contracts of public employment. If vacation and sick leave with pay were unreasonably protracted in duration they would justify the charge that public funds were being illegally used in payment for services not performed. Such leaves would be particularly offensive to the constitution if they were granted to <em>special classes </em>of employees, <em>with no reciprocal benefit to the state”.</em>

Unusual circumstances, as used in this rule shall be construed to mean that tbe services of tbe employe at a time other than during bis vacation are so essential to tbe National Defense that it would be in tbe best interests of our country to authorize special leave with fiill salary for two weeks.”.

This contention is principally based upon the general repealer in the School Code that “All other acts and parts of acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed.”. The Public School Code is a codification of laws pertaining to the public schools. It cannot be seriously contended that every matter pertaining directly or indirectly to the administration of the public schools has been embraced therein. To so hold would have destructive effect upon many general laws, the import and effective scope of which embrace larger fields than that of a school district or municipality or other political subdivision of the State. Such is the Act of 1935. It applies as a matter of public policy to all public employes. The Act of 1935 is neither specifically nor by implication repealed by the 1949 School Code, and the powers under the latter Act relied upon by the defendant must be exercised in conformity with the provisions of the former.</p>
