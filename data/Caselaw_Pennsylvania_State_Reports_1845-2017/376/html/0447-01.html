L. 1258, 53 PS §10201.1 et seq., the City Treasurer sold for unpaid taxes and the City purchased the property of one Hinnau. The period of redemption having passed, the City agreed to sell the property to one Yolpe, and under the provisions of the Act petitioned the court to confirm the sale free of all claims against it. The Commonwealth has of record several liens against Hinnau for unpaid unemployment compensation contributions approximating $4,000 and asserts priority and continuation of lien.</p>

L. 343, 72 PS §1401, which states that “whenever the . . . property of a . . . person shall be sold at a judicial sale, all taxes, interest, bonus, penalties and public accounts due the Commonwealth shall first be allowed and paid out of the proceeds of such sale before any judgment, mortgage or any other claim or lien against such . . . person.” It further contends that the provisions of the Act under which ¡the tax sale was had provide for divestiture of the Commonwealth’s claims as against local taxes. This latter is on the theory that the purpose of the statute is to liquidate “tax sick” properties; that the Commonwealth must proceed to establish its claim, <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>and failing to do so, the court must direct a conveyance under the provisions set forth herein.</p>

It may be trae, as contended by the City, that the “very purpose of this statute is to liquidate ‘tax sick’ properties and again place them on the tax rolls.” However, that purpose is not at all determinative of the problem presented here. “Generally speaking, a judicial sale of real estate divests all prior and subsequent liens on the property sold, unless preserved by statute or are by nature incapable of discharge . . . <em>However liens in favor of the Commonwealth are only divested to the extent permitted by statute: Commonwealth v.
