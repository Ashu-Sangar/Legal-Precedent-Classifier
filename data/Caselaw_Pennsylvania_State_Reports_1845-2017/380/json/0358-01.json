Since the findings are supported by the evidence and were confirmed by the court en banc, they are binding upon us. As a consequence, the legal question, which the appellant advances, is not germane to the present record. The opinion of the late President Judge Smith for the court below fully justifies that court\u2019s findings and conclusions.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.",
