The case boils down to a question of fact, namely, the location of an ancient boundary line. Defendants\u2019 evidence in support of their claim was not only adequate to support the Trial Judge\u2019s findings of fact, but was far stronger and more eohvincing than that produced by plaintiffs to support their claim.\nThe judgment in favor of- the defendants is'affirmed on the Opinion of President Judge Carr.",
