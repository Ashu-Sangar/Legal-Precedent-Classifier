The present Chief Justice there said: “Paragraph 20 reads as follows: ‘From April 1, 1949, to January 1, 1951, upon any sale of the real estate of which the herein demised premises are a part, this Lease may be lawfully terminated, at the sole option of the Landlord, by giving to the Tenant six months’ notice in writing of such termination. . . .’</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[160,1023,1148,1094]]]'>“3. The word ‘upon’ in the phrase ‘upon any sale of the real estate’ is quite obviously used to denote, not time, but a condition precedent. When an event is certain to occur the word ‘upon’ is synonymous with the word ‘when’ or ‘thereupon’; for example, ‘upon my death my children shall receive my library’. Where however, the happening of the event is contingent or uncertain the word ‘upon’ has ordinarily the meaning of ‘if’ or ‘on condition that’; for example, ‘upon my surviving my children my brother shall receive my library’; see Little v. Wilcox, <a href="/pa/119/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="119 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="558084" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0439-01">119 Pa. 439</a>, 447, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.%20468" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="13 A. 468">13 A. 468</a>, 474. So here, ‘upon any sale of the real estate’ means, not when, but if any such sale occurs, that being the condition upon which alone the lessor was to have the right to terminate the lease; there is nothing in the use of the word ‘upon’ which suggests that the phrase ‘upon any sale of the real estate’ was intended to relate back grammatically to the designation of the period during which the lease might be terminated.”</p>
