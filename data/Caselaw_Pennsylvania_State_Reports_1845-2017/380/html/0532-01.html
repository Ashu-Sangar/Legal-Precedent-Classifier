The principal evidence adduced by the Commonwealth in support of the bookmaking charge consisted of certain telephone conversations between defendant and one Manduchi which were intercepted by two police officers of the City of Lancaster who had placed a tap on the telephone wire leading into Manduchi’s apartment. These officers testified, over objection, as to the contents of the conversations they thus overheard and which revealed that defendant received and accepted horse race bets from Manduchi. The latter’s apartment was at 715 North Duke Street, Lancaster, and the telephone calls were from there to defendant’s apartment at 122 North Queen Street, also in that city. The court refused defendant’s motion for a new trial and the Superior Court affirmed the judgment; (<a href="/pa-super/176/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="176 Pa.

Therefore the interception of telephonic communications is not illegal nor are the overheard conversations inadmissible in evidence unless prohibited by statute: <em>Olmstead v. United States, </em><a href="/us/277/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="277 U.S. 438" data-case-ids="3903035" data-case-paths="/us/277/0438-01">277 U. S. 438</a>, 464-468. It is by Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act of June 19, 1934, c. 652, <a href="/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%201103" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="48 Stat. 1103">48 Stat. 1103</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7605" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="47 U.S.C. §605">47 U.S.C.A. §605</a>, that such a prohibition was effected. That Section provides in substance that no person receiving or transmitting, or assisting in receiving or transmitting, any interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio shall divulge or publish the contents thereof to any person other than the addressee, or use the same or any information therein contained for his own benefit or for the benefit of another not entitled thereto, and no person having become acquainted with the contents of the same, knowing that such information was so obtained, shall divulge or publish the contents thereof or use the <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>same or any information therein contained for his own benefit or for the benefit of another not entitled thereto. These provisions, therefore, prohibit employes of communication agencies from divulging any interstate or foreign communications. But the portion of the Section from which the present problem arises is as follows: “and no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person.”</p>
    <p id="b565-3" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[140,953,1153,700]]]'>Two questions soon arose as to the scope of this provision. The first was whether the phrase “no person” embraced federal agents engaged in the detection of crime, and whether “divulging” included the giving of testimony in a federal court as to the contents of an intercepted communication. In <em>Wardone v. United States, </em><a href="/us/302/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="302 U.S. 379" data-case-ids="6141044" data-case-paths="/us/302/0379-01">302 U. S. 379</a>, it was argued that such general words as “no person” should not be held to include the sovereign and apply to federal officers, but the court held to the contrary and also that the prohibition against divulging the contents of intercepted messages banned the giving of testimony in regard thereto in a federal court.</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[138,1675,1151,655]],["BL_566.1",566,[254,341,1156,203]]]'>The second question was whether the prohibition against interception applied to intrastate as well as interstate and foreign communications. In <em>Weiss v. United States, </em><a href="/us/308/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="308 U.S. 321" data-case-ids="6139912" data-case-paths="/us/308/0321-01">308 U. S. 321</a>, a policeman in New York City acting under instructions of a United States Post Office Inspector, tapped telephone wires over a period of months; the intercepted messages consisted of both intrastate and interstate communications. The court stated that, since Congress had power, when necessary for the protection of interstate commerce, to regulate intrastate transactions, there was no constitutional requirement that the scope of this statute be limited so <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>as to exclude intrastate communications, and accordingly it held that none of the intercepted messages were admissible in evidence in a criminal prosecution in the Federal court.</p>
    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[251,572,1159,1598]]]'>In the present case there were <em>no </em>interstate communications, all the telephoning between defendant and Manduchi taking place within the City of Lancaster. There may be some room to doubt, therefore, whether the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce extends to such a situation, or, if so, whether the decision in the <em>Weiss </em>case was intended to be broad enough to include the interception of purely local messages. Be that as it may, however, the more important question is whether State agents engaged in the detection of a State crime and testifying in a State court are included within the intended scope of Section 605 of the Act. It is the contention of appellant that they are so included and that therefore they not only commit a crime when they <em>intercept </em>a communication but an additional crime when they <em>divulge </em>it by testimony in court; accordingly he argues that for the court to allow them to give such testimony is practically to sanction and condone the commission of a criminal offense in its very presence, and therefore, even though their testimony be relevant to the determination of the guilt or innocence of the person on trial, it should not be received under such circumstances. Appellant would thus distinguish the search and seizure cases previously referred to on the ground that there the witness merely testified to the information gained by a crime already committed but did not commit another crime in and through the very act of testifying.</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[251,2183,1155,155]],["BL_567.1",567,[150,346,1155,1772]],["BL_568.1",568,[234,336,1155,871]]]'>In our opinion Section 605 of the Act was not intended to, and does not, relate to the divulging of the contents of intercepted communications by State agents <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>testifying in the criminal prosecution of a State crime in a State court. In <em>Schwartz v. Texas, </em><a href="/us/344/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="344 U.S. 199" data-case-ids="11299429" data-case-paths="/us/344/0199-01">344 U. S. 199</a>, it was held that the Section applies only to the exclusion in federal court proceedings of evidence obtained and sought to be divulged in violation thereof, but does not exclude such evidence in State court proceedings. When it is borne in mind that an intention of Congress to supersede or suspend the exercise of the police powers of the States, even when it has the power to do so, is not to be implied unless its purpose to effect that result is clearly manifested, <em>(Reid v. Colorado, </em><a href="/us/187/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="187 U.S. 137" data-case-ids="6137936" data-case-paths="/us/187/0137-01">187 U. S. 137</a>, <em>148; Atchison, Topeka &amp; Sante Fe Rwy. Co. v. Railroad Commission of California, </em><a href="/us/283/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="283 U.S. 380" data-case-ids="434082" data-case-paths="/us/283/0380-01">283 U. S. 380</a>, 392, 393), it would seem quite incredible that Congress intended by the phraseology it employed in Section 605 to interfere with those police powers and thereby prevent the States not only from seeking to detect the commission of crime but even possibly to prevent it. It would seem likewise incredible that Congress could have intended to make it a crime for a State agent to testify in a State court to intercepted telephonic communications and thus, in effect, while on the one hand admitting the existence of the power in the States to receive such evidence, on the other making it practically impossible for such testimony to be given. And since the <em>Schwarts </em>case holds that notwithstanding the prohibition of Section 605 State agents <em>may </em>divulge the contents of intercepted communications in testimony in a State court, the inescapable inference is that the provision in that Section that “no person shall divulge” such communications does not include State agents in the phrase “no person.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Such interpreta<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>tion is in accord with the well established rule of statutory construction that the literal terms of a statute not only may, but must be limited in their application where a consideration of the whole legislation indicates that such was the intention of the framers: <em>United States v. Kirby, </em>7 Wallace (74 U. S.) 482, 486, 487; <em>Church of the Holy Trinity v.

Thus in the last-named case, where an Act of Congress provided that “No property ... of . . . any national of either such country [Germany or Japan] . . . shall be returned to former owners thereof .. . ,” it was ruled, notwithstanding the inclusiveness of the term <em>“any </em>national,” that it should be held applicable only to <em>some </em>German “nationals,” namely, those who were enemies.</p>

The State of New York having provided, by Constitution and statute, certain specific methods by which it may exercise its fundamental power of gathering evidence of criminality and of prosecuting crime, it surely is not to be assumed that Congress intended to circumscribe that power unless it unequivocally indicated such an intent.

That the highest tribunal in this Commonwealth should countenance a situation so opposed to the creed of freedom is to me as incomprehensible as it is deplorable.

There is no difference in principle between a communication which is reduced to writing and one which is mechanically recorded by some other medium. If the Constitution protects the message which a citizen has committed to paper, why should it deny him protection for the same message which he commits to a wire? As no one has the right to bore through the walls of his neighbor’s house to listen to his conversation, so also he has no right to draw the same information from a cable which originates in that neighbor’s dwelling. Breaking into a citizen’s house and taking away an article which may be used against him is but a slight invasion of privacy as compared to taking away all his private utterances, his intimate observations, his spoken aspirations, etc., etc. Had the telephone been invented prior to 1873, I do not doubt that the Constitutional Convention which met in Philadelphia that year would have so written Section 8 of Article I of the Pennsylvania Constitution as to guarantee citizens protection from unreasonable searches regardless as to how perpetrated — by door-<a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>breaking, window-smashing, or wire-tapping.

On September 21, 1951, two police officers, Albert Farkas and Thomas Williams, descended into the basement oí the apartment house at 715 North Duke Street, Lancaster, and attached a wire-tap to the telephone line serving Richard Manduchi who lived on the first floor. On that day and for the following three days these two policemen listened through their clamped-on device to conversations between Richard Manduchi and Isaac Chaitt, the defendant in this case. They heard these two men discuss race horses, baseball pitchers and football games. They heard the placing of bets of $1, $2 and |&gt;3 and $5 “round robin parlays” on horses with names such as Ham Bone, Little Colleen, Miss Ellaneous, Fighting Thru, Papa Charlie, Dandy Foot, William Tell, Knot Hole, Betsy Marie, Poocha and Under the Rug.</p>

Those who believe that wire-tapping is a very complicated and difficult procedure will be astonished, not to say dismayed, to learn how simple and easy this ominous invasion of a citizen’s privacy can be accomplished. Farkas testified: “Q. You say you made this tap, tell the court and jury how you do that. A. It is very simple, the headset that you have has two wires attached to it and possibly 50 feet of wire, 2-strand wire and the telephone wire is also a double wire.

All wires have a little clamp, spring clamp of metal which you place like this (indicating). It opens up and when you let it go, it clamps down and all you do is clamp one wire to one wire and take the other wire and clamp it to the second telephone wire.”</p>
