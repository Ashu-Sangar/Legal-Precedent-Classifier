That the Board of Trustees of the Evangelical Home hereby elect to accept the bequeath of George Barron Miller, deceased, and elect to comply with the directions, conditions and requests under which the said bequest is and has been made. 2.

That the Evangelical Home continue the policy that has been in effect since the founding of the orphanage, in that they do not, nor at any future time will limit their orphanage of the Evangelical Home to their own denomination, but that they will continue throughout the existence of the orphanage, to accept orphans of other denominations, without discrimination whatsoever, according to the needs of the individual child. 4. That this Board shall retain exclusive direction and control of the funds derived from this bequest in erecting the ‘Miller Memorial7, commensurate with the needs of the orphanage. 5.

    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[178,1749,1147,485]]]'>It is clear that Item Seventh of George F. Miller’s will incorporated in the will of George Barron Miller, imposed a condition precedent to the vesting of the bequest in the Evangelical Home, namely, that it <em>elect to comply </em>with the directions, conditions and requests subsequently set forth.

In his brief appellant’s learned counsel deletes the portion thereof which provides that “. . . the Board of Trustees . . . shall have exclusive management of all money derived from said estate,” and quotes, emphasizes and relies upon the remainder of this subdivision that “. . . they choose to erect a memorial . . . suitable to the needs of the Orphanage, and one that will render valuable service.”. It is argued that since the charitable bequest called for the erection of a suitable and lasting memorial to the testator, the choice of the memorial constituted a condition precedent to the vesting of the bequest; that the resolution passed by the trustees showed that no definite decision was made with respect to the memorial and that the testimony of representatives of the Home at the hearing before the auditor was to the effect that while various plans had been discussed by the trustees for using the bequest, nothing definite had been decided, or plans adopted as to cost, size or whether the memorial would be an auditorium, chapel or wing.</p>

When read in its entirety the direction in subdivision (3) adds nothing of substance to subdivision (1) for the Board of Trustees would have exclusive management of the fund according to the constitution and by-laws of the Home which were introduced into evidence, and in that body would lie the choice of the memorial to be erected affording proper facilities for the education and care of orphan children. Both subdivisions (1) and (3) apply to the application and use of the fund after it is received. The only condition precedent to the receipt of the fund was the election to comply. However, when received, the Home would become a trustee for itself and be required to carry out <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>the purposes specified in the gift <em>(Craig Estate, </em><a href="/pa/356/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="356 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="470669" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0564-01">356 Pa. 564</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20A.2d%20650" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="52 A.2d 650">52 A. 2d 650</a>).

Wanamaker Scholarships for Mercantile Business. . .”. The university did not establish a course for mercantile business instruction, nor did it propose to. In claiming the bequest it relied on the existence of other courses as substantially meeting the condition imposed upon the gift. This Court held in a cogent opinion by Mr. Justice Linn that the courses offered and relied on by the university did not constitute a course for mercantile business instruction as contemplated by the testator, and since the establishment of such course was a condition precedent to the vesting of the bequest, the university was not entitled thereto. A marked difference between the <em>Wanamaker </em>case and the present case is at once apparent. In the former the object of the charitable bequest was not in existence but was to be established before the gift in trust would become effective. Here the object of the testator’s charity, an orphanage for the education and care of orphan children, existed, and upon the Home’s election to comply in the administration of the trust with the direc<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>tions, conditions and requests of the testator, it became immediately entitled to the bequest.</p>

And this distinction is quite inevitable, for it is founded in the nature of things. We must observe this distinction in studying Mr. Girard’s will, otherwise we run the risk of inverting the natural order of things by subordinating principles to form, the purpose to its means, the actual and executed gift for a known purpose to the prescribed or vaticinated modes of administering it, that are intended for adaptation to an unknown future, and of thus making the chief purpose of the gift dependent on the very often unwise directions prescribed for its future security and efficiency.”.</p>

It is argued that the testator having expressed the intent to perpetuate the Miller name and through a change of circumstances, having provided an inadequate bequest, the trust fails absolutely. We cannot agree. The testator prescribed nothing as to the size <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>or character of the memorial. It could be modest or pretentious. The charitable intent could be carried out by an addition to an existing building as contemplated by the trustees, and this could not only be dedicated as a “Miller Memorial” but could afford facilities for the “education and care” of orphan children, “suitable to the needs of the Orphanage”. The testator did not indicate the extent of the facilities to be added to those existing in the Home. A reasonable construction of the bequest must be given in favor of the beneficiary and a strict construction against a forfeiture.
