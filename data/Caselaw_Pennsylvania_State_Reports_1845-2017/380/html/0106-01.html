Unfortunately for the two surviving sisters, testator failed to do so, and therefore the insertion of the word “Two” was invalid: Wills Act, April 24, 1947, Pi L. 89, §2,- 20.

In effect, they admit that the insertion of the word “Two” is invalid for the purpose of making a testamentary bequest to the two sisters, but contend it is sufficient to disclose the testator’s actual intent and therefore disclose he did not intend the residue to go to his three sisters. The same argument or theory could be advanced if an illegal revocation were made of a testamentary bequest (See <em>Williams Estate, </em><a href="/pa/336/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="336 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="1195623" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0235-01">336 Pa. 235</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20377" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="9 A.2d 377">9 A. 2d 377</a>; Cf. <em>Hildebrand Will, </em><a href="/pa/365/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="365 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1225596" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0551-01">365 Pa. 551</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20102" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="76 A.2d 102">76 A. 2d 102</a>), or if a gift to a charity within thirty days of death were made in lieu of a gift to a son. In each such case the illegal revocation or invalid substitutionary gift could not affect or operate (to show an actual intent) to defeat a prior valid bequest. This same argument was made in <em>Jull Estate, </em><a href="/pa/370/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="370 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="1234534" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0434-01">370 Pa. 434</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20753" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="88 A.2d 753">88 A. 2d 753</a>, where it was unsuccessfully argued that an invalid exercise of a power of appointment showed an intention that the testator did not wish the property invalidly appointed to pass to the residuary legatee, since he had already specifically, although ineffectively, said he wished it to go elsewhere.</p>
