Plaintiff Cott Bottling Company of Pittsburgh is a licensee of Cott Beverage Corporation authorized to distribute such beverages in Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs filed applications to register their beverages so sweetened; they received certificates of registration from the Department of Agriculture but subsequently <em>were </em>advised by the Department that the certificates were not intended to confer any exemption from the provisions of the law regarding such beverages. Thereupon plaintiffs filed a bill in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County alleging the likelihood of a multiplicity of suits against them for the recovery of fines and penalties and seeking to enjoin the Secretary of Agriculture and the Attorney General from enforcing certain provisions of the law which would in effect prohibit the manufacture of carbonated beverages or still drinks containing artificial sweetening agents.

Such carbonated beverages or still drinks shall contain not less than eight per centum sugars by weight.” It further provides that all carbonated beverages or still drinks shall be deemed to be adulterated which are not in compliance with the above provisions of the section, or which contain any of the ingredients prohibited by section 3 of the Act of March 11, 1909, P. L. 15, or which contain “any other substance deleterious to health.” Section 3 of the Act of March 11, 1909, P. L. 15, thus referred to, provides that a non-alcoholic drink shall be deemed to be adulterated, within the meaning of the act, if, inter alia, it contains dulcin, glucin, saccharin (which are artificial sweetening agents) or “other added substance deleterious to health.” The Act of May 13, 1909, P.' L. 520, entitled “An Act relating to food,” etc., as amended, provides, section 3, that an article of food shall be deemed to be adulterated if, inter alia, it contains saccharin, “or other artificial sweetening agents”; provided, however, that “any article of food containing saccharin or any artificial sweetening agent may be manufactured, transported or sold if it contains no added sugar, honey, or other natural sweetening agent, and the name of the artificial sweetening agent followed by the word ‘sweetened’ is placed upon the label each time the name of the article of food is mentioned, in type no smaller than the largest type on <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>said label.

Plaintiffs contend, and the court below sustained their contention, that the act, so far as it effects such result, is invalid and unconstitutional because it violates the Fourteenth Amendment in that it deprives plaintiffs of their property without due process of law, and also violates Article I, Section 1, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania which provides that it is an inherent and indefeasible right of all men to acquire, possess and protect property. The court below found, and defendants admit, that suearyl is not deleterious to health, especially when prepared in the form of calcium cyclamate which is the product manufactured by Abbott Laboratories and used in the carbonated nonalcoholic beverages manufactured, sold, bottled and distributed by plaintiffs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Being non-caloric it is useful in diets for the restriction of sugar intake and therefore is especially indicated for diabetics and for persons aiming to reduce excessive weight.

But, as likewise there stated, the power is not unrestricted ; its exercise, like that of all other governmental powers, is subject to constitutional limitations and judicial review. By a host of authorities, Federal and State alike, it has been held that a law which purports to be an exercise of the police power must not be unreasonable, unduly oppressive, or patently beyond the necessities of the case, and the means which it employs must have a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be attained. Under the guise of protecting the public interests the legislature may not arbitrarily interfere with private business or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations. The question whether any particular statutory provision is so related to the public good and so reasonable in the means it prescribes as to justify the exercise of the police power, is one for the judgment, in the first instance, of the law-making branch of the government, but its final determination is for the courts.” In support of the statement that “a law which purports to be an exercise of the police power must not be unreasonable, unduly oppressive, or patently beyond the necessities of the case, and the means which it employs must have a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be attained” are cited a great number of decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the appellate courts of this Commonwealth.</p>

But here there is no such danger. As sold in bottle form Sucaryl is labeled as what it is, namely, a non-nutritive, artificial sweetner to be used by persons who must restrict their intake of ordinary sweets, and when used to sweeten carbonated beverages the consumer is naturally without interest or concern as to the sweetening agent employed. It is not a cheap substitute for natural sugar, but, on the contrary, is more expensive than sugar because of the cost of the ingredients which enter into its composition, and the beverages containing it are accordingly sold at a higher price.</p>

    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[264,1456,1157,765]]]'>This brings us to a consideration of the Act of May 13, 1909, P.

It permits the manufacture and sale of articles of food containing an artificial sweetening agent if they contain no added sugar, honey or other natural sweetening agent, if they are properly labeled, and if the label contains an “appropriate warning statement” to be prescribed'by the Department of Agriculture. Acting under that provision the regulations of the Department of Agriculture provide for a label with a black border which reads “Warning! This product contains the drug'(name). Caution !

L. 520, since it deals exclusively with articles of “food,” food being defined as including “not only every article used for food by man, but also every article used for, or entering into the composition of, or intended for use as an ingredient in the preparation of, food for man,” — a definition which throws little if any light on the scope of the term “food” as employed in the act. Does it include carbonated beverages? Food is defined in Webster’s New International Dictionary as <em>“nutritive material </em>absorbed or taken into the body of an organism which serves for purposes of growth, work, or repair and for the maintenance of the vital processes.” Sucaryl is not “nutritive material.” In <em>Commonwealth v.

The court said (pp. 291-292, A. p. 896) : “The words food and drink in common usage and understanding are complementary and associate terms, denoting the two prime necessities of life, but they are so far from synonymous that they import a plain and fundamental distinction, as universal as language and as old as the human race .... No liquor dealer, . . . having a wakeful eye to the strict regulations of his business by the other statutes, would suppose he was to be affected by a new act with a title indicating food as its only subject. Nor is it reasonable to suppose that his representative in the legislature so intended.” In <em>Commonwealth v. Pflaum, </em><a href="/pa/236/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="236 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="986615" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0294-01">236 Pa. 294</a>, 297, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.%20842" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="84 A. 842">84 A. 842</a>, it was said that sugar and honey are food; sugar and honey, of course, are nutriment, but sucaryl is not; <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>suearyl is an inert substance having no food value whatever. It becomes the more abundantly clear that the legislature did not intend to include drinks in the term “food” as used in the Act of May 13, 1909, P. L. 520, when it is noted that in that same session of the legislature the Act of March 11, 1909, P. L. 15, was passed providing separately for non-alcoholic drinks. And since, therefore, the Act of May 13, 1909, P. L. 520, does not apply to carbonated non-alcoholic drinks, the requirement of that act that the label should contain an appropriate warning statement prescribed by the Department of Agriculture does not affect the product here in controversy. Indeed, in any event, as the court below properly held, the warning prescribed by the Department was not “appropriate” but wholly unreasonable and unnecessarily alarming, since it would naturally tend to discourage the purchase and use of what admittedly is a harmless product.</p>
