    <p id="b437-8" data-blocks='[["BL_437.10",437,[163,1282,1152,871]]]'>This appeal grows out of an action of assumpsit instituted by the plaintiff seller for the recovery of damages allegedly sustained through the defendant buyer’s breach of contracts for the sale and purchase of wholesale quantities of flour. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff for a specific sum of money. Subsequently, the court en banc (one judge dissenting) denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial. Prom the judgment entered on the verdict, the defendant took this appeal. The members of. the court who sat for the argument of the appeal are unanimously of the opinion that the case involves material issues of fact which it is the jury’s province to resolve. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed and a. new trial ordered.</p>

Did the specifications for the flour, which the defendant sought to prove the plaintiff had breached, violate the parol evidence rule by ascribing to the agreement of the parties matter which their integrated contracts did not contain? The court below answered “yes” and accordingly ruled out the buyer’s defense on the merits. We think that was plainly error.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[251,800,1158,1268]]]'>The plaintiff (seller) and the defendant (buyer) executed five identical contract forms for the sale and purchase of specified quantities and qualities of flour to be milled by the seller. The forms were the uniform flour contract form for the milling and baking industries as approved by the Millers’ National Federation and the American Bakers’ Association. The contract forms, as executed by the parties, were severally dated September 11, 1947, October 13, 1947, November 12, 1947 (two), and February 9, 1948, and each concluded with the printed provision that “This Contract constitutes the complete agreement between the parties hereto; and cannot be changed in any manner except in writing subscribed by Buyer and Seller or their duly authorized officers.” According to the averments and testimony of the defendant, the contract forms did not fully or correctly reflect the whole of the understanding of the parties at the time of their execution and that a material provision was deliberately omitted therefrom at the seller’s insistence but with the understanding that it would be separately agreed to by the seller by way of a contemporaneous letter from the seller to the buyer which- was transmitted.</p>

Agreement <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>between the parties was substantially reached at that time. The buyer’s president there stated that the written specifications prescribed by the American Institute of Baking, of Chicago, Illinois, for flour intended for human consumption should be incorporated in the contracts. The seller’s representative replied that this could not be done since “these milling contracts . . . are uniform all over the country and they didn’t want to violate the normal contract.” He suggested, however, that when he and his co-representative of the seller returned to Detroit they would write a letter tying in the buyer’s specifications in its subsequent purchase orders and that under those circumstances the buyer should be satisfied. Thereupon, at the conclusion of the meeting of September 11th, the buyer delivered to the seller <em>a purchase </em>order, dated the same day of the meeting, for a certain quantity of flour under the contemplated contracts when executed. The purchase order stated, inter alia, that “This flour to be guaranteed to meet specifications attached, which are part of this order. Understanding is that one (1) pound sample of flour will be submitted to the American Institute of Baking, 1134 Fullerton Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, for test before shipment is made of any car. Also understand we are going to make check analysis upon arrival of car, such analysis also to be made by the American Institute of Baking.” The attached specifications are identical forms to those similarly attached to three subsequent purchase orders. They contain a list of unclean foreign substances of which the flour was to be relatively free in order to guarantee the product fit for human consumption. On the same day, viz., September 11th, the seller, by telegram, accepted the purchase order.</p>

These <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>forms made no reference whatsoever to the buyer’s purity specifications as recited in the order already accepted by the seller. But, on the same day (September 12th) one of the salesmen who, in part, had represented the seller at the meeting of September 11th, sent the buyer a letter assuring deliveries of flour <em>in compliance with the buyers purity specifications. </em>This salesman testified at trial that the letter was prepared and sent with the knowledge and approval of his co-representative with whom he had discussed the matter after the meeting of September 11th. The letter stated: “This will confirm our agreement made in your office on September 11. Before any flour is shipped to you, a sample will be sent to the American Institute of Baking, to determine the extraneous matters that may be in the flour. We feel, that for the greater part, our flour Avill have no extraneous matters of any kind, but as a check, to be sure that you will never receive any, your car will be held until such time as we get a satisfactory report back from the American Institute of Baking. When a car arrives at your, siding, you will take samples from the car and also send them to the American Institute of Baking as a double check, and if they should report that this flour does not come up to specifications, that flour will be diverted from your siding, and replaced with satisfactory flour. We are very interested in cooperating with the food inspectors in this matter, and you can be assured that we will cooperate with you 100% in meeting your requirements.”</p>

And, in respect <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>of the second, third and fourth purchase orders, they were expressly made subject to the seller’s guarantee of compliance with attached specifications which were the same as already indicated above in connection with the purchase order of September 11, 1947.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In fact, the third and fourth executed contract forms, being those dated November 12, 1947, each specifically mentions the buyer’s corresponding purchase order number and states that “This P.O.

The buyer also subsequently accepted two more carload shipments but rejected and refused to accept six carloads because of failure of the flour to meet the specifications referred to in the purchase orders. Of the six cars so rejected, four were returned to and accepted by the seller; one more carload lot was condemned by United States officials as unfit for human consumption; and another carload, when its return was refused by the seller, was sold by the buyer for use as animal food. To make the breach complete, the buyer’s president, by letter dated June 28, 1948, notified the seller that all contracts between the parties were cancelled as of June 18, 1948, since the seller had failed to deliver flour which met the specifications agreed upon between <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>them. The seller acknowledged receipt of the buyer’s letter of repudiation by a letter dated June 30, 1948, and therein notified the buyer that a statement of damages occasioned by the breach would follow.</p>

    <p id="b442-5" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[235,1136,1165,1152]]]'>The parol evidence rule, as is well known, provides that where parties to an agreement commit their undertakings to a writing with the intention that it shall formally and comprehensively evidence the terms of their agreement, the writing, when executed by the parties, cannot thereafter be made subject to parol alteration, contradiction or variance by way of agreements or understandings had prior to or contemporaneously with the execution of the writing. And, so, the parol evidence rule insures the integrity of written memorials adopted by the parties to an agreement as evidencing the whole of their contractual undertakings. But, while the salutary effect of the rule is not lightly to be impaired by exceptions, evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements of the parties is admissible to alter, contradict or vary the terms of their writing where the omissions therefrom occurred by reason of either fraud, accident or mistake.

The defendants contended that the bailment lease constituted the only contract between the parties and that the parol evidence rule excluded consideration of the agreement of sale and the receipt. Speaking for this court, Mr. Justice Stearne declared that, “. . . it is clear that the parties did not intend the written bailment lease to constitute the final and complete contract between them. . . . There was an interrelation between the writings and the parol testimony which required the action of the jury to determine what was the contract between the parties. . . . That the construction of this contract is a jury question is manifest. The issue is what insurance defendants agreed to supply. The agreement of sale states <em>fire, theft and property damage </em>. . . ; the lease names <em>fire and theft; </em>the receipt states that it was <em>property damage and liability; </em>the parol evidence was that it was <em>property damage . . . , fire, theft and liability insurance. . . . </em>[SJuch a situation <em>‘. . . becomes a question for the jury to determine what the parties actually </em>meant/ ”</p>

The issue as to the extent of the parties’ contractual undertakings should, therefore, have been submitted for the jury’s determination. The seller’s contention that the buyer’s evidence in such connection, instead of being clear and convincing, was vague and uncertain is not well founded. The fact that some of the witnesses failed to recall incidental details with specificity does not detract from their testimony as a whole which was clear and convincing with respect to the parties’ intended engagements. In addition to the oral and documentary evi<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>deuce, to which, we have referred, further corroboration that the purity specifications were accepted by all as being a part of the agreements is to be found in the record by way of correspondence of the parties and the seller’s inter-office memoranda. It is true that the seller disputes the authority of its salesman to write the above-quoted letter of September 12, 1947, but it is equally true that the testimony shows that the seller’s chief negotiator at the meeting in Pittsburgh on September 11, 1947, gave assurances that such a letter would be written and actually approved of the letter as written and transmitted. On the basis of the evidence as a whole, the jury might have justifiably found that the contractual agreements of the parties were not restricted to the matters set forth in the five executed printed forms.</p>
    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[212,1215,1160,874]]]'>That brings us to the seller’s argument, in the alternative, that, even assuming the agreement of the parties was as the buyer alleges, still the buyer failed to adduce any competent evidence to prove the default ascribed to the seller, viz., failure to deliver flour conforming to the specifications contractually imposed. The buyer, on the contrary, contends that the requisite proof of the seller’s default was contained- in the proffered reports of the American Institute of Baking which the trial court excluded, on the plaintiff’s objection, as being hearsay. The buyer assigns several reasons why the ruling was error, only one of which it is presently necessary to consider, namely, that, by virtue of the agreement of the parties, as pleaded and proven by the buyer, the reports were not hearsay but agreed-upon definitive proofs.</p>
    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[211,2103,1156,210]],["BL_449.1",449,[144,345,1154,755]]]'>Among the specifications, which the buyer’s proofs show were a part of the entire contract, was an overall provision that the' flour, which the seller was to deliver, would not. contain more than 35 insect fragments, per <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>pound. The parties selected the American Institute of Baking as an independent agency for determining specification compliance by analyzing samples of the flour and reporting whether the inspected flour met the purity specifications required. Accordingly, the buyer argues that, regardless of the accuracy or inaccuracy of the analyses, if the American Institute of Baking reported that the flour did not comply with the specifications, the seller was to take it back and replace it with satisfactory material. If such were in fact the understanding of the parties, then the reports of the Institute’s findings were not hearsay and, consequently, were erroneously excluded as evidence by the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b449-3" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[140,1123,1156,819]]]'>If the reports of the Institute had been admitted, there would then have been sufficient evidence for a jury to find that, if the specifications were a part of the parties’ agreement, the seller was in default. The reports of the Institute actually disclosed that the insect fragment count in the flour delivered by the seller ranged from a low of 70 to a high of 576 fragments per pound, whereas the maximum permissible count was, as already indicated, an average of 35 fragments per pound. It follows, therefore, that any lack of evidence in the record to sustain the buyer’s allegation of the seller’s default resulted not from the buyer’s failure to proffer such evidence but from the learned trial judge’s erroneous refusal to admit in evidence the reports of the Institute.</p>

Of course, so far as essential proofs are oral, their submission for the jury’s determination is required : cf. <em>Nanty-Glo Boro. v.
