But the question naturally arose as to what was to be done in regard to employes of the county offices who, by virtue of the City-County Consolidation Amendment, — the likely adoption of which was then in contemplation — would become employes of the city instead of the county and who had never been under civil service regulations. <em>It would manifestly have been unjust to provide that such employes should thereupon automatically lose their jobs, or that they might be dismissed at the arbitrary will of their employing officer, thereby making possible the retention of a spoils system which permitted such dismissals for purely political reasons; </em>on the contrary, therefore, the framers of the charter obviously planned to bring all these former county employes as soon as possible under the protection of civil service, the same as governed city employes already enjoying that protection. It was evidently further thought, however, that these new city employes should not be compelled to take the regular competitive examinations required of new applicants, but that their previous service, in some cases extending over many years, should entitle them, by reason of the experience thus gained, to a less rigorous qualifying test. Accordingly it was provided by section A-104 of the Charter that those who might become employes of the city by virtue of amendment of the constitution, and who had not been appointed after civil service test and certification, should <em>‘also be continued in their respective positions provided that within one year after this charter takes effect </em>. . . <em>they pass a qualifying test prescribed by the Personnel Director and approved by the Civil Service Commission’, </em>and that those who failed so to qualify should ‘be dismissed from their positions within thirty days after the establishment of an eligible list for their respective positions.’ This language is so clear that he who runs may <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>read. The former county employes were to be given the opportunity of maintaining their positions by passing a qualifying test at some time during the period of a year. If before such opportunity were afforded them they could be discharged by their employer without cause this provision of the section would be so extremely deceptive, not to say wholly meaningless. . .

This contention was succinctly answered by the Chief Justice in the <em>Garrota </em>case, supra, (p. 261) : “Defendants urge that because the City-County Consolidation Amendment provided that the county officers should continue ‘to perform their <em>duties’, </em>this meant that they should continue to have the <em>power </em>to dismiss their employes at will. <em>Such an interpretation is wholly beyond reason. </em>This provision did not purport in any manner whatsoever to deal with the relations between the county (now city) officers and their employes or with the latter’s employment status. As to the provision in the amendment that the county officers should continue to be ‘organized’ in the manner provided by the Constitution and the then existing laws, this obviously refers, not, as appellants mistakenly claim, to the county <em>offices, </em>but to the county <em>officers, </em>and covers the case of County Commissioners who were ‘organized’by legislation into a board for the transaction of their business.” (Italics supplied in part)</p>

Plaintiff, a <em>County </em>of Philadelphia employe, was lawfully employed in the Sheriff’s office on and prior to November 6, 1951. Upon the adoption of the amendment to the Constitution and the consequent consolidation, above referred to, plaintiff became a <em>City </em>employe. On January 2, 1953, <em>without affording him am opportunity to pass a qualifying test, </em>the Sheriff peremptorily discharged him. The sole notice which he received was in writing and read <em>“For just cause, your employment . . . has been terminated. . . ” </em>In defendants’ answer it is alleged that the dismissal was for just and proper cause, viz.: “. . .

As early as the <em>Carrow </em>case it appeared that the Sheriff dismissed a former County employe without cause. We affirmed the court below in its judgment of mandamus reinstating such employe. Obviously in the case now before us the City, in defending its attitude and position, has adopted the military strategy that the best defense is a vigorous offense. It has presented all manner of objections <em>against plaintiff </em>in seeking to evade the plain mandate of the Charter and decisions of this Court, which, however, became less convincing the more it pressed, multiplied and explained them.</p>

For example, it is argued that a summary judgment in mandamus should only be granted where the right is clear. But in the <em>Carrow </em>case the Chief Justice accurately stated, respecting the declared purposes of the Charter (p. 260) : “[The] language is so clear that he who runs may read.” It is argued that such judgment should not be rendered <em>because of delay due to litigation. </em>This was answered in the <em>Lennox </em>case, supra. The rights of an employe certainly cannot be prejudiced or lost because the City failed to conduct the examination as required by the statute or because of litigation to settle the law. Neither are we impressed with the argument that it would be inequitable to require the defendants to reinstate such employes with back pay, if they were illegally dismissed. The fact that over 300 employes were dismissed, and not merely the two involved in this case, makes it even more imperative that the law should be obeyed and not evaded. Perhaps the. most extraordinary contention of the City <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>Solicitor is that plaintiff should not secure relief because of legal <em>technicalities. </em>On the contrary, curiously enough, it is the <em>defendants </em>who are resorting to technicalities and not the plaintiff.</p>

Philadelphia, </em>supra, we decided a former County employe could not be discharged for political reasons but only for “just cause”. As above stated, the plaintiff received a written notice which read, <em>“[f]or just cause” </em>the employment was terminated. No facts or reasons constituting “just cause” were given, however, nor were the discharged employes given any hearing or indeed any opportunity to learn the derelictions with which they were charged, and to present a defense thereto. This was a violation of fundamental justice and of the rights given them by the Charter.</p>

There the board of street commissioners were authorized to appoint policemen “subject to removal for cause”. The policemen received no definite term of employment. A policeman summarily dismissed brought a mandamus proceeding for reinstatement because he had been given no notice or opportunity to be heard. The Court upheld the plaintiff’s contention, and in the course of its opinion said: .“. . . A removal for cause is, therefore, the only limitation fixed by the statute to their tenure. This being so an appointment is in legal effect an appointment dur<a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>ing good behavior, or so long as the appointee is competent to discharge the duties of the office or efficient in the performance of them. The term is not, therefore, indefinite, nor is it determinable at the mere will of the appointing power. True the term may be put an end to, but when terminated it must be terminated for cause. . . As the tenure of the policemen appointed under the charter of Hagerstown can be cut short only Tor cause,’ it is clear that it cannot be terminated without cause. The phrase Tor cause’ does not mean the arbitrary will of the appointing power, for that might be the outgrowth of mere whim, caprice, prejudice or passion, which would, in reality, be no cause at all. But the phrase ‘for cause’ must mean some cause affecting or concerning the ability or fitness of the incumbent to perform the duty imposed upon him. ‘The cause must be one affecting the officer’s capacity or fitness for the office.’ 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency.'L. (2nd ed.) 850. Hence it must be inefficiency, incompetency, or other kindred disqualification. <em>This being the case the appointee does not hold at the will of the appointing power, </em>and the doctrine laid down in State ex rel. O’Neill v. Register and in Townsend v. Kurtz, supra, does not apply. <em>When the right to remove can be exercised only for specific cause, or for cause generally, the appointing power cannot arbitrarily remove the officer, and where the removal is to be had for cause the power cannot be exercised until the officer has been duly notified and an opportunity has been given him to be heard in his own defense; </em>19 Am. &amp; Eng.

I know of no law, statutory or otherwise, except of course where civil service provisions are applicable, that requires an employer, whether public or private, to give a detailed statement to an employe of the reasons for his discharge.

Indeed not a single one of the other cases cited in the majority opinion deals with <em>employer or employe, </em>but only <em>with the removal from office of a public official, </em>which is quite a different matter and has no bearing whatever on the present issue. The only feature in <em>Bagg’s Case </em>which is here relevant is that the court there said, as quoted in the majority opinion: “He who decides any matter <em>without hearing both sides, </em>though his decision is just, is himself unjust.” Ironically enough, our court is now doing the very thing thus condemned, and violating the very principle which the majority opinion thus holds up for emulation; <em>it is deciding a matter “without hearing both sides”) </em>it is <em>denying a hearing </em>to the defendant Sheriff, — the right to establish the truth of his allegation that there was in fact just cause for the dismissal of these plaintiffs.</p>

The only right plaintiffs and all similar employees had was the right to be retained in their positions until given a test to qualify for entrance into the permanent civil service, but neither in the charter nor anywhere else were they accorded any right to be immune from dismissal meanwhile <em>for cause. </em>What the piresent decision really amounts to is a grant to plain<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>tiffs of the rights secured by the civil service regulations before they have attained a civil service status, and which, if it be ultimately found that they did give just cause for dismissal, they have precluded themselves from attaining at all. Not being under civil service regulations they cannot avail themselves of the provision of the Civil Service Commission that the appointing authority must notify the employe of the reason for his dismissal. Indeed, were they under the aegis of those regulations their present actions of mandamus could not, in any event, be maintained since the Charter provides that if an employe is improperly dismissed his recourse must be by an appeal to the Civil Service Commission, and only from the decision of that Commission, if unfavorable to plaintiffs, could they appeal to the court.</p>
    <p id="b363-4" data-blocks='[["BL_363.4",363,[186,1251,1154,707]]]'>To summarize, therefore- — because the assertion in the answers filed on behalf of defendants that plaintiffs were discharged for causes therein specified must be accepted as true on motions for judgments on the pleadings; and because (except under civil service regulations, to the benefit of which plaintiffs had not become entitled) there is no law making the dismissal of an employe illegal if not accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor; and because I believe that the present decision of the court is therefore wholly unwarranted from the standpoint both of procedural and substantive law, I respectfully dissent from the present affirmance of the judgments of the court below.</p>

I have seen nothing in the present litigation or in previous litigation while I have been a member of this Court which would warrant the charge that the City defies the Constitution and the decisions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. I do see, however, in this very case that the Majority of the Supreme Court ignores its own pronouncements and decisions. In <em>Carrow v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/371/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="371 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1237085" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0255-01">371 Pa. 255</a>, decided only two and one-half years ago, the Majority of this Court, speaking through the Chief Justice, said that the Sheriff of Philadelphia County had no authority to dismiss an employe of his office without cause. In the printed decision in the Pennsylvania State Reports, <em>“without cause” </em>is italicized. Yet, in the case at bar, where the circumstances italicize over 300 times the dismissal of employees <em>with </em>cause, the Majority of this Court declines to give sanction to the very principle it announced in July, 1952. The Majority says: “With the plan of the City-County consolidation so plainly outlined and interpreted by this Court, the <em>Ccause&gt; </em>for dismissal was obviously intended to .be <em>analogous </em>to that ‘cause’ which enables an employe to be removed from a <em>civil service </em>job.”</p>
    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[237,1741,1153,588]]]'>Accepting this analogy as a valid one, is it contended by the Majority that if the charges brought by the City against the plaintiffs were proved to be true, the Civil Service authorities would nevertheless retain the plaintiffs in their positions? If an employe leaves outside the door the equipment of loyalty, efficiency, tidiness and cooperativeness, will Civil Service still regard him as a capable employe? Civil Service is intended to be armor plate for the faithful and the industrious, not a camouflaged facade for the disloyal and the indolent.</p>

If a formula had to be devised for the disintegration of society, the disorganization of the law, the battering down of human respect and the incubation of contempt for all authority, it would be one composed of universal insubordination, inefficiency, untidiness and uncooperativeness.</p>

In the <em>Garrow </em>case this Court specifically repudiated any such thought by saying that regardless of Charter, “it is implicit in every relationship of employer and employe that if the latter violates the conditions of his employment, and fails to render efficient service, the employment may be terminated as in the case of any other failure of a party to perform a contractual obligation.”</p>

Why does the Majority therefore disregard its own pronouncement of June 24, 1952, and refuse to permit termination of an employment in which one of the parties fails to live up to his contract to perform efficient service? In contemplating judgment on the pleadings, all averments properly pleaded by the opposing party must be accepted as true. <em>(London v. Kingsley, <a href="/pa/368/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="368 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1230332" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0109-01">368 Pa. </a></em><a href="/pa/368/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="368 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1230332" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0109-01">109</a>.) The City avers inefficiency on the part of the plaintiffs. By the very criterion laid down in the <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>
      <em>Garrow </em>case, judgment for the plaintiffs here is utterly unjustified.</p>
    <p id="b366-4" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[234,465,1155,487]]]'>The Majority quotes in support of its position Section A-104 of Chapter A of the Charter. A-104 was intended as a temporary shelter while the more substantial structure of permanent tenure was being built. It was to protect city employes with civil service rating and county employes who were awaiting the opportunity to pass a qualifying test, but it was never intended to provide a perpetual domicile for the idlers and the bunglers.</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[234,965,1155,753]]]'>The whole concept behind the Charter movement was to bring a better government to Philadelphia. But the Majority Opinion would suggest that the purpose of the charter was to perpetuate the <em>status </em>quo. The Superintendent of a building operation who is compelled to use equipment that is faulty as well as employes who are indifferent and incompetent will never get his building completed. If, in this reorganization of the government of the largest city in our Commonwealth, the officials elected by the people may not weed out employes who, through sloth and dereliction of duty, will not allow the job to be done, the whole charter movement will have become a mockery, a delusion and a sham.</p>
    <p id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[232,1741,1155,595]],["BL_367.1",367,[179,355,1148,368]]]'>The Majority treats rather summarily the very serious matters raised by the defendant City. A vital phase of this litigation is the obvious laches practised by the plaintiffs. Laches in a case of this kind is not a technical defense, it goes to the very heart of the controversy. In a situation where jobs are involved, and especially jobs in a reorganizational enterprise, one must be prompt to assert his rights because all work must be kept moving. The plaintiffs waited for a year after dismissal before making any complaint. The Majority criticizes the City for not having supplied the <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>plaintiffs with reasons for their dismissal, bat in this connection if is to be noted that the plaintiffs never asked for reasons as to why they had been discharged. It is possible that, like the child who is being whipped by his parent without explanation, they knew the cause of their dismissal without requiring specifications.</p>
    <p id="b367-3" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[175,745,1152,987]]]'>Two years have now passed since the plaintiffs were discharged. A similar period of time has elapsed since the others of the 300 employes were discharged. In the meantime the entire occupational picture has changed. Positions have been abolished, new employes have been hired, functions have been transferred from one office to another, various offices have been consolidated. While the plaintiffs and the others of the 300 were sleeping on their alleged rights the gigantic project of overhauling the City and County Governments of Philadelphia was proceeding apace. In point of efficient administration it is currently impossible to fit 300 employes into the precise jobs they once held. Three hundred eggs have been scrambled. The Majority in effect orders these eggs to be unscrambled and the contents restored to their original individual shells, but it offers no advice, guidance or instruction as to how this extraordinary feat is to be accomplished.</p>

Are the taxpayers of Philadelphia to be required to pay two sets of salaries for one piece of work, just because the plaintiffs were indifferent to the responsibility resting upon them to have their rights adjudicated with dispatch? The Supreme Court of the United States spoke with forceful wisdom on this very subject in the case of <em>Arant v. </em>Lane, <a href="/us/249/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="249 U.S. 367" data-case-ids="3687672" data-case-paths="/us/249/0367-01">249 U. S. 367</a>, 372, when it said: “When a public official is unlawfully removed from office, whether from disregard of the law by his superior or from mistake as to the facts <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>of his case, obvious considerations of <em>public policy </em>make it of first importance that be should <em>promptly lake action </em>requisite to effectively assert his rights, to the end that if his contention be justified the Government service may be disturbed as little as possible and that two salaries shall not be paid for a single service. . . Such a long delay must necessarily result in changes in the branch of service to which he was attached and in such an accumulation of unearned salary that, when unexplained, the manifest inequity which would result from reinstating him renders the application of the <em>doctrine of laches to his case peculiarly appropriate in the interests of justice and sound public </em>policy.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_368.4",368,[243,1135,1154,373]]]'>No court should render judgment without mentally envisioning what its decree will physically bring to pass.

If a head-on contradiction like this does not raise a question of fact, then the word “fact” which has heretofore been the symbol of the concrete and the objective has now entered into the vaporous world of the vague, the mysterious and the unknown.</p>

The Majority is refusing to give a hearing to both sides. The defendants have declared under oath that the plaintiffs do not possess the qualifications required for the jobs they hold. The defendants ask for an opportunity to demonstrate to a jury that the plaintiffs do not measure up to the standards that even a Civil Service board might establish. The defendants want to know if the taxpayers of Philadelphia should be required to pay money to persons who refuse to do their work properly, who bungle their tasks, who are slovenly at their jobs and who decline to cooperate with their fellow-employes.</p>

The Majority arbitrarily declares that it refuses “to sanction triáis of fact in over 300 employe removal cases.” The Majority says that it makes this decision “in the interest of justice, as well as for economy.” How does the Majority know that in those 300 cases, there is not one drone, not one hanger-on, not one clock-watcher? How does it know that there are not one hundred who were wont to show up at their offices only to receive their pay checks and then were to be seen no more until the following pay day? What ominiscience does the Majority possess that it can assume that these 300 employes are models of efficiency and deportment and render service for every dollar taken from the public treasury? The Majority says it will not permit trials for these 300. The Supreme Court has the power to refuse these trials, but in doing so, it <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>cannot escape the observation that it has itself presented: “Quia quicunque aliquid statuerit, parte inaudita altera, aequum licet statuerit, haud aequum fuerit.”</p>
