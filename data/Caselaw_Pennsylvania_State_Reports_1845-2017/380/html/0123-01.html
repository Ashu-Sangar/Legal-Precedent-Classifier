Moreover, the enumeration does include “bath-houses” and “amusement and recreation parks,” and the court properly held that defendants’ establishment fell within both of those categories. Certainly the building containing . the shower and locker facilities constituted a bath-house, and it is difficult to imagine how the whole enterprise could be characterized as other than “an amusement and recreation park.” The exclusion of the negroes, therefore, merely because of their race or color, constitutes a violation of the act: <em>Commonwealth v.

The answer to this question must undoubtedly be in the affirmative. It will be noted that section 651 begins by stating that “All persons within the jurisdiction of this Commonwealth shall be entitled to the full and equal accommodations ... of any places of public accommodation, resort or amusement, . . .”. If, therefore, they are “entitled” to such privileges they are likewise entitled to enforce them, since wherever there is a right there is a remedy. Indeed, the section refers, in another connection, to “presumptive evidence in any civil or criminal action,” thus indicating that civil relief was contemplated by the legislature. Nor does the fact that a criminal penalty is provided for in the enactment render such remedy exclusive or supersede the right of action for damages in a civil proceeding, it being generally held that where a statute imposes upon any person a specific duty for the benefit of others, if he neglects or refuses to perform such duty he is liable for any injury caused by such neglect or refusal <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>if such injury is of the kind which the statute was intended to prevent: <em>Stehle v.

This does not mean, however, that, even though there be other reasons for invoking the jurisdiction of equity, no injunctive relief - can be granted if the act against which it . is directed is subject to a criminal penalty. The proper statement of the rule is this, — that the mere fact that the act complained of is a crime neither confers equitable jurisdiction nor ousts it. It was said in <em>People ex rel. Bennett, Attorney-General v. Laman, </em><a href="/ny/277/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="277 N.Y. 368" data-case-ids="2029890" data-case-paths="/ny/277/0368-01">277 N.Y. 368</a>, 376, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20N.E.2d%20439" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="14 N.E.2d 439">14 N.E. 2d 439</a>, 442: “Whether or not the act sought to be enjoined is a crime, is immaterial. Equity does not seek to enjoin it simply because it is a crime; it seeks to protect, some proper interest. If <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>the interest sought to be protected is one of which equity will take cognizance, it will not refuse to take jurisdiction on the ground that the act which invades that interest is punishable by the penal statutes of the State.” In short, while equity will not enjoin the commission of a crime in order to enforce the criminal law, the criminal nature of an act will not deprive equity of jurisdiction otherwise attaching. As a matter of fact, the cases are legion both in our own State and elsewhere where injunctive relief has been granted although the commission of an act which is subject to a criminal penalty is thereby being enjoined: <em>Commonwealth v.

But it is a generalization “more honoured in the breach than the observance,” and runs counter to the cardinal need of flexibility in the domain of equity jurisprudence. Blackstone, after quoting Grotius’ definition that equity is “the correction of that wherein the law (by reason of its universality) is deficient,” stated (Book 1, *62) that “Equity thus depending, essentially, upon the particular circumstances of each individual case, there can be no established rules and fixed precepts of equity laid down, without destroying its very essence, and reducing it to a positive law.” The categorical statement that equity will grant relief only if a property right is involved has been frequently criticized in legal periodicals and the' authorities are overwhelmingly opposed to it. In 28 Am.- Jur. p. 266, §71, it is said: “. . . there have always been some clearly defined exceptions to the general rule, and there is a progressive tendency on the part of the courts to remedy by injunction injuries -to personal rights. This is, perhaps, as it should be, because the personal rights of citizens are more sacred and,-by.; every. test, of- more <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>value than things that may be measured by a purely monetary standard, and the courts have expressed difficulty in understanding why injunctive protection of the one class of rights should be placed above similar protection of the other.’V:</p>

We are by no means satisfied that property rights and personal rights are always as distinct and readily separable as much of the public discussion in recent years would have them. But in so far as the distinction exists we cannot believe that personal rights recognized by law are in general less important to the individual or less vital to society or less worthy of protection by the peculiar remedies equity can afford than are property rights. . . . We believe the true rule to be that equity will protect personal rights by injunction upon the same conditions upon which it will protect property rights by injunction. In general, these conditions are, that unless relief is granted a substantial right of the plaintiff will be impaired to a material degree; that the remedy at law is inadequate; and that injunctive relief can be applied with practical success and without imposing an impossible burden on the court or bringing its processes into disrepute.” The court then cited a very large number of States which “have tended toward this view” and also a large number of legal writers who “support it.”</p>

The issue should not in logic or justice turn upon the sole proposition that a personal rather than a property right is involved.

These concepts of the sanctity of personal rights are specifically protected by the Constitutions, both state and federal, and the courts have properly given them a place of high dignity, and . worthy of especial protection.”</p>

This contention cannot be seriously considered, although since the dictum in the case of Gee v. Pritchard et al., ... it has become firmly established as a general rule in the courts of equity. Precedent for jurisdiction is abundant:.......the history and development of the court of chancery both in England and in this Commonwealth militates against the existence of a wrong without an adequate remedy. Unless equity affords relief under circumstances such as this plaintiffs are in a most lamentable situation. Monetary damages can never be adequate compensation. . . . The powers of equity are not so impotent that such a situation will be tolerated. The remedy afforded must be such as to destroy the roots of the evil and this can only be done by mandatory injunction.”</p>
