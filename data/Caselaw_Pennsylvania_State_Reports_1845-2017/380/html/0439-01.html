The other defendants have not appealed. W. I. Worsham &amp; Bros, were the owners, and Marlow the driver, of the tractor-trailer involved.</p>

Perry Street, which carries heavy vehicular traffic, runs north and south and is crossed by the tracks of defendant railroad which run east and west. There had been a heavy snowfall which ended on the morning of the day the accident occurred. As a result, the snow was well packed, the roads icy, and driving hazardous.</p>

Marlow drove his empty tractor-trailer onto the crossing, and as he did so his wheels became stuck on the rails. Despite his efforts the wheels continued to spin without moving the vehicle forward or backward. Defendant’s train, travelling from west to east, struck the tractor and hurled it into plaintiffs’ automobile.</p>

      <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>Plaintiffs’ testimony was that the tractor-trailer had been stuck on the rails some three to five minutes prior to the approach of the train; that from <em>a, </em>point on the crossing, but not where the truck was stopped, the view in the direction of the train was clear for approximately one-half mile. But their evidence further showed that between the crossing and the train there was a bend in the tracks and that a number of railroad cars were stopped on a siding which parallels the main track. The witnesses also stated that, standing east of the crossing, these would obscure the view to the west. One witness stated that he had not stood in the eastbound track and looked west; and the other stated that from the north rail of the track he would not see the train because of the bend and the cars on the siding. It was not established that the crew had the view claimed or that they could have stopped soon enough to avoid the accident. Nor was it shown that the train crew knew or should have known that the tractor was on the tracks, in sufficient time to have stopped before striking it. Neither was there any proof that no audible warning of the train’s approach was given, although there was proof that the “flasher signals” were flashing and gave notice of its approach. None of the witnesses testified that they would have heard a whistle if it had been blown. The proof falls far short of proving negligent operation of the train. The following from <em>Guyler v. Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/165/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="165 Pa.

Their claim is that it was permitted to get into and remain in a state of disrepair, so that the resulting “holes” caused the tractor-trailer to get stuck. But, in this they also failed to sustain their burden. Their testimony established that despite the heavy snow and ice, the hazardous driving conditions, and the fact that one of the rear tires was smooth (which, if it spun would prevent the vehicle from moving), the tractor-trailer was not equipped with chains or any device to combat such conditions. They further established that the “ruts” were formed by the clear rails and the snow packing on the remaining portion of the crossing. There was no proof that the crossing was then in disrepair, although it was shown that there had been some complaints about its condition. Nor was it established that any defect resulting from disrepair caused the vehicle to be stuck on the crossing. On the contrary, the testimony was definite that the snow, rather than any defect in the crossing, caused the wheels to spin. Nor was there any evidence that the snow or ice should or could have been removed. In addition, the driver of the tractor-trailer testified that all of the road, including the crossing, was “icy.”</p>

Grotefend parked his automobile on private property adjacent to the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the vicinity of the crossing at Ferry Street in East Deer Township, Allegheny County. At about 5 p.m. of that day, Lester Marlow driving a huge tractor-trailer started over the crossing, but, arriving at the center of the crossing, his vehicle bogged down into ruts and depressions which, combined with the accumulated ice, made traction impossible. While he was thus helplessly immobilized, seeking desperately to move either forward or backward, a train approaching from the west, and without diminishing its speed, crashed into the trailer-truck with such violence as to hurl it 75 feet through the air and on to the top of the Grotefend <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>automobile, demolishing it entirely.

This rule does not permit a jury to decide in what manner a railroad company should perform its duty to the public at a particular point and to substitute its judgment for that of the company’s proper officers, but merely permits them to <em>pass on the question whether, under the circumstances described, taking into consideration the physical conditions of the crossing, the extent of its use by the public, the nature of the surroundings, the speed of the train, and other matters tending to show exceptional dangers incident to the particular locality, they performed their duty toward persons </em>using the highway.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

As the train approached to 25 car lengths from the crossing (1,000 feet), the fireman warned the engineer that there was “trouble up at the crossing.” The engineer, who stated that he was travel-ling 35 miles per hour, testified that when 800 feet from the crossing he saw the obstruction and applied his emergency brake. If he was travelling only 35 miles per hour, is it possible that with all the multiple air brakes on a modern locomotive he could not have stopped, or at least have reduced his speed to the point that he would not have hurtled the tractor-trailer 75 feet? Police officer Novasatt, witness to the accident, testified that the locomotive travelled 1,000 feet after the collision. Further, that he heard the air brakes being applied on the train <em>after </em>the collision: “Q. You worked around this crossing for a long time. Have you become accustomed to that kind of sound on a train. I mean this sound of the air, had you heard that kind of sound before frequently or not? A. Yes, sir. Q. What is that the sound of?

Even after audible and visual warning of the obstruction which lay athwart his track, he sped on with unabated velocity on the evident assumption that the obstruction would eventually animate enough to arise and get out of his way.</p>

Eight in the crossing plank. Q. In the plank? A. Yes. Q. Had you ever seen that hole there? A. <em>1 made it. </em>Q. You made it? A. That’s right.”</p>
    <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.6",478,[261,1759,1159,542]]]'>He testified further that the Township policeman constantly complained to him about the bad condition of the crossing: “A. He (the policeman) told me to patch up holes and to repair the crossing; and to repair the crossing, that is a big job. We generally patch up holes. Q. What do you mean by patching up holes? A. The holes that works the black top loose away from the rails, and we generally <em>go </em>around and patch it up. Q. What works the black top loose away from the rails? A. Vibration of the trains, I suppose.”</p>

      <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>The Majority Opinion says that “there was no proof that the crossing was then in disrepair.” But Officer Novasatt testified that there was a rut 6 inches deep at the very point where the tractor-trailer was stalled. He also testified that he notified the railroad foreman about the bad condition of the crossing: “Q. What did you tell him? A. The exact words? I told him it was a shame the way the crossing was kept. Q. Did you point out any specific illustration of what you were talking about? A. Yes. Q. What did you show him? A. <em>The holes in the crossing, </em>Q. Do you know when that was? A. <em>Prior to the accident </em>and after the accident. Q. Well, how long prior to the accident? A. I couldn’t tell you the exact time. Q. Can you estimate? A. Approximately a month or two before that. Q. You definitely know he was an employee of the Railroad? A. Yes, sir, definitely. The Court: Q. You know he is a track foreman? A. Yes, sir.”</p>
    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[154,1411,1151,876]]]'>It seems that the condition of the crossing had reached such a state of delapidation that people joked about it. The track foreman DeNunzio testified: “Q. Did I understand you to say he [Officer Novasatj did complain to you about the condition of the crossing? A. He is always joking with me about this crossing. Q. I am not talking about jokes. A. That is a fact. Q. Did he complain to you about the condition of the crossing? A. Sure. When we were patching the crossing he would say, 'Well, are you patching the crossing?’ Every time he saw me there he would talk about the crossing. Q. Did he complain about the condition of the crossing? A. He would complain about when we were going to rebuild it. I said, 'Rebuild a crossing is a big job.’ We had to wait until we got the materials.”</p>

Officer Novasatt was asked whether he observed what “was keeping the truck from moving forward.” He replied: “. . . The front end of the tractor wheels, the front end, was <em>in the rut </em>on the third rail looking north. Q. What was the nature of that rail at that point? A. The rut was at least approximately six inches deep there. Q. What was six inches deep? A. The rail was down in and as the traffic kept moving over sort of <em>made a hump and a gutter in there. </em>Q. Was the rail below the surface of the roadway? A. Yes, sir. Q. What was the condition of the roadway at that place where the front wheel was located? A. <em>It was dug in.”</em>

It requires some rather brave and accurate reasoning with some formidable display of precedent and authority to strike down a jury’s verdict on a fact-situation of that character. I fail to find in the Majority Opinion any such reasoning or any such parade of authority. One would have to search rather diligently through the law books <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>to find a case where negligence was more clearly established than it has been in this case.</p>

Grotefend will undoubtedly never park an automobile in the vicinity of a railroad track again, but from his experience with this lawsuit he will undoubtedly also feel that he should remain far away from the courts because, from his point of view, a collision with court-inspired law can be as devastating as a collision with a railroad locomotive.</p>
