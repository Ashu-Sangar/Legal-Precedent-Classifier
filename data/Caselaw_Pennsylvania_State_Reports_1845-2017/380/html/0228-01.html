She filed an application with the Zoning Division of ..the Department of Licenses and Inspections for a permit to use those premises for a school for physically handicapped children. The Zoning Division denied her application and, on appeal, the Zoning, Board of Adjustment likewise refused her request. Thereupon the plaintiff took her case to the Court of Common Pleas No. 3 of the County of Philadelphia, which reversed the decision of the Zoning Board- on the ground that its action was arbitrary, capricious, -and without foundation in the evidence, and it remanded the record to the Board with direction to issue the permit for which application had been made.

(7) Hospitals, sanitaria, eleemosynary and public institutions (other than correctional), provided, any such use is not prejudicial to the public health or welfare.” Subsection 21 provides: “Hospitals, sanitaria, eleemosynary and public institutions (other than correctional), shall be located at least seventy-five (75) feet from any adjoining lot or lots.”</p>

She has long conducted an institution for the education of such children at a property on City Line Avenue, which premises, however, have been sold, so that she now wishes to remove to the Drexel Road property. The school is licensed by the Private Schools Division of the Department of Public Instruction of this Commonwealth as a “private academic school or class in ‘special educa<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>tion . . . physically handicapped children’/’ and she is duly certificated as a teacher by that Department. The school is under the supervision, not of the Department of Welfare, which has general supervision of sanitaria, but of the Department of Public Instruction. None of the children in attendance are “mental eases” but are merely handicapped physically, all except one being afflicted with cerebral palsy. There are 36 students, 20 of whom commute daily from home and the remaining 16 board at the school because they come from distant points. Following the ordinary school schedule, classes are from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays, and the curriculum covers the courses which are generally given from kindergarten through high school; some of the graduates matriculate in college. There is the usual summer vacation period although 3 of the students who come from faraway places remain during the summer months because the distances from their homes prevent travel back and forth. The staff consists of from 18 to 20 persons, 12 of whom are instructors, the rest consisting of household employes and assistants who give manual aid to the children. The principal difference between this school and the public schools is the high ratio of teachers to students, thus making possible a smaller size of the classes and enabling the students to obtain more individualized attention.</p>

It is a school the same as any other private school except that its students are physi<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>eally handicapped.

The Zoning Board of Adjustment rejected the application for the same erroneous reason; moreover, it stated that the appeal to the Board was for a variance, which was likewise erroneous since the permit was not sought as a variance but demanded as a matter of right under the terms of the ordinance.</p>

In recent cases we felt this rule should prevail in all appeals to the Court of Common Pleas whenever testimony is taken in that Court: <em>Pincus v.

The reasons are obvious — there is no real difference in the various Statutes, and the Board of Adjustment cannot be guilty of an abuse of discretion if it did not have the advantage of hearing the testimony which was presented in the Common Pleas Court and which might have caused it to render an entirely different decision. For these reasons I am convinced that the correct test is and should be the one set forth in the most recent cases, viz.: <em>Dooling’s Windy Hill v. Springfield Township, Rolling Green Golf Club Case, Lord Appeal, Pincus v. Power </em>and <em>Silverco, Inc. v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em>supra.</p>
