We can appreciate the feelings possessed by many counsel who are greatly restricted by the decisions of this Court in their cross-examination of expert witnesses in this class of case; especially when the testimony appears to be unbelievable and inexplicable.

The opinion in the <em>Rea </em>case makes that plain beyond cavil. In the <em>Rea </em>case, one of the plaintiffs testified to a valuation for the appropriated land of $1,056,000. Counsel for defendant sought to cross-examine the witness as to what his father had paid for the property just two years and nine months before the condemnation and also sought “to show that there was no such increase in the market value of the property between June, 1900, and March, 1903, as would be indicated by the price paid for the property in June, 1900, and the estimate now given by the witness of its market value in March, 1903.” The offers were objected to “as not cross-examination, immaterial, irrelevant and incompetent”; and the objection was sustained. “The defendant made practically the same offer in its case in chief.” The price paid for the <em>Rea </em>property, as shown by the deed in evidence, which was limited to proving the grantee’s title, was $140,000. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for $775,133.33 which the parties agreed was composed of $616,000 principal and $159,133.33 compensation for delay in payment.</p>

However, the learned Justice immediately went on to say, — “But after serious consideration we have reached the conclusion that <em>under the peculiar facts of this case </em>the question as to the purchase price of the property in <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>June, 1900, was proper cross-examination and should have been allowed” (Emphasis supplied).

And, if there were such a rule, would not Mr. Justice Moschziskek, who was widely recognized as extremely well versed in the rules of law and evidence, have at once directly held that the proffered cross-examination was proper in such cases as a matter of a condemnor’s right in general instead of tying the decision to “the peculiar facts of this case”? And, what were “the peculiar facts”? The fact that the plaintiff witness was claiming a value of $1,056,000 for the land alone and the further fact that his ancestor had paid only $140,000 for both the land and buildings only two years and nine months before. Among the reasons given by Mr. Justice Moschzisker for allowing the cross-examination as to what the grantee had paid for the property was “the disparity between the price paid and the value claimed”.</p>

That was in <em>Greenfield v. </em>Philadelphia, supra. The <em>Greenfield </em>case is truly <em>sui generis. </em>There, the condemnation was not of an entire property to which the purchase price as a whole bore relation. The appropriation embraced no more than a strip 5 feet in width across the frontage on Chestnut Street of a plot of ground situate at the southwest corner of Chestnut and 15th Streets in Philadelphia. The lot fronted 79.2 feet on Chestnut Street and ran back, preserving an even width throughout, for a distance of 142.08 feet to Ionic Street. The lot had erected upon it a then obsolete hotel. Greenfield had acquired this property and a smaller lot directly across Ionic Street by deed dated March 6, 1922, in pursuance of his agreement of purchase of December preceding. The total consideration for the two properties was $1,887,500 of which, according to the purchaser, $1,762,500 represented the purchase price of the Chestnut Street property.

However, because of an ordinance of the City of Philadelphia of <em>March 31, 1884, </em>which widened Chestnut Street from 50 to 60 feet, the owner was obliged to keep his new building back 5 feet from the old Chestnut Street building line.</p>

The viewers awarded the claimant $40,158.24, and the City appealed to the Court of Common Pleas. At the trial of the issue in the Court of Common Pleas the valuations for the property immediately before and immediately after the condemnation, as testified to by the experts on both sides (on the assumption that the date of the taking was January 2, 1923), had no identifiable significance to the damage, if any, due to the widening of the Chestnut Street sidewalk by 5 feet in 1923. In the course of the trial, the court permitted the City to cross-examine the owner relative to what he had paid for the Chestnut Street property upon taking title thereto just nine months before. The owner’s real estate experts variously testified to a valuation for the property, minus the 5-foot strip, as of January 2, 1923, from, respectively, $120,000 to $780,000 more than he had paid for it. The City’s experts testified that the property (especially for a tall office building use) had been benefited more than it had lost by the reduction in area occasioned by the widening of the Chestnut Street sidewalk by 5 feet and that, conse<a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>quently, the owner had not been damaged. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant City on which judgment was entered.</p>
    <p id="b64-4" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[245,509,1161,1714]]]'>The owner appealed and assigned for error, inter alia, the trial court’s having permitted the defendant to cross-examine him with respect to what he had paid for the property. This court affirmed, citing <em>Rea v. Pittsburg &amp; Connellsville Railroad Company, </em>supra. The fact of the matter is that the <em>Rea </em>case is in no sense analogous. There were no “peculiar facts” in the <em>Greenfield </em>case as there were in the <em>Rea </em>case justifying such cross-examination. In short, there was no patent “disparity between the price paid and the value claimed”. Moreover, in the <em>Rea </em>case, the whole of the property to which the purchase price related was taken whereas, in the <em>Greenfield </em>case, the 5-foot strip appropriated was but three and a half per cent of the area of the whole lot to which the purchase price applied. Nevertheless, the <em>Rea </em>case was cited to justify the cross-examination which, presumably, produced the verdict for the defendant. Thus, a rule expressly intended for application only in exceptional circumstances was applied to a case without exceptional circumstances. If Mr. Greenfield was damaged by an appropriation of the front 5 feet of his Chestnut Street lot for a public improvement, he had a constitutional right to be paid for it. On that basis, the permitted cross-examination was harmful error. However,- it is not clear that the plaintiff had a claim for damages. Cf. <em>Berkley v. Jeannette, </em>supra. He had bought, with knowledge that,, by virtue of the 1881 ordinance, he could not erect a new structure on the front 5 feet of his lot. That inhibition was undoubtedly reflected in a reduced purchase price.</p>

In the <em>Goodman </em>case, the condemnor was denied the right so to cross-examine the owner who had purchased the property about a year before the taking. On appeal, this court affirmed the ruling in an opinion by Mr. Justice Steen who said that, under the facts of that case (viz., an exchange of properties), the proposed cross-examination would have “necessitated an investigation into the value of these other properties which would undoubtedly have been confusing to the jury.” In the <em>Luts </em>case there was actually no attempt to cross-examine the owner as to what he had paid for the 78-acre farm of himself and wife which the county condemned for a public purpose. The nearest counsel for the county came to inquiring into the purchase price was when the husband, who had testified to a value for the buildings on the farm in excess of §11,000, was asked whether that was not more than he had paid for both land and buildings seven years before. On appeal to this court the question was held to have been harmless as the price which the husband had paid for the farm had come out in the plaintiffs’ case through one of their own witnesses. This court went on, however, by way of a pure gratuity, to add that “Moreover, plaintiff could have been asked on cross-examination the direct question as to what he had paid for the property [citing] <em>Greenfield v. Phila., </em><a href="/pa/282/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="282 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1088400" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0344-01">282 Pa. 344</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.%20768" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="127 A. 768">127 A. 768</a>.” Thus, what had begun as a very restricted rule in the <em>Ilea </em>case became, with only one case intervening (viz., <em>Greenfield v. Philadelphia), </em>a general rule by way of a dictum in the <em>Luts </em>case. And, while it is of no present moment, a reading of the <em>Luts </em>case will con<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>vince that it abundantly supplied the “peculiar facts” necessary to make the rule of the <em>Rea </em>case applicable.</p>

Whether the given case is exceptional, that is, presents the “peculiar facts” which make cross-examination of an owner as to what he paid for the condemned property proper, is, as Mr. Justice Moschzisker said in the <em>Rea </em>case, “always . . . one for the exercise of discretion on the part of the trial judge.” But, in addition to that, whether the particular purchase or sale is too remote to be of any evidentiary value is, as the majority opinion concedes, also a matter calling for an exercise of the trial court’s discretion.</p>

In an opinion for the Court of Appeals of New York, in which Judge Cardozo concurred, it was said that “Remoteness, [of evidence] . . . does not necessarily result from mere lapse of time, which is not necessarily an element of it. Its essence is such a want of open and visible connection between the evidentiary and the principal facts that, all things considered, the former are not worthy or safe to be admitted in proof of the latter. . . .

Consequently, unless trials are to become fleeting and ineffectual episodes, an exercise of judicial trial discretion is not to be rejected or disturbed on appeal “save for manifest abuse”: <em>Thompson v.

About a year later, viz., on July 19, 1947, at a time when foreclosure of a defaulted mortgage on the property was threatened, Berger contracted to sell the property to one Speer for a consideration of $36,-000. The proposed sale was never consummated, however, due to the inability of the buyer to finance his purchase. Thereafter, title to the property became vested in Berger and his wife as tenants by the entire-ties. On February 28, 1951, the Berger property was one of a number of properties condemned by the Pub-<a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>lie Parking Authority of Pittsburgh. Meanwhile, unusually rapid and unprecedentedly extensive building activity in Pittsburgh served to enhance the value of real estate in the “Golden Triangle”. The land in that area available for private uses (business and otherwise) had become more and more limited due to the physical constrictions of the section imposed by two converging rivers and a topographical barrier from one river to the other back some distance from the confluence. The natural relative scarcity of privately usable property within the particular area was still further intensified by increased appropriations of land for public uses. Indeed, the testimony of the Parking Authority’s own real estate witnesses fully confirmed the sudden and continuing increase in the value of real estate in downtown Pittsburgh.</p>

At the ensuing jury trial, the court refused to permit the defendant either to cross-examine Berger with reference to the Berger-Speer contract of 1947 or to allow independent introduction of the contract on the ground that the matter sought to be elicited was <em>too remote. </em>The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for $64,385, certainly not an unconscionable sum when you consider that there was an additional year and two months delay in payment since the viewers’ award and a witness for the defendant conceded a value of $45,000 for the property at the time of the taking.</p>

He is constantly faced with questions on evidence in their special relation to the issue to be tried. He must deal with such questions in the light of the purposes of the ultimate inquiry and does so in the exercise of what is known as judicial discretion. He should see that nothing relevant is excluded, so long as its admission will not unduly distract the attention of the jury from the main inquiry, by first requiring the ascertainment of an unnecessary quantity of subordinate facts from which the main inferences would ultimately be made. His conclusion or decision on such points will not be interfered with on appeal save for manifest abuse of power. He must, therefore, determine in the first instance whether evidence which, though logically relevant on the ultimate issue, may nevertheless be excluded, because its general effect on the trial will be to confuse <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>the issue by distracting the attention of the jury from the primary to collateral issues . . .</p>

The exclusion of collateral matter is so much within the discretion of a trial court as, virtually, to be unreviewable on appeal save for what clearly amounts to palpable error. Prudent and experienced trial judges are ever cautious not to permit, under the guise of impeaching a witness’s credibility, cross-examination as to collateral matter which, of itself, may have a direct bearing on the issue being tried.</p>
