The jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed the penalty at death. On this appeal from the judgment of sentence, the defendant assigns two alleged trial errors. He does not assert, however, that they entitle him to a new trial. His counsel frankly state that the seven witnesses called by the defendant (he himself did not take the stand) were produced “in an effort to raise the issue of punishment.” Appellant’s sole contention is that the matters whereof he now complains helped motivate the jury in fixing the penalty at death rather than life imprisonment and that, consequently, this court should substitute the latter penalty for the former.

The lack of power in a court to change the penalty as specified by the jury for a conviction of first degree murder has been scrupulously regarded by this court ever since the duty of fixing the penalty in capital cases was first reposed in the jury by the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 759. Since that date, there has not been a single instance where the penalty for a first degree murder, as fixed by the jury, has been interfered with on appeal — a fact which we have heretofore remarked several times: <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Taranow; <em>Commonwealth v.

The téstimony adduced by the defendant related, almost in its entirety, to his drinking and drunkenness the afternoon and night before the fatal shooting.: The learned trial judge, after correctly instructing thé jury that drunkenness does’not' exculpáte for the commission óf ¿ crime; went on to explain that the one instance' in'which' drunkenness is of importance, so far as the substantive offense is concerned, is in determining the degree of the' crime “where thé defendant is charged with murder which involves a wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, with specific intent to take life.” The trial judge told the .jury <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>that, if the defendant’s drunkenness was such that he was incapable of forming a specific intent to take life, then the homicide could not be raised above second degree murder. But, the court further properly instructed the jury in the instant case that they had nothing to do with a specific intent to take life as the killing, here involved, was committed in the perpetration of a robbery — a fact, which the defendant’s confession not only freely admitted but described in detail. The court’s charge in this respect was in strict accord with our pronouncement in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Simmons, supra, that “Where ... a murder is committed in the perpetration of a robbery or a burglary it is, irrespective of any question of intent, murder in the first degree, and therefore the fact that this defendant may have been drinking to excess was of no legal significance as bearing upon the degree of his crime: Commonwealth v.

And, defendant’s counsel must have so regarded it; they took no exception to it; nor did they request anything additional. What we said in <em>Commonwealth v. Simmons, </em>supra, is particularly apposite, — “It is true, as defendant argues, that the question of intoxication was important in connection with the determination of the penalty, and it is said that the court should have stressed this phase of the matter to the jury, but the element of intoxication and all other possibly mitigating circumstances were covered by the court’s statement in its charge, several times repeated, that the jury were to determine the penalty only as the result of a full consideration of <em>all </em>the facts and circumstances disclosed by the testimony and <em>all </em>the information brought out about him at the trial; this would include his mental capacity and his state of intoxication as tending to prove a condition of diminished responsibility; it was not necessary for the trial judge to discuss in detail each of the factors, pro and con, that would properly enter into their consideration of the penalty to be imposed [citing <em>Commonwealth v. Wooding, </em>supra].” Here, likewise, the jury were instructed that, should they find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, then “if from all the evidence in the case you find circumstances of mitigation which would lead you to inflict or impose the lesser punishment then you would have the right to impose the penalty of life imprisonment” and,' further, if “you feel that the defendant is. guilty of the first degree and that there are mitigating circumstances and that the lesser punishment is required under the circumstances, it is equally your duty, and you should be equally courageous to say so <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>by your verdict.” There is obviously not the slightest merit in the appellant’s first assignment.</p>

The time was fixed by two residents of the neighborhood each of whom testified that he heard loud talk followed by four shots fired. The police were summoned and a police radio ear containing two policemen arrived at the scene of the crime in three to four minutes. They found the victim, Isaac Teitelbaum, staggering in his bedroom, grievously wounded. One of the shots struck Teitelbaum in the mouth, plowing his tongue and passing through and out the back of his neck, seriously injuring his tongue and the wall of his throat. He was bleeding from the mouth; there was blood down the front of his pajamas and a pool of blood on the floor. He seemed to want to say something, but it was difficult for him to talk. He was “more or less gasping” as he tried to communicate something to the policeman. They started at once to take him to the hospital in their car. On the way there, a distance of some eight blocks, Teitelbaum did manage to say in the hearing of both policemen, — “I offered the robber twelve dollars and begged him not to shoot.” Within a few minutes after they arrived at the hospital, the physician in charge forebade the police to question Teitelbaum because of the serious hemorrhaging that had set in. He died from shock and loss of blood less than two hours later.</p>

That he is in such condition may be shown by the nature of his wounds and the result thereof. ... As stated in Wigmore on Evidence (2d ed.), volume 3, page 172: ‘We may avail ourselves of any means of inferring the existence of such knowledge [that the declarant knew he was about to die]; and if, in a given case, the nature of the wound is such that the declarant must have realized his situation, our object is sufficiently attained. Such is the settled judicial attitude.’ It is not necessary for the declarant to state that his declarations are made under a sense of impending dissolution [citing cases].” In <em>Commonwealth v.

Even though this may not be the case for intervention of that character, I believe it is serious error to declare that in no case after a jury’s verdict may the Supreme <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>Court of Pennsylvania substitute life imprisonment for death. I fear that the constant repetition of this error will finally enthrone it as authority, not because of any inherent law, logic or justice in the utterance, but simply because of the numerousness with which it is proclaimed. In the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Onda, </em><a href="/pa/376/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="376 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1246174" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0405-01">376 Pa. 405</a>, this Court stated that it had all the powers exercised by the Court of' King’s Bench in England and that under those practically unlimited powers “it protects the liberty of the subject, <em>by speedy and summary </em>interposition.” In a demonstration of that awesome power, this Court prohibited the Court of Quarter Sessions of Allegheny County from imposing sentence on a convicted Communist seditionist.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

    <p id="b90-4" data-blocks='[["BL_90.4",90,[244,1123,1155,598]]]'>Taking the pronouncement of this Court in the <em>Onda </em>case and other cases as binding precedents, it is difficult to understand how the Majority can say that it lacks power to transform a sentence of death into life imprisonment regardless of arguments advanced in behalf of such transformation. If this Court can and does reduce money verdicts in civil cases on the proposition that its conscience is shocked because of the size of the verdict, it is shocking to say that in the proper ease and where justice requires it (and this is not that case), it cannot save human life.</p>
    <p id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[243,1735,1153,153]],["BL_91.1",91,[154,357,1145,154]]]'>It is admitted that this Court has, or at least exercises, the power to change a death sentence into life imprisonment where the penalty has been fixed by <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>three judges. If, in the opinion of this Court, three learned, trained and experienced judges may err, why exclude the possibility that twelve laymen might err?</p>
    <p id="b91-4" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[153,525,1145,266]]]'>I believe that it is necessary that this expression of dissent be written, filed and printed so that the legal world may know that this Court is not of one mind when it says that it may not save the life of a convicted person when justice demands that it be done.</p>

      <p id="b90-6" data-blocks='[["BL_90.6",90,[242,1948,1154,363]]]'> The tremendous power of this Court was exercised to the extent that although the convicted Communist seditionist in that case petitioned for only four months delay, almost a year has now passed since his petition and Onda still enjoys the asylum of the State of New York, to which he fled in order to avoid receiving the sentence he merited for the heinous crime of seeking to overthrow the government of the United States and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
