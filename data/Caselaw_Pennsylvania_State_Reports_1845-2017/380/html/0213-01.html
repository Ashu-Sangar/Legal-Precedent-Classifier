      <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>The appeals involve the construction of a will, which testamentary document consists of the will and nine codicils. Testatrix created eight income funds. By the fourth codicil she made the following provision: “Item: It is my wish and I hereby order and direct that all the Trusts created in my Will and Codicils which have not already ended by their own limitations shall absolutely cease and determine at the end of fifty years from the date of my death; and I direct that at the expiration of the said term of fifty years all legacies shall be paid over absolutely to the parties entitled thereto under my said Will and Codicils. . . .” The words of this codicil require judicial interpretation. A residuary beneficiary, appellant, contends that the words are too indefinite to identify the beneficiaries intended and that the court, being unable to reform the will, should decide that such bequests fall into the residue. The charities, on the contrary, contend that in the light of the surrounding circumstances it was the plain intent of testatrix that the church organizations so receiving the income for fifty years should receive the principal. In a comprehensive adjudication, unanimously approved by the court in banc, the learned court below decided that testatrix intended the charities which have received the income for fifty years should be awarded the principal.</p>

In her will she made substantial and adequate provision for all of the persons who had any claim upon her generosity, particularly her adopted daughter and her children, and her nieces and nephews, the children of her brother, Edward N. Benson, to whom she left her residuary estate in addition to large pecuniary legacies.</p>
