He further alleged that defendant agreed to hold the title in trust for him and to convey it to him upon demand but has refused to make such conveyance. He therefore sought a decree declaring defendant a constructive trustee for himself as the real owner.</p>

These findings, affirmed by the court en banc, were based upon the chancellor’s well-justified conclusion that, far from meeting the prescribed standard of evidence, plaintiff’s testimony was vague, evasive, contradictory and unconvincing, whereas defendant’s testimony was straight-forward, credible, and corroborated in all important details by the other witnesses.
