It appears that one S. Leroy Wingate was the owner in 1923 of a large tract of vacant land known as “Wood-crest” in what is now the 50th Ward of the City of Philadelphia. It covers an area of about six city blocks, extending from Vernon Road on the south to Mt. Airy Avenue on the north and from Forrest Avenue on the east to Rodney Street on the west. On each of the lots therein that were sold and conveyed from time to time Wingate imposed the following building restriction: “That not more than one (1) house, same to be detached or semi-detached, and private garage shall be erected on each lot with a frontage of at least 24 feet . . . .” Defendants became the purchasers of a portion of the tract, namely, the block bounded by Gorgas Street on the north, Vernon Road on the south, Thouron Avenue on .the east and Gilbert Street on the west. . They have built 14 semi-detached two-story houses along the west side of Thouron Avenue between Gorgas Street' and Vernon Road, 12 of which are not involved in the present controversy; the issue concerns only the two end structures at the southwest corner of Thouron Avenue and Gorgas Street and the northwest corner of Vernon Road and Thouron Avenue respectively. These two are identical in outward appearance with all the others except that <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>they are 3' 6" wider and 6/ 2" longer in depth and that they each have two entrances on the Thouron Avenue front and a basement entrance on the side street; one of the front entrances leads to a stairway directly up to the second floor, so that each of these properties contains a basement apartment, a first floor apartment, and a second floor apartment, thus providing for occupancy by three families.</p>
    <p id="b93-4" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[169,803,1149,878]]]'>Plaintiffs own and occupy the house at the northwest corner of Thouron Avenue and Gorgas Street and brought the present bill in equity for an order on defendants to discontinue the erection of houses for occupancy by more than one family. The two corner structures were 85% completed when the bill was filed, but plaintiffs allege that they were misled and deceived by defendants and did not become aware until immediately before they began their action that those properties were to contain three-family apartments. The court below entered a decree in favor of plaintiffs, prohibiting the building by defendants of any three-unit apartment house. Defendants appeal from that decree, contending that the building restriction did not prevent them from constructing “houses” accommodating more than a single family.</p>

The court pointed out that the objection raised was to the use to which the building was being devoted and not to the erection of the building, and (p. 399, A. p. 865) that “Such restrictions . . . are not extended beyond their plain and necessary intent.” The building having been erected as a dwelling house there was no violation of the terms of the restriction merely because of the subsequent use to which it was put.</p>

It was again' pointed out that the covenant was directed only against the construction, not its subsequent use. The court said (p. 420, A. p. 505): “The fact that the building proposed is a <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>single structure intended for dwelling purposes brings it within what is permitted under the restriction; the fact that it is intended to accommodate a number of families does not bring it within what is forbidden.”</p>

The court said (p. 299, A. p. 1051) : “We agree with the court below that the stipulation was for a single house or structure, and not for a house for a single family; and that, if the latter had been intended, it would have been easy to say so.” And it was once more repeated that “ ‘Covenants of this nature, which restrain a man in the free enjoyment of his property are not to be extended by implication.’ ”</p>

It does not extend to limitations arising by implication: . . . . Under clause (a) of the restrictive covenant, only ‘houses’ could be built upon the property. ‘House,’ in common speech, embraces ‘every form of structure for human habitation’ . . . .” Accordingly it was held that the erection of an apartment house on the lot did not violate the restriction.</p>

Cases hereinbefore referred to were cited with approval and the same principles were repeated (pp. 515, 516, A. p. 63), namely, that “Restrictions . . . [cannot] be enforced, unless they appear in express terms. . . . Reservations upon the use of land are never favored by the law; hence it follows that such provisions are never to be extended by implication.”</p>
    <p id="b96-4" data-blocks='[["BL_96.4",96,[242,1012,1156,266]],["BL_97.1",97,[180,354,1150,1996]],["BL_98.1",98,[235,345,1155,200]]]'>It will thus be seen that all the authorities<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> are uniform to the effect that a restriction against the erection of a building other than a “house” or a “dwelling house” is a restriction only in regard to the type of construction and not the subsequent use, and that if any re<a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>striction on use is intended it should be plainly expressed and not left to implication. Of course, the term “house,” like all other terms, does not have an unlimited connotation. While it is defined in Webster’s International Dictionary as “A structure intended or used for human habitation; especially, a human habitation which ... is intended for the private occupation of a family or families,” its common and accepted import certainly does not cover the conception, for example, of a large modem apartment building. But there is a difference between such a building and a structure which in size and appearance, as in the present case, conforms to the popular idea of a “house” and is generally so regarded even though it may be occupied by two or three families and therefore become designated as an “apartment house.” It is this difference that distinguishes the case of <em>Bennett v. Lane Homes Inc., </em><a href="/pa/369/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="369 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1232342" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0509-01">369 Pa. 509</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20273" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="87 A.2d 273">87 A. 2d 273</a>, — the case which the court below erroneously thought was determinative of the present issue. There the restriction was that “not more than one house, same to be detached or semi-detached, and private garage to be used in connection therewith, shall be erected on each lot with a frontage of at least 24 feet.” It was held that this restriction prevented the erection of a three-story, 34-unit apartment building built on a frontage of 9 lots on one street and 6 lots on another, with overall dimensions of 151 feet by 160 feet, and which, since it was intended to house 34 families, would require a multitude of mechanics, janitors, and other service personnel. And while it might be objected that the- difference thus pointed out is merely one of degree, we may remind ourselves that, as Mr. Justice Holmes observed, many, if not most, legal questions resolve themselves into problems of degree rather than of kind. A 34-family apartment building is <em>not, </em>in ordinary parlance, a “house,” but a two-<a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>story structure practically identical in size and appearance with all the other houses on the block <em>is </em>a house, even though it may be referred to as an “apartment house” if it accommodates two or three families.</p>
    <p id="b98-4" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[229,566,1160,879]]]'>It is our conclusion, therefore, that there is nothing in the present restriction that “not more than one house shall be erected on each lot” which would justify an interpretation that would make it read: “that not more than one <em>single-family </em>house shall be erected on each lot.” If the restriction were so intended it should have been so expressed. And in view of that conclusion it becomes unnecessary to discuss other questions raised by defendants, such as plaintiffs’ laches, their acquiescence in previous violations of the restriction, the alleged change in the neighborhood, and the admissibility of testimony of the original grantor, Win-gate, that the restriction was not intended to limit the number of families in the individual dwelling and that by the expression “one house” there was meant merely “a single edifice.”</p>

The court said (p. 85, A. p. 330) that “If . . . they had restricted the use of the land to one <em>dwelling house </em>. . .an apartment house would have been within this agreement.”</p>
