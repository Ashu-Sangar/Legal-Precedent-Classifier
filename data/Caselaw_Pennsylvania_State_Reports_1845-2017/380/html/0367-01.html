Clark, </em>372 Pa., supra, the Court specifically held that paragraph or clause (7) of the City-County Consolidation Amendment was self-executing and became effective immediately upon its adoption, to wit, November 6, 1951. This Court, again speaking through the Chief Justice, said (pages 363-4, 370) : <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>“We start with the City-County Consolidation Amendment itself. It provides in clause (1) that ‘In Philadelphia all county offices are hereby abolished, and the city shall henceforth perform all functions of county government within its area through officers selected in such manner as may be provided by law.’ The crucial words there , to be noted are <em>‘hereby* </em>and <em>‘henceforth.’ </em>The county offices are abolished, not at some indefinite time in the future when a legislative body might so enact, but <em>‘hereby,’ </em>that is, by virtue of the constitutional amendment itself, which in this respect, therefore, is obviously self-executing. It will be further noted that all the functions of county government, that is to say, all the activities or duties theretofore performed by the county officers, are <em>thenceforth </em>to be performed by the city; the city is to take over <em>then and there, </em>as part of its own government, the performance of the functions of the county government. This provision also is clearly self-executing. Clause (6) of the amendment provides: ‘This amendment shall become effective <em>immediately upon its </em>adoption.’ Clause (7) provides that ‘Upon adoption of this amendment all county officers shall become officers of the city of Philadelphia.’ Here again the amendment is manifestly self-executing, for the change from county to city officers is to take place <em>upon adoption of the </em>amendment— which, incidentally, occurred on November 6, 1951— and therefore without the necessity of any further action, legislative or otherwise. Thus the county offices were effectually brought into the structure of the municipal government. And of course, when the county officers became city officers their employes automatically became thereby city employes. It is true that clause (7) further states that ‘until the General Assembly shall otherwise provide,’ the county officers [having now become officers of the City of Philadelphia] ‘shall <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>continue to perform their duties and be elected, appointed, compensated and organized in such manner as may be provided by the provisions of this Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth in effect at the time this amendment becomes effective, . . . ’. In other words the county, now city, officers were to carry on their duties or functions just as before the transformation took place and <em>until such duties or functions should be changed by legislative action. </em>*. . .”</p>
    <p id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.4",403,[168,847,1151,767]]]'>It is crystal clear from the Constitutional Amendment itself, as well as from the aforesaid decisions of this Court, that no act of the Legislature or of City Council was necessary to abolish county offices; and no ordinance of City Council and no City Charter which was framed and adopted by the people of Philadelphia could transfer or change the duties and functions of former county officers because the <em>Constitutional Amendment itself clearly provided </em>that “all [former] county officers shall continue [as city officers] to perform their duties and be elected [or] appointed, compensated • and organized, as may be provided by . . . existing laws <em>until the General Assembly shall otherwise </em>provide.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>

Furthermore, to pile Pelion on Ossa, for a hundred years the people of Pennsylvania have known that the words “General Assembly” mean the legislature, and in every village, township and farm they likewise know the difference between the General Assembly or State Legislature and a local council. When, therefore, the Constitutional Amendment which was adopted on November 6, 1951 — not, we repeat, by the citizens of Philadelphia, but by the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania — provided that all county officers should continue to perform their duties “. . . <em>until the General Assembly shall otherwise provide” </em>the people of Pennsylvania did not mean “until the citizens of Philadelphia” or “until the City Council of Philadelphia shall otherwise provide”; they meant beyond the peradventure of a doubt what they so unmistakably said: <em>“until the General Assembly shall othemoise provide.”</em>

The City overlooks (1) that on November 6, 1951 there were approximately a dozen <em>existing </em>laws of the Commonwealth which dealt specifically with the Board of Revision of Taxes or with other County offices, and it is these laws to which the Constitutional Amendment clearly and unquestionably refers; and (2) that the City Charter was not enacted by the General Assembly after November 6, 1951.</p>

Undoubtedly, therefore, <em>if </em>the Board of Revision had then been a <em>city </em>office, the City of Philadelphia, under the powers thus given by the Act, and having adopted a charter’as authorized by it, would have had the power to do what it is now attempting to do by the Ordinance of August 16, 1954, namely, to abolish that Board and transfer its powers and duties to the office of Chief Assessor and the Tax Review Board. But it must be borne in mind that at the time of the adoption of the Home Rule Act the City-County Consolidation Amendment had not yet come into being; therefore the Act had relation, and could have had relation, only to the components of the municipal structure as it then existed and of which the county offices were not a part. On November 6, 1951, the City-County Consolidation Amendment was adopted by the electorate and became a part of the Constitution of the Common<a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>wealth and thereby the supreme law. It provided that the county offices were abolished and that all their functions were thereafter to be performed by the city. Accordingly, we held in the <em>Lennox </em>case that by virtue of the Amendment the <em>employes </em>of the county offices automatically became city employes and, as such, subject to all the laws then in existence governing such employes. By the same token, the same result would have been achieved in the case of the county <em>officers </em>were it not for the fact that the Amendment, after providing that all the county officers should thereupon become officers of the City of Philadelphia, chose, by Clause (7), to place an express restriction upon the process of <em>“intra </em>city consolidation” by providing that <em>“until the General Assembly shall otherwise provide </em>they should <em>“continue to perform their duties </em>and be elected, appointed, compensated and organized in such manner as may be provided by the provisions of this Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth <em>in effect at the time this amendment becomes effective, </em>... .” In other words, what the Amendment practically said was that, although the Home Rule Act of 1949 gave the city the power of determining its own municipal structure, now that the county offices are being added to that structure this is being done subject to the proviso or restriction that the officers should continue to carry out their duties in the same manner as they were then doing under the laws then in effect, which is equivalent to saying that their functions could not be taken over by other persons or agencies until and unless the General Assembly should otherwise so provide. Obviously, upon the abolition of a county office its officers could no longer “continue to perform their duties” as at the time of the adoption of the City-County Consolidation Amendment. Nor were the laws <em>then </em>in effect regulating the manner in which the <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>county officers were to perform their duties in any way altered or affected by the mere fact that the Legislature had previously, in 1949, authorized Philadelphia to adopt a Home Rule Charter. Moreover, it seems to me impossible, in view of the future tense of the verb “shall provide,” to interpret Clause (7) as meaning other than that the county officers should continue to perform their duties until the General Assembly should otherwise <em>thereafter </em>provide. Speaking as of November 6, 1951, the Amendment evidently intended that any change in regard to the performance of their duties by the county officers would have to be by future action of the General Assembly dealing specifically with that subject.</p>

It chose to adopt the latter method, and, by the Act of August 26, 1953, P.L. 1476, it vested the Council with “full powers to legislate with respect to the election, appointment, compensation, organization, abolition, merger, consolidation, powers, functions and duties” of several of the former county offices, but it withheld such grant of power in the case of the Sheriff, the City Commissioners, the Board of Revision of Taxes, and the Registration Commission. The vesting in the Council of the power with respect to the other offices was clearly valid.</p>

Nor does the answer depend upon whether the term “General Assembly”, as employed in Clause 7 of the Consolidation Amendment, means “General Assembly”, — an inquiry to which the majority opinion so largely devotes itself to the exclusion of the real issue presented. We are all agreed that, of course, “General Assembly” means the General Assembly of the Commonwealth and not the Council of the consolidated City-County of Philadelphia. The proper approach to the problem is contained in the admonition of Mr. Chief Justice Steen in <em>Carrow v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/371/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="371 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1237085" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0255-01">371 Pa. 255</a>, 257, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20496" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="89 A.2d 496">89 A. 2d 496</a>, where he said that “The solution of the legal problem presented is entirely free from difficulty if the controlling enactments are read with an eye to their plain and unequivocal meaning instead of with a straining after forced constructions <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>and a seeking of ambiguities where none exist.” See, also, the same effect <em>Lennox v.

The present inquiry, just as in the <em>Car-row </em>and <em>Lennox </em>cases, is but a part of the same <em>sui generis </em>subject-matter.

Section 17 of the Home Rule Act of 1949 invested the City with power to include in its Home Rule Charter (1) “all powers and authority of local self-government”, (2) “complete powers of legislation- and administration . in relation to its municipal functions”, (3) “the..exercise of any and all powers relating to its municipal functions ■. . . to the. full extent that the General Assembly may legislate in reference thereto as to cities of the first class, and with like effect” and (4) power to “enact ordinances, rules .and regulations necessary and proper for carrying into., execution the foregoing ..powers, and all other., powers, rested in the <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>city by the charter it adopts or by this or any other law.” And, Section 1-100 of the Home Rule Charter, in avowed pursuance of the Home Rule Constitutional Amendment of 1922 (Art.

That the abolition of the office and the transfer of its functions was immediate, no one can deny. As Mr. Chief Justice Steen said in the <em>Lennox </em>case, with respect to Clause 1 of the Amendment, — “The crucial words there to be noted are <em>‘hereby’ </em>and <em>‘henceforth.’ </em>The county offices are abolished, not at some indefinite time in the future when a legislative body might so enact, but ‘hereby/ that is, by virtue of the constitutional amendment itself, which in this respect, therefore, is obviously self-executing. It-will be-further-noted that all the functions of county government, that is to say, all the activities or duties theretofore performed by the county officers, are <em>thenceforth </em>to be performed by the city; the city is to -take over <em>then and there, </em>as part of its own government, the performance of the <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>functions of the county government.” Where, then, is the necessity for a further Act of Assembly before the City, in the exercise of its Home Rule powers, can perform the functions which Clause 1 of the Amendment specifically imposed upon it?</p>
    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[243,626,1156,1658]]]'>The Consolidation Amendment (Article XIV, Section 8) provides in Clause 7 that “until the General Assembly shall otherwise provide”, the incumbent officers of the abolished County offices (who by the same Clause became, forthwith, City officers) “shall continue to perform their duties and be elected, appointed, compensated and organized” as provided by the “Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth in effect at the time this amendment becomes effective . . . .” On the basis of that provision, the plaintiffs argue that the Board of Revision of Taxes, as such, continues to exist and that the functions of the office cannot be committed to the City’s disposition except by a further Act of Assembly. Plainly enough, the contention not only ignores but, once adopted, will effectively nullify the express language of the first clause of the Amendment which abolished the office and transferred all its <em>functions </em>to the City. By what reason or logic can such an interpretation be justified? The majority say Clause 7 is a constitutional provision and therefore supreme. So much may be granted, but that does not make it supreme over Clause 1. Both are integral parts of the same constitutional Amendment and must be read together and reconciled and each given its intended effect. There is not the slightest justification for intérpreting Clause 7 so as to nullify the primary purpose of the Amendment as contained in Clause 1, viz., the consolidation of the City and County governments by abolishing the County offices and reposing all of their functions in the City.</p>

      <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>There is no conflict between Clause 1 and Clause 7. They respectively apply to different phases of the consolidation. Clause 1 applies to County <em>offices </em>all of which it abolished and whose functions it committed to the City with neither qualification nor restriction. Clause 7 applies to the <em>officers </em>of the abolished County offices and the duties, powers, etc. of such officers <em>in a certain contingency </em>which we shall hereinafter consider. As we observed in <em>Suermann v. Hadley, </em><a href="/pa/327/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="327 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1176710" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0190-01">327 Pa. 190</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.%20645" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="193 A. 645">193 A. 645</a>, — “There is a vast difference between abolishing an office and removing the incumbents of an office.” It was held in that case that, although the terms of the members of the Board of Revision of Taxes could not be terminated without violating Article VI, Section 4, of the State Constitution, the abolition of the office itself was no violation of that constitutional provision- — a principle presently recognized by the last part of Clause 7 which permits the County officers serving when the Amendment became effective to complete their terms. It follows that, apart from the portion of Clause 7 hereinbefore quoted, there was no constitutional requirement that the officers of the abolished County offices be permitted to perform any of the duties of their former offices as City officers. What, then, was the intendment of Clause 7 in respect of a possible further Act of Assembly?</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[167,1790,1148,543]],["BL_416.1",416,[331,337,1165,1427]]]'>The purpose of Clause 7 is both evident and understandable. Indeed, it was a necessity in the circumstances of charter formulation and promulgation, on the one hand, and City-County consolidation, on the other, both of which proceeded more or less abreast for somewhat the same period of time through requisite legislative and electoral processes. When the resolution providing for the submission of the proposed Consolidation Amendment was first introduced at the legislative session of 1949 it obviously could not then be <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>known and, consequently, was not known whether a home rule charter for Philadelphia under an Act introduced and enacted at the same 1949 legislative session would ever be adopted. Clause 7 of the proposed Amendment was, therefore, advisedly drafted so as to accommodate the situation that would obtain if the Amendment were adopted and the Home Rule Charter defeated. In such a contingency, the City’s legislative power would have been no greater than what it possessed under its existing Charter of 1919 and extant statutes applicable to the City. It is manifest, therefore, that with Home Rule rejected, the City would have been without power to integrate in its municipal government the functions of the late County offices which, upon the adoption of the Amendment, became the City’s responsibility. It was in that situation that the officers of the abolished County offices were to continue to perform their duties, etc. until the General Assembly provided otherwise as directed by Clause 7. In the other possible contingency, i.e., had the Home Rule Charter been adopted and the Consolidation Amendment been rejected, there would have been no problem. Philadelphia would have operated the City government under the Home Rule Charter instead of its Charter of 1919 and the County government would have continued as theretofore.</p>
    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[327,1785,1157,543]]]'>What, then, is the course to be pursued for the integration of the functions of the late County offices into the City government since both the Charter and the Amendment were adopted? The answer is plain enough. It is the province of the City Council under the Home Rule Charter to act to that end without the necessity for any further legislation by the General Assembly. And, that is so by virtue of the very provision in Clause 7 which the plaintiffs cite in support of their úntenable position.</p>

At that time (viz., November 6, 1951), the First Class City Home Rule Act of 1949 was obviously an existing law of the Commonwealth. That Act had been passed pursuant to the constitutional authority contained in the Home Rule Amendment of 1922 (Article XY, Section 1) which authorized the General Assembly to delegate a part of its legislative authority to local governmental units so that cities might “exercise the powers and authority of local self-government.” So much of the Home Rule Amendment as is presently pertinent provides that “Cities . . . may be given the right and power to frame and adopt their own charters and to exercise the powers and authority of local self-government, subject, however, to such restrictions, limitations, and regulations, as may be imposed by the Legislature.” The Home Rule Act of 1949 conferred upon cities of the first class what Mr. Chief Justice Steen aptly characterized in the <em>Carrow </em>case as a “sweeping grant of powers” for their home rule, so much so, in fact, that the extent of the authority delegated by the legislature to a city of the first class can be fully appreciated only by reference to the exact wording of Section 17 of the Home Rule Act of 1949 which we have hereinbefore summarized. The power and authority extended by the Home Rule Act to the City of Philadelphia resulted in the drafting of the Home Rule Charter which was duly accepted by the electorate of Philadelphia on April 17, 1951.</p>

The postponement of the effective date of the Charter cannot possibly affect the construction of Clause 7 of the Consolidation Amendment. Had the Charter been made effective by its terms, as it readily could have been, any time after its adoption but prior to the vote on the Consolidation Amendment, the contention which the plaintiffs now advance could not have been raised.
