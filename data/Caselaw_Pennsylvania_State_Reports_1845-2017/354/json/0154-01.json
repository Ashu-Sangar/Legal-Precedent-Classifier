      {
        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearns,\nOn the morning of May 28,1943, a bright sunny day, Ida F. Simmonds, a women of sixty-five years, together with her daughter, entered the self-service store of defendant Penn Fruit Company, , located in Darby, Pennsylvania. Decedent had completed her marketing, had paid for her purchases, and while walking from the cashier\u2019s counter towards the door to leave tripped over the platform of a penny-scale and fell. The fall resulted' in serious injuries which led to decedent\u2019s death a short time later. Two suits were brought against the Penn Fruit Company, one. by. the administrator of d\u00e9cedent\u2019s estate and the other by decedent\u2019s husband. A trial ensued and the jury returned a verdict in favor .of plaintiff administrator in the sum of $4,000 and in favor of plaintiff husband in the sum of $2,500. Defendant appeals from the dismissal of its motions for judgment non obstante verdicto and new trial.\n. The negligence alleged was that the platform scale over which decedent tripped was placed in the store where it would cause an unreasonable risk of harm to customers of the store. The scale was the usual p\u00e9nny weighing scale forty-four inches high and its platf\u00f3rni six and one-quarter inches from the floor. The platform itself measured twelve by fifteen inches and the scale at its most extreme length was twenty-two inches. It stood with its back to the front window of the store with the platform facing the exit-aisle of the store leading from th\u00e9 cashiers\u2019 aisle to the storm door which was placed inside the entrance and exit door of the store. Plaintiffs\u2019 position is that the scale was placed so that the platform extended into the aisle of the store.\nIt is not necessary to discuss the possible negligence of defendant (see Kulka v. Nemirovsky, 314 Pa. 134, 170 A. 261; Vetter v. Great A. & P. Tea Co., 322 Pa. 449, 185 A. 613; Restatement, Torts, sections 332 and 343), because the contributory negligence of decedent in tripping over such an obvious thing as the scale relieves defendant of liability. Ordinarily a decedent is favored by the presumption that he or she used due care: Yuhasz v. Pitt Construction Co., 305 Pa. 166, 157 A. 461; Morin v. Kreidt, 310 Pa. 90, 164 A. 799; Mickener v. Lewis, 314 Pa. 156, 170 A. 272; Harris v. Reading Company, 325 Pa. 296, 189 A. 337; Rowles v. Evanuik, 350 Pa. 64, 38 A. 2d 255. But when, as here, rebutting facts are shown in plaintiffs\u2019 case, the presumption falls: Stark v. Fullerton T. Co., 318 Pa. 541, 179 A. 84; Ray v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 321 Pa. 538, 184 A. 445; Wickline v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 347 Pa. 136, 31 A. 2d 535; Basel, Admrx. v. Pittsburgh, 350 Pa. 545, 39 A. 2d 582; Weldon, Admrx. v. Pittsburgh Rwys. Co. et al., 352 Pa. 103, 41 A. 2d 856; Grutski v. Kline, 352 Pa. 401, 43 A. 2d 142.\nIn Burckhalter v. F. W. Woolworth Co., 340 Pa. 300, 16 A. 2d 716, on facts almost identical with the instant case, plaintiff was held contributorily negligent as a matter of law. Plaintiffs distinguish that case from the present one on the ground that there the injured person survived the accident and testified that she did not look where she was going. That distinction is accurate, but immaterial, for here, as in the Burckhalter case, it is abundantly clear from , the evidence that had the customer looked, she would have seen the scale. Plaintiffs here rely on the testimony of their two witnesses that there were people leaving the store when the accident occurred and that there were some people standing along the front wall. But one of the two witnesses (Mrs! Likens) testified as follows: \u201cQ. Now, if you didn\u2019t see your mother from the time she .checked out until the exclamation was made by somebody, you don\u2019t know, do you, whether or not there was anyone in front of your mother? A. No. . . .\u201d And again: \u201cQ. Do you know of your own knowledge whether or not at the time she tripped and fell, there were other people around her? A. No, because I did not see mother trip. Q. So you don\u2019t know whether there were people around her or not? A. That\u2019s correct.\u201d\nThe other witness, Carrie Drumheller, was equally inconclusive. In the first place she didn\u2019t see decedent until she tripped so she could not say whether there were people in front of her \u00f3r not. The gist of her testimony is that there were, other people in front of decedent, but they were going out the doorway.\nThere is not one line of testimony on plaintiffs\u2019 side of the case that there was anyone standing between decedent and the scale. Even if there were people leaving the door, as plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses testified, this, would not mean there was anyone standing between decedent and the scale, nor that her view was blocked by such persons, for the door was past the scale. What is most significant is that plaintiffs\u2019 witness, Carrie Drumheller, who was standing to the side and rear of the scene of. the accident as she stood in the line at the cashier\u2019s desk, testified that at that point the scale was \u201cperfectly, obvious\u201d to her.\nIn addition to the failure of plaintiffs to show anything obstructed decedent\u2019s view, there is abundant testimony that the lighting conditions were extremely good. The scale was near a large bulk window, it was a bright, sunny day and there were lights on in the store so that one could see plainly.\nOrdinarily \u201cno liability attaches for injuries from alleged dangers or defects which were obvious or known to the person-injured, for, all that the law requires is that the premises be so constructed and maintained that they can. bfe used without danger, by persons using ordinary care for their own safety: Wessner v. Blue Ridge Trans. Co., 338 Pa. 161, 162; Twersky v. Penna. R. R. Co., 261 Pa. 6, 10; Graham v. Penna. Co., 139 Pa. 149, 162.\u201d Rogers v. Max Azen, Inc., 340 Pa. 328, 330, 16 A. 2d 529.\nThe judgments are reversed and . judgment is here entered.for the defendant.",
