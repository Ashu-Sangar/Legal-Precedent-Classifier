Defendant told him that he might then drive the truck home and that he need not bring it back to defendant’s place of business until the following Monday morning. Johnson testified that on previous occasions defendant had similarly allowed him to keep the truck over a weekend and use it during that period for his own purposes. Johnson bought the cap and, about two o’clock in the afternoon, drove to his home at 21st and York Streets, where he <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>bathed and changed his clothes, and, around five o’clock, drove to 25th and Huntingdon Streets, some five or six squares from his residence, where he bought some ice. The accident happened at the corner of 22nd and York Streets on his way home with the ice. From this recital it is clear that Johnson was not operating the truck within the scope of his employment or on defendant’s business at the time of the accident, and, as there was no other evidence in regard to his agency, the presumption which plaintiff might otherwise have invoked was wholly lost, since it could not stand in the face of the</p>

Johnson’s testimony being contrary to this alleged statement, plaintiff’s counsel asked leave to cross-examine him, but the trial judge refused such permission. This was a matter within the court’s discretion <em>(Commonwealth v.

It clearly appears from Johnson’s testimony that after he had purchased the cap for the distributor he was to have the full and unrestricted use of the truck, his only obligation being to return it to defendant’s place of business the following Monday morning, so that from the moment he left the repair shop he was no longer acting within the scope of his employment nor driving the truck for defendant’s benefit. Even if, therefore, he was on his way home for the first time when the accident occurred, that journey was for his own convenience and not on his employer’s business; consequently defendant was not liable for the accident and the mere fact that he owned the truck was shorn of either substantive or procedural significance.</p>
