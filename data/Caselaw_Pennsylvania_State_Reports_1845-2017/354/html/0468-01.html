    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[195,610,1150,647]]]'>The pertinent facts are: a report of the board of auditors of the School District charged the tax-collector with a balance due to the School District- for the school year 1941-1942. The School District instituted an action in assumpsit for the purpose of collecting the monies due, but never brought the issue to trial. Taxpayers intervened in that action and obtained a verdict and judgment in favor of the School District. The-surety of the collector paid this judgment. Twenty taxpayers then petitioned the learned court below for the removal of the Directors of the School District. Answers were filed by respondents and a hearing was held.</p>
    <p id="b575-5" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[198,1267,1146,96]],["BL_576.1",576,[242,277,1148,699]]]'>The order of the court below was made under authority of Sections 217 and 218 of the School Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>These sections were relied upon, because, quoting from the court’s opinion: “Under Section 2824 of tbe School Code, there is an expressed mandatory duty imposed upon the School Directors of a School District to collect the amount charged against a person or persons in a report filed by the Auditors of a Third Class School District from such person or persons, or their sureties, for the use and benefit of the School District. To comply with the provisions of this Section, the Respondents [four of whom are appellants in these appeals] would have had to press the suit In Assumpsit against Stephen Pancoe, Tax Collector, and the New Amsterdam Casualty Company, his surety.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[244,987,1149,373]],["BL_577.1",577,[182,291,1148,807]]]'>The learned court below erred in its conclusion that appellants would have had to prosecute the suit in assumpsit against the tax collector and his surety to its conclusion, in order to comply with the provisions of Section 2624 of the School Code. That section imposes no mandatory duty to collect monies due by whatever means possible, such as an action in assumpsit. It pro<a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>vides, in clear and unambiguous language, a definite manner in which a judgment will result, and must be entered, against a person charged with a sum due by a report of auditors filed with the Prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas. It has absolutely nothing whatever to do with any other method of obtaining a judgment for the monies due. The word “same”, in the phrase “the same to be' collected”, refers to the word “judgment” and not to the phrase “amount charged”, said judgment having resulted under the provisions oí the section. And it is this judgment which this section of the Act permits taxpayers to intervene to collect. The fact that an action in assumpsit will also result in a judgment for the monies due does not bring such action under the provisions of this section.</p>
    <p id="b577-3" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[178,1110,1150,808]]]'>Whether Section 2624 places a mandatory duty on the School District to issue execution on all judgments resulting by reason of the provisions of this section, need not now be decided. It may be pointed out, however, that if it does place such a mandatory duty, the School District would have to issue execution on all such judgments, even though it were well and surely known that the person charged with the monies due, and his surety if he had one, were “judgment proof”. On the other hand, if the School District may exercise discretion, and does not issue execution, then a taxpayer may intervene and attempt to collect the monies due, provided he files a bond with sufficient surety “conditioned to indemnify and save harmless the School District from any costs accruing by reason of such proceeding”.</p>
