Long, age 13 years, was killed by a shot from a 32-caliber revolver held against his right side by the defendant, then aged 17 years. These youths were on friendly terms at the time of the homicide. The defendant and his mother, while his father and brother were in the U. S. Armed Forces, were residing in Lancaster, Pa., with the family of William H. Long, whose son was the victim of the shooting.</p>

A few minutes later, both youths sat on stools in front of the lunch counter and ate some food. The defendant suggested to the decedent that they play “Russian Poker”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Long replied: “I don’t care; godhead”.

This contention we over-rule. A specific intent to take life is, under our law, an essential ingredient of murder in the <em>first </em>degree. At common law, the “grand criterion” which “distinguished murder from other killing” was malice on the part of the killer and this malice was not necessarily “malevolent to; the -deceased particularly” but “any evil design in general; the dictate of a wicked, depraved and malignant heart”: 4 Blackstone 199.

The charge in its entirety affords no grounds for the reversal of the judgment and sentence. Certain'excerpts if they stood alone might have misled the jury-to the. defendant’s prejudice. For example, the trial judge said: “All felonious homicide or illegal or unlawful homicide is presumed to be malicious, .that is, murder of some decree, until the contrary appears in the evidence.” The <em>second </em>sentence after this one reads as follows: “Accordingly, when a felonious or unlawful homicide is proved, malice is presumed to have existed .. . . as a presumption of fact”. A homicide may be unlawful <em>without being </em>presumably malicious. The homicide known as involuntary manslaughter occurs when death is caused by an unlawful act or by a lawful act' done in an unlawful manner. While there do appear statements in some of the reports that “all unlawful homicide is presumed to be malicious and, therefore, murder”, careful trial judges always qualify that statement, as Chief Justice Agnew did in <em>Com. v. Drum, </em><a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">58 Pa. 9</a> at page 17 where he said; “All murder , . . in-<a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>eludes all unlawful killing under circumstances of depravity of heart, and a disposition of mind regardless of social duty”. Trial judges should make it clear to the jury that an unlawful killing in order to constitute murder must result from an intentional, felonious act and not rherely from <em>án inadvertent </em>or <em>negligent </em>act. The trial judge in a sentence which intervened between the two sentences above quoted, stated the applicable principle of law correctly as follows : “This presumption of malice does not. rise, however, until the Commonwealth has made out <em>a prima facie </em>case of felonious homicide”. This statement was in accord with what Mr. Justice Steen, speaking for this court, said in <em>Com. v. </em>Wucherer, <a href="/pa/351/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="351 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="462697" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0305-01">351 Pa. 305</a> at 310; <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20574" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="41 A.2d 574">41 A. 2d 574</a>, to wit: “It is important at the outset tb bear in mind that the sb-called presumption of malice does not arise until the Comm on - wealth has-made out a prima facie case of felonious homicide”. Defendant’s rights were fully protected by the charge: in its totality.</p>
    <p id="b291-3" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[159,1298,1155,1076]]]'>However, the charge was in several respects prejudicial to the Commonwealth. For example, , the trial judge said: “It is the duty of the Commonwealth to prové that the killing was unlawful and intentional, and if the-evidence taken as a whole raises reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury as to whether the killing was 'accidental or intentional, you must acquit the accused, for the reason that, the Commonwealth has failed to sustain .its case.”' This instruction was tantamount to saying that the Commonwealth in order to obtain the conviction of the defendant of any crime included in the indictment had to prove him guilty of murder in the first degree, for if the killing <em>was </em>intentional, it <em>would have been </em>murder in the <em>first </em>degree. The alternative presented to the,jury by the instructions <em>was </em>limited,to. an <em>intentional </em>killing <em>or to an accidental </em>killing. • The jury found that the killing <em>-was'neither </em>intentional <em>nor </em>accidental but that it was a malicious killing though <em>without </em>a specific intent in the killer to take life, and that, therefore, it was murder in the second degree.'</p>
    <p id="b292-3" data-blocks='[["BL_292.3",292,[261,266,1154,1512]]]'>
      <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>The trial judge also erred in charging that “A person on trial for murder cannot be convicted of any offense if the testimony shows that the death was. accidental”. Death may be accidental though it resulted from a malicious act intentionally committed: In such a case the means were not accidental; the result was.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In the instant case if the defendant had by some negligent, unintentional act, caused Long to fall off the stool at which he was sitting in. the: store and if, as a result of that fall,. Long had sustained a fatal injury, <em>both </em>the <em>initial &lt;aot and </em>the <em>death </em>might be correctly characterized as accidental. But when the defendant knowing that a revolver had at least one loaded cartridge in it, pressed the muzzle of that revolver to the side of Long and pulled the trigger three, times, his <em>act </em>cannot be characterized as accidental, even if his statement that he had <em>no intention-to hill </em>Long is accepted (as the <em>jury </em>accepted it). The way the trial judge used the word' “accidental” throughout the charge must have been confusing to the jury and might easily have misled it into acquitting the accused on the theory that since the <em>death </em>of Long was accidental, “the defendant cannot be convicted of any offense”, (as the trial judge said). The-latter should have made it clear to the jury that even though Long’s death might have been unintended and, therefore, accidental j the evidence showed'that the act which caused the victim’s death was <em>not </em>accidental. This was the view the jury took of the case despite the court’s instructions.</p>

Long, from the effects of which he afterwards died, then you should acquit the defendant’^ There was not in this record any evidence which would warrant a finding that “the shot was accidental”. Later the judge instructed the jury that “If the .Mlling was accidental, although done with a deadly weapon, it could not be said to be intentional or <em>wilful; </em>and, if neither intentional nor wilful, the crime of murder is not made out”. What we have already said on this phase of the casé sufficiently reveals the error in these instructions. Of such and similar errors, the appellant cannot complain; they were prejudicial only to the Commionwealth.</p>
