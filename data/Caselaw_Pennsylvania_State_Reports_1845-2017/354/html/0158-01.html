Gates, the defendant. The accident occurred in Butler County. Plaintiff sued Gates in Allegheny County, Defendant instituted proceedings to1 join as additional defendants Meadow Gold Dairies, Inc., the owner of the truck in which plaintiff was riding, and Joseph Babriek, the driver. At the time plaintiff began' his suit Joseph Babriek was a resident of Allegheny County and amenable to service there. -Before the defendant moved to join him as additional defendant, Babriek had changed his residence to Wayne) Michigan. To serve him, the original defendant had the sheriff of Allegheny County send a true and attested copy of the process to the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Babriek was also served by registered mail in Wayne, Michigan. Babriek’s attorney appeared de bene esse and filed a petition to set aside service under the Act of March 5, .1925, P. L. 23,12 PS, section 672. The court denied:the petition and this appeal was taken.</p>

Since the Act of May 14, 1929, P. L. 1721, section l,;as amended by the Act of April 24, 1931, P. L. 50, section 1, 75 PS, section 1201, authorized such service of process on non-resident motorists, we are required to hold that the. Rules of Civil Procedure define the limits of service of process on nonresident motorists: Goodrich-Amrám, Stand. Pa. Practice, Procedural Rules Service, section 2077 (a)-2. Rule 2254 provides that “(a) A defendant or additional defendant shall have the same right of service as though he were a plaintiff.”</p>

If the action is instituted in a county where defendant may be personally served, personal service must be accomplished. Substituted service is, as was the former practice <em>(Nathan v.
