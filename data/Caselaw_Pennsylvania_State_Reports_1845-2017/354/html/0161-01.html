Appellee thereupon filed'this bill-for specific performance. At the hearing one Arthur L.

His version, of the conversation that ensued was that she “. ... told me .that she was not going to make settlement. I asked her why and she said, ‘Well, because I cannot make settlement. I don’t ihave any place to go to and I am not going to make settlement.’ ” Mrs. Eisenthal denies this repudiation; Regarding this dispute of fact, the court below, said: “We have no hesitation in relying on Berns’ account. He was in our . opinion sincere in his intention to carry out the contract as written. ■ His .conduct was consistent with that purpose .... He got the old deed, applied for title insurance, secured the needed mortgage ..,</p>

Having expressly declared the contract null and void prior to settlement day, and in the meantime having done no act recognizing its validity, the Kaufmans are not now in position to assert that a full and complete tender was not made: Penna.
