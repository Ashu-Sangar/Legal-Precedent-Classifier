Mrs. Donna Yarger McCall, at that time a clerk in that store, testified that she saw Mrs. Simpson “put a pair of shoes off the counter into a shopping bag she had between her and the counter”. The clerk asked if she could help her and Mrs. Simpson replied “No”. Mrs. McCall “got close enough to see in the shopping bag” and saw that “she really had a pair of shoes, and she was holding the <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>shopping bag close to her”. - Mrs. McCall reported to the Manager of the Shoe Department, J. J. Burns, that she had seen Mrs. Simpson “take a pair of shoes from the counter and put them in the shopping bag”. The witness added: “As soon as she saw her she turned and started to walk real fast across the store”. She saw her “enter a fitting room and he [Burns] was directly behind her”. Burns reported the matter to H. F. Bechtel, the Assistant Manager of the store, and he and Burns went into the fitting room after Mrs. Simpson emerged from it. They examined “the bag that was left there by a lady” and it was “filled with children’s clothes”. These clothes were from the defendant’s store but they were not wrapped and had no sales slip on them. No shoes were found in the bag. Bechtel then saw Mrs. Simpson “handling white shoes on the counter”. He said he “saw her pick up a pair of shoes, open a carrying bag and drop them in, and just in a split second there was a move and her mother left the Department and they both started out to the front of the store”. They went up the stairs to the Furniture Department and then “turned around and went down the steps and out on the street; Béchtel asked Mrs. Simpson to show him “the receipt for the pair of white shoes she had in the bag”. She refused his request, saying he “would have to see the police”. He said to her: “What about the other bag in the store?” She answered: “The one in the small room?” He testified: “I didn’t mention where it was in the store.” Bechtel then “re-entered the store and had Mr. Holliday”, who at that time had charge of the Men’s Division of the store, to “notify the police to follow me, as I was going to follow her”. When Bechtel next went out into the street, Mrs. Simpson and her mother were down the street “near Woolworth’s store” and the witness did not come “within close walking distance of them” until he got near Isaly’s. How far that was from the Montgomery Ward Store does not appear, but Bechtel said .Mrs. Simpson and her mother had been “out of (his) sight entirely”.</p>

Bechtel took the bag which had been found in the fitting room, to the Chief of Police’s office and upon its being opened, merchandise belonging to the Montgomery Ward Store and valued at $14.88 was found. It “consisted of dresses, socks, pads and a small cap or so”. No shoes were found in either that bag or in the bag which the Chief of Police examined at the police station. One pair of missing shoe's was a little later, found “under, the blanket counter” in the Montgomery Ward Store. The other pair of missing shoes was never found.</p>

Bechtel testified that he made no recommendation to the Chief of Police that Mrs. Simpson be held for court and the Chief of Police confirmed this by saying that none of the employees of the Montgomery Ward Company “urged him to make an information against this woman” and that he made it because he “thought there was enough evidence offered -at the Alderman’s office to warrant such an action”, and that whatever action he took against Mrs. Simpson was taken in his “official capacity as Chief of Police of the City of Butler”. Mrs. Simpson could not immediately produce bail after the hearing, and she was committed. to the jail at “almost noon”. She said she remained there “until late in the evening”, but the record of the Alderman shows that bail in the form of $500 was entered for Mrs. Simpson by her attorney at 2 P.M. that day and she was released from custody.</p>

In <em>Altman v. Standard Refrig. Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/315/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="315 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1156726" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0465-01">315 Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20411" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="173 A. 411">173 A. 411</a>, this court said that' the question: “Who is to judge the existence of probable caused, in a case of malicious prosecution “is settled . . .. it is a question of law for the court.” We reiter<a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>ated this in <em>Groda v. American Stores Company, </em><a href="/pa/315/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="315 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1156638" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0484-01">315 Pa. 484</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20419" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="173 A. 419">173 A. 419</a>. We also said in that ease: “Neither an acquittal of the defendant in a criminal prosecution, nor the ignoring of the bill against him by the grand jury, nor his discharge by the examining magistrate, constitutes proof of want of probable cause, or shifts the burden of proof to the defendant in the civil action.” It has been immemorially held that the public interest requires that the legally trained mind of the judge and not the more or less emotional minds of jurors, decide whether or not there was probable cause for the initiation of the prosecution. Jurors are likely to confuse the issue of the guilt or innocence of the defendant in the criminal case out of which the civil action originated with the basic issue whose determination decides the civil action. That basic issue is the want, of probable cause for the criminal prosecution. Blackstone’s Vol. 3, Sec. 127 says: “It would be a very great discouragement to the public justice of the kingdom if prosecutors who had a tolerable ground of suspicion were liable to be sued at law [for malicious prosecution] whenever their indictments miscarried . . . Any probable cause for proving it [the charge], is sufficient to justify the .defendant”. In <em>Robizsek v. </em>Daum, <a href="/pa/220/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="220 Pa. 61" data-case-ids="1005879" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0061-01">220 Pa. 61</a>, 64, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.%2096" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="69 A. 96">69 A. 96</a>, we said: “What is probable cause, and whether it exists under an admitted or clearly established state of facts, is a question of law for the court.” As recently as 1941 in the case of <em>Curley v. Automobile Finance </em>Company, <a href="/pa/343/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="343 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="1208349" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0280-01">343 Pa. 280</a>, 290, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.%2048" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="23 A. 48">23 A. 48</a>, we said: “In cases of malicious prosecution . . . the trial judge and not the jury determines whether or not the prosecutor in the criminal case, [i.e. the defendant in the civil action trying] had an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause for the prosecution’s initiation.” In that opinion we quoted Thayer in his “Preliminary Treatise on the Law of Evidence” as to the reason for making the court instead of the jury the decider of the issue of probable cause as follows: (p. 286) “The reasons which <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>have availed to keep this particular question of fact, in actions for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment, in the hands of the court, are easily to be seen, and have already been suggested. It is the danger so often recognized by the courts, e.g. by Lord Colonsay, in <em>Panton v. Williams, </em>2 Q.B. 169, lest those who would come forward in aid of public justice should be intimidated or discharged.” In <em>Bryant v. Kuntz, </em><a href="/pa-super/25/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="25 Pa. Super. 102" data-case-ids="851903" data-case-paths="/pa-super/25/0102-01">25 Pa. Superior Ct. 102</a>, judgment on a verdict for the plaintiff was reversed without a venire. Judge Oblady said: “The inquiry as to the probable cause goes back to the commencement of the prosecution, and it relates to the facts then known and as they then appeared. It is not confined to the truth of the matters that lead to the prosecution, but extends to their appearance as indicating the guilt or innocence of the accused. If probable cause is shown, •it matters not whether the motive of the prosecutor be praiseworthy or malicious; and the undisputed evidence in this case made it the duty of the court below to affirm the defendant’s seventh point and to direct a verdict for the defendant.”</p>

In that case, Chief Justice Tindal said, inter alia: In some cases of malicious prosecution, “the question has turned upon the inquiry, whether the facts stated to the defendant at the time, and which formed the ground of the prosecution, were believed by him or not; in other cases the inquiry has been, whether, from the conduct of the defendant himself, the jury will infer that he was conscious he had no reasonable or probable cause.” He states that it is the province of the court to determine from the facts as they were found by the jury whether or not there was reason<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>able and probable cause for the prosecution.

He must also show that “the defendant did not<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> have probable cause for initiating the proceedings”: Sec. 672c Restatement, Torts. The issue on this phase of the case is: Did the defendant “honestly believe” that the accused committed the crime for which he was prosecuted and was that belief based on “a reasonable ground of suspicion of guilt”: <em>Taylor v. Shipbuilding Corp., </em>supra. Plaintiff must further show that the prosecution was motivated by malice, or, to put it as the Restatement of Torts, Sec. 672, expresses it, that the “primary purpose for which the proceedings were initiated was not to bring an offender to justice”. <em>If </em>there is a “conflict in the testimony as to what the circumstances were” out of which the prosecution arose (Restatement, Torts, Sec. 673, comment d), there are two courses open to the trial judge. He can submit that testimony to the jury with instructions to render a special verdict (See footnote 3, post) answering, inter alia, the question as to the existence or non-existence of an honest, reasonable belief on the part of the person initiating the prosecution, of the guilt of the accused, and if the jury gives an <em>affirmative </em>answer to that question, the trial judge will enter judgment for the defendant. If the jury gives a <em>negative </em>answer to that question and also makes the other essential findings in plaintiff’s favor, the jury shall <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>then render a verdict for the plaintiff for the harm done him. If the trial judge does not require a special verdict, he should instruct the jury that they must first determine whether or not an honest, reasonable belief on the part of the initiator of the prosecution existed, and if they find that it did, it is their duty to return a verdict for the defendant. But if the jury finds that no such belief existed and <em>further finds </em>that the prosecution was motivated by malice, the jury should return a verdict for the plaintiff in such an amount as it deems proper, subject to correction by the court. If the jury finds that there was no malice behind the prosecution, the verdict must be for the defendant, even though probable cause for the prosecution was wanting.</p>

If this were not so, it would deter men from approaching the courts of justice for relief. Prosecutions may fail from many causes independent of the justice of the case; and it would be very hard to visit a man with heavy damages for making a complaint, or bringing a suit, when he had probable cause for it . . .

It was an undoubted and damaging error. The jury should, instead, have been instructed that malice AND want of probable cause must concur ánd be shown to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict. While malice may be inferred, sometimes from want of probable cause,- where there is nothing to rebut the inference, still it is the inference of a fact, and this illustrates the error noticed in thé rejection of the testimony offered to rebut the inference of malice to be drawn of want of probable cause, by throwing out the bill by the grand jury. The jury should have been instructed that where there is probable cause it is not of the slightest consequence whether the prosecutor be actuated by malice or not. Park, J., in Mitchell v. Jenkins, 5 B. &amp; Ald. 588, said : ‘If there be. reasonable or probable cause, no malice, however distinctly proved, will make the defendant liable.’ If this were not so, the <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>evil spirit of the prosecutor might redeem the evil act of the criminal.”</p>

Upon appeal to this court, the judgment was reversed. This court, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Gibson, said: “It was a matter of much doubt at the trial of the present cause, whether he had said that the alleged lunatic had been called as a witness in <em>Schoch v. Seibert </em>by the defendant, or not; insomuch, that the witnesses who swore positively about it were divided, even insomuch, that a majority were in favor of the affirmative. In this conflict of perception, then, suppose that the prosecutor had acted on a mistaken belief that the plaintiff had sworn what would undoubtedly have been a perjury, would he not have acted on what appeared to have been justifiable cause; and if he did so act, would it not repel the implication of malice? Again, if the same misapprehension was entertained by the by-standers, would it not materially increase, in an indifferent mind, the probability of the witness’s guilt? What is justifiable probable cause, in the technical sense? It is a deceptive appearance of guilt arising from, facts and circumstances misapprehended or misunderstood so far as to produce belief; and when the subject of belief is the. crime of perjury, the misapprehension may have regard to the extent of the swearing, as well as the truth of it. The question of probable cause, may as well depend on the one as on the other, the difference being, that a misapprehension or doubt is more likely to occur in regard <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>to the former than the latter. Still, the tenor of the testimony, resting as it does in the understanding and memory of the hearers, who may have misapprehended or forgotten it, may not be accurately perceived by the prosecutor; for the uncertainty of human perception is well known to those who are familiar with.the examination of facts depending on. oral proof. No two eyewitnesses ever yet exactly agreed in their account of a transaction; and nothing is more frequent than the misapprehension of a person’s words. A by-stander relying on his own ears, may be grossly mistaken; and when the matter has regard to the sum of a witness’s testimony instead of the truth of it, there may be such a mistake as to produce an appearance of perjury sufficient to justify a prosecution of it. If, then, there was a reasonable belief in the minds of the prosecutor and the by-standers that the plaintiff swore to what it is admitted would have been an untruth, whether the belief was well founded or not, there was probable cause amounting to justification.” See also <em>Chester S.
