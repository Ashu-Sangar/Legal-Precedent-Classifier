    <p id="b492-10" data-blocks='[["BL_492.16",492,[252,1400,1148,210]]]'>This appeal is from the refusal of the court below to grant defendant’s motion for judgment upon the whole record under the Act of April 20, 1911, P. L. 70, section 1, 12 PS, section 684, where the jury disagreed.</p>

From the judgment thus entered the party against whom it is entered may appeal to the Supreme or Superior Court, as in other cases, which shall review the action of the court below, and enter such judgment, if any, as should have been entered by the court below upon that evidence” (italics ours).</p>
    <p id="b493-3" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[189,654,1147,372]]]'>The statutory procedure was followed. The motion for judgment on the whole record was refused and a new trial granted. The statute expressly authorizes the grant of a new trial instead of passing upon the motion for judgment on the whole record. We review the action of the court, in such cases, to ascertain whether there was any abuse of discretion.</p>
