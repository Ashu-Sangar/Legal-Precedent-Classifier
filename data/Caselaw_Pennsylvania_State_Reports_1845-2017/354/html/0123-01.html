The point has not heretofore been expressly passed on by this court. The court below held that the right to redeem could be exercised after the sale but before the acknowledgment and delivery of the sheriff’s deed. The correct decision is of considerable importance in the conduct of such sales and the effect to be given to them. It happens that the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County recently reached the opposite conclusion: <em>Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation v. Howard, </em>47 D. &amp; C. 64, and denied redemption after the property had been knocked down to the sheriff’s vendee. It is elementary that “all judicial sales must be open to free and fair competition” <em>(Slingluff v.

On November 5, 1945, judgment for $73,946.67<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> was entered on the bond accompanying the second mortgage. On November 8, 1945, Pennsylvania Comphhy issued a writ of fieri facias, returnable on the first Monday of December, 1945. On November 27,1945, after the writ was issued but before the return day, the suit was marked to the use of the appellant, The Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia! On December 3, 1945, at the sheriff’s sale on the fi. fa., the mortgaged property was sold to the appellant for $124,500. On December ll, 1945, on defendant’s motion, the court granted a rule to show cause why the sheriff’s, sale to appellant should not be set aside on the ground that after <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>the sale, defendant had tendered the amount of the judgment with interest and costs.

No statute author<a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>izes redemption after the sale.

Property had been knocked down to Young but before a deed was delivered the court set aside the sale on the sole ground that the debtor had tendered payment after the sale but before delivery of a deed. Young appealed; In support of its ruling, the court be<a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>low said: “The purchaser undoubtedly has his rights. The sale, in this case, was fairly made; but on the return-day . ; . and before the deed is acknowledged, the debtor comes into court, offers to pay the debt, and asks to retain his lands; ■ The creditors do not object; the purchaser alone says he has acquired a right to the land. There does not appear, to be any peculiar hardship in the case of the purchaser who pays his money and is disappointed in getting his deed, by reason of the sale being set aside by the court. Thé sale is not complete until the deed is acknowledged in court. Until the acknowledgment of the deed the debtor is not divested of his estate, and it seems to me- that if the debtor pays the debt before the purchaser has acquired a legal right to the land, the equity of the debtor to retain is stronger than that of the purchaser, who insists upon the forfeiture.” On appeal, this was disapproved. Ross, J., in specifying the error of the court below, stated: “The opinion delivered by the court below is predicated upon false principles and arrives at erroneous conclusions. It is not supported by law, equity or expediency. The <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, .at a public sale of land, the moment it is knocked off to him, if he complies in all respects with the conditions of sale, instantly acquires a vested right to the property .sold. Such a- purchaser would be bound by his bargain thus made, although his bid greatly exceeded its. value. And if he purchase at a <em>bona fide </em>sale, greatly below the value, the vendor would be bound by the sale. <em>Equality </em>in this case at least is <em>equity. </em>The vendee certainly should have the advantage of a purchase at a price below the value, when he is bound by a purchase at a price greatly exceeding the true value: . . . In order to set aside a sheriff’s sale, there must be satisfactory evidence of fraud or abuse of power in the sheriff: . . . These general observations are made with the hope that any practice in opposition to these principles, which may have arisen in some of the courts, as to sheriffs’ sales, may be corrected. It is not a sound exercise of the discretionary power of a <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>court to destroy the vested rights of a fair purchaser, either from feelings of sympathy for the defendant in the execution, or because the court may not see any peculiar hardship in the <em>bona fide </em>purchaser being arbitrarily deprived of his just and equitable right. The practice, if any such exist, as well as the principle laid down in the opinion of the court below, are highly inexpedient <em>; </em>and if there were no other reason, this alone should be sufficient to prevent such a practice being recognized as law. It is indeed calculated to affect sheriffs’ sales very injuriously. Who would become bidders on such terms? Who would purchase and pay his money at sheriff’s sale, if the defendant in the execution could at any time before the acknowledgement of the deed upon payment of the debt retain the property and rescind the sale? The purchaser, under such circumstances, would not only lose the opportunity of purchasing other property but in some cases would be compelled to pay interest on money borrowed, for the purpose of paying for the property purchased at sheriff’s sale. The practice would indeed be pregnant with ruin and injustice. Is there any cause either in law or equity, in which any court has thought proper to rescind a contract, on the application of the party in default? Or, can any case be produced (except the decision in question) where a bargain made in good faith has been rescinded against the will and consent of the party who has performed everything required of him, and who insists on a specific execution of the terms on which he bought? Individually I do not entertain a doubt that the practice authorized by the opinion of the court below, cannot be supported upon any principle, either of law, equity or expediency. Although this point has not been argued, I have nevertheless felt myself bound to express a decided opinion on the subject, before I proceeded to consider the motion to dismiss the appeal.” Chief Justice Gibson concurred. The other three justices declined .to express an opinion because the point had not been argued. While <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>the opinion expressed was not necessary to the dismissal of the appeal, it was not a chance expression of view but one deliberately made for the guidance of future sheriffs’ sales.</p>

Hence it follows that although bis title is not perfect before the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed, so as to enable him to obtain possession, it is sufficiently so to vest in him an interest in the land and to bind him for the money.

After the sale to the plaintiff the same land was again sold as the property of the same person, but under another execution and judgment.

The only question which the record presents <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>is, whether a title acquired by a sheriff’s sale can be defeated by a subsequent sale to another person, when the deed to the last purchaser is <em>first </em>acknowledged.

      <em> </em>Such a purchaser would be bound by his bargain thus made, although his bid greatly exceeded its value. And if he purchase at a bona fide sale, greatly below the value, the vendor would be bound by the sale. Equality, in this case at least, is equity.’ The opinion then goes on to show that any other rule would necessarily affect sheriff’s sales very injuriously, because buyers would not attempt to purchase at such sales, when they could be set aside for mere inadequacy of price. We do not see that lapse of time has changed the rule that ‘equality is equity’ into the opposite one that inequality is equity. The. same reasons for adhering to all other formal solemn contracts exist where sheriffs’ contracts are regular and made under no misapprehension as to material facts. We are clearly of the opinion that the rule was founded upon the soundest reason, and should be adhered to.” If this court had then been of opinion that a: sheriffs sale did not foreclose the equity, but that acknowledgment and delivery of a deed were required, it would have been unnecessary to proceed further with the suit; it would only have been necessary for the debtor, the creditor and the intending bidder (as they were the petitioners) to get together, hand the necessary amount to the creditor and so end the proceeding and thereby deprive the purchaser of his purchase.</p>

London Assurance Corp., </em><a href="/pa/165/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="165 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="862126" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0298-01">165 Pa. 298</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20A.%20924" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="30 A. 924">30 A. 924</a>." It appeared in that case that the plaintiff, owner of mortgaged premises, had them insured by the defendant j after foreclosure sale but before : delivery of'the sheriff’s deed, fire destroyed the premises. The plaintiff sued for the <em>insurance; </em>the trial turned on .whether the.policy had become void by the clause “any change ... in .the interest, title or <em>possession </em>of the subject of the insurance.” The case involved no controversy- between the mortgagor and the mortgagee or the purchaser at the sale.-; The decisive fact was that the mortgagor was still lawfully in <em>possession; </em>she could not have been ejected until after the delivery of the sheriff’s deed. By its express words, the policy covered as long as- she had possession. The principle applied in deciding the case was that the party in possession at the time of the fire had an insurable interest. Obviously, that decision is not inconsistent with what we are now deciding. Nor is the obiter dictum on page 312 of <em>Derr v. New York Joint Stock Land Bank, </em><a href="/pa/335/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="335 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1193068" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0309-01">335 Pa. 309</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20899" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="6 A.2d 899">6 A. 2d 899</a>, controlling.</p>

In measuring the extent of those rights, it is of no consequence that after the fi. fa. was placed in the hands of the sheriff by the mortgagee,- the proceeding was marked to appellant’s use. There is evidence that during the period when the mortgages were in default, the Pennsylvania Company, mortgagee, sought<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> a purchaser for the property “con<a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>ditioned upon our [the Pennsylvania Company] obtaining title.” The Pennsylvania Company agreed on September 25,1915, to sell to the appellant if, as Mr. Sayre testified, his Company obtained title by foreclosure. Instead of carrying out that plan, which was begun by the issuance of the fi. fa., they consummated their arrangement by marking the execution to the purchaser’s use. The purchaser’s position as a sheriff’s vendee is •therefore no different from what it would have been if appellant had purchased at the execution without taking an assignment of the judgment. The bidding was actively competitive, the competing bidder being Mr. Lieberman. Mr. Jacoby, vice president of defendant’s Board of Trustees, testified that defendant had not authorized anyone to bid on its behalf. The competitive bidding was recognized by the court below in saying, “When Mr. Lieberman bid at the sale, he had no authority from the defendant’s Board of Directors: he was bidding on authority from Dr. Wolffe and the staff of defendant’s doctors.” Dr. Wolffe was not .a member of defendants staff; the court added that after the sale,.the Board of Directors “ratified the arrangement suggested, by Dr. Wolffe, ...” '</p>

We think the rule to be adopted should outlaw the possibility of such fraud. Apparently, in this case, the mortgages'were-long in default; the mortgagor could not pay; the Pennsylvania Company was willing to take less than its debt; its broker interested- the appellant as a purchaser. It was only after, the property was about to be sold by the sheriff that the arrangement for raising money referred to in the opinion of the court below, was made. We have no doubt that this arrangement was made in good faith by Mr. Lieberinan and the physicians who authorized him to bid, but the fact that such • an arrangement was possible indicates how easily parties fraudulently inclined might take from a successful bidder the property purchased. The tender made -at bar in the court below was, as the court said, of “. . . money coming from another medical group : headed by Dr. Wolffe that is interested in making some use of défendant hospital.” Defendant was not tendering its own money. In effect, a new purchaser was being substituted for the sheriff’s vendee. ■ It also illustrates the value of the warning made in <em>Young’s </em>AppcaZ .against the adoption óf rules conducive to wrongful <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> interference with sheriffs’ sales.
