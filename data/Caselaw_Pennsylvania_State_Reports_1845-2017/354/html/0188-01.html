At 9:15 A.M. Sundayj June. 24th, he, clad only in an undershirt, was found lying in a pool of blood on his bedroom floor. He had three lacerations at the right side of his head and one in the middle-of the back of his head. The cause of his death was multiple fractures of the skull. On the floor were cigarette butts, an: over-turned ash-tray and a hammer handle. The bloody hammer which fitted the handle was found on a shelf. No finger marks were found on the hammer or the hammer handle. No finger marks of the defendant were found on any object in the victim’s house. The.pockets.of the victim’s clothes were turned inside out. On the bed was an empty purse and a brown hat With a small red feather in it. In the kitchen a money box was found pried open. A half empty bottle of beer was found. At 2 :00 P.M. on June 23rd, a colored girl, Ethel M. Williams, who- worked for Lee Joe, saw him. as he gave her her wages, with a roll of money “one inch thick” and which contained “some fives and twenties, fifties : and a one-hundred”.

They were friendly and called each other, respectively, “Son” and “Pop”. - Knee New had been in the. United. States <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>about two years and had worked in the Sun Shipbuilding Yards for about eighteen months. His last day at work was Monday, June 18th, 1945. He then quit work because the immigration authorities were seizing Chinese at the plant for deportation to China. Two years earlier, Knee New had come from <em>Singapore; </em>within a day after the murder he was arrested in New York by immigration agents as an “illegal entry” and was lodged at Ellis Island for deportation. Earl H. Allen, a Delaware County Detective, who interviewed Knee New at Ellis Island on Tuesday,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> June 26th, testified that the defendant told him that he left Chester Sunday morning, June 24th. The detective again saw Knee New at Ellis Island, in company with Detective Horris and Croak of the New York City Force, and Francis Holt, of the Chester Police. He said the questioning was done by Detective Horris because the defendant “seemed to understand him better than anyone else”. The conversation was in English and no stenographic notes were taken. The defendant, in reply to questions, told the officers (so it is alleged) that he had left Chester at 10:30 A.M. June 24th and reached New York at 12:30 P.M. and went to his cousin’s home at 316' Mott Street, that he had worked at the Sun Shipbuilding Yard for 18 months and that he had 4 days’ pay coming to him. Detective Holt asked Knee New if he had any money. He answered “No”. He was searched and a few dollars were found. Then Detective Holt raised his shirt and amoney belt which contained $1212 was found. None of this was ever identified as Lee Joe’s money. The officers asked him if he would go back to Pennsylvania and he said he would. The next day the officers took him to the New York City Police Department. He was then questioned for the first time about the murder of Joe Lee. He was asked:, “When did you see Lee Joe last?” He replied: “Last Saturday night, Sunday morning.” In reply to further questionings, he said: “I was with Lee Joe until 4:00 A.M.” and that he had “a glass of beer”. He was then asked: “What was Lee Joe doing?” <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>and lie replied: “He was ironing clothes and I wet clothes to help him.” Holt then asked : “What was Lee Joe doing when you left him on Sunday morning?” : The defendant then put his hands on his stomach and said: “I sick; I sick; no more questions.” The detective said: “That was the last of the conversation.”</p>

On. the following day, he went to New York and withdrew from a Bank eight $100 bills and a $50 bill. This was proved by his own testimony and by the bank records and by bank officers. These withdrawals were allegedly due to the fact that he was afraid he was about to be deported to' China. He said: “Immigration office pick, up somebody else and then I was so afraid'that I didn’t dare to go to work.” He had $47.29 coming to him from the Sun Shipbuilding Company. When asked why he didn’t draw that money out, he.answered: “I didn’t dare to take money out”, indicating thereby that' he didn’t dare go where the immigration authorities were. On Thursday, June 20th, according to his testimony,-he Avent back to Chester-and sent from there by parcel post to New York some bags of personal belongings and then-he visited a sick friend, Tee Soy, in the Chester hospital. This friend paid him $10, which he owed him. The defendant testified that he left Chester for New York at 1:05 A. M. Friday, June 22, 1945, and did not return until after his arrest.- • ■</p>

The two “cornerstones” of its case are these alleged: facts: (1) The défendant was with Lee Joe at 4:00 A.M. June 24th. The Commonwealth claims that the defendant when arrested admitted this. How he:fixed this time so definitely does not appear and whether or not he understood the questions asked him in English we will later discuss. (2) “The time of death was- fixed at between 2:30 and 4:30 A.M. June 24th, 1945”, (quoting from the Court’s statement). The Coroner’s Physician, Dr¿ Vincent A. Nacrelli, gave it as his “personal Opinion” that Lee Joe was killed between the hours stated, and that the victim’s death was “presumably instantaneous”. His statement as to the time of death, was obviously a mere conjecture. He based it on the fact that he found that rigor mortis “started to set in” at 10:30 A.M. and upon the assumption that rigor mortis “begins to set in between six and eight hours after death generally”.- Upon cross-examination he' said that rigor mortis “had not set in at 10:30 but it had set in completely at 1:30.” When asked whether or not rigor mortis had ever been known to set in two hours after death, he answered: “Yes”. He was asked: “Is it possible for rigor mortis to set in three hours after death?” He answered: “It is possible for-it to set in immediately; it may be delayed for days at the same time”. He admitted that age “speeds it up” and that “time is quite variable ... it is possible for it to set in immediately”. After the defendant’s counsel had cross-examined the physician at some length as to the hour of the victim’s death as indicated by the onset of rigor mortis, the court said to the counsel: “You are asking him to fix a condition he knows nothing about... Do you think the doctor can guess?” “He is called to <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>show the cause of death. This is not proper cross-examination.” Dr. Nacrelli was the only witness who testified as to the time of the victim’s death and he said: “We approximate it”. We find-in this record no support for the Court’s unequivocal statement as to, the “fixed” time of Lee’Joe’s death.'</p>

Taylor in. his “Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence”, Vol. 1, 9th Ed.

The rule “works both ways” and to fix the hour of . death by. basing it on calculation, as to the onset of rigor mortis “may be inconsistent, with the proved facts” and help to convict an innocent man.</p>

Since its onset was first’ observed at 10:30 A.M., it was impossible for any witness to “fix” with any degree of certitude the time of Lee Joe’s death at “from 6 to 8 hours before 10:30 A.M.” It follows that even if the defendant <em>was </em>with Lee Joe at 4:00 A.M. there is no proof that he was with him when he was killed.'</p>

Bur-rill’s “A Treatise on Circumstantial Evidence” (18.68 pp. 368, 549). Burrill points out the infirmity of proof based upon an inference of guilt of an accused merely from the fact that he was in the vicinity of a crime at the time when it may have been committed. He says, inter alia: (Quoted from p. 151 of Wigmore’s “Principles of Judicial Proof”) “The principal <em>infirmative </em>supposition applicable to the circumstance of opportunity to commit a crime, is that, admitting it proved to have existed, it does not necessarily follow that it was actually taken advantage of by the party shown, to have possessed it; or that it was not taken advantage of by another person. In order to give it this effect, where it is solely, or chiefly <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>relied on, the circumstances tending to show its existence must be <em>exclusive </em>in their operation, by demonstrating that no other person, had, or could have had the opportunity possessed by the accused, and that, therefore, by a necessary consequence, none but he could have committed the crime. It's whole tendency is merely to show a <em>possibility </em>that the act might have been committed by the person supposed to be indicated; without any of that quality of positive <em>probability </em>in which the essence of the force of presumptive evidence resides ; . . <em>Another </em>person may have been present. The real murderer may have left the dead body, and escaped from the room or the house in which it is found, only the-moment before the accused entered it. The real incendiary may have fled from the building fired, only the moment before the accused approached it.

Nothing in this record excludes it. The court below says: “The decedent was killed by someone well known to him. No locks or windows were broken. ■ A brown hat had mongoloid hairs on it. There was no evidence that any other mongoloid ever visited the decedent except the defendant.” As to the first statement, there is not a particle of proof to support it. As to the second statement, the fact that-“no locks or windows” of the victim’s habitation “were broken” is of no significance whatsoever. The man who discovered the murder was Anthony C. Ciroalo, who called at Lee Joe’s-at 9:15 A.M. June 24, 1945 to get his laundry. He found “the door ajar and walked in and found Lee Joe on the floor, blood all over the bed and on him”. As to the hat, Pang) a restaurant keeper, testified that on the evening' of June 23rd, the defendant wore a brown hat which “looked like” Commonwealth’s exhibit 19, which was the hat found on Lee Joe’s bed with a red feather in it.: The hat <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>the defendant had on when Pang saw him had no feather in it. A taxi driver said he saw the defendant on June 21st wearing a new brown hat with a feather in it. He identified six and a half months later exhibit 19 as that hat. On the other hand, Dr. T. D. Beach, an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and a Commonwealth witness, who was called to testify to the human blood spots on the hammer, the bed-clothes and the linoleum, testified that the “mongoloid hair” he found in exhibit 19 was “the victim’s hair”. He compared the brown hat with a hat, exhibit 35, which was admittedly the defendant’s. He said the brown hat was smaller than exhibit 35. Miss Williams, the maid who worked for Lee Joe, testified that she had seen her employer wear a brown hat.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a> Even if the brown hat had been the defendant’s, the fact that it was found on the victim’s bed would be of no incriminatory value. The defendant frequented Lee Joe’s house and it might easily happen that on some occasion he left his hat there. This murder was committed in warm weather and it was testified to that Knee New was seen on the streets occasionally without a hat. The trial judge told the jury: “Whoever did it ran away and escaped. It may have been that the hat was left there in an endeavor to get away quickly, and the Commonwealth contends that it is the defendant’s hat. If that is true . . ., how did it get there unless the defendant was there? That is very important indeed. The Commonwealth contends under the circumstances the defendant did commit this act, and that you ought not to hesitate to convict him in the manner and form as he stands indicted”. The prejudicial character of this instruction is <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>self-evident.

Williams, a colored maid who worked for Lee Joe] testified she knew that he had a lot of money, and he paid her off [on June 23rd] and when he did she noticed the money that he had and mentioned a one-hundred dollar bill and fifty dollar bills.” The Commonwealth claimed that “this is the money which he [the defendant] obtained as a result of inflicting the blows on the deceased.” When at the close of the charge, defendant’s counsel challenged that by saying: “that was never the contention of the Commonwealth”, the court replied: “As a matter of inference. . . . This was perpetrated as a result of losses sustained by gambling. ... Is that not the correct assumption as far as the money in the belt is concerned?” The District Attorney, Lessy, then answered: “Yes, your Honor”.</p>

Lo Tei, the cook, said the defendant was in the restaurant on Friday evening. He said the defendant was accompanied by another Chinese, Ting Ah Soy. The latter, then in the court room, was identified by the cook as being the Chinaman he referred to, but Ting Ah Soy testified that he was a patient at the Chester Hospital on that Friday, and the hospital records corroborated him. Willie Pang said he saw the defendant in the restaurant at 10:50 P.M. Saturday, June 23rd.

The defense argued that the witness who said he saw the defendant in the restaurant on <em>Saturday evening, </em>June 23rd, had confused Saturday night with the preceding <em>Thursday </em>night.

Detective Horris, who did most of the questioning, was asked as to what the defendant’s attorney said to him on <em>July </em>28th at the extradition proceedings and he. said he “would have to refresh his recollection from the minutes of that proceeding.” Yet, the same officer testified as to the interrogation a month earlier, without any '“minutes” of <em>that </em>proceeding. Detective Allen testified that Detective Horris “seemed to understand him [Knee New] better than anyone else and we told him to talk to: him.” This would indicate that there was considerable difficulty about the questioning. Detective Horris may have had to resort to leading questions in order to obtain the answers and Knee New may have nodded assent to these questions without realizing their import. It frequently appears in this record that witnesses testified to Knee New’s assent to a question merely because he nodded his head. Foreigners who do not understand our language frequently nod their heads to indicate that they are at least trying to understand. It is not to be expected that a Chinaman who has been in this country a little more than two years could carry on a conversation in English. Apparently, it was hard for him to even tell about the kind of work he was engaged in for Detective Allen testified that Der tective Horris “asked him what his work consisted of, and he tried to explain it to us, and we were a little confused, but thought he meant that he worked around a machine.

Thomas D. Nunn, Commonwealth’s witness and the Delaware County fingerprint expert, testified that he interviewed the defendant in jail and he told about the difficulties of making him understand.

When the witness was asked : ; “How did he indicate that he was married?”, the witness answered: “He nodded his head to one of the questions which I asked him.” The trial judge seemed to think that the fact that the defendant shook hands with the county detective and thanked him and'said “goodbye” when the detective lodged him in jail after bringing him back from New York, indicated that the defendant could.speak English. The trial judge said to the jury: “That is natural for a person who speaks English to do that; That is correct or not?” Saying “goodbye” no more proves one’s command of English than saying “au revoir” proves one’s command of French. •' .....</p>

As the-jury took <em>no </em>notes they would be likely to accept the trial judge’s “notes”. At the close of the charge, both defendant’s counsel and the district attorney called the judge’s attention-to his error. The district attorney agreed that there was <em>no </em>such testimony. The judge simply said that “the recollection of the jury would control”. This could not erase the effect of his mis-statement and did not “cure” the error.</p>

For example, when a defendant'sets up an alibi, it is <em>not </em>sufficient-to tell the-jury merely that the Commonwealth has (quoting from the charge) “to prove the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, and when the defendant sets up a defense in this case of alibi then it not only should receive <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>your careful consideration but you must be satisfied by the weight of the evidence that he has made out his defense, not beyond a reasonable doubt as far as an alibi is concerned, but satisfied by the weight of the evidence or the preponderance of the evidence that he was not present”, but a trial judge <em>must </em>also, as we said in <em>Com. v. </em>Jordan, <a href="/pa/328/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="328 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1179671" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0439-01">328 Pa. 439</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.%2010" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="196 A. 10">196 A. 10</a>, speaking through Justice Stern, fully advise the jury “as to the difference between the burden resting upon the Commonwealth to establish guilt, and that resting on the defendant with respect to the alibi set up” so that the jury may be “furnished with a standard for determining the legal value of the evidence”. The jury must also be instructed that “the evidence in support of the alibi may, with other facts in the case, raise the reasonable doubt of guilt which entitles a defendant to acquittal”. (Citing many cases). The charge before us fell far short of these requirements. For example, the trial judge said: “His defense is that he was not there and remained in New York all of the time. If you are satisfied that he did, of course, that is his alibi, and he was not. there. It is not that the defendant is trying to convince you that the murder was not committed. It is a sort of a confession and avoidance as we recollect, that is as far as the evidence is concerned; that admitting that it was committed, it was not committed by the defendant; he was not present.” The phrase “confession and avoidance” was improper and prejudicial. It may have conveyed to the jury the impression that the defendant had “confessed” the murder and was endeavoring to “avoid” the consequences. “Confession and avoidance” is a plea and a phrase which has no proper place in any criminal trial.</p>

That burden is with you, the defendant. I say that all through the case the burden is on the Commonwealth to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, but when you set up an alibi, <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>the Commonwealth, having made out its ease, showing murder in the first degree, and the fact of the murder of the man is uncontradieted, the burden is upon you to satisfy the jury by the weight of the evidence that you were not there.” Later, the Court said: “The burden is upon the defendant to thus satisfy you by the weight of the evidence. The burden at the same time is upon the Commonwealth to satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt inclusive of evidence of everything, of the guilt of the defendant, but when they set up an alibi which is in effect: ‘We don’t know about it; we were not there,’ or words to that effect, you have to be satisfied that he was not there.” Nowhere in the charge did the Court make it clear to the jury that the evidence as to an alibi may generate in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt of the defendant’s guilt, except the vague phrase above quoted: “inclusive of evidence of everything”. A comparison of the foregoing excerpts, with what this court so clearly said in <em>Turner v. Com., </em><a href="/pa/86/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="86 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1056643" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0054-01">86 Pa. 54</a>, 73, (a murder case based on circumstantial evidence), about “proof of an alibi” being “as much a traverse of the crime charged as any other defense, and proof tending to establish it, though not clear may, nevertheless, with other facts of the case, raise enough doubt to produce an acquittal”, will reveal the prejudicial inadequacy of the trial judge’s charge as to defense of alibi in the instant case.</p>

Samples of this “pertinent evidence” are the following in quotation marks: (1) “Cigarette stumps found in the bedroom; no evidence that any other person who was known to the deceased, except the defendant, smoked cigarettes.” Smoking is not such an uncommon practice that this defendant can be connected with this murder by “cigarette stumps”. How long these stumps had been in that bedroom does not appear. (2) “The deceased was undressed for bed”. How this fact connects the defendant with the murder is left to the imagination. If a burglar entered Lee Joe’s house to rob and murder him on the morning of June 24th, he presumably found the victim in bed. (3) “No person testified he ever saw defendant with a large sum of money on his person except at the time of his arrest.” The lawful origin of every dollar of that money was accounted for; apparently the defendant had earned and saved it. (4) “When defendant was arrested, he denied he had any money on his person, except several dollars, but a large sum of money was found on his person in a money belt after he was physically searched.” His denial in no way showed Ms guilt of murder. The defendant knew he was to be deported to China as an “illegal entry” into the United States. He may have feared that if he revealed his savings they would be confiscated, and he was under no obli<a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>gation to reveal them to anyone. (5) “Knee New was illegally in the United States and immigration officials were conducting a raid on persons unlawfully in this country, of which the defendant had knowledge.” It is impossible to understand how that fact connects the defendant with the murder of Lee Joe. (6) “He was asked whether he wore overalls at the Sun Ship, and he said he did not know”. He may have been unfamiliar with the word “overalls”. The record shows that the defendant’s range of English words was very restricted. The defendant spoke the “Fuchow dialect” of Chinese and the interpreter who was finally obtained in this ease had some difficulty in interpreting and so stated. (7) “He testified on page 538 ‘I don’t know anything. I generally follow what people did.’ ” The record shows that the defendant made the answer just quoted when being asked on cross-examination if he knew why he put his hand on the book [the Bible] when he was sworn as a witness. His answer was apparently an honest one. (8) “He testified that the last day he worked at the Sun Shipyard was June 18, 1945, and was asked on cross-examination whether or not he didn’t use the words ‘1945’ to which he testified: ‘No, I didn’t say that.’ ” The fact is that this answer was true. It was apparently the interpreter who added “1945” after the defendant said “June 18”. (9) “He said he got the book [in the American language] because he liked to see the pictures, and yet when he was asked what the pictures showed, he said he did not know.” There is no proof that he did know. (10) “He was asked whether he knew where the Bowery was on the East Side to which he replied: ‘I don’t know what the Bowery Street is’,”. He probably did not know; many Americans do not. (11) “He did not know whether he played mah jong with Ah Hing or not, and yet used him as an alibi.” The trial judge is mistaken about this. The defendant testified that he played mah jong in New York on June 22nd with Ah Hing. The trial judge evidently confused Ah Hing with Ah Himg. The latter was a New York friend of <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>the defendant. (12) “The defendant testified he did not know where Joe Lee kept his money, and the condition of the deceased’s place showed that it was ransacked”. It is difficult to understand how these two facts incriminate the defendant. If <em>someone else </em>killed Lee Joe, he also presumably did not know where the latter kept his money. (13) “He did not remember whether he had told the officials that he had a wife, he did admit he had a wife, under further cross-examination, and admitted he had a son.” What relevancy this has to the fact in issue does not appear. (14) “When the defendant was confronted with the application that he signed at the Sun Ship for employment, he was asked whether or not the application was not signed by him, and he said at page 836 ‘I was told by man who put pencil into my hand and move my hand along.’ ” How that answer discredits Knee New is not explained. The application, which is in the record, shows the name “Knee New” evidently printed with great difficulty and in the wrong place on the application. This defendant was tried for murder, not for illiteracy.</p>

The defendant did <em>not </em>admit that he “was in the presence of the deceased” when the latter was killed. Second, there is in this case no evidence of the defendant’s “flight to another jurisdiction”. An individual who dej&gt;arts from a certain city a few hours after a murder is committed in that city does not thereby become a “fugitive in flight to another jurisdiction”. (The preponderance of the evidence is that the defendant left Chester at <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>least fifty L ours before the murder.) A man is not fleeing from justice until he knows that justice is looking for him or fears that justice is about to look for him. Even if it was 10:3Q A.M. June 24th when Knee New left Chester for New York, there is no evidence whatever that he then knew that his friend had been murdered and that he was suspected of the crime. Knee New had formerly resided in New York. He had relatives and friends there and since he knew that he would eventually be deported to China, it was reasonable for him to withdraw his savings from the banks and seek out his relatives and friends in New York for farewell visits with them. He did not attempt to change his name or go into hiding. New York with its twenty thousand policemen and detectives is not a place which a “fugitive from justice” is likely to select as a “hideout”. The fact that he did not waive extradition and return to Chester voluntarily is no evidence of his guilt. He was within his rights in not waiving extradition and he was apparently acting on advice in so doing for he had an attorney at that time. Many accused persons whose guilt is later established waive extradition. Just as such a waiver of extradition is no evidence of innocence, so resistance to extradition is no evidence of guilt.</p>

But the Commonwealth failed to prove that such an opportunity was <em>exclusively </em>the defendant’s and that no one else could have entered Lee Joe’s habitation for the same felonious purpose.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a> The Commonwealth <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>did <em>not </em>prove that the defendant knew that Lee Joe bad a large sum of money in Ms possession on June 24th.

No suspicion of guilt has fallen upon this maid but she may have inadvertently told others of Lee Joe’s possession of “a roll of bills one inch thick”, as she described it. It is in evidence that Lee Joe often displayed his roll of hills to other'persons.

The question of guilt is ‘left to conjecture or surmise and has no solid foundation in established facts.’ ” (Citing several cases.)</p>

The murder weapon was the wounded man’s gun. Both women were convicted by a jury and sentenced to imprisonment. The defense was that the evidence did not exclude the possibility of an intruder in the house. The Supreme Court of Illinois said that all the evidence proved was “that a murder was committed, that Mrs. Holtz was present when her husband was shot and that Mrs. Whisman was in the house. It does not connect them otherwise with the fact of the shooting or show that the crime was not committed by some other piersun. Being X&gt;rosent they had the ox:&gt;portunity to commit the crime, hut or&gt;portunity, alone, is not sufficient to justify a conviction even though they are unable to show who did commit it. The burden still rests ux&gt;on the prosecution to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime was actually committed by them and not by some other person.”</p>

        <em> The </em>trial judge said to the Jury: “However, evidence of good character is of no avail against positive proof of crime.” This statement was prejudicial to the defendant.
