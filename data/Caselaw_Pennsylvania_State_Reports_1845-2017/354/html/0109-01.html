It was begun by William Sellers and Company (hereinafter called Sellers) against Clarke-Harrison, Incorporated, Chambers-burg Engineering Company (hereinafter called Chambersburg) and Eugene C. Clarke, president of the latter companies. The complaints were (1) to recover an alleged overpayment to Clarke-Harrison of management fees and (2) for an accounting of profits made by Chambersburg from a navy contract which it was alleged Clarke had improperly diverted from Sellers to Chambersburg. The court below denied plaintiff’s right to recover any part of the management fees, but a majority of the court required the defendants to account for the profits from the alleged diverted contract.

In June, 1938, it found itself in serious financial difficulties. It had lost $1,567,000 during the previous ten years. The officers and stockholders were alarmed and were seeking sale and liquidation of the corporation. They contemplated the possibility of bankruptcy or reorganization under 77 B of the Bankruptcy Act. The corporation was indebted to the Philadelphia National Bank in the sum of $600,000. The Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities was the trustee of the estate of a large stockholder and in its banking depart<a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>ment was the holder of certain shares of the corporation held as collateral for loans. The two bank creditors, fearful of the soundness of their loans, suggested to Sellérs that it employ Clarke-Harrison, a corporation engaged in the management of businesses, to manage and supervise the business of the corporation. The-board of directors of Sellers was composed of highly successful and well-known business men. They unanimously agreed to such employment and their action was approved at a meeting of the stockholders. The attorney for Sellers revised and approved the contract of employment which Was submitted to Sellers. The executed contract of employment was dated June 24, 1938 (and amended twice thereafter). It was in operation until February, 1943, when it Avas cancelled. During the period of the Clarke-Harrison-management the business became highly successful. It ceased to be operated at a loss and produced enormous-profits. Sellers was lifted out of the red and placed in the black. It was able to add over one million dollars to its surplus. On February 2, 1943, through negotiations' by one of the Sellers’ directors all of the stock of Sellers was sold to the Srell Corporation. -Sellers had been financially rehabilitated and sold to good advantage. Clarke-Harrison had received substantial compensation for the successful results which were obtained’during' its management. Apparently the business relations of Sellers and Clarke and his companies hád terminated to the mutual satisfaction of all the parties.-</p>

It was regarded as a highly profitable and desirable contract. Delivery was required to be made within a limited time. A boring mill'machine consists of over 2,000 small parts, assembled and erected upon a heavy cast iron bed and components which must be machined prior to assembly. Sellers never had facilities to cast the bed and components, and consequently, for years prior to 1938 had secured them from Chambers-burg. In 1940, because of the large order in prospect, and in view of other orders secured by Clarke approximating $5,000,000, Sellers did not have the facilities to machine the heavy castings ¿nd components theretofore secured from Chambersburg. In order to obtain the desired contract (hereafter called the <em>supply </em>contract) it became necessary to erect additional <em>facilities </em>■ consisting of a inachine shop containing particular tools necessary for the machining of.the heavy castings, and <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>additional assembly space. Through appropriate Acts of Congress the United States Government undertook to finance the erection and equipment of facilities required by manufacturers to fulfill their supply contracts with the government. The manufacturers borrowed the requisite funds from a bank, and the government paid back to the bank twenty percent each year for five years until the loan was liquidated. Title to the facilities remained in. the government, and at the conclusion of the <em>supplies </em>contract, or its cancellation, the manufacturer had the privilege of purchasing back the facilities at their <em>then </em>value (the government absorbing any loss in depreciation, etc.) or leasing the same from the government. In order to finance the construction of “facilities” required the expenditure of over $600,000, which Sellers did not have, and which would have to be borrowed.</p>

The business problem arose, as to how to handle, the matter. Before the securing of so vast an order' Sellers had purchased the large castings from Chambersburg and machined .them in Philadelphia in its. own shops. The weight of a casting was heavy, being over eighty per cent of the weight of the entire machine. Shipping between Chambersburg and Philadelphia, and transportation costs, the element of time and other difficulties entered into the consideration of the problem. It was concluded that it would be more economical and expedient to' machine the castings and assemble the machines in Chambersburg. During October, 1940, the plans of the parties changed from day to day depending upon what plan appeared most expeditious. If the facilities contract was taken by Sellers, it would mean an increase.of indebtedness of about $750,000 and the possibility of financial complication which’ might, interfere with the sale of the stock in liquidation which Sellers desired. On the other hand, such a facilities contract <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>might prove to be advantageous and profitable to Sellers. The alternative was to permit Chambersburg to machine and assemble the machines, and for them to take over the facilities contract with its attendant profit or risk.</p>

    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[251,891,1149,756]]]'>On October 10, 1940, the government was informed that Chambersburg would machine the castings and would assemble the machines, and on October 14, Sellers and Chambersburg jointly wrote the government that the facilities would be undertaken by Chambersburg and the contract made by it. On October 16, 1940, this arrangement was approved by the Sellers directors. On October 24, 1940, Mr. Spahr, attorney for Sellers, and Mr. Sellers, chairman of the board, suggested that it might be advantageous for Sellers to build the facilities on the ground leased from Chambersburg. On the following day, October 25,1940, the board met and authorized Sellers to take the facilities contract and to borrow |750,000 to finance same.</p>
    <p id="b222-6" data-blocks='[["BL_222.6",222,[252,1659,1148,590]]]'>Clarke agreed to the change.

They met representatives of the government and discussed the matter.

The chancellor was of opinion that the ratification by the officers, directors and stockholders of Sellers was a mere form and subterfuge. He was of opinion that the execution of the management contract by. the officers and directors of Sellers, approved by the stockholders, completely surrendered the authority, responsibilities and duties of the officers and directors of Sellers to Clarke-Harrison and that thereafter Eugene Clarke, the president of Clarke-Harrison, assumed all of the duties and responsibilities of the Sellers regular corporate directors and officers. He found as a fact that Clarke was in such controlling and dominating position in Sellers, Clarke-Harrison and Chambersburg as to make possible the diversion of the contract to Chambersburg and which amounted to a fraudulent betrayal of Sellers’ interest by Clarke—its fiduciary. He also found as a fact that it was Clarke’s secret and undisclosed purpose to divert the contract to Chambersburg so that Clarke and his associates might profit thereby at the expensé of Sellers. Judge Lewis filed a dissenting opinion. According to. his view the findings of the chancellor were. not supported by the evidence; the court should not compel a satisfied employer to be dissatisfiéd; the directors and stockholders <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>ratified everything that was done and the assignee of the corporate stock subsequently sold by the ratifying holders, should not through the corporation be permitted to raise this question.</p>

All it purported to do, and in fact did, was to constitute Clarke-Harrison <em>business manager </em>for Sellers.

The decisions concerning corporate policy were duly submitted to the Sellers board of directors <em>before </em>they became effective, and in all cases were thereafter approved at stockholders’ meetings.

The Clarke-Harrison employment was not solicited by that corporation. It was suggested by the two large creditors of Sellers. Everybody knew that Mr. Clarke was president and large stockholder in both Clarke-Harrison and Chambersburg. Such, fact was never concealed, but was always revealed and was well known. Sellers’ board of directors and the stockholders, with this full • information and knowledge, authorized the contract. With the creation of such dual responsibility by the interested parties with full notice all that was required of Clarke-Harrison was to perform its duties with honesty and fidelity. It has not been proven Eugene Clarke did not act in good faith. When the Navy official notified Mr. Clarke, Mr. Benzon, the president of Sellers, and Mr. Thompson, Sellers’ attorney, and its sales manager, Mr. Holljes, that the Navy would not enter into the facilities contract with Sellers for the assigned reason, this was reported to Sellers’ board of directors who thereafter authorized the contract with Chambersburg. Sellers’ attorney assisted in the preparation of the contracts and the Sellers officers were authorized and did thereafter execute them. All of this was later approved at a stockholders’ meeting. It is <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>futile to say, under this record, that the action of Sellers’ board of directors and of its stockholders was a mere formality on the theory of Clarke-Harrison’s domination over them¿. There is not a line of testimony that Mr. Clarke so dominated them. Any conclusion that it was Clarke’s secret and undisclosed intention to secure the facilities contract for his own profit, is a matter of conjecture and suspicion, which never take the place of testimony : <em>Rosenthal’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/339/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="339 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1201285" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0488-01">339 Pa. 488</a>, 496, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20A.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="15 A.2d 370">15 A. 2d 370</a>; <em>Ash Will, </em><a href="/pa/351/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="351 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="462704" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0317-01">351 Pa. 317</a>, 324, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20620" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="41 A.2d 620">41 A. 2d 620</a>.

We agree with the principles of that case. However, such principles do not apply to the present facts. In that case the defendant manager illegally withdrew corporate funds for his individual use; by gross manipulations and deliberate concealment and falsification induced innocent stockholders, without notice, to agree to a merger with his own worthless corporation, and made a personal secret profit. To accomplish his fraudulent purposes he caused his own nominees to be elected as officers and directors. That was an entirely different situation than here exists.</p>
