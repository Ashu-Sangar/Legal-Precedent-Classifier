    <p id="b624-8" data-blocks='[["BL_624.10",624,[228,852,1147,916]]]'>By Ms will, George Shaffer, after directing the payment of his debts and funeral expenses and providing for the care of his burial lot, left the rest of his property, real and personal, to four nephews and a niece in equal shares. Three of them are plaintiffs in this suit; they filed this bill in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, the county of testator’s domicil, against the other two for the partition of four parcels of real estate, three of them located in Pittsburgh in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and the other in Youngstown, Ohio. The defendants filed preliminary objections to the bill, asserting, inter alia, that the doctrine of equitable conversion applied with the result that there was nothing to be partitioned; that one of the four parcels of real estate was in Ohio, that another had been sold by the executors. The court below held there was a conversion and dismissed the bill. The plaintiffs took separate appeals.</p>
    <p id="b624-9" data-blocks='[["BL_624.11",624,[229,1781,1148,361]]]'>The decision depends on the construction of the will of George Shaffer. If he clearly stated his intention to give the proceeds received from the sale of his land instead of the land itself, the decree was correct; if the intention is not clearly expressed, his beneficiaries took land and not the proceeds of the sale of land and the decree must be reversed.</p>

Yerkes, </em><a href="/pa/200/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="200 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="924326" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0419-01">200 Pa. 419</a>, 423, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.%20186" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="50 A. 186">50 A. 186</a>, Mr. Justice Mitchell said: “The doctrine of equitable conversion is based on the rule that what is to be, or ought <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>to be done shall be treated as if done already. It is a fiction therefore invented to sustain and carry out the intention of the testator or settlor, never to defeat it. Its application requires constant watchfulness to guard against the tendency to become a formal rule de jure without regai’d to its real purpose and necessity. It should never be overlooked that there is no real conversion, the property remains all the time in fact realty or personalty as it was, but for the purpose of the will so far as it may be necessary, and only so far, it is treated in contemplation of law as if it had been converted. Few testators have any knowledge of the doctrine or any actual intent to change the nature of their property except when and to the extent that may be required to carry out the special purpose of the will. The presumption therefore, no matter what the form of words used, is always against conversion, and even where it is required it must be kept within the limits of actual necessity. These are very elementary propositions, but it is necessary to recur to them frequently to avoid the tendency already referred to, the danger of which is apparent in many of our cases.” See also Restatement, Trusts, section 131; Scott on Trusts, section 131.</p>

    <p id="b626-4" data-blocks='[["BL_626.4",626,[231,861,1149,861]]]'>The bill for partition was filed Angust 20, 1945. The defendants contend that testator directed his executors to sell and that it is necessary, in carrying out the terms of the will, to treat the land as equitably converted into money. We must reject the contention. The will does not contain an absolute direction to sell; on the contary, the sale is directed “at the discretion” of the executors; the paragraph is ambiguous as the word “discretion” may perhaps be understood as relating to the time or the order of sale or terms of payment and the like. We understand the provision to confer a grant of power or authority to sell and not a mandatory or absolute direction to do so. If, as was said in <em>Yerices v. Y erkes, </em>supra, the presumption is against conversion, we must have something more than the words of the third paragraph of the will.</p>
    <p id="b626-5" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[230,1731,1147,646]]]'>The fourth paragraph authorizes the executors “prior to the sale of any or all of my real estate” to manage and administer it, but, on the question of conversion, we receive no aid from that paragraph. The technical words used in the fifth paragraph express the intention to give land and not money. In that paragraph he disposed of the “rest, residue and remainder” by directing its division into five equal parts, giving, <em>devising </em>and bequeathing one part to each of the persons named. The use of the word “devise” with the limitation to “them, their heirs and assigns forever” would indicate that he was disposing of real estate.</p>
