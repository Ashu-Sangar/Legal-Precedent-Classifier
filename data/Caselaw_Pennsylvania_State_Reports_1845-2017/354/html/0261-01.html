In 1933, the husband was committed to an institution for the insane, and in 1937, the wife was appointed guardian of his estate. He remained in the institution until his death on May 24, 1943. There was no issue by the marriage. In 1941 the wife went to Reno, Nevada, where she procured a divorce. In the divorce proceeding the wife falsely testified that she was a bona fide resident of Nevada, domiciled in that state. She bases her right to claim as widow upon the ground that the Nevada court had no jurisdiction over her and her husband and hence its decree was a nullity. The learned court below rejected the claim, holding that appellant was barred from attacking the decree which she had procured. This appeal followed.</p>

The bases for such decisions are varied. Most of them are supported on the ground of estoppel or quasi-estoppel; others on general equity principles; that no one can profit for his or her wrong; that complainant must come into equity with “clean hands”.

One or both parties may have remarried on the faith of such a decree; a remarriage may have been either innocently contracted by one of the parties or with knowledge of the fraud. Rights of innocent parties to the second marriage and their children must be considered. In some cases the rights of the parties relate solely to property or financial matters. Perhaps the question has arisen more frequently in the State of New York than in any other jurisdiction. The earlier New York cases were frequently in conflict with each other. But in 1940 the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Krause v. Krause, </em><a href="/ny/282/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="282 N.Y. 355" data-case-ids="2039610" data-case-paths="/ny/282/0355-01">282 N.

This rule has been adhered to ever since. See <em>Vernon v.

    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[241,753,1148,1179]]]'>Pennsylvania adopted (not in the same language) this doctrine as early as 1929. In that year the case of <em>Willetts v. Willetts, </em><a href="/pa-super/96/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="96 Pa. Super. 198" data-case-ids="684008" data-case-paths="/pa-super/96/0198-01">96 Pa. Superior Ct. 198</a>, was decided, opinion by Judge Baedeige. There a libellant had fraudulently obtained a divorce from her husband in Pennsylvania while the parties were'in fact domiciled in New York. The wife was permitted to secure an annulment of the marriage. It was decided that the libellant, in the facts of that case, was not barred from attacking the divorce which she had obtained. The opinion adopts what Mr. Chief Justice Maxby (then a judge in Lackawanna County), said upon preliminary procedural matters in the case: “the rule that Tie who comes into equity-must come to court with clean hands’ applies only to cases where the public interest is not affected by the matter in controversy. In the case at bar the dignity and honor of the court and the rights and interests of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, are as much involved as are the respective interests of the petitioner and the respondent. . . . The peace and dignity of the Commonwealth transcends the personal rights and interests of either party to a wrong.”</p>

The matrimonial status was effectively terminated upon the death of the husband. The. wife confesses that she committed perjury in the Nevada court when she swore that she was domiciled in Nevada and intended to reside there permanently. She seeks to excuse this wrong by stating that she committed it to prevent her husband’s kin from receiving any part of her estate should she predecease him. Apparently her position is that had she died first the fraudulent divorce would have protected her estate from her husband, but as he died before her then she should be allowed to demonstrate her divorce was invalid and as she remained his widow was entitled to a spouse’s share under the intestate laws.
