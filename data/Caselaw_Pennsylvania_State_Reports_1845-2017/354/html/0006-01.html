Lusk, who died testate May 8,1931. The question presented by this <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>appeal is: Does the testator’s will clearly express an intent that his heirs who were to take at the termination of his testamentory trust are to be determined as of the time of that termination and not as of the time of his death? The court bélow held that the ninth paragraph of. the testator’s will meant that the distribution to be made at the time of the contingency specified was to be made to those who were the heirs at the date of the testator’s death.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[189,746,1149,477]]]'>The ninth paragraph of the will reads as follows: “In case of the death of my son, Donald Augustus Lusk, before the death of his mother, and in case of the death of my grandson, Donald Campbell Lusk, before he reaches the age of thirty years, then I direct that my estate, real, personal and mixed, subject to the bequests hereinbefore given to Mary Helen Lusk, shall revert back to my original estate and be distributed under the intestate laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”</p>

The testator’s grandson, Donald Campbell Lusk, died on August 24, 1944, at the age of twenty-five years. Under these facts, the testator’s entire estate “reverted back” (according to testator’s directions), to his “original estate” for distribution “under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania”.</p>

    <p id="b114-4" data-blocks='[["BL_114.4",114,[222,983,1149,356]]]'>The court below held that this testator did “direct otherwise”. The court said that the testator “did not mean the tide of descent to move forward; he meant it to move back. He said, to his ‘original estate5, intending thereby to have his heirs determined as of the time when his estate [as an inheritance] had its origin, i.e. upon his own demise.”</p>

The case of <em>Downing v.

The court said: “. . . The ordinary meaning of the words ‘revert to my estate’ is to return to the aggregate of all the property which I may leave at my death.” In <em>Cochran v. Lee’s Admr., </em>Ky., <a href="/citations/?q=84%20S.W.%20337" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="84 S.W. 337">84 S.W. 337</a>, it is stated that the word “revert” as used in a will providing that if “any of my children die without issue . . . his or her portion shall revert to my estate for the benefit of the living heirs”, means to come back or return and that if any of the children die without issue, his or her portion shall return to the estate for the benefit of the living heirs.</p>

There a testatrix in her will provided for “the creation of a trust of one-half of the residuary estate, the income from which was to be paid to a granddaughter, Florence Bonsall Judge, during life; upon her death the principal was to go to her child or children, but if she should die ‘without leaving child or children surviving or children of deceased child or children, then and in such case the principal monies of said Trust Fund shall go to and vest in my lineal descendants according to the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania.’ ” The granddaughter named did die without leaving any children. This court held that “the lineal descendants” were to be ascertained as of the date of the death of the life beneficiary. The decision construed the will according to the Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 914, for it was clear that the testatrix did not direct <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>otherwise. In the instant case, it is equally clear that the testator did direct otherwise.</p>

The lawyer who drafted the Lusk will undoubtedly knew that if his client wished the remainder of his estate, after the termination of the trust estates, upon the happening of the contingencies named, to vest in those who were his heirs at the time of the termination of the trust estate, it would be necessary to “plainly manifest” this intent in the will. No such intent is so manifested in the Lusk will. On the contrary, what <em>is </em>plainly manifested is the testator’s intent that when the trust estate ended, his estate should be distributed exactly as it would have been on the date of his death, had there been no trust estates; it was on the date of his death that the testator’s testamentary estate originated. The use of the phrase “original estate” in the ninth paragraph of his will, is of decisive significance in this case.</p>
