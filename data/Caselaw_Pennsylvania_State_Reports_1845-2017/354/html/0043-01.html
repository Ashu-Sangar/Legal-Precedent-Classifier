But such direction is not essential to comply with her plain intent for equal distribution. The law does this for her.

If the amounts of the advancements are first added to the estate before division, as they should have been, then testatrix’s language in charging George’s share, and which share “as so diminished”, is to constitute the trust, is in strict accord with the hotchpot doctrine. She directs no more than what the law already provides. The words of the will clearly express an intent for an <em>equal </em>distribution among her children. An unequal distribution is unwarranted by the language of the will. The doctrine of hotchpot should have been applied.</p>

In his adjudication the auditing judge held that the doctrine of hotchpot applied and ruled that “distribution will be awarded hereunder by treating the advancement as if repayment had been made to the estate, the total then divided in equal one-third shares, and the advancement deducted from the share given in trust for the benefit of George <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>Laughlin and Ms family.” He added the charge against the share of George to the balance for distribution and then divided that balance in three parts. Prom one of such parts he deducted the charge against George and awarded the balance in trust for George. The other parts were awarded to Henry Laughlin and Stella M. Shannon. Instead of receiving the entire charge against George’s share, they were given only two-thirds of it. Their claim for the remaining one-third in equal shares was denied. The net effect of this method of distribution was to release George from payment of one-third of the charge which his mother directed be made against his share, or $3,177.70, and his brother and sister were deprived of this amount.</p>

It is not our business to rewrite her will or to speculate as to why she preferred her method of distribution. It is our duty to give effect to her intention.

The law does not require her to express any reason for her scheme of distribution. It is sufficient if she express a clear intention of what is to be done with her estate. “If his language is clear it constitutes its own decree of distribution”: <em>Hogg’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/329/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="329 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1181494" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0163-01">329 Pa. 163</a>, 166, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.%20503" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="196 A. 503">196 A. 503</a>, 504.</p>

Almost the whole will is taken up by consideration of them—past, present and future. Only a few lines are given to the other children. For some reason, not expressed, this mother gave preferred treatment to George, for at least twenty-three years prior to her death. This is proven by the fact that during all that long period she gave him a house to live in and herself paid the taxes and water rents; and during the same period she gave him various sums of money; the result being that when she died he owed her $9,533.09, almost twenty-five percent <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>of the total value of her $40,000 estate. It is undisputed that she did not do anything similar for hér other children, although not anything indicates a lack of affection for them. It is also clear that testatrix had a strong-feeling that she should not prefer one child over the other, and to prevent inequality she provided that the share given George should be “diminished” by the amount he had received in excess of that given the other children.</p>
    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[263,761,1147,523]]]'>With the intention to distribute her estate the way she did, we cannot imagine how she better could have done so. If she had wished George to participate in the residue she could have so declared in very few words. It was much more difficult to order the distribution she did than to simply name him with the other children as an equal beneficiary of the residue. Her language is clear and unambiguous; her plan of distribution is sensible and her own; it cannot be fairly said she made any distinction between her children.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[261,1304,1151,1024]],["BL_163.1",163,[172,258,1148,207]]]'>In considering this case it seems to have been generally overlooked that while testatrix said in her will that George “has received from me during my lifetime sums of money at various times in excess of amounts given to my other children” she made no charge against his portion of her estate for those sums of money. She only charged against him the carrying charges of the property and “any sums of money which I may advance to him from July 15, 1937, until my decease, an account of which shall be kept by me.” It is apparent that during the many years he: occupied the house without charge he received in cash sums of money in excess of what the other children received. He was not asked to repay them. Because of this it is unjust to say that George did not get as large a share of his mother’s estate as did his brother and sister. The truth is he received more than either. And now by the decision in this case he is released from paying one-third ($3,177.70) of the charge Which his mother specifically and in the plainest lan<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>guage directed be charged against his share, and his brother and sister are thus deprived of that amount.
