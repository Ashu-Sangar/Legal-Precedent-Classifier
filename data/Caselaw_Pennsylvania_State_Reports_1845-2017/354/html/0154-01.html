    <p id="b261-8" data-blocks='[["BL_261.14",261,[127,1085,1164,916]]]'>On the morning of May 28,1943, a bright sunny day, Ida F. Simmonds, a women of sixty-five years, together with her daughter, entered the self-service store of defendant Penn Fruit Company, , located in Darby, Pennsylvania. Decedent had completed her marketing, had paid for her purchases, and while walking from the cashier’s counter towards the door to leave tripped over the platform of a penny-scale and fell. The fall resulted' in serious injuries which led to decedent’s death a short time later. Two suits were brought against the Penn Fruit Company, one. by. the administrator of décedent’s estate and the other by decedent’s husband. A trial ensued and the jury returned a verdict in favor .of plaintiff administrator in the sum of $4,000 and in favor of plaintiff husband in the sum of $2,500. Defendant appeals from the dismissal of its motions for judgment non obstante verdicto and new trial.</p>

The negligence alleged was that the platform scale over which decedent tripped was placed in the store where it would cause an unreasonable risk of harm to customers of the store. The scale was the usual pénny weighing scale forty-four inches high and its platfórni six and one-quarter inches from the floor. The platform <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>itself measured twelve by fifteen inches and the scale at its most extreme length was twenty-two inches. It stood with its back to the front window of the store with the platform facing the exit-aisle of the store leading from thé cashiers’ aisle to the storm door which was placed inside the entrance and exit door of the store. Plaintiffs’ position is that the scale was placed so that the platform extended into the aisle of the store.</p>

Plaintiffs distinguish that case from the present one on the ground that there the injured person survived the accident and testified that she did not look where she was going. That distinction is accurate, but immaterial, for here, as in the <em>Burckhalter </em>case, it is abundantly clear from , the evidence that had the customer looked, she would have seen the scale. Plaintiffs <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>here rely on the testimony of their two witnesses that there were people leaving the store when the accident occurred and that there were some people standing along the front wall. But one of the two witnesses (Mrs! Likens) testified as follows: “Q. Now, if you didn’t see your mother from the time she .checked out until the exclamation was made by somebody, you don’t know, do you, whether or not there was anyone in front of your mother? A. No. . . .” And again: “Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether or not at the time she tripped and fell, there were other people around her? A. No, because I did not see mother trip. Q. So you don’t know whether there were people around her or not? A. That’s correct.”</p>

In the first place she didn’t see decedent until she tripped so she could not say whether there were people in front of her ór not. The gist of her testimony is that there were, other people in front of decedent, but they were going out the doorway.</p>

What is most significant is that plaintiffs’ witness, Carrie Drumheller, who was standing to the side and rear of the scene of. the accident as she stood in the line at the cashier’s desk, testified that at that point the scale was “perfectly, obvious” to her.</p>
