This injunction suit was begun before the hearing. It questions the authority of the State Board to proceed.</p>
    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[214,766,1149,865]]]'>The first comprehensive legislation establishing a separate medical bureau and regulating the issuance and revocation of licenses to practice medicine and surgery was the Act of June 3,1911, P. L. 639. The power of the Bureau of Medical Education and Licensure to revoke licenses under section 12 of this Act was then believed to be restricted only to those licenses issued <em>after </em>the passage of the Act. <em>Koler et al. v. Bureau of Medical Education and Licensure, </em>61 Pittsburgh L. J. 538 (opinion of Attorney General, 1913). An amendment of section 12 of the 1911 Act was enacted on May 24, 1917, by which it was provided that the Board had authority to revoke the license of ’“Any person who is <em>licensed to practice medicine and surgery, or any of its branches, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. . . </em>.” Act of May 24, 1917, P.

The narrow argument of appellant is that the word “clarifying” does not give <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>notice that section 12 of the Act was amended to apply to physicians licensed prior to 1911. It is not necessary to discuss the technical meaning of that word. It is clear that a title which mentions that the act is amendatory, recites the particular prior acts it is designed to amend and further specifies the sections of the prior acts involved, puts a person of a reasonably inquiring state of mind on notice of the subject matter of the- act and the reader to further inquiry. That is all that is required by article III, section 3 of.the Constitution. <em>Kotch v.

    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[189,993,1151,1086]]]'>The stated intention of the legislature in passing the 1911 act and its amendments was to establish a complete system of licensing and regulation of physicians and surgeons. The only purpose of-the amendment of section 12 of the Act of 1917 was to bring within the jurisdiction of the Board those licensed prior to the passage of this legislation. If it is to be said that there is a retroactive effect to these statutes, it can also be said that this was manifestly and clearly intended by -the legislature by the very words of section 12 of the 1917 Act, and by the broad, general purpose of this legislation to bring <em>all </em>physicians and surgeons under the uniform operation of. a single licensing and regulatory system.

Juris. Physicians and Surgeons, section 44, it is also the general rule that where the license should never have been granted for reasons such as fraud or forgery, the licensing authority has the <em>inherent power </em>to revoke it: 41 Am.

The appellate courts of this state have not passed on this question. Respectable opinion, however, supports the principle that where a license, such as this, was procured by fraud, it may be revoked by the licensing authority regardless of the fact that fraud is not specified as a ground for revocation in the statute. In the opinion of Deputy Attorney General Frederic W. Fleitz, a license to sell oleomargarine wrongly procured by a non-resident, could be revoked for fraud though the licensing statute did not so provide. See <em>Revocation of Oleomargerine License, </em>1907-1908 Opinions of Attorney General 286. In an opinion by Deputy Attorney General J. E. B. Cunningham (later a judge of the Superior Court), a license to practice osteopathy could be revoked where the application for the license contained false information. In his opinion he states: “In my opinion, your board [Board of Osteopathic Examiners] in addition to the express powers of revocation conferred upon it by the act creating it, has a general inherent power to revoke a license obtained by fraud”: <em>Practice of Osteopathy, </em>13 Dauph. Co. Rep. 302, 305. See also: <em>Oleomargarine Licenses, </em><a href="/citations/?q=19%20Pa.%20D.%20927" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="19 Pa. D. 927">19 Dist.
