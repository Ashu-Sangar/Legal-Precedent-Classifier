It consisted of tAVO lots, each 35 feet in front and 134 feet in depth. On each lot there was a house. The owners had acquired these two lots from Isaac Levy on November 27th, 1917. In order to pay the costs of remodelling these houses, the appellees boriwed in 1927 |5,500 from the First National Bank of Ashley and they gave as security for this loan, a bond and mortgage. This mortgage described the property subject to it as being 35 feet in front on Main Street, i.e., it described only <em>one </em>of the two 35 feet <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>lots, that being the lot Edward C.

Because of default on the payment of the debt, judgment on the bond was entered and the property sold at Sheriff’s sale on March 5th, 1913. It was purchased by the First National Bank of Ashley fifteen days later. The Bank petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, reciting the facts of the conveyance of the two lots to Louis Trachtenberg and wife on November 27th, 1917 by Isaac Levy and wife; the loan made to the Trachtenbergs by the Bank in 1927; the giving of the bond by the debtors, the “inadvertence” in the mortgage description of the property, the default, the entry of judgment, the issuance of a fi. fa., and the fact that in the description of the property to be sold (which description was given to the Sheriff) was the following: “Improved with a two-story frame building containing four apartments and known as 73-75 South Main Street, Ashley, Luzerne County, Penna.” The petition also set forth that the Sheriff’s advertisement contained the recitals as to the property: (1) “Being the same premises conveyed by Isaac Levy and Dora Levy, Lis wife) to Louis Trachtenberg and Annie Trachtenberg, his wife, by deed dated November 27, 1917 and recorded” . . . and, (2) Being “improved with a two-story frame building containing four apartments and known as 73-75 South Main Street, Ashley, Luzerne County, Penna.”. The petition averred that: “The above two recitals indicate that the property sold was the property obtained from Isaac Levy <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>and Dora Levy, Ms wife, on the 27th day of November, 1917, as recorded in Deed Book 518 page 849 being 70 feet in width in the front of Main Street instead of 35 feet on Main Street and 70 feet in the rear instead of 35 feet as set forth in the description in said mortgage.” The petition also asked the Court “to make an order directing the Sheriff to acknowledge, record and deliver a deed to the purchaser containing the description as set forth in the deed from Isaac Levy and Dora Levy, his wife, to Louis Trachtenberg and Annie Trachtenberg, his wife, dated November 27, 1917, and recorded in Luzerne County in Deed Book 518 page 349; and that the description in the record of said mortgage be corrected accordingly.”</p>

The correction ordered gave the lot sold a 70 feet width in front and rear, instead of 35 feet width, and corrected the . description so that it covered the <em>two </em>lots which the Trachtenbergs actually owned when they made the loan. The Court also ordered that the description in the record of the mortgage “be corrected accordingly” and that the “Recorder of Deeds shall duly record this decree and note same on the margin of the record of said mortgage”. This order was carried out. On July 14,1943 the Glen Alden Coal Company purchased this property from the bank for $4500.</p>

Brown from dispossessing them from the property. A preliminary injunction was granted and after taking testimony on the motion to continue it, the injunction was modified so as to permit the defendants to proceed with the dispossession of the plaintiffs from that portion of the premises described in the mortgage. The injunction dissolved twelve days later, and when an appeal to this court was made we held that the dissolution of the injunction was not an abuse of discretion.

The original answers denied plaintiffs’ right to relief. After the taking of testimony, the defendant company in accordance with the provisions of Equity Rule No. 56, filed an amended answer, setting up “New Matter” and praying for affirmative relief. The relief asked for was for the court “to correct the description in the aforesaid mortgage from Louis Trachtenberg and Annie Trachtenberg to the First National Bank of Ashley, Pa., dated May 16, 1927, and recorded in Mortgage Book 310, at page 174, so that the description thereof will conform with the description in the deed from Isaac Levy and Dora Levy, his wife, to Louis Trachtenberg and Annie Trachtenberg, his wife, dated November 27, 1917, and recorded in Deed Book 518, page 349, and in the deed <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>poll from Dallas C. Shobert, Sheriff of Luzerne County, to the First National Bank of Ashley, dated March 5, 1943, and recorded in Luzerne County in Deed Book 792, page 579.” Plaintiff filed a responsive reply. The issues became these: (1) Whether the mortgage description of the property limiting the property to a 35 foot frontage, instead of a 70 foot frontage was caused by a mutual mistake. (2) Whether, if such a mistake was made, a Court of Equity has authority to correct it after the Sheriff’s sale of the property and the delivery of his deed to the purchaser.</p>
    <p id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.4",632,[244,894,1149,425]]]'>The Sheriff’s Sale advertisement described the property to be sold under the fi. fa. as being 35 feet in front and approximately 133 feet in depth. The property described by metes and bounds conformed to the description of one lot which was the western half of the entire property of 70 feet. The Sheriff’s Sale advertisement also contained the recital quoted in the last sentence of the second paragraph of this opinion.</p>

In the decree nisi filed on June 20th, 1945, it was ordered that the plaintiffs’ Bill be dismissed and that the mortgage executed on May 16th, 1927, by Louis Trachtenberg and Annie Trachtenberg, his wife, to the First National Bank of Ashley, be reformed so that the description of the land contained therein should show a width of 70 feet instead of 35 feet. Exceptions were filed to the findings of fact and conclusions of law- and these were heard before the court en banc. These exceptions were not acted upon by the court en banc except as it rendered the following “opinion”: (1) “While the evidence might warrant a finding of mutual mistake in the description contained in the mortgage in question, the understanding of the <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>mortgagees as to the land to be included therein is not clearly established, and that the satisfaction of the mortgage on July 14, 1943, eliminated the mortgage as an instrument of record, and precludes the Court from reforming the mortgage, even though the foreclosure proceedings are not a barrier to such relief;” and (2) “neither plaintiffs nor defendants are entitled to the relief respectively prayed for by them.” In this “final decree” of October 2,1945, the Court ordered that “for the purpose of clarifying the record in the office of the Recorder of Deeds, the sheriff’s deed to the First National Bank of Ashley, dated March 5th, 1943, and recorded in Luzerne County Deed Book, 792, Page 579, should be reformed so that the description of the land contained therein conforms to the description embodied in the mortgage of May 17,1927, given by the Trachtenbergs to the First National Bank of Ashley, and that this may be directed under the prayer in plaintiffs’ Bill for general relief.” This final decree thus negatived the decree nisi of June 20, 1945 and also the decree of March 30, 1943, and thereby it denied defendant’s prayer for “affirmative relief” from the alleged mistake in describing the lot it acquired as having a frontage of only 35 feet.</p>

The proceeds of the mortgage loan were used to pay a debt secured by a then existing mortgage covering <em>both </em>lots and the then attorney for the bank (now Judge Thomas F. Farrell), testified that the mortgage of May 17, 1927 for $5500 was “a substitute for the Levy mortgage” for $7500, which was a lien on both lots. On July 23, 1926, fhe Trachtenbergs had borrowed $1,000 from the same bank and as security therefor had executed and delivered a mortgage covering both lots. On November 9th, 1927, the Trachtenbergs executed a third mortgage securing a loan of $1500 on the same one lot of 35 feet described in the second mortgage. This mortgage likewise, contained <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>the recital as to the “same premises”,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> already quoted. President Edgar <em>of </em>the bank testified that after the sheriff’s sale of the property, Mr. Trachtenberg came to him and said he “wanted to redeem the property for $4,000” (later increased to $4,500) which offer the bank was unwilling to accept and that Trachtenberg also discussed the renting of the property. Mr. Edgar further testified “that there Avas no intimation at that time or any time that we were discussing thirty-five feet”. Tie answered “Never” when asked: “At any of these discussions or conversations, Avas anything said about a division or thirty-five feet of the property?” Tie declared that in the conversation with Trachtenberg about the latter’s possible redemption of the property there was “never any discussion as to any other than the whole property”. The insurance policy given the bank as additional security for the mortgage loan of $5500 covered the “entire property”. The only evidence tending to deny that the mortgage covered the entire property was that of Louis Trachtenberg, Avho as a witness Avhen interrogated as follows: “Did you ask Mr. Edgar to give you the mortgage on the new brick building or on the whole property?” ansAvered: “On the brick building.” Trachtenberg also testified: “I told Mr. Edgar I would give him mortgage on this brick building because it cost me over $25,000”.</p>

However, this is not the pivotal question in the case at this late stage of the proceedings and we do not have to decide it.</p>
    <p id="b635-3" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[193,785,1148,853]]]'>The question whose answer decides this case is this: Where a mistake in the description of mortgaged property has been carried through the foreclosure proceedings and the sheriff’s deed, is the purchaser entitled to have a court of equity correct the deed so as to vest in him property which' was not expressly included in the mortgage and ivas not included in the sheriff’s advertisement of the property to be sold? On every sound consideration of public policy this question must be answered in the negative. To embody in a judicial opinion an affirmative answer to this question would be to countenance and establish a procedure which would be likely to open the door to irregularities prolific of great injustices and which would tend to cast uncertainty on land titles derived through or from sheriff’s deeds of title.</p>

First, it would be unfair to the mortgage debtor. He is entitled to have the <em>entire </em>property of which he is to be divested advertised for sale so that it will bring a price higher than will the mere portion advertised for sale. Second, the judgment creditor is entitled to have the <em>entire </em>property which he claims is covered by the mortgage advertised and sold to the end that a higher price may be obtained from the successful <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>bidder. The fact that, as in the instant case, the successful bidder was the judgment creditor, does not make the reason just stated inapplicable. Some other person might have bid higher had the property been correctly described in the advertisement and thus have rendered unnecessary for the creditor’s protection his own purchase of the property. Third, the public is entitled to be correctly informed by advertisement of the size and nature, i.e., of the exact identity, of the property to be sold at the sheriff’s sale so that possible purchasers may bid with exact information as to what they are bidding on. That there should be no concealment or misrepresentation, intentional or otherwise, of a fact which if known would affect bidding at a public sale conducted by an official representative of the Commonwealth is incontestable. Pomeroy’s “Equity Jurisprudence” Yol. Ill, 5th Edition, p. 398 says: “It is held in the majority of jurisdictions that a mistake or defect in a sheriff’s deed cannot be aided and the deed reformed in equity. The reason given for this rule is that a sheriff in the sale of lands, under execution or order of court, acts in the exercise of a statutory power and if his deed contains a false description or is otherwise defective, a court of equity is without jurisdiction to aid it and pass the title.”</p>
    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[263,1605,1147,798]]]'>Whether or not the error in advertising the sale of this property had any effect on the bidding for the property is immaterial. If a decision in cases such as this depended on the result of an inquiry as to that, the court which conducted the inquiry would have to pass on so many collateral questions and would have to depend so much on conjecture that it would be impracticable, perhaps impossible, to reach a reasonably just result. The only rule which is compatible with the due administration of justice in such cases is a rule to the effect that after a sheriff’s sale of property in a mortgage foreclosure proceeding and after the. sheriff’s deed is acknowledged and delivered, it cannot be reformed by a court of equity so as to include property <em>not </em>mortgaged and sold.</p>

Mericles et al., </em><a href="/ind/75/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="75 Ind. 443" data-case-ids="1944205" data-case-paths="/ind/75/0443-01">75 Ind. 443</a>. In that case the Court after discussing other Indiana cases on the same subject said: "These cases establish the proposition, that when an incorrect description of lands intended to be embraced in a mortgage is carried into the judgment, order of sale, notice and sheriff’s deed, such proceedings can not be corrected either at the instance of the mortgagee or the purchaser at such sale, but they do not decide that such mistake can not be corrected by reforming the mortgage and foreclosing it as reformed . . . The mortgage, as reformed, is a different instrument, embraces a different parcel of land, and one against which no foreclosure has been had. The judgment of foreclosure upon the land described did not adjudge that the land in dispute was not mortgaged by such instrument, and omitted therefrom by mistake, and, therefore, ‘the question of description’ is not <em>res adjudícala, </em>nor does such judgment form any obstacle to the reformation and foreclosure of the mortgage.”</p>

It is true that she thought that the property intended to be mortgaged was the property offered for sale, and evidently bid in the property with that understanding, but it does not appear that other bidders, if any others were present at the sale, had the same understanding.

If upon the advertisement and sale of entirely different property by mistake in the original mortgage would permit a reformation of the sheriff’s deed, the entire purpose of the advertisement of the property by the sheriff would be defeated. Here lot No. 5 was advertised and sold—a different piece of property entirely from lot No. 6, to which the defendant in execution had no title whatever. It cannot be known who would have bid, nor the amount of the bid, nor that appellant would have been the purchaser if lot No. 6 had been advertised and sold, and neither can it be known what, if any, steps appellees would in such event have taken to protect their interest in said lot No. 6.
