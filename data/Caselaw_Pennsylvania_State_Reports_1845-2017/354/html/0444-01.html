The official death certificate gave <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>the cause of death as “Cardiac Dilation due to Arteriosclerosis Psychosis”. His next of kin were a brother and two nephews, issue of a deceased brother. The estate was valued at $7,000. All of the property (except 50 shares of stock of the Mesta Machine Company) had been owned by testator and his wife as tenants by the entireties. The wife predeceased testator, dying in December, 1943, a week prior, to her husband’s death. Testator, a pensioned employe of the Mesta Machine Company, had retired in November, 1940 because of disability due to illness. He and his wife had maintained a joint bank account in the Colonial Trust Company, a Pittsburgh bank. Raymond D. Wetherell, a proponent and chief beneficiary under the will, was an officer of the bank. Mr. Wetherell testified that he first met testator and his wife <em>“about 194-2” </em>when the account was opened. Later he said he knew decedent and his wife for “twenty years”; that “it was 1922” when the account was opened in the bank; the learned hearing judge found that Mr. Wetherell first met decedent about 1935. But irrespective of the correct date, Mr. Wetherell testified that his only connection with the decedent and his wife was as teller at the window of the bank when he waited upon them as customers. He said that on one occasion he explained to decedent the nature of the various issues of United States Government War Bonds and advised him as to which issue was most suitable for his requirements. It does not appear that he ever visited the decedent and his wife. After the wife’s death proponent arranged for decedent’s admission into a nursing home and he took him there.</p>

He asked them if they had ever written a will and they told him that Mr. McWhinney had previously written- their wills. Decedent said that they did not wish to go back to him because Mr. McWhinney was the attorney for his brother-in-law. (Mr. McWhinney later testified that he <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>had written reciprocal wills for decedent and his wife in May, 1940 and under these wills the decedent and wife had left their estates to named nephews and nieces of both of them). Mr. Wetherell said decedent and his wife asked the name and address of the lawyer whom decedent had previously known, and who was the personal attorney for Mr. Wetherell. Mr. Wetherell said it was Bruce Harrison, Esq., of the law firm of Shrum, Harrison and Craig. Decedent stated that this was the man he was looking for. The name and address of Mr. Harrison was then written by Mr. Wetherell on the back of a deposit ticket. Mr. Wetherell then called Mr. Harrison on the telephone to inquire if he was in. Mr. Wetherell informed the decedent that the lawyer was in and was waiting in his office. A bank guard who participated in part of the conversation, showed the decedent and his wife the way to go to the lawyer’s office. (Bruce Harrison, Esq., the scrivener, died after he had prepared the will, which he had witnessed, and assisted in its probate).</p>

All three witnesses to the will swore before the register that they had seen the decedent sign his name and at the time of so doing he was of sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding. The wife’s pastor and the bank guard testified that in their opinions decedent possessed testamentary capacity. Contestants produced two physicians and nine lay witnesses, all of whom testified that in their opinions decedent was mentally incompetent to execute the will on October 2, 1942.</p>

From their viewpoint the testator was before and after the execution of the will in a far advanced state of senility from which he could not have recovered sufficiently on October 2,1942 to execute a will and was at the time of its execution unable to legally dispose of his property.” The court below ruled that the testimony of proponent’s witnesses concerning decedent’s mental capacity <em>on the date of the execution of the will </em>overcame the testimony of contestants’ witnesses as to decedent’s mental incapacity on that date, derived from observations made near October 2, 1942. The court below regarded contestants’ evidence as possessing no probative value. With this we disagree. In the circumstances of this ease, we regard that evidence as material and admissible.</p>

Dr. Campbell testified that he had been the surgeon for the Mesta Machine Company for thirty years, and had known the decedent, an employe, for at least fifteen years. In November, 1940 he examined decedent and found a stomach condition which caused decedent to quit his employment and go on a pension. While <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>the doctor testified without his records, and from memory, he said that he had treated decedent professionally from November, 1940 until decedent’s death in January, 1944. He testified that he saw him professionally frequently during 1942—the first part of the year at least twice a week and after that at least once a month. In 1943, he visited decedent occasionally, but was not the attending physician when he died. The doctor testified, “I observed that he had arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure and mental deterioration, commonly called softening of the brain, a chronic condition which is incurable and never gets better after it once starts.” He testified that in his opinion decedent did not possess the mental capacity to make a will on October 2, 1942. He assigned as his reason “Because he (decedent) was of unsound mind. He really had what is called senile dementia.” Dr. Malcolm, the other physician, wus on the staff of St. Francis Hospital (having an important mental clinic), Mercy Hospital, and was assistant professor of neurology at the medical school of the University of Pittsburgh. Decedent was brought to St. Francis Hospital for observation and remained there from September 27 until October 2, 1943 and Avas under the charge of Dr. Malcolm. The doctor diagnosed his condition as “generalized arteriosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries, and a marked arteriosclerosis in the eyes,” that the mental symptoms had been present for eighteen months to two years prior thereto, and that in the opinion of the doctor on October 2,1942 decedent would not have been competent to have made a will.</p>

There the decedent told the scrivener “everything she owned and the disposition she desired to be made of it, and that in doing so, she named each of her children individually and determined just what each should receive.” The clarity of decedent’s mind was corroborated by the other subscribing witnesses. The doctor’s-testimony that, from his observation of decedent three months after the execution of the will, she was mentally incompetent “was not grounded upon any definite or real knowledge of (decedent’s) testamentary capacity at the time she executed her will.” Such opinion was not supported by substantial facts.</p>

A substantial issue of fact with respect to that question is plainly disclosed by the record. But, equally, I am unable to perceive the evidence which would justify a chancellor in accepting a jury’s verdict against the will on the ground that its execution was procured by fraud and undue influence practiced upon thé decedent.</p>
    <p id="b559-7" data-blocks='[["BL_559.9",559,[183,1445,1152,917]]]'>The factual situation necessary to cast upon the proponent the burden of establishing affirmatively the propriety and regularity of the execution of the will is not present. It may at once be conceded that the evidence would justify a finding that at the time of the execution of the will the decedent was aged and weak in mind (whether lacking testamentary capacity or not) and that the proponent, a stranger to the blood, was given a large share of the estate by the terms of the will. But, there is nothing to support a finding that a <em>confidential relation </em>obtained between the decedent and the proponent. And, the existence of such a situation is essential to an application of the rule which the majority opinion invokes: <em>Stewart Will, </em><a href="/pa/354/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="354 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="467444" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0288-01">354 Pa. 288</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=47%20A.2d%20204" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="47 A.2d 204">47 A. 2d 204</a>; <em>Llewellyn’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/296/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="296 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1116672" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0074-01">296 Pa. 74</a>, 82, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20810" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="154 A. 810">154 A. 810</a>; <em>Phillips’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/244/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="244 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1003479" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0035-01">244 Pa. 35</a>, 42, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20A.%20457" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="90 A. 457">90 A. 457</a>; <em>Adams’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/220/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="220 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="1005889" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0531-01">220 Pa. 531</a>, 533-534, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.%20989" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="69 A. 989">69 A. 989</a>.</p>

      <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>The proponent’s only contacts with the decedent and his wife were when they, for business purposes, periodically visited the bank where the proponent held a responsible position. He had never visited them in their home nor had he met with them socially or for other purposes elsewhere. And, the only time he ever gave them any advice was with respect to the particular series of War Bonds best suited to the decedent’s investment. For a service in such regard, the proponent had become expertly qualified for the benefit of the bank’s inquiring customers in general.</p>

True enough, Mr. Harrison was also the legatee’s attorney; and, in last analysis, it is that relationship upon which the suggestion of <em>undue </em>influence depends. But, the wills were drawn and executed <em>in the attorney’s office </em>upon a visit there for that express purpose by Mr. and Mrs. Diehter (the decedent and his wife) <em>unaccompanied by anyone else. </em>He was not unknown to the Dichters for whom he had earlier performed a professional service. Upon going to the bank the day the wills were drawn, the decedent and his wife asked the proponent the name of the attorney to whom he had sent them before. He said that it was Mr. Harrison. They told the proponent that they wanted to have wills drawn. He asked them if they already had wills and they said they had, telling him the name of the attorney who had drawn them. The proponent suggested that they again consult the same attorney, to which the decedent demurred for a sufficient personal reason which he expressed. The proponent then called Mr. Harrison by telephone to see if he was in his office and found that he was. This telephone conversation took place in the bank lobby in the hearing of the Dichters and a bank usher who then escorted Mr. and Mrs. Dichter to the Fourth Avenue exit of the bank and pointed <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>out the office building up-street to which they went alone to see and consult with the attorney in <em>Ms </em>office. Unfortunately, Mr. Harrison who was also a subscribing witness to the wills, died prior to the hearing in the court below on the appeal from the probate. There is not a scintilla of evidence from which it could be directly found or reasonably inferred that Mr. Harrison incorporated a single thing in the reciprocal wills other than the personally expressed testamentary desires of the decedent and his wife, unprompted and not <em>unduly </em>influenced by anyone.</p>
    <p id="b561-4" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[203,867,1150,1082]]]'>It is, of course, unavoidably true that a reputation for honor and integrity is not a safeguard against the involvement of one’s name in unpleasant litigation, even after death. But, such involvement should at least rest upon probable cause. How the evidence in .this case warrants any imputation of fraud and undue influence in the execution of the decedent’s will, it is not possible for me to see. Certainly a chancellor at the trial of such an issue should have more than what this record now discloses to justify him in accepting a jury’s verdict against the will on that ground. Furthermore, it would seem that, upon a trial of that issue, the wife’s mentality and physical condition would also be highly relevant and material. As already indicated, she executed a reciprocal will on the same day and under the same circumstances, —subsequently predeceasing her husband by a week. If she was sound of mind and not <em>unduly </em>influenced, she had a right to expect that the property would ultimately pass as she and her husband by their wills had reciprocally provided.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[202,1962,1149,373]],["BL_562.1",562,[228,263,1148,580]]]'>The will is by no means an unnatural one even though the proponent had seen and conversed with the decedent and his wife only upon their monthly or so visits to the bank over a period of years (about twenty). The status of “stranger to the blood” requires for its full legal import that there be blood relatives who were likely objects of the testator’s bounty. In the present <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>instance Mr. Dichter had one brother who lived in Germany and from whom he had not heard for years. It was not even, known that the brother was alive. He also had two nephews, who lived in Erie, only a hundred miles away, but who were not sufficiently interested in their uncle either to communicate with him or visit him in the eighteen years prior to his death. That the decedent and his wife, in making their wills, were cognizant of those really close to them is in part evidenced by the fact that, among their bequests, they provided for masses for their deceased children.</p>
    <p id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.4",562,[228,865,1149,532]]]'>At most, the suggestion of undue influence in this case has nothing more to support it than a shadowy suspicion; and, that is not enough: see <em>Ash Will, </em><a href="/pa/351/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="351 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="462704" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0317-01">351 Pa. 317</a>, 324, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20620" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="41 A.2d 620">41 A. 2d 620</a>; <em>Rosenthal’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/339/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="339 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1201285" data-case-paths="/pa/339/0488-01">339 Pa. 488</a>, 496, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20A.2d%20370" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="15 A.2d 370">15 A. 2d 370</a>. Under the present record, it is no less reasonable to infer that the beneficent disposition of the decedent and his wife toward the proponent was the result of his courtesy and kindliness to them rather than to any over-reaching on his part. In my opinion, therefore, the injection of undue influence is unwarranted.</p>
