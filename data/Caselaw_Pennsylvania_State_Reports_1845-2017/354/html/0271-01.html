Nicol &amp; Co., Inc., is in New York, though it also maintains an office in Philadelphia; it began doing business in Pennsylvania in 1942. Mr. Nicol is a resident of Montclair, New Jersey, and since 1939 has had no financial interest in defendant corporation. He testified that Pacific Atlantic Steamship Corporation "were general agents for the War Shipping Administration in the operation of” its vessels. During the year 1943, but after the date of the alleged service now involved, R. A. Nicol &amp; Co., Inc., acted for the defendant with respect to four ships coming to Philadelphia, one of them owned by defendant and the other three owned by the War Shiping Administration and operated by the defendant. Asked what his company did for the defendant he said, "A. Well, today we check with the Navy Department as to when a steamer might be expected, and arrange for pilots, for a berth for her on arrival, towboats to put them into the berth, and arrange to pay off the crew and sign them off the articles, order and see delivered stores for the new voyage, and signing on a new crew, dispatch of the vessel, towboats to take her out of here and pilots to take her out. We see that the master attends the Navy routing conferences to get his instructions to go to sea under today’s conditions.” From the beginning of 1944 until August 25th, when his evidence was given, the Nicol Company handled four ships op<a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>erated by defendant bnt belonging to the War Shipping Administration. Mr. Nicol testified that his company was paid “agency fees on a ship basis.” He stated that his company had “no contract” with defendant.

S. 310</a>, Chief Justice Stone said: “ ‘Presence’ in the state in this sense has never been doubted when the activities of the corporation there have not only been continuous and systematic, but also give rise to the liabilities sued on, even though no consent to be sued or authorization to an agent to accept servicé of process has been given, [citing cases] . . . Conversely it has been generally recognized that the casual presence of the corporate agent or even his conduct of single or isolated items of activities in a state in the corporation’s behalf are not enough to subject it to suit on causes of action unconnected with the activities there, [citing cases] . . . To require the corporation in such circumstances to defend the suit away from its home or other jurisdiction where it carries on more substantial activities has been thought to lay too great and unreasonable a burden on the corporation to comport with due process.” Further on he said, “Whether due process is satisfied must de<a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>pend rather upon the quality and nature of the activity in relation to the fair and orderly administration of the laws which it was the purpose of the due process clause to insure. That clause does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment <em>in personam </em>against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.
