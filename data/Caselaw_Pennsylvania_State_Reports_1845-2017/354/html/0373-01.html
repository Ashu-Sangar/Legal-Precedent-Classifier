The facts are these: The motor bus was proceeding in a southerly direction on the Pike at 9 A. M. The operator of the bus described the road as being “very slippery, icy and sleety; it was partly raining and snowing and slushy”. There were no chains on the tires. The Pike is intersected by Susquehanna Road at a point where to one driving southerly, the Pike curves “very sharply to the left”. Approaching Susquehanna Road, the Pike for a distance of 244 feet north of Susquehanna <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>Road drops in a <em>2y2% </em>grade; from Susquehanna Road south the grade increases to one of 6%% for approximately 156 feet. An engineer described this latter grade as “a heavy grade, especially around the curve”. The bus driver testified that as he approached Susquehanna Road the bus was proceeding at a rate of between 15 and 20 miles per hour, and that as he was drawing near to Susquehanna Road, he took his foot off the accelerator and as he came around Susquehanna Road, he “suddenly went into a skid”. He was asked: “Just as you crossed Susquehanna Road how fast were you going?” He answered: “. . . Not more than five miles an hour, because I expected a passenger, and I had started to pull up a bit.” His testimony at the first trial of this case was then read to him. There he had testified: “The road was icy and slippery. I was traveling between 16 and 20 miles per hour, and as I hit Susquehanna Road at the curve, the bus went into a skid.” He had driven over this route for more than six months. The trip in which the accident occurred was his second crip that morning over that road. He testified that he was not “on schedule” on the second trip and he “thought” he was “a little late”.</p>

This <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>was not a case where a car or bus suddenly encounters an unforeseen patch of ice on the highway and then skids. The operator of this bus had traveled over this part of the highway only two hours previously and he knew exactly what was ahead of him. The general weather conditions also were such as to put him on notice that he should proceed down grade with caution, at a slow rate of speed. This he did not do. The momentum of the bus was such that its skidding on this hill was to be expected. It was the driver’s duty to reduce that momentum. This duty he breached and it is a legitimate inference that the accident resulted from that breach.</p>

I, Sec. 56, p. 152, makes this statement: “It is not that, in any case, negligence can be assumed from the mere fact of an accident and an injury; but in these cases the surrounding circumstances which are necessarily brought into view by showing how the accident occurred contain, without further proof, sufficient evidence of the defendant’s duty and of his neglect to perform it. The fact of the casualty and the attendant circumstances may themselves furnish all the proof of negligence that the injured person is able to offer, or that it is necessary to offer. [Citing cases.] It is not the injury, but the manner and circumstances of the injury, that justify the application of the maxim and the inference of negligence. If a passenger in a car is <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>injured by striking tbe seat in front of Mm, that of itself authorizes no inference of negligence.

It is not a case of res ipsa loquitur, for negligence is not presumed from the mere happening of the accident, but from the circumstances under which it occurred. It was an abnormal occurrence such as in the usual course of events does not occur. An automobile when driven along a dry level road in daylight at proper speed and under control is not accustomed to leave the pavement and dash against a stone pile at the roadside.
