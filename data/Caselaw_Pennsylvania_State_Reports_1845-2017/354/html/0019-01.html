    <p id="b126-7" data-blocks='[["BL_126.9",126,[255,720,1150,1082]]]'>This is an appeal from the refusal of the court below to grant a new trial. The plaintiff brought a suit in trespass against the defendant, claiming damages for injuries to his right eye. His claim was that on May 2nd, 1942, as a street car on which he was a passenger, approached an intersection and he was in the act’ of depositing his fare in the coin box before alighting, “the car stopped with a jerk, the doors were thrown open and the fare register cord struck him in the right eye.” He continued on the street car, a short distance, to the end of the line and there he examined the cord and “found on the bottom” thereof “a steel nut”. This cord was said to be “similar to a clothes-line, but heavier”. He said there were “several knots tied in the free end of the rope and the steel nut was at the bottom”. As a result of the blow to the right eye, the plaintiff claimed its <em>retina </em>was <em>detached </em>and its sight destroyed. At the second trial on February 24, 1945, a verdict was returned in favor of the defendant. After the refusal of a new trial, this appeal followed.</p>

This evidence was not followed by any proof that the condition the rope was in five days before the accident continued until the date of the accident. This assignment is sustained. Henry’s “Pennsylvania Trial Evidence”, Second Edition, Sec. 32, p. 51. says: “Whenever the condition of a particular place or thing at a certain time is in question, evidence of its condition at a prior or subsequent time is admissible <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>

    <p id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[171,771,1151,1137]]]'>The third assignment of error is based on the admission of evidence in behalf of the defendant of the usual and customary condition of fare cords in other street cars of the defendant. This evidence was inadmissible. The fact that other fare cords on the street cars of the defendant company did not have a nut on the end of them did not tend to disprove the plaintiff’s allegation that the cord in question did have a nut on its end. The evidence was, therefore, irrelevant. In <em>Com. v. Crowell, </em><a href="/pa-super/52/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="52 Pa.

James L. O’Toole, Jr. The witness represented plaintiff as counsel, in a suit against the Pittsburgh Railway Company, for injuries sustained by the plaintiff’s eye while a passenger on that company’s street car in October 1928. Plaintiff made an offer that the witness would testify that the injuries then complained of <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>“were all on the left side of the face and not on the right side.” Dr. Kuntz had testified that he had attended plaintiff in 1928 and that the plaintiff told him at the time that he had been struck in the right eye while riding on a street car on October 9th, 1928. The object that struck him was a limb of a tree which was “extending from a landscape wagon”.</p>
    <p id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.4",128,[251,678,1150,1613]]]'>The plaintiff testified that Dr. Kuntz had not treated his right eye in 1928 but had treated his left eye. Therefore, the question of whether the left eye or the right eye had been injured in 1928 was a fact in issue and when the man who had been plaintiff’s counsel in the action based on the 1928 injury, offered to testify after refreshing his recollection by consulting his files, his primary knowledge of the inquiry being based on seeing the plaintiff at that time and on the statement of claim that he, the attorney, drafted at that time, the evidence should have been admitted. The court erred in stating that this testimony was “purely hearsay and not rebuttal”. It was <em>not </em>hearsay because it was based upon the witness’ own observation, as recorded by him in his files of the case, and it was clearly in rebuttal of the testimony of Dr. Kuntz. A witness may use a book or memorandum for the purpose of refreshing his memory even though the writing itself would not be competent evidence : <em>Babb v.

At the trial now being reviewed, the defendant witness, Jozefcik, testified that after the accident, he had removed the fare register rope involved in this case, at the request of the foreman, and that the rope did not have any steel nut on the end of it. His testimony that it was he who removed the rope was in contradiction to the testimony of A. D. Bramwell, a witness called by the defendant in the first trial of this case in May 1943. Bramwell testified that he had taken the fare cord off that car. If his testimony was credited by the jury, it would tend to discredit Jozefcik as a witness. The trial judge excluded the notes of Bramwell’s testimony on the ground that it was “not rebuttal” and because Bramwell was not called as a witness at this trial. In the opinion filed in this case, the trial judge said: “Jozefcik could not have been bound by what Bramwell stated.” When one party calls a witness to contradict the opposing party’s witness on a material matter, the fact that the witness contradicted is “not bound” by the contradicting witness’ testimony is wholly amiss. It is for the jury to decide which witness is telling the truth.</p>
