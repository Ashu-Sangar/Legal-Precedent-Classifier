The debtor defaulted. It was the duty of the Board to conserve the property of the Fund; in performing that duty and for the purpose of saving the expense of foreclosure the Board obtained from the debtor a deed for the property. This deed was dated December 31, 1940, and was recorded May 8, 1941. Since taking the title, the property has been rented to the former owner; no part of it is occupied by the Commonwealth or any of its agencies.</p>

In 1945 the Treasurer of Dauphin County notified the Board that the property had been returned for non-payment of taxes in the sum of $1,837.83 for county and school taxes for the year 1942 and that unless such taxes were paid by August 6, 1945, he, as treasurer, would sell the real estate for taxes at a specified time and place. This proceeding was then begun by petition for a rule to show cause why the assessment should not be set aside. No suit was pending. The county, the city, the school district and the county treasurer answered the petition <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>and the Board filed a replication to the answers. After hearing on those papers the court struck off the assessments. The School District appeals.</p>
    <p id="b666-4" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[229,442,1149,643]]]'>Appellant contends that as “the real estate is not used solely and exclusively for public purposes but is used for commercial purposes and for a rental it is subject to local taxation;” that the deed to the Board is void because title should have been taken in the name of the Commonwealth (Section 1 of the Act of May 29, 1931, P. L. 214, 72 P.S. 1412) and, not having been taken in the name of the Commonwealth, the title remains in the former owner. It was also contended the Board should have made an earlier disposition of the property as permitted by section 3 of the Act of May 29, 1931, P. L. 214, 72 P.S. 1414.</p>

L. 762, administrator of the State Workmen’s Insurance Fund in accordance with the provisions of the said Act of Assembly,” leaves no doubt that the property belongs to the Commonwealth; as title was taken without the means of a foreclosure sale, there has been no violation of section 1 of the Act of 1931, supra. There is nothing in the record to show that the Board has unlawfully delayed making a sale, nor do we see Ixow such an issue could be relevant as this is not a proceeding to require the Board to perform a duty alleged to be unperformed.</p>

The $200,000.00 loaned in 1930 was public property and the transaction was for a public purpose, that is, in the course of the administration of the State Workmen’s Insurance Fund. The administration of the investment has not ceased and will not cease until the loan is repaid or lawfully charged off. It has not ceased to be public property ad<a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>ministered for a public purpose merely because the form of the investment was changed from money to land. The deed to the grantee, a copy of which was furnished to us at the argument, contained a resolution by the corporate grantor authorizing the conveyance; it provided that the mortgage indebtedness shall be credited with the “fair market value of said real estate at the time of the transfer” and that after four months “upon satisfaction of said mortgage and the surrender of the present Bond a new Bond shall be executed and delivered by the Corporation for any deficiency or balance due the said Workmen’s Insurance Fund, the said new bond to be restricted, however, to the proceeds of the life insurance policies now in the possession of the State Workmen’s Fund or the cash surrender value thereof.</p>

Written all over the transaction is the fact that this is a mere change in the form of the investment whose administration is as much for public purposes now as it was when it was created. Article IX, section 1, of the Constitution, authorizes exemption from taxation of public property used for public purposes. The General County Assessment Law of May 22, 1933, P. L. 853, 72 P.S. 5020-201, provides for taxation of property and section 204 (g) specifies that “All other public property used for public purposes, with the <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>ground thereto annexed and necessary for the occupancy and enjoyment of the same . . .” shall be exempt from taxation.</p>
    <p id="b668-4" data-blocks='[["BL_668.4",668,[233,441,1149,794]]]'>The learned court below held, and we agree, that the case is ruled by the principle applied in <em>Com. of Pennsylvania, State Employes Retirement System v.

That case dealt with the exemption of land in Harrisburg that had been purchased by the Retirement System at its foreclosure of a mortgage taken as security for a loan of its funds. We held that the property was within the exemption of public property used for public purposes. While Section 17 of the State Employes Retirement Act, under consideration in that case, exempted “the moneys in the fund created under this Act” from taxation, the opinion stated that “This real estate [is] outside the scope of the general taxation provisions of the Act of 1933.”</p>

No suit was pending when the rule to show cause was allowed by the court; its jurisdiction had not attached to anyone; there was no proceeding to which the motion for the rule could be auxiliary. If any proposed respondent had disregarded the motion and rule, the court could not have proceeded as for default because the court had never obtained jurisdiction over the person by summons or similar process authorized to confer jurisdiction over the person. <em>Short v.

Judge Parker said: “The rule should not have been granted, and it was properly discharged. ‘In other <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>words, a rule is not properly original process in any case, but is auxiliary, and for the facilitating of jurisdiction already acquired’: Mitchell, Motions and Eules, p. 3. The learned author in the same work points out that by statute a rule to show cause is sometimes authorized to be used as an original process; for example, a rule by one in possession of land against a person claiming title to bring an action of ejectment, and rules with relation to sheriffs’ interpleaders. We know of no statute authorizing a rule to show cause as an original process in a case of this kind.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>
