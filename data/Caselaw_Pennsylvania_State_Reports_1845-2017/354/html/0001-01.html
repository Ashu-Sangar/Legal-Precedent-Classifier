Bowser, plaintiff, was injured by a fall alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the J. C. Penney Company, defendant. She and her husband, Leroy E. Bowser, co-plaintiff, brought an action in trespass against defendant and after they had presented their evidence, the trial court on motion of defendant, granted a nonsuit on the' ground that plaintiff had not established negligence.</p>

They walked down the store aisle of the first floor, Mrs. Bowser a few feet ahead of her husband, and when she was about halfway to the rear of the store, she slipped nnd fell. Her husband and Mr. Robinson, an employee of defendant, assisted her to her feet. She asked why the floor was so slippery and Mr. Robinson said that it had been waxed <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>tlie previous evening. Plaintiffs then examined the floor and found that where plaintiff fell there was an accumulation of wax, the wife testifying that it was a spot twelve inches square while the husband said it was somewhat larger—1 foot by 2% feet.</p>

However, the trial judge should not permit an issue of fact to be presented to the jury, where the evidence is such that upon full belief and the draAving of all proper inferences, reasonable men could not reach the conclusion that there was negligence. Plaintiffs rest their claim of negligence on the ground that there existed a spot of wax on the store floor Avhich caused Mrs. BoAvser to fall and since this condition existed the proper inference to draw was that <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>the wax was improperly applied. The real question is not whether there was an improper application but whether such alleged improper application created a condition so obviously dangerous as to amount to evidence from Avhich an inference of negligence would arise: <em>Diver v.

Q. What was the floor like where you fell? A. The first you could tell there were new boards because they weren’t as dark in color as the other boards were, and this Microshene was shining and waxy. It had sort of a greasy wax on it ... Q. And they got you up and you say the first you noticed the condition of the floor as you describe it,'was at that time? A. It was just a waxy, glossy film on the floor and there was more in that place than there had been tOAvard the front of the store. It looked as though they had started to wax and did not go back and get it spread out evenly. Q. Was there any of it on your clothing? A. On my hose and it went clear through to my legs. Q. What was it? A. It left a yellOAvish, brown glossy, waxy mark.”</blockquote>

    <p id="AQL" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[175,1380,1149,802]]]'>From this testimony it appears that there existed a spot on the recently waxed floor where there had been a heavier application of wax or where there had been an uneven absorption of the wax by the wood, the difference so slight that in order to see it one had to stop and look “right down at it”. This is not such evidence as would show that a condition had been created so obviously dangerous that an inference of negligence could arise. We agree with the learned court below that: “There is no evidence that it [the wax] was improperly applied, there being merely a film that was not observable in walking over it . . . Under such circumstances, to render this defendant liable would be to reverse the well established rule that the owner of a store is not an insurer of the safety of his patrons.”</p>
