An appeal was sustained and the assessment reduced to $30,000. Exceptions were dismissed, and from the order of the court below confirming the action of the learned trial judge this appeal was taken.</p>

He argues that it was error for that court to find the market value of the property to be $30,000, when his real estate expert testified it was but $18,600, and the expert for the City of Philadelphia, appellee, stated it was $35,000.</p>

There is no requirement that the trial judge should average the experts’ figures, where, as here, there are widely varying opinions.
