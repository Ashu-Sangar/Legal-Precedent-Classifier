Selden two policies of insurance against the results of bodily injuries caused by violent and accidental means; in one of them the beneficiary was Selden’s mother, in the other his estate. He died on December 31, 1941, from a gunshot wound of the head. The policies provided that affirmative proof of loss must be furnished to the company within ninety days after the date of such loss. <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>Proof was furnished within the prescribed time in the case of the policy in which the estate was the beneficiary. The mother, however, had no knowledge of the existence of the policy in her favor until it was found, on February 22, 1943, among some old papers of the deceased; on March 19, 1943, she filed proof of loss under that policy. In the present action, brought by her as beneficiary, the court held that while the proof was thus filed well beyond the stipulated ninety days the company could not defend on that ground because they had received all required information from the proof presented under the other policy; since the facts in each case were identical there was no need to reiterate them. That ruling was sound in principle and justified by authority : <em>Girard Life Insurance, Annuity and Trust Co., Admr., v.

While apparently there is no exact precedent in Pennsylvania, a recent case, <em>Faulks v.

There the beneficiary knew of the existence of the policy, but she was unable to find it, it being in fact in the possession of the insurance company; it was held that she was not excused for her failure to start action within the stipulated time. This is in accord with the general principle that a person is not relieved from compliance with the express provisions of a contract merely because of ignorance of his rights or even of the very existence of the contract; if the other party has not been guilty of any fraud or deception which has caused such ignorance the loss must be borne by the party in default however innocent or well-intentioned he may be. It would be extremely unjust to insurance companies if suit on a policy could be brought at any time, however indefinite, merely by virtue of an allegation that the beneficiary had only then discovered that such a policy existed; certainly the duty should rest upon the insured to apprise the beneficiary or someone else of the existence and location of the policy, or to keep it in a place where it might readily be found after his death.

For plaintiff discovered the policy on February 22, 1943, and at that time she still had thirteen months in which to bring suit under its terms. She did not proceed for more than five, months after those thirteen months had expired. She offers no excuse for that delay. Even in jurisdictions which hold, contrary to our own view, that a failure to perform the conditions of the policy within the specified time will be overlooked if circumstances are such as to prevent compliance, such liberality of interpretation is not applied where the failure to act, after action becomes reasonably possible, is due to a lack of due diligence on the part of the beneficiary seeking to be excused.</p>

Although the ninety-day period had expired, the beneficiary had a <em>reasonable </em>time after her discovery of the existence of the policy (theretofore unknown to her, admittedly through no fault of her oavu) within which to file such proof. See Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, Vol. 7, § 1538k, pp. 5478 et seq. Consequently, when the <em>reasonable </em>time for the filing of a proof of loss, in the exculpatory circumstances here present, had expired, the beneficiary by the terms of the policy had two years within which to institute a suit upon the policy.</p>

That period never varies. And, it begins to run “. . . from the expiration of the time within which proof of loss is required by the policy”. That time, in cases such as the facts here reveal, is when the existence of the policy first becomes, or should have become, known to the one entitled to assert a claim under it. If that is after the ninety-day period prescribed by the policy, the beneficiary has yet a <em>reasonable </em>time after the discovery of the policy within which to file the required proof.

Or, suppose a case where the existence of the policy, under like circumstances, was unknown to' the beneficiary or the deceased insured’s legal representative until two years and two months after the insured’s death. Even then recovery would not be possible although the two years and ninety days (stressed by the majority opinion as crucial) had not expired. That would necessarily follow, for under further terms of the policy, suit may not in any event be instituted until sixty days <em>after the 'filing of proof. </em>So that, in the instance last supposed, although the policy had been found a month before two years and ninety days had elapsed, suit could not be instituted for another sixty days, thus making in all two years and four months after the insured’s death, and, hence, out of time under the holding of the majority opinion.</p>

That question, the defendant has never yet put in issue. I should, accordingly, reverse and send the case back for a, trial on its merits if the defendant sees fit to put in an affidavit of defense on the merits.</p>

The insured had died from accidental cause on December 31, 1941. But, within a day of the finding of the policy, viz., on <em>February 23, 19Jf3, </em>the beneficiary requested the defendant to furnish her with proof of loss forms which, by letter of March S, 1943, the defendant refused to do. None the less, on March 19,1943, the plaintiff furnished the defendant with written proof covering the occurrence, character and extent of the loss for which she made claim under the policy. The defendant having refused to pay the policy, the instant suit on the policy was entered on September 8, 19-14.</p>
