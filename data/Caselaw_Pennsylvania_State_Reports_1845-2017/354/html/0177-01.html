On June 17, 1942, Ben<a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>nard and George, together with George’s wife, Selma, for a stated consideration of.$10,000, conveyed these-premises to J. H. McHale, a member of the Philadelphia Bar, who, according to the terms of the deed, was to hold title as trustee for Bernard, George,' and a third brother, Louis Overbeck. The three brothers were to have “beneficial ownership” of the property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. At the time this conveyance was made, Bernard Overbeck was engaged ,to marry the plaintiff and two days later, on June 19, 1942, the. marriage was performed. Bernard Overbeck died on May 26, 1944.</p>
    <p id="b284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[205,939,1148,262]]]'>It is plaintiff’s contention that the antenuptial conveyance in 1942 was in fraud of her marital rights, that it was made without consideration, without her knowledge, and its sole purpose was to defeat whatever interest she might acquire in the property by marriage. ■</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[206,1211,1147,305]]]'>The issues here were primarily factual and after hearing, President Judge Finletter found that there was no fraud in the conveyance in question, that there was a good and valuable consideration for the transfer and on these findings concluded that the bill should be dismissed. '</p>
    <p id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[206,1536,1149,422]]]'>Since defendant offered no testimony, the question is whether plaintiff has made out a prima facie case. Her testimony fell far short of sustaining the allegations in her bill. Taken in its entirety, plaintiff’s evidence would at best establish merely that the conveyance was accomplished without her knowledge, and that her husband had made representations to her before and after marriage that he was the owner of one-half of the premises.</p>

Patton, </em><a href="/pa/351/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="351 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="462755" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0006-01">351 Pa. 6</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20921" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="39 A.2d 921">39 A. 2d 921</a>), it is clear that her testimony does not sustain her burden’ of proof.' While it may at one time have been the rule in this jurisdiction that the failure to disclose an antenuptial conveyance of real estate to an intended spouse was prima facie evidence of fraud (see <em>Duncan’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/43/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="43 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="483172" data-case-paths="/pa/43/0067-01">43 Pa. 67</a>; <em>Robin</em>

As is said by Mr. Justice Linn in <em>Kirk v.

In addition, it is necessary for the party alleging it to prove the fraud, or 'actual fraud,’ to -use an expression common in the decisions. Mere conjecture or suspicion does not take the place of evidence. . . .” See commentary on <em>Kirk v. Kirk, supra; </em>Bregy and Wilkinson, Antenuptial Transfers as Frauds on Marital Rights in Pennsylvania, 90 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 62 (1941).</p>

Be this as it may, settlors do mot retain title to the property put into a dry trust. The effect of this is to vest, both legal and equiable title in the cestui que trusts. If this was a dry trust, <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>the three brothers would hold an absolute title as joint, tenants with the right of survivorship.

There it was held that a testamentary trust was dry and therefore <em>executed in the donee. </em>It did not decide that settlor’s estate retained the legal title.</p>
