      <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>Dallett, J., filed the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[162,418,1182,261]]]'>It is a fact, regrettable perhaps, that the recognition in England of an executorship or trusteeship as a post solely of honor does not prevail in this country, where such offices are too frequently looked upon, if not sought, as positions from which profit is to be derived.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b581-6" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[160,689,1181,208]]]'>And this distinction, as urged by counsel for the exceptant, must necessarily deprive the English authorities cited on behalf of the legatee of much of the weight we would otherwise accord them in our determination of the question before us.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b581-7" data-blocks='[["BL_581.7",581,[157,906,1184,587]]]'>We see no error, however, in the finding of the auditing judge. The testator directed that each one of his three executors should receive $6,000 “in lieu of all commissions.” All three qualified; four months subsequently Mr. Caven died, the settlement of the estate was only well under way and the executors of course had not completed their work. We think, nevertheless, that Mr. Caven’s estate is entitled to his $6,000 in full. The testator himself determined the sum that he should receive and took the risk of his executor’s illness or death; the executor by accepting the post took with it the chance that the labor entailed might be greater than he could reasonably anticipate.</p>
