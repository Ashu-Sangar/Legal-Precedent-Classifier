In an action against a corporation to recover for a breach of a contract of employment, the plaintiff testified that his contract was for three years, and that he had made it with the secretary and the president of the company, and that all of the directors had knowledge of it; that he had entered upon his duties without anyone making objection, and after serving a year and receiving the stipulated compensation had been discharged without cause in a letter expressly recognizing a contract of employment. The defendant asked the court to charge that a “ party seeking compensation from a corporation under a contract made with an officer of the corporation, for a breach of the contract, and hot for services actually rendered, the corporation must not only establish the contract, but must also establish the authority of the said officer to make the contract.” The trial judge said: “Under the facts in this case this point is denied.” <em>Held, </em>not to be error.</p>

A verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, and the trial judge reduced it by deducting therefrom the amount admitted to have been earned after the discharge. <em>Held, </em>that the judgment should be reversed, inasmuch as the admission of the plaintiff that he had secured other employment, which he might have retained, should have been submitted to the jury with the same force and effect as though it had been proven by the defendant.</p>

The verdict of the jury established the fact that plaintiff had a contract with the defendant company for a fixed term of three years, and that he was discharged without cause, at the end of one year of the term. Suit was brought and the case was tried more than a year prior to the expiration of the contract. The plaintiff admitted on the trial that after his discharge by the defendant company he secured employment in a like capacity elsewhere, by which he earned the sum of $720 and that he quit that employment of his own accord. The trial judge reduced the verdict by deducting therefrom the amount admitted to have been earned after the discharge.</p>

But in this instance it appears that the plaintiff testified that his contract was made with the secretary and the president of the company, and that all the directors had knowledge of it. .That while the proposition was pending the company wrote that he would hear from them when the water question was settled, and later it wrote to him, “Relative to your verbal proposition to our company, have every reason to believe we will accept same unless it would be in regard to boarding house.” When the proposition was accepted, and plaintiff entered upon his duties, no objection was made on the part of anyone in the company. His services were rendered and accepted throughout the year, and the letter written to him at its expiration telling him he would not be needed after December 1, 1906, expressly recognized a contract of employment. After having had the benefit of his services and making to him the stipulated compensation for the first year, the company could not repudiate the contract which had been made by its officers. In fact the issue submitted for the determination of the jury was not whether there was a contract of employment, but it was as to what that contract actually was, and as to its extent. The point submitted, therefore, had no specific application tqthe precise issue which was being tried, and there was no error in refusing to instruct the jury in the manner requested. ■</p>

It is conceded that this was error, but it is argued that it was cured by deducting the amount actually earned elsewhere from the verdict; and as to the further earnings plaintiff might have made, he is excused on the ground that the burden of proof was upon the defendants. That the general rule is so is indisputable; but it should not apply where it is admitted by the plaintiff not merely that he might have found other employment but that he actually did so; and <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>though it was apparently more profitable than that with appellants, he left it voluntarily for a reason which hardly seems to be sufficient. The excuse given by plaintiff, that he expected this case to come on for trial, would hardly warrant his abandonment of a permanent situation. It would be strange if a reasonable leave of absence could not have been obtained to attend the trial. It was at most a matter to be submitted to the jury, as to the sufficiency of the reason advanced for giving up his employment. We think the admission of the plaintiff that he secured other employment, which he might have retained, should have been submitted to the jury with the same force and effect as though it had been proven by the defendant. And for this reason we sustain the second and fourth assignments of error.</p>
