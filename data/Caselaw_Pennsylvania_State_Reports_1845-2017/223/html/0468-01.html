The purpose was that the legislators thus unsually summoned and the public at large should be advised as to the general character of the legislation that could or might be constitutionally enacted at such special session. Although a governor who has decided to convene a special session of the legislature is empowered to proclaim, to indicate, to designate, the subjects for legislative consideration at such session, he cannot by his proclamation, any more than he can by his message to the same body when in regular session, prescribe or limit the manner in which or the extent to which the legislature may dispose of these subjects, which he designates in his proclamation as matters for legislative consideration. He may by proclamation in the one case, as by message in the other, suggest the lines along which, in his judgment, the lawmaking body could most wisely or effectively operate. Such recommendations are in nowise restrictive of the legislative power. When, therefore, the governor, by his proclamation, couched in such language as he may select, has fairly indicated to the legislators and the people a general subject for legislative consideration, the legislature in special session may lawfully deal with that subject as fully and completely as at a regular <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>session. It is practically conceded that if the proclamation had stopped at what is called by the appellees, the first clause of “Item Third: To designate the uses to which moneys may be applied by candidates, political managers and committees in political campaigns, both for nomination and elections,” the legislature would have fairly and properly before it the whole subject of the uses of money in political campaigns, and the legislation that followed would have been in this respect constitutional. Certain uses of money, expended by certain classes of persons or organizations, could have been declared lawful; other uses by other classes of organizations could have been prohibited, and the primary commands of the law could have been surely made effective by an enactment for the filing, auditing and publishing of accounts by those authorized to expend money, and the punishment of those who violated the legislative prohibition. But it is argued, because, in the language following the suggested first clause referred to, the governor speaks of the filing of accounts, and in that connection mentions only “managing committees and managers of political parties” and not candidates, he thereby cut down the dimensions of the subject previously designated, and limited the legislative power so that it could not lawfully prescribe or require the filing of any account by any person or body not specifically mentioned, described or designated in the proclamation. If this construction be sound, the governor has succeeded in practically strangling before its birth the very offspring he hoped to call into being through the efforts of the legislature he was summoning. The candidates are the persons most interested in the results of political campaigns, and if they may expend money at will, without being required to make public the nature and extent of their expenditures, the requirement that such accounts must be filed only by “ managing committees and managers” who might neither gather nor expend any money, would simply divert the course of the stream into a channel whence it would flow unvexed by any construction or supervision, so that this legislative attempt to prevent the pollution of the ballot box would be destitute of sense or significance.</p>

It is not required by the constitution that the subject be as clearly expressed in the proclamation as in the title to an act, nor is it required that the details by which the desired results may be accomplished be stated in the call, as this is necessarily a brief suggestion of a subject in such words so as reasonably to direct to it the attention of the legislative mind.

Even if the individual, whether he be candidate, manager or committeeman, should have notice equivalent to the members of the general assembly, of the designated subject for intended legislation, each would see in the proclamation, that he is in the designated class of persons in regard to which the prospective legislation is requested.</p>

If this construction of the proclamation leads to a result which deprives the act of a beneficial feature the remedy is with the legislature.</p>
