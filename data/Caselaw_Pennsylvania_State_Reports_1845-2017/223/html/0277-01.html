On March 1, 1907, an ordinance of the city of Pittsburg was passed and approved, a true copy of which is attached to the plaintiff’s bill. It was provided that thereafter the stalls and stands in the Diamond Market shall be leased for a term of three years from the first Monday of May, 1907, and every three years thereafter. Under the authority of this ordinance the director of the department of public works, who was the proper officer, made a lease, dated May 6, 1907, of stand No. 0-37 to the plaintiff. By its terms the city granted to her the right to occupy the stand for the purpose of selling fruits for three years from the first Monday of May, 1907, in consideration of the payment of $591.50, payable quarterly in advance.</p>

He had been in business in the Pittsburg Market for about eight or nine years prior to that time and had occupied the stall in controversy for about three years at the time of the making of the lease to Mrs. McTighe.</p>

On May 7, 1907, the plaintiff, by her attorneys, gave the defendant a written notice as follows: “You are hereby notified to deliver up quiet and peaceable possession of stand 0-37 in the Diamond Market, City of Pittsburg, to Mrs. J. McTighe, on or before May 8, 1907. Burleigh, Gray &amp; Challener, Attorneys for Mrs. J. McTighe.” The defendant refused to deliver up possession and is still in occupancy of stall.'</p>

A. G. Logeman, at No. 522, July Term, 1907, in common pleas No. 2. There the plaintiff, a huckster, had a lease under the ordinance. The rules of the market, which were a part of the lease, required hucksters to allow gardeners to occupy their stands until nine o’clock a. m., and an injunction was granted against such a gardener, restraining him from interfering with the plaintiff in his possession of the stand after that hour, the court holding that the remedy of trespass was not adequate.</p>
