The plaintiff learned of the foreclosure proceedings on the mortgage, and, desiring to secure for herself something <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate, consulted her attorney, J. Merrill Wright, who was at the same time solicitor for the Monongahela Trust Company, defendant, as to the method to accomplish that purpose. Wright advised the plaintiff that the only manner in which the title of her son, Guy Hamnett, to the lands could be divested was by sheriff’s sale, and then Wright sought to obtain the aid of the defendant in assisting the plaintiff. The defendant agreed to purchase the lands in its own name, provided the sum of not more than $5,000 was necessary, then to dispose of the real estate as quickly and as profitably as possible and after being reimbursed the amount invested, together with six per cent interest, expenses, attorney’s fees and a commission of ten per cent on the price at which it might thereafter sell the property, to voluntarily pay to thé plaintiff such 'sum as might be left from the proceeds of such sale or sales, and to convey to the plaintiff whatever of the lands might be remaining. The agreement on the part of the defendant was not in writing, and it was especially stipulated and agreed to by the plaintiff that the control and management of the real estate after its purchase by the defendant, should be solely in the hands of the defendant. Before the sheriff’s sale, Irvin Redpath, mortgagee, was advised of the arrangement which had been made by the plaintiff with the defendant, and consented that the defendant should purchase the property, and after sale of the property to Irvin Redpath and delivery of deed to him, he conveyed to defendant by deed dated August 26, 1906, and defendant paid therefor, the sum of $4,975, being in full of balance due on his mortgage, together with interest, costs, attorney’s fees, etc., and no part of that consideration was paid by the plaintiff.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b278-13" data-blocks='[["BL_278.14",278,[266,2340,1169,98]],["BL_279.1",279,[190,405,1175,1721]]]'>The evidence satisfies us that Guy Hamnett made a parol gift of the lands in dispute to his mother, and that she entered <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>into possession of the same. Both the Monongahela Trust Company and its attorney, Mr. Wright, who was also attorney for the plaintiff, were willing to assist the mother to save something out of the lands, and a verbal agreement was made between the company and Mrs. Hamnett under the advice of their mutual attorney. We find that that agreement was that the trust company should manage the real estate, sell as quickly as possible a portion of it, reimburse itself out of the proceeds of the portion sold, including the money actually expended by it, the expenses of its management, six per cent on the amount invested to secure the title, reasonable attorney’s fees and ten per cent on the amount received upon the sale of the portion sold. The defendant in its answer asserts that this was the agreement, and the president of the company admits it when on the stand and says that it is still the purpose of the defendant to carry it out. There is undoubted authority that a parol gift such as this and entry into possession by the donee, gives such donee an interest as would enable him to sustain a bill against the purchaser at sheriff’s sale, who had promised to purchase for the benefit of the donee, and then refused to perform the promise, as trustee ex maleficio.- In this case the defendant having alleged a trust and having afterwards through its officers admitted when the case was on trial that it had purchased the lands for the benefit of the plaintiff and was still willing to carry out the terms of the agreement, it is not necessary to find either fraud or to resort to the finding that the defendant is a trustee ex maleficio. We are only required to declare the trust as set up and proven by the defendant. If the defendant had offered before the bill filed to perform the agreement which it now admits, it might have saved the costs. As it is, we are of the opinion that the costs should be paid by the defendant.</p>
