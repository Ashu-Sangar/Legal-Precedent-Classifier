He denies that the note in suit was delivered to said bank in payment of the prior note. He, "on information received,” denies that exhibit <em>“A” </em>is a true and correct copy of the note, upon which suit is brought; but he does not state wherein said copy is incorrect, nor that he believes the information, and expects to prove it. He, “on information received,” denies that the plaintiff had the note in suit protested; and he denies that the plaintiff, as junior indorser, gave notice of protest or dishonor to defendant.

The defendant now takes the position, that the court has no power to entertain the second rule. But we cannot agree with him. The purpose of the practice is to avoid delay, by having the court, upon a rule, determine, what it must determine upon trial, whether or not, assuming all that is alleged in the defense as true, the plaintiff is entitled to binding instructions. The reason for the practice applies to a case where an amended statement is filed and an affidavit of defense thereto is filed, equally as strong as it does in the first instance. It will be observed that the defendant voluntarily filed his affidavit of defense to the amended statement. There is no question here as to the right of the plaintiff to compel the defendant to file such an affidavit of defense. He has filed it. But we think the point is decided in the case of Cook v. Forker, <a href="/pa/193/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="193 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="910408" data-case-paths="/pa/193/0461-01">193 Pa. 461</a>.</p>

He has not denied that said note, at maturity, was presented at the place named in the note for payment, and that payment was refused. He has not denied that said note was protested. He does say that the plaintiff gave him no notice of dishonor. But this is immaterial.
