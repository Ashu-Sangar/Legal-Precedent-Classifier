Baton, one of the defendants, was the owner of one-fourth, undivided, of a tract of coal lands, situate in Morris Township, Washington county, and in Morris township, Greene county, Pennsylvania, and containing 4,226.378 acres. The legal title to said coal lands was held under an agreement in the name of J. W. Dawson, trustee for himself, for O. W. Kennedy, for S. M. Graham, and for said George S. Baton in equal parts. The said coal lands had been purchased in the name of J. W. Dawson, and in 1902 the said George S. Baton was the owner of a half interest therein. In 1903 the latter disposed of half his interest to said Kennedy and Graham, and Dawson was made trustee. The purchases were for part cash and the unpaid purchase money was secured by mortgages.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b430-6" data-blocks='[["BL_430.8",430,[276,1349,1174,1067]],["BL_431.1",431,[135,383,1177,260]]]'>2. Prior to April 12,1904, the said George S. Baton had been unable to meet his obligations upon the purchase of said coal lands and he had requested H. C. Booz and the plaintiffs to undertake the payment thereof. A short time afterwards the plaintiffs agreed to the undertaking. Thereupon, upon said date, to wit: April 12, 1904, the said George S. Baton, party of the first part, entered into a written contract with W. A. Guthrie of Indiana, W. B. Schofield, H. O. Booz of Philadelphia and D. P. Pugh of Norristown, state of Pennsylvania, parties of the second part, wherein, after reciting that there was due by said George S. Baton to J. W. Dawson, trustee, the sum of $3,985.64, being the amount which said Baton was in arrears upon his share of said mortgages, it was agreed that said second parties should pay to said J. W. Dawson, trustee, the sum of $4,000 upon the signing of said agreement, and the further sum of $1,000 on May 8, 1904, with which to pay Baton’s share of a note, which payments were to be in full of the balance due by said Baton upon said mortgages theretofore paid by the said J. W. Dawson, trustee. It was further agreed that said second parties should pay said Baton’s share (one-fourth) of said mort<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>gages, according to the schedule annexed as the same should fall due in these proportions, viz.: W. A. Guthrie, five-sixteenths, W. B. Schofield, five-sixteenths, H. C. Booz, four-sixteenths and D. P. Pugh, two-sixteenths. The agreement, however, provided as follows:</p>

Baton in all of said mortgages except the dower mortgage hereinbefore mentioned shall have been paid, and, if, upon the 26th day of August, 1905, the parties of the second part shall have paid the share of said George S. Baton in said mortgages, the parties of the second part shall have the right to pay to said George S. Baton the difference between one-eighth of the entire cost of said coal field and the ámount of said Baton's interest in said mortgages, and upon such payment the said George S. Baton agrees to convey to said parties of the second part in fee the undivided one-eighth interest in said tract of coal lands to be held by the parties of the second part in the following proportions: The said W. A. Guthrie to hold the undivided five-sixteenths of said one-eighth interest; the said W. B. Schofield to hold the undivided five-sixteenths of said one-eighth interest; the said H. C. Booz to hold the undivided four-sixteenths of said one-eighth interest, and the said D. P. Pugh to hold the undivided two-sixteenths of said one-eighth interest. If a sale of said coal property shall be made at any time before the 26th day of August, 1905, the said George S. Baton, shall in that case, pay the amount of his share of the mortgages due at the time of said sale, and the parties of the second part shall share in the proceeds of sale in the proportion which the amount actually paid in by them shall bear , to the entire cost of the field at that date; the parties of the second part to share among themselves in the same ratio in which payments are to be made by them, to wit, the said W.

    <p class="summary" id="b432-5" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[283,601,1174,370]]]'>It was finally agreed that said second parties should pay the one-fourth of the interest on said dower mortgage, and if the same should fall due before August, 1905, they should pay the one-fourth thereof, but if it should not be paid before August, 1905, then they should pay the one-eighth thereof. A list of the properties and the cost and a list of the mortgages were attached to said agreement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b432-6" data-blocks='[["BL_432.6",432,[283,979,1174,688]]]'>3. Pursuant to said agreement, the plaintiffs paid the said sums of $4,000 and $1,000 to J. W. Dawson, trustee, and they also promptly made such other payments on account of the share of said George S. Baton in said mortgages, both principal and interest, as they were called upon from time to time by said J. W. Dawson, trustee, until about November, 1907. The method of making these payments was this: Mr. Dawson would notify the plaintiffs that the interest or principal of a mortgage was about due, and state to them their one-fourth thereof, and then the plaintiffs would work out the amounts that they respectively were to pay, and would then forward checks for these amounts to Mr. Dawson. The plaintiffs acted in these matters individually each for himself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b432-7" data-blocks='[["BL_432.7",432,[285,1678,1171,636]]]'>4. Early in March, 1905, the said J. W. Dawson, trustee, acting for himself and his associates, secured an extension of the times of payment of the unpaid mortgages, and the same have not yet all fallen due. For this reason the plaintiffs could not pay the entire ¡amounts which under said contract they were obliged to pay, so as to discharge in full the share of the said George S. Baton in said mortgages. The plaintiffs have been ready and willing, and they have offered to pay the entire share of said mortgages for which said George S. Baton was liable, but since the disputes hereinafter mentioned the said J. W. Dawson has refused to receive said payments and has returned the same to the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b432-8" data-blocks='[["BL_432.8",432,[269,2325,1183,101]],["BL_433.1",433,[139,397,1177,475]]]'>5. Both W. A. Guthrie and H. C. Booz knew that said J. W. • Dawson, trustee, and his associates contemplated securing an <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>extension of the said mortgages to which reference is made hereafter, before the extension was secured. The evidence does not show that either W. B. Schofield or D. P. Pugh had any knowledge upon this subject. None of the plaintiffs protested against the extension and none of the plaintiffs ever requested that an extension of any of said mortgages be secured. They conceded that the desire of the owners of the larger part of the field ought to control, although they were ready to meet their obligations.</p>

He did not notify him not to do so, neither did he prior to August 26,1905, notify any of the plaintiffs that he objected to the extension of said mortgages or that their agreement would be forfeited in case it was not performed on or before August 26, 1905. On March 9, 1905, said George S. Baton wrote the following letter to H. C. Booz:</p>
