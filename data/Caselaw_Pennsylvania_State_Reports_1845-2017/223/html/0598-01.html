L. 503, that the testator did not intend to accumulate and add to the principal of the trust, any of the accruing income, it follows that neither in his disposition of the principal fund, nor elsewhere in his will&gt; can he have sought to dispose of any of the accumulated- kbcome, beyond its use for Noah’s benefit under the trust. Therefore the testator must be taken to have died intestate with' respect to the accumulation which the auditor distributed'. “There cannot be an intent to accumulate beyond the prescribed limits in order to increase the corpus of the estate,- or of a trust fund carved out of it, which is not an unlawful intent. When by chance or design the-income is increased to -an- amount-in excess of- present demands, the surplus is retained only in order to provide for future deficiences. The intent to provide for these contingencies within reasonable limits may be sustained, but the intent to- add the increase to a permanent fund cannot be:” Howell’s Estate, <a href="/pa/180/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="180 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="888343" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0005-01">180 Pa. 5</a>-15. Without offending against the act of 1853, the surplus- in oúr case could be accumulated by the trustee. “To provide-for future • contingencies,” and the intent that it should-be so-accumulated could <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>be attributed to the testator, but no intent respecting its destination if it should not be consumed during the life of the trust, may be attributed to him. It follows that subject to its retention by the trustees, as a contingent fund, liable to be consumed by them at any time for Noah’s benefit, it was vested as it accrued, by the operation of the intestate laws, in Noah Walters as the testator’s sole heir and next of kin. Noah could not successfully have demanded it, his creditors could not have seized it, it was the duty of the trustees to treat it as a reserve fund for the purposes of the trust. Not having been consumed by the trustees, it is now payable to Noah Walters’ administrator. In Howell’s Estate, supra, the testator’s grandchild was his residuary legatee, and in case of intestacy would have been his sole heir. The court there says: “The right to the surplus income vested as it accrued, in the testator’s grandchild, subject to the right of the widow to have it retained for the judicious protection of her annuity.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[138,1310,1179,635]]]'>We think it is not permitted to conclude, as does the auditor, that: “The corpus of the fund with the accumulations, are the trust residuary estate remaining, which the testator gives on the failure of issue in his own line to his own collateral kinsmen,” for it is only by assuming that the testator did not intend the accumulation to become a part of the corpus of his estate that the accumulation can be saved from the operation of the act of 1853. The intent to provide for these contingencies within reasonable limits, may be sustained, but the intent to add the increase to a permanent fund cannot be. It is therefore unimportant to consider whether there was an actual intent which if found, could not be carried out: Howell’s Estate, supra.</p>
