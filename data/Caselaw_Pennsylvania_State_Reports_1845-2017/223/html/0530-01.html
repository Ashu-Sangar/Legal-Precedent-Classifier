A will is to be so construed, if possible, as to avoid an intestacy, and, in case of doubt, as nearly as may be in conformity with the provisions of the intestate laws. The will certainly affords indications of the testator’s supposition that the daughters, so long as they should live, were the beneficial owners of the residuary estate; he provides for partition if either of them should so desire, in which event he says the real and personal estate shall be divided “into two equal shares, in such manner that the share held in trust for each daughter shall be designated and identified in writing in such manner as to distinguish it from the other portion,” so that each daughter, by herself, may consent to the sale of “any portion of the share so held for her.”</p>
