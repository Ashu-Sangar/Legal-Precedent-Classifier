A corporation organized for the purpose of maintaining a park for the amusement of the public purchased land for the purpose of its organization, and gave a mortgage for the balance of the unpaid purchase money. Subsequent to the date of the mortgage the park company leased a small portion of the land, including a theater building, then in existence, to a lessee for the purpose of constructing thereon and operating a scenic railway. The consideration was a percentage of the gross <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>receipts derived from the railway. The lease provided that the park company at its option might appoint a cashier to receive all moneys from the sale of tickets; that the plant was at all times to be subject to the inspection and approval of the park company, that the buildings and appliances were to revert to the park company upon the termination of the lease; and that the park company should have the right to buy the leasehold with all buildings and appliances erected and maintained thereon at the end of any park season during the term of the lease. The railway was duly constructed with uprights and supports imbedded in the earth to a distance below the frost line, and with platforms attached to the theater, which was used as a ticket office and a station. While the railway could be taken down and removed without serious injury to the materials, it appeared that the removal of such structures was of infrequent occurrence. After the railway had been operated for two seasons the holder of the mortgage foreclosed, and bought in the park company’s land. <em>Held, </em>that as between the purchaser at the foreclosure sale and the lessee, the railway was the property of the former, inasmuch as it was the intention of both parties at the time of the construction of the device, that it was to be placed on the lessor’s realty as a permanent improvement.</p>

The character of the property, whether personal or a part of the real estate, must be determined by the covenants contained in the agreement of January 31, 1906. That agreement, read in the light of all the circumstances, leaves no doubt of the intention of the parties as to the character of the property. As observed above, the Luna Park Company was incorporated for the purpose of operating an amusement park. The sixteen acres of land owned, by the corporation were purchased to carry out the purpose of the corporation. The object the company had in obtaining title to the land in Pittsburg was to make it a place “for the amusement, entertainment and recreation of the public.” The company erected various devices <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>on the premises for the amusement of the public and has continuously operated the property as a place of amusement since the erection and construction of the buildings.</p>

The intention which controls and determines whether or not a chattel is annexed and becomes a part of the realty is the intention the parties had at the time it was placed upon the property: Vail v. Weaver, <a href="/pa/132/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="132 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="970615" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0363-01">132 Pa. 363</a>; Carver v.

In leasing this space to Miller, therefore, it was for a purpose to which the lessor was devoting the balance of the park, and instead of the park company erecting the device, it leased the space of ground to Miller for the like purpose of erecting and operating the railway for a limited time. Under the covenants of the lease, the scenic railway was practically under the control of the lessor like the other amusement devices constructed and operated on the park premises. As said by the court in Thompson Scenic Railway Company v. Young, <a href="/md/90/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="90 Md. 278" data-case-ids="2179359" data-case-paths="/md/90/0278-01">90 Md. 278</a>: “It (scenic railway) was only available for pleasure resorts and had no general utility.” After the lease expired, it could be utilized by the park company in the operation of the park as a place of amusement. By the terms of the lease the railway was attached to and became a part of the Japanese theater building on the park property and owned by the park company. The lessor company had the authority to appoint a cashier to receive all the moneys from the sale of admission tickets to the railway. The railway was at all times subject to inspection and approval of the park company. The consideration to be paid the company was twenty-seven and one-half per cent of <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>the gross receipts from the operation of the railway, and it was to be paid daily. In addition to these provisions, it is specifically provided in the lease that the buildings and appliances erected by the lessee were to revert to the lessor upon the termination of the lease; and further that the lessor was to have the right to buy the leasehold with the buildings and appliances at the end of any park season during the continuance of the lease by paying ten per cent less than the original cost for each season during which the railway device had been operated. These several provisions of the lease leave no doubt whatever as to the intention of both parties at the time the instrument was executed and the scenic railway was erected on the park premises. The manifest purpose of the lessor was to add another attractive amusement to its park. As we have said, it could have constructed the railway; but it preferred to lease the space of ground and permit the lessee to construct and operate the device for a limited time. Instead of erecting a railway itself and receiving all the receipts from its operation, it gave the lessee the right to construct and operate it by paying the lessor a certain percentage of the receipts. At any time, however, the lessor had the right, by its cashier, to receive all the receipts from the operation of the device, and thereby practically control the financial part of the operation of the railway. As conclusively showing, however, that the improvement was to be permanent, it was agreed that the railway should become the property of the lessor at the termination of the lease. This stipulation, taken in connection with the other provisions of the lease, leaves no doubt of the intention of the parties at the time of the execution of the lease and the construction of the device. If/ as claimed by the lessee, the railway was intended to be a trade fixture removable during the term, contrary to the implied covenant that it should remain during the term and the express covenant that it was to revert to the lessor at the close of the term, the parties should have so stipulated in their contract. Presumably the parties intended exactly what they agreed to in the lease. They have there contracted that the device shall revert to the lessor at the end of the lease. Manifestly this stipulation was to enable the <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>lessor to continue its use on the park premises. The lessor could advantageously utilize it at the very place it was constructed; and while it could be removed by the lessee, yet it would be at a loss to him. There was therefore a substantial reason why the device should remain on the premises at the place it was constructed and this must be considered in determining the intention of the parties as disclosed by their agreement.</p>
    <p id="b427-3" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[128,815,1186,1440]]]'>The leasehold could be purchased by the lessor at the end of any park season during the continuance of the lease. This does not show, however, that it was not the intention of the parties that the railway should not permanently remain in the park. It is simply a stipulation in the agreement that the leasehold acquired by the lessee shall become the property of the lessor by the payment of the stipulated sum. The lessor could avail itself of this option, or it could await the termination of the lease and pay nothing. The lessee could not remove the device on failure of the lessor to exercise the option. The lessee company was compelled to allow it to remain on the park premises whether the lessor exercised its option to purchase or not. An execution creditor of the lessee could not have levied upon and sold the railway, nor could the purchaser at such sale have removed it. That manifestly would have been a violation of the contract between the parties. The railway was not subject to the control of the lessee or its creditors to the extent of permitting its removal from the lessor’s premises during a continuance of the term. The lessor had a right not only to have the railway remain on the park premises, but also to have it operated thereon so that it could receive its per cent of gross receipts during the lease. The removal of the property by the lessee or its creditors would have been a deprivation of this right which, on application of the lessor, the courts would prevent. The clear and undoubted purpose, therefore, was that the railway should remain on the park premises during the continuance of the lease and thereafter-revert to the lessor.</p>

The learned counsel for the appellant company has furnished us an exhaustive brief, but none of the cases control this case in its favor. In the cases cited by the counsel in which there was an agreement, the court construed the contract to authorize the removal of the improvement. In Thompson Scenic Railway Company v. Young, <a href="/md/90/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="90 Md. 278" data-case-ids="2179359" data-case-paths="/md/90/0278-01">90 Md. 278</a>, cited by the appellant, it was specifically provided that the right and possession of the property should remain in the contractor (the claimant) and should not vest in the tenant for whom it was constructed until it was paid for. Hence it was held that on failure of the tenant without having paid for the railway, it did not become a part of the realty and belong to the landlord. Hill v. Sewald, <a href="/pa/53/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="53 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1004702" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0271-01">53 Pa. 271</a>, was simply a hiring of chattels and there was no intention of annexing them to the freehold. In Lemar v. Miles, <a href="/watts/4/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="4 Watts 330" data-case-ids="1842753" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0330-01">4 Watts, 330</a>, the fixture was held, under the contract, to be personal property, and that the event had not occurred which was to make it the property of the landlord. This case was followed in Watts v. Lehman, <a href="/pa/107/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="107 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="8856435" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0106-01">107 Pa. 106</a>. Both cases were between landlord and tenant. But even in such cases it has been distinctly ruled by this court in Harris v. Kelley, <a href="/sadler/10/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="10 Sadler 185" data-case-ids="252673" data-case-paths="/sadler/10/0185-01">10 Sadler, 185</a>, that a creditor could not seize and sell the personal property placed by a tenant on leased property under a lease containing a clause providing that “ all improvements erected or placed in said building to be and remain at the expiration of this lease the property of the lessor.”</p>

We have been referred to no case which rules that the property in question would be held to be a trade fixture-with the title in the lessee as against a prior mortgagee under the circumstances of this case. The same rule as to ownership of property in chattels annexed to realty prevails between a mortgagor and mortgagee as between a grantor and grantee: Gunderson v. Swarthout (Wis), <a href="/citations/?q=76%20Am.%20St.%20Rep.%20860" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="76 Am. St. Rep. 860">76 Am. St. Rep. 860</a>; McFadden v.
