Whilst descending from the pole, his hat was knocked off, and in his endeavor to catch it he grasped the guy wire of the Delaware &amp; Atlantic T. &amp; T. Co. and received a shock which has injured him severely. From the evidence it appeared that both companies had their guy wires attached to a stable at the same point, and which brought them in contact, and the claim of plaintiff is that by the negligence of the defendant company in allowing an unused piece of wire to remain on top of the pole, by contact with high tension wire it caused the current in the defendant’s charged wire to be communicated to defendant’s guy wire and thence to that of the Delaware &amp; Atlantic Co.’s guy wire.</p>

His plea that it is not usual to wear gloves in descending from a pole; or that there was no apparent danger; or that he had no reason to sup<a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>pose that the guy wire was charged, are, in our opinion, insufficient.

It is not only the apparent danger to guard against, but also that which may happen. This is exemplified by the facts of this case, and how important it is obey the rule of absolute safety.

The facts important in considering that question are stated in the opinion of the court overruling the motion to take off the nonsuit. An equally tenable ground for entering a nonsuit was the failure to show any negligence on the part of the defendant that was the proximate cause of the accident. The defendant’s guy wire extended from the top of a pole thirty-five feet high over private property to a hook in a stable wall eleven feet above the ground. At the pole this wire was seven feet above the wires of the telephone company, the plaintiff’s employer. About two months before the accident the telephone company extended a guy wire from the place where its wires were placed on the pole to the same hook in the stable wall. On this wire there was an insulation ball thirty inches from the pole. The result of this-was that, since’the guy wires were hr contact at the hook to which they were fastened, if the defendant’s wire-became charged, the current would pass to the line of the telephone company as far as the insulating ball. Whatever danger there was in this situation was brought about by the telephone company in its use of the pole. The defendant’s construction was' safe. The guy wire was above the réach of anyone oh the'ground or-anyone working oh the pole, and its-accidental charging would' have been harmless.</p>
