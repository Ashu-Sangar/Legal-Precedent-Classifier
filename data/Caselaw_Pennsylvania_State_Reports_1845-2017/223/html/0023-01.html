Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/90/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="90 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1065664" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0300-01">90 Pa. 300</a>; Commonwealth v.

Nothing more is to be found in the indictment, and counsel for the commonwealth frankly so admit, for their statement of the question involved is, "Can a railroad company be indicted and convicted under the common law for maintaining a nuisance at a grade crossing, arising from the manner of operating its trains, where no permanent physical obstruction of the highway is occasioned by the construction of its roadbed?” The question for determination, then, is not one of the sufficiency of the indictment under the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 427, which provides that every indictment shall be deemed and adjudged sufficient and good in law, which charges the crime substantially in the language of the act of assembly prohibiting the crime, or, if at common law, so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may be easily understood by the jury, but is whether any offense at all is charged. The court below was of opinion — concurred in by the Superior Court — that if the defendant was dissatisfied with the sufficiency of the indictment, its remedy was an application for a bill of particulars. This is never a remedy for an indictment so defective that it charges no offense: 1 Bishop's New Criminal Procedure, sec. 646. <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>A bill of particulars cannot give life to what was dead when it left the grand jury. By this indictment the commonwealth charges a nuisance arising from the frequent and rapid passing and repassing of the trains of the appellant over a public road or street — acts which are entirely lawful in themselves. If, in the exercise of an undoubted franchise, the railroad company so exercises it as to commit a public nuisance, its offense is the improper exercise of its franchise, which must be set forth and described in the indictment as the substantive offense. Where an act is not in itself necessarily unlawful or a nuisance, but becomes so by its peculiar circumstances and relations, all the matters necessary to show its illegality must be stated in the indictment: Clark's Criminal Procedure, 155. A bill of particulars, prepared by a district attorney, can never take the place of what must affirmatively appear on the. face of an indictment to which the accused must plead.</p>
    <p id="b55-3" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[171,1254,1177,693]]]'>The passing and repassing of appellant's trains over the highway are not complained of, and it is not even averred that they are allowed to cross it negligently. The frequent and rapid passing, without more, is the sole offense charged. Railroad companies may not habitually run their trains over highway crossings at an unreasonable and unsafe rate of speed without giving reasonable and proper signals of their approach for the protection of life and property. If they fail in the discharge of this duty, they are liable to indictment for nuisance: Wood’s Law of Nuisances, 74; Louisville, Cincinnati &amp; Lexington Railroad Co. v. Commonwealth, <a href="/ky/80/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="80 Ky. 143" data-case-ids="4396370" data-case-paths="/ky/80/0143-01">80 Ky. 143</a>. But there is no such allegation here, and without it there is no essence in the offense charged.</p>

The indictment charges that the highway is obstructed by the rapid passing of trains. Slow passing would obstruct it more. But we need not dwell upon this, for the “very purpose of locomotion by steam upon railways is the accomplishment of a <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>high rate of speed in the movement of passengers and freight. It is authorized by law:” Reading &amp; Columbia R. R. Co. v. Ritchie, <a href="/pa/102/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="102 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="502654" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0425-01">102 Pa. 425</a>. In the exercise of this lawful right a railroad company is under a constant duty to protect life and property by the proper regulation of the speed of its trains at danger points or by giving, without regard to their speed, reasonable and proper notice of their approach. Its failure to do so is not, however, presumed even in civil actions, but must be averred and proved, and when the criminal process of the commonwealth is invoked against it, this is still truer, for in all criminal prosecutions the presumption is always in favor of innocence and that no public duty was neglected. For neglect of such a duty in connection with the passing and repassing of its trains over the public highway this appellant might have been indicted, and an indictment containing the charge properly laid would be sufficient to support a conviction. No such neglect is here charged, but, instead, the appellant was indicted for what it lawfully had the right to do. As no crime was charged against it, the judgment on the verdict cannot stand. That judgment is that the appellant “abate the nuisance charged in the indictment.” Upon the failure of a defendant to abate a nuisance after having been sentenced to do so, a writ will be directed to the sheriff, commanding him to abate it: Taggart v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/21/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="21 Pa. 527" data-case-ids="411606" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0527-01">21 Pa. 527</a>; Barclay v.

If this defendant continues to run its cars frequently and rapidly across the highway and the judgment against it is to stand, is the high sheriff of Washington county to prepare a schedule regulating the frequency of the passing of the trains and their rate of speed at the crossing and take his stand there to see that his regulation is enforced? In no other way could he execute the sentence of the court, if commanded to do so, and yet this is the situation that might actually arise if the contention of the commonwealth should prevail, that the defendant has been convicted of a nuisance.</p>
