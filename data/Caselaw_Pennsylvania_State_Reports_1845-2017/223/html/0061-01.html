    <p id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.6",90,[278,445,1186,1654]]]'>Appellant under his grandfather’s will was entitled to an undivided eighth of certain real estate, the other heirs being his aunts and his sister. In September, 1905, when he was twenty-four years old and had been in business for himself for a year, he was in financial difficulties and consulted with Brahm who was the husband of one of his aunts, was one of the grandfather’s executors, had been one of appellant’s guardians, and was a man of means and business experience. At first appellant desired to raise money by mortgage, but being told that in Brahm’s opinion he could not do this as his interest was an undivided one, he announced to Brahm that he had determined to sell his interest. He was asked to give the other heirs the first chance; thereupon it was agreed between them that a family conference should be held; this took place about September 15, at the home of the claimant’s father; at this meeting there were present, appellant’s father, his aunt, Mrs. Brahm, with her husband, his aunt, Mrs. Lotz, with her husband, Mrs. Beegle, with ‘her husband, and his sister, Augusta Kramer. The latter was invited to join in the negotiation, but declined for lack of funds. Appellant told those assembled that he was there to sell his one-eighth interest in this real estate; they all urged against it, telling him they did not believe he was qualified to take up the study of medicine, which he contemplated, and that holding the realty secured him a fixed income; upon his persistence and expressed determination to dispose of his interest the parties discussed the price, he asking $10,000 for his interest, which they thought was too high; thereupon it was mutually agreed between him and them that a valuation be obtained from two real estate trust companies. This was done and the average .valuation by these companies was adopted and the sale made.</p>
