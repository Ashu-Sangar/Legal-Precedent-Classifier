When said contract was executed, defendant’s supply of gas was obtained from wells in and near the vicinity of Pitts-burg, the gas being driven by natural pressure.

The defendant’s main supply is now obtained from wells at a great distance from the city of Pittsburg, driven to far greater depth, and the greater portion of the gas must be pumped from the supply wells through its mains to the points of distribution. The cost of production is now a fraction over nine cents per thousand cubit feet. The price received from the plaintiff company under the contract is a fraction over one cent and five mills per thousand cubit feet. The defendant’s regular charge to like consumers at present is twenty-five cents per thousand for the first 150,000 cubit feet, fifteen cents per thousand for the next 150,000 feet and eleven cents per thousand for all in excess of that. The plaintiff company from the time of the contract to 1893 paid the defendant $114 or $117 per month, and since that time it has paid $50.00 per month. From a meter installed by the defendant, it appears that between May 4, 1907, and December 31, 1906, a period of about eight months, the plaintiff company consumed 24,072,400 cubit feet of gas, or an average of over 3,000,000 cubit feet per month, which at the ordinary charge to like consumers would average over $350 per month. Its daily consumption is over 100,000 feet and exceeds the daily production of all the wells and territory when the contract was made.</p>

Repr. 900), relied on by the plaintiff, was decided on its own peculiar facts, among which it appears that the defendants had released a prior valuable contract; that they had expended $10,000 to erect a new wire under the new contract; and that plaintiff failed to substantiate its averment that it was excluded from any use of the wire on its lines by the continuous use thereof through the defendants; these facts seeming to <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>establish an equity in favor of the defendants, are not comparable with those in the case at bar, and therefore have no controlling weight in its determination.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[307,577,1183,1119]]]'>The contract, exhibit “A,” as a whole, is revocable on notice by its terms. The printed form contains the “terms and conditions” referred to in the written contract; in consideration of the grant of an easement in the beds of Thirty-sixth street and Spruce alley, the defendant company agreed to furnish gas to the works for nothing during the first year, and thereafter at half the cost of coal and coke, “according to the terms and conditions of the contract in ordinary use by the said Philadelphia Company with its customers.” The printed contract contains important and material terms and conditions, without which the written contract was not enforceable. For instance, the plaintiffs were required to make all connections and appliances from the defendant's lines; to exercise due care in preventing waste, agreeing that, if it violated any of the foregoing provisions, or any of the other provisions in said printed form, the supply of gas might be cut off; it contains the important provision that in case the supply of gas failed the contract was at an end, and the final clause that the contract might be terminated upon certain notice; these are there with a purpose, else they would have been stricken out. If the printed contract is not to be considered with the written, why is it part thereof?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.6",372,[305,1706,1178,472]]]'>It is urged that it is inconceivable that the parties by the written terms of the contract should have provided for a never-ending agreement and at the same time provide for the termination thereof. That does not follow — when the contract was made, much of the consideration had passed — the defendant was on the right way of — the plaintiff receiving free gas — under the conditions then existing, its continuation for a reasonable time controlled. By their act they provided for its termination under changed conditions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b372-6" data-blocks='[["BL_372.7",372,[305,2189,1173,260]],["BL_373.1",373,[194,407,1179,255]]]'>It is contended that defendants having accepted this right of way by deed, cannot be permitted to retain the same and escape the liability to deliver gas at the stipulated price, citing a number of railroad condemnation proceedings as analagous cases: these are all actions of law, where the injury, if any, was ascer<a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>tamable in damages. If the use of this right of way has damaged the freehold to an extent exceeding the difference between the price they paid and the price charged to other consumers, then it is within plaintiff’s right to bring suit for the recovery of such additional loss.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[192,679,1181,1286]]]'>Not only is it said in Crescent Steel Company v. Equitable Gas Company, 40 P. L. J. 316, that the parties might terminate their contract, but the principle is further announced that the contract was in violation of the act of assembly chartering natural gas companies, and void as contrary to public policy, because it was an attempt to prefer certain consumers as against others of a similar class. Conceding that the preferred consumers there, were stockholders and directors of the gas company, why in principle should there be any distinction between them and any other class of preferred consumers, peculiarly benefiting by a contract with a public service corporation, necessarily at the expense of other consumers? This contract must be construed with reference to the conditions existing at the time it was made. If, as contended for by the plaintiff, at the time of its execution all the parties knew or ought to have known that new fields and greatly increased expenses would be incurred for the purpose of the supply of gas, then the contract was discriminatory and is void because the defendant, to remain in business, must charge other consumers more than the cost price of its gas; this advantage to the plaintiffs, against the general public, is wholly unwarranted in law. The day of rebates, preferential discriminations and unequal and unfair charges, to like classes of customers, by public service corporations, is, and should be, drawing to a close.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.6",373,[194,1975,1177,474]]]'>Again, if the parties had in contemplation only the conditions as they then existed, it is clear that the contract should fail for want of a supply of gas, the evidence being that not enough gas is obtained from all the wells in existence when the contract was made to now supply the plaintiffs’ works, if no other consumer was served in the city of Pittsburg or its vicinity. The subject-matter, the supply of gas, being thus exhausted, the contract is terminable by virtue of the terms and conditions relating thereto: Ward v. Vance, <a href="/pa/93/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="93 Pa. 499" data-case-ids="442027" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0499-01">93 Pa. 499</a>.</p>

      <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>Finally, the equities of this case are wholly with the defendant company. It is clear that when this contract was made a condition existed vastly different from that now found. The supply of gas seemed overabundant; it came from the immediate vicinity, propelled by its own power. For twenty-two years and more the plaintiffs have had a great profit at the expense of the general consumer, and loss of the company, paying for this fuel now a little over ten per cent of its actual cost. Since 1893, a period of fourteen years, this advantage amounts to more than $65,000; from 1885 to 1893, a period of eight years, it had the same relative advantage. Apparently the consideration of this right of way has been an expensive one. Certainly, in view of the abandonment thereof with the tender of surrender, the plaintiffs have no ground for complaint, especially in view of the fact that the offer is made them to continue their supply on such new contract as may be agreed upon, assuming, of course, that this contract will be fair and on the same terms and conditions of like contracts with a class of consumers.</p>
