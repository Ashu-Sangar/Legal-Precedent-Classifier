The action is against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, which had no part in the construction of the road but has operated it since 1900. The grounds of action set out in the statement are that the noise, vibration and dirt caused by the operation of the road injuriously affect the plaintiffs' property, and that safety gates erected on the avenue on which both properties abut interfere with access to the plaintiffs ’ house.</p>
