    <p class="summary" id="b383-5" data-blocks='[["BL_383.6",383,[165,706,1184,1610]]]'>The only dispute as to the material facts of this case is in reference to the parol agreement and representations made to the Sammels when they signed the agreement upon which suit is brought. James E. Sammel died prior to the filing of the bill and his testimony was not available; J. B. Sammel, however, in his answer, avers the facts to be substantially as heretofore found, and his testimony supports the answer. It is corroborated as to his subscription being conditional, by the fact .that he paid the tube company on December 21, 1902, $10,000, receiving that amount in bonds, being the amount he was liable for under the agreement of November 30,1901, by reason of the assignment to him by Gillespie and Hickman of $10,000 of their subscription to that agreement. It was not necessary to take up these bonds under the agreement until January 2,1903; but he evidently paid for them on December 21,1902, in compliance with Beall’s request made in a letter of October 18, 1902, in which he recognizes Sammel’s right to cancel his underwriting under the agreement of October 8, 1902, by taking up and paying for bonds to the amount of $10,000, which strongly corroborates Sammel’s testimony, and in addition to this, it is not contradicted by Beall. We thus have the testimony of one uncontradicted witness, strongly corroborated, which is sufficient to support the findings of fact as to his subscription being conditional, and move a chancellor to reform or set aside the agreement. The only corroboration of J. B. Sammel’s evidence that Beall represented to his brother and himself that their subscriptions under the agreement of November 30, 1901, would be canceled by the subscriptions under the agreement of October 8,1902, is the inference from the facts of the case that the latter agreement was to supersede the former.</p>

The cases cited on this question arise from subscriptions for stocks of corporations.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[280,558,1181,1110]]]'>Mr. Justice Green in Phila. &amp; Delaware County R. R. Co. v.

Railroad, he is estopped from setting up such an agreement.” A number of cases on the subject are cited in this opinion, and it appears from all that the reason for the rule is, that it would be a fraud upon the other subscribers for stock to permit one to set up a secret agreement by which he would be relieved from liability, whilst they would not. This reason does not apply here, as if Sammel is not bound by his subscription, $300,000 of bonds were not subscribed for, and all the defendants are released from liability, on the agreement. It would certainly be inequitable under the facts of this case to hold Sammel liable, and as he can be relieved from liability without injury to his cosubscribers, there does not seem to be any reason why the rules of law governing ordinary agreements should not apply to this case.</p>

Phila. &amp; Chester County Railroad Company, <a href="/pa/80/0363-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="80 Pa. 363" data-case-ids="1042388" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0363-01">80 Pa. 363</a>, we think, rules this case for the defendants. There Mr. Justice Gordon says: “Where one subscribes to the stock of a public corporation prior to the procurement of its charter, such subscription is to be regarded as absolute and unqualified, and any condition attached thereto is void: Bedford Railroad Company v. Bowser, <a href="/pa/48/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="48 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="422269" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0029-01">48 Pa. 29</a>. The reason for this rule is obvious: the commissioners who are appointed to receive such subscriptions, are not the accredited agents of the corporation, for it is not yet in being, but .are rather the agents of the public, acting under limited and definite powers, which everyone is bound to know, and if he be misled by representations which such agents have no right to make, it is his own folly. Any other rule would lead to the procurement from the common<a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>wealth of valuable charters without any absolute capital for their support, and thus give rise to a system of speculation and fraud which would be intolerable. When, however, the company is once organized, a different order prevails. Such a company may receive conditional subscriptions for its stock, and, when it does so do, it is bound to the performance of the conditions therein contained: Railroad Co. v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/41/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="41 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="479999" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0054-01">41 Pa. 54</a>: Railroad Co. v.

Nothing is better settled in this state than that not only can the ambiguities of a written instrument be explained by parol, but it may, in the same manner, be varied, added to, or even contradicted where it is shown that but for the oral stipulations, made at the time, the party affected would not have executed it. The authorities for, as well as the reasons given in support of this doctrine so abound in our books, that to cite the former, or to restate the latter, would be but a waste of time. But it is said this corporation was not bound by the declarations of its agent, they having exceeded their authority, and hence it was under no legal obligation to fulfill their undertakings. Grant this to be so, but how, then, can it hold the defendant to his part of the covenant? This plea would answer an excellent purpose were Caley seeking to enforce the contract against the company, but it so happens that the stick is in the other hand. ‘If one party be not bound neither is the other:' Strong, J., in the case of Railroad Co. v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/41/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="41 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="479999" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0054-01">41 Pa. 54</a>.
