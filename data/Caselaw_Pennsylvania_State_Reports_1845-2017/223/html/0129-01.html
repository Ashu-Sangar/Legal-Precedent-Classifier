In an action against a roofing company to recover damages for death of a roofer, it appeared that the deceased was sent with other men under a foreman to put a tar roof on a car bam. The defendant had provided rubber shoes for the men, and guard rails to be fastened to the edge of the roof. The deceased started to put up the guard rails, but was stopped by the foreman who told him to go on with the work of laying the roof, that the roof was safe without guard rails, but that he would put them on after the first sheet of paper had been laid. The deceased worked an hour and a half on the roof when he slipped and fell off the edge. It appeared that the foreman worked with the other men, and that they followed his directions. He was also empowered to hire and discharge men, but it was not shown that he had ever done either. <em>Held, </em>that a nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

He was sent with four other men to put a tar roof on a car barn. These men were all under the charge of Ewing, a foreman. The defendant had provided rubber shoes for the men to wear and guard rails to be fastened to the edge of the roof, when necessary to secure their safety. Soon after the men went on the roof, Staebler proceeded to put up the guard rails but was stopped by Ewing, who told him to go on with the work of laying the roof, that the roof was safe without guard rails, but that he would put them on after the first sheet of paper had been laid. Staebler worked an hour and a half on the roof, when he slipped and fell off the edge. The negligence alleged was the failure to place guard rails on the roof.</p>
