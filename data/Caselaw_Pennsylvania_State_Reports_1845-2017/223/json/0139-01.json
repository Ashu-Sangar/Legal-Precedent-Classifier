        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThis was a scire facias on a mortgage. The defense was that only a part of the consideration named in the mortgage had been received by the mortgagor, and that this had been repaid by him. At the trial the defendant\u2019s son testified that he was present when the repayment of the money was made and that the mortgagee had promised to satisfy the mortgage the next day. In rebuttal testimony was received under objection that this witness after the date of the payment alleged had stated that he then knew that his father owed the whole amount of the mortgage. The witness was afterwards recalled and testified that he had made no such statement.\nThe objections urged to the admission of this testimony were that the statement, if made, was in connection with a compromise offered, and also that ground had not been laid for contradiction of the witness by first calling his attention to the subject. The offer of testimony was made at side bar and the court very carefully excluded any reference to a proposed compromise and admitted only the bare statement of the witness as to the fact of his knowledge that the whole amount was due. While an offer of compromise is not admissible as evidence of liability the distinct admission of a fact by one of the parties is not to be excluded because it was made in connection with a proposition looking to a compromise: Arthur v. James, 28 Pa. 236. There is less reason for excluding the proof of a statement by a witness in conflict with his testimony at the trial because in the same conversation a compromise was suggested.\nThe right to discredit a witness b,y proof of contradictory statements, without having first called his attention to them, is under our later decisions a matter that rests in the sound discretion of the court: Cronkrite v. Trexler, 187 Pa. 100. A failure to lay a foundation for the impeachment of the witness became immaterial, since he was recalled and given an opportunity to explain or reconcile the statement with his testimony.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

While an offer of compromise is not admissible as evidence of liability, the distinct admission of a fact by one of the parties is not to be excluded because it was made in connection with a proposition looking to a compromise. There is less reason for excluding the proof of a statement by a witness in conflict with his testimony at the trial because in the same conversation a compromise is suggested.\n2. The right to discredit a witness by proof of contradictory statements without having first called his attention to them, is a matter that rests in the sound discretion of the court.\n3. A failure to lay a foundation for'the impeachment of a witness, becomes immaterial if the witness is recalled and given an opportunity to explain or reconcile an alleged statement made by him with his testimony.\nArgued Oct. 22, 1908.\nAppeal, No. 94, Oct. T., 1908, by defendants, from judgment of O. P. No. 1. Allegheny Co., June T., 1903, No. 361, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Louis L. Rabinowitz v. Tanhel Silverman et al.\nBefore Mitchell, O. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nScire facias sur mortgage. Before Ford, J.\nAt the trial when the plaintiff was on the stand in rebuttal plaintiff\u2019s counsel proposed to prove by the witness an admission made by Yictor Silverman, the son of defendant in this case, as to the indebtedness existing from Mr. Silverman to Mr. Rabinowitz, to wit: That on or about September 24, 1907, when the testimony of Mrs. Amy S. Barrimore was being taken on deposition at the office of W. O. McNary, Esq., in the Frick building, there were present the notary public, the stenographer, Mr. Langdon, S. S. Robertson and W. O. McNary,- attorneys for Tanhel Silverman, Tanhel Silverman, himself, Yictor Silverman, his 'son, Mrs. Barrimore and EL S. McKinley, representing George O. Burgwin and Mr. Rabinowitz.\nThat after the testimony was all taken, and Mr. Rabinowitz was about to leave the office and was standing with Mr. McKinley, Yictor Silverman walked up to Mr. McKinley and asked him if he, Yictor Silverman, could have a talk privately with Mr. Rabinowitz. That Mr. McKinley told him he did not see any reason why not. Yictor Silverman then asked Mr. Rabinowitz to go into one of the private offices, of which there were two. That after Yictor Silverman and Mr. Rabinowitz got into this office and were alone, Yictor Silverman closed the door and said to Mr. Rabinowitz, \u201c Did you hear Mrs. Barrimore\u2019s testimony?\u201d Rabinowitz said, \u201cYes.\u201d Yictor said, \u201c The same thing I will swear to, and the same thing my uncle will say. Now would you like to get $6,000 with your counsel\u2019s fees, or would you like to continue the case ? That is all the money my father has to pay, and he cannot pay any more.\u201d Rabinowitz told him, \u201cNo, I cannot do it.\u201d I told him I gave $10,000 to your uncle. Yictor says, \u201cWe know that everybody lost money on him, and I don\u2019t know why you should not lose some of the money.\u201d\nThen Rabinowitz told him, \u201c I cannot give you an answer now, but I will let you know before I go to New York.\u201d Yictor said to him, \u201cWell, let me know.\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201c Where.\u201d I said, \u201cWhere would like to have it ? \u201d He said, \u201c In Rabinowitz\u2019s brother\u2019s office.\u201d Rabinowitz told him all right, that he would send for Yictor on Saturday before he went to New York. That before Rabinowitz left the office Yictor Silverman said to him, \u201c If you will mention anything in court that we spoke of together, then I will swear I never said anything.\u201d\nFurther, that Mr. Rabinowitz left this office and went to Mr. Burgwin\u2019s officej and saw Mr. McKinley, and told Mr. McKinley in the presence of Miss Wylie, Mr. Burgwin\u2019s stenographer, what was said. That Mr. McKinley told Mr. Rabinowitz that he had better wait until Mr. Burgwin came home from the east, and talk about the matter with him.\nThat when Mr. Burgwin came home on Friday, Mr. Rabinowitz told the circumstances, and Mr. Burgwin told him it was for Mr. Rabinowitz to decide.\nThat on Saturday morning about ten o\u2019clock Rabinowitz came over to his brother\u2019s office, and told those there that he would like to send for Yictor Silverman. That his brother\u2019s boy went to Silverman\u2019s house, and said to Yictor Silverman, \u201c My uncle would like to see you.\u201d That Yictor said, \u201c Go home, and I will be there inside of ten minutes.\u201d That after ten minutes passed, the bell rang, they opened the door, and a little girl came to the door. The little girl asked for Mr. Rabinowitz. Mr. Rabinowitz came out into the hall, and said, \u201c What do you want to see me for ? \u201d The little girl said, \u201c My mother wants to see you.\u201d She said Mrs. Silverman. Mr. Rabinowitz said, \u201c I don\u2019t know Mrs. Silverman, and I don\u2019t have anything to talk to Mrs. Silverman about.\u201d That Rabinowitz sat in the house until one or two o\u2019clock and left for Mr. Burgwin\u2019s office. When he got to the office, Mr. Burgwin\u2019s office boy said, \u201c Just now the telephone bell rang; someone wanted to see you and said in case you came you should wait in the office.\u201d That Rabinowitz waited in the office about half an hour and the telephone rang again, and when he came to the telephone Yictor Silverman was on the telephone. That Yictor Silverman said, \u201c Are you Mr. Rabinowitz?\u201d Mr. Rabinowitz said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWill you please come to your brother\u2019s office, I want to see you ? \u201d Rabinowitz told him all right, he would be there in half an hour. That when he came into his brother\u2019s office Yictor Silverman was waiting for him in the front office. That Yictor said to him, \u201c Have you made up your mind to anything ? \u201d Rabinowitz told him, he had not made up his mind at all. Then Yictor repeated the same thing, and said, \u201c Well, you had better take the $6,000 with your counsel\u2019s fees, for otherwise we will go ahead and fight the case.\u201d\nThis offer was made at side bar.\nObjected to by the defense as incompetent and irrelevant, partly hearsay and partly immaterial.\nThe Court: Portion of the offer relating to the acknowledgment of the indebtedness of Mr. Silverman, at the termination of the taking of Mrs. Barrimore\u2019s testimony, might be competent ; outside of that, the balance is clearly incompetent. The objection to the offer as at present made is sustained. Exception noted to plaintiff.\nMr. McKinley: Then we offer so much of the foregoing offer, to wit: The conversation which occurred between Mr. Rabinowitz and Mr. Silverman at the time mentioned in the foregoing offer, in which there was an acknowledgment of indebtedness, or tending to show an acknowledgment of indebtedness through Mr. Silverman to Mr. Rabinowitz.\nObjected to by the defense as incompetent and irrelevant. For a further reason that, on any theory of agency, it could not be anything but an offer of compromise; for a further reason, that no ground has been laid for contradiction of the witness.\nThe Court: The objection is overruled and the testimony admitted in so far as it relates to anything said by Victor Silverman in recognition to the existing indebtedness secured by the mortgage. But all testimony in relation to any offer by the way of compromise made is excluded.\nException noted by the defense.\nMr. McKinley : \u201c Q. Mr. Rabino witz, were you in McNary\u2019s office on or about September 24, 1907, when the deposition of Mrs. Amy Barrimore was taken in this case? A. Yes, sir. Q. Will you state who was present there ? A. Mr. McNary, Mr. Robertson, Mrs. Barrimore, Mr. Tanhel Silverman, Mr. Victor Silverman and myself, Mr. McKinley and Miss Wylie, the stenographer. Q. Did you have any conversation with Victor Silverman after the testimony was taken? A. Yes, sir. Q. Please tell us how that occurred ? \u201d\nThe Court \u2022: \u201c Was that in the presence of these parties whose names you have given, Mr. Robertson and the rest of them ? \u201d\nMr. McKinley : This part I am asking about was in the presence of all these parties.\nMr. McKinley : \u201c Q. What occurred there ? A. After the testimony was taken and everybody was going to go home, Victor Silverman said to Mr. McKinley, \u2018 I would like to see Mr. Rabino witz.\u2019 He said, You can see him if you want.\u2019 He called me into his, McNary\u2019s, private office and closed the door. Q. He called you into the private office and closed the door? A. Yes, sir. Q. Then what did he say ? A. He says to me, Did you hear Mrs. Barrimore\u2019s testimony ? \u2019 I told him I did.\u201d\nObjected to by the defense.\n\u201c Q. Have you testified that Mr. Victor Silverman and you went into this private office together ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Now, you had some conversation there for a few minutes, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir. Q. And after this conversation what did you say to Victor Silverman and what did he say to you about this mortgage? A. I told him, \u00a3 You know your uncle owes me $10,000.\u2019 He said to me. \u00a3 We know all that.\u2019 That is what he says to me. \u00a3 But,\u2019 he says,\u00a3 Everybody lost money on him, and I don\u2019t see why you shouldn\u2019t lose any.\u2019 Then I told him, \u00a3 I cannot do it.\u2019 He says, \u00a3 My father has $6,000.\u2019 \u2014 Q. Don\u2019t tell us that. That would not be admissible under the rulings.\u201d\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $13,782.99. Defendants appealed.\nError assigned was rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions.\nS. S. Robertson, with him W. O. McNary, for appellants.\nEarry S. McKinley, with him H. & G. G. Burgwm, for appellee.\nJanuary 4, 1909:"
