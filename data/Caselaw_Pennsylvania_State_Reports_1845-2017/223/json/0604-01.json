T., 1908, by plaintiffs, from judgment of C. P. Chester Co., Oct. T., 1907, No. 34, for defendants on demurrer in case of John I. Green, by his next friend and mother, Mary E. Green, and Mary E. Green in her own right, v. Worth'Brothers Company and Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company.\nBefore Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nDemurrer to statement in trespass.\nButler, J., filed the following opinion:\nThe plaintiff\u2019s statement having been demurred to on the ground that the acts complained of were not joint acts of the defendants, and the plaintiff having joined issue on the demurrer, judgment was directed and entered' for the defendants on March 16, last. On the third of this month the plaintiff entered this rule to show cause why the record should not be amended by striking out the name of Worth Brothers Company as codefendant and plaintiff be permitted to file an amended statement and proceed with the suit against the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company. The amendment sought would no doubt have been allowed had it been asked for in advance of the entry of judgment against the plaintiff on the demurrer, Manifestly the entry of judgment against the plaintiff on the demurrer is a final adjudication that he cannot recover and is an end of the pending suit. This would seem to be entirely clear on principle and is abundantly shown by the following authorities presented by counsel for defendants: 1 Troubat & Haly\u2019s Practice, p. 492, citing 2 Arch. Pr. 231, and Conrad v. Ins. Co., 26 U. S. 386,443; Wood & Anderson, 25 Pa. 407; Burk v. Huber, 2 Watts, 306; Stephens v. Myers, 12 Pa. 302. This suit being determined, decided and at an end, there is nothing to amend.\nThe rule to amend is dismissed.\nError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nGoodman & Mitchell and Granville L. Rettew, for appellants.\nG. G. Cornwell, of Cornwell & Cornwell, with him A. P. Reid, for appellees.\nMarch 1, 1909:"
