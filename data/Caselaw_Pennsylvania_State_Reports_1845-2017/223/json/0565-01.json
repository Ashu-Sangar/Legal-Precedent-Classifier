        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThis action was on a promissory note for $3,000 drawn by the defendant to his own order, payable thirty days after date at the Real Estate Trust Company, Philadelphia. The note was given under an agreement between the parties in relation to the purchase of shares of a mining company, and at the time of its delivery to the plaintiff he gave the defendant a receipt in the following form: \u201cI acknowledge having received from D. Clare Good note for 30 days for $3,000 in payment of 1,000 shares, Certificate No. 280 of the capital stock of the Liberty Copper Mining & Smelting Company, and I agree that if the note is paid with interest at the end of 30 days, I will deliver said certificate to D. Clare Good, the certificate then to be the property of D. Clare Good.\u201d\nAt the trial it was testified on behalf of the plaintiff that the sale of the stock was complete and absolute, but that because of the defendant\u2019s inability to pay for it at the time he requested the plaintiff to accept his note at thirty days; that the plaintiff agreed to do this, after he had made inquiries as to the defendant\u2019s financial standing, on condition that the stock, the certificate for which was in the name of a third party who had signed a blank power of attorney indorsed on its back, should be pledged with him as a collateral security; that the writing signed by the plaintiff was in pursuance of this agreement and was intended to express it; that after the maturity of the note the defendant repeatedly promised to pay it. The instruction by the court was that, if this testimony was believed, a verdict should be rendered for the plaintiff.\nThe defendant presented no testimony, but asked for an instruction that there could be no recovery because the stock was not delivered or tendered at the maturity of the note, and that the agreement between the parties was merely an option to purchase and was ended by the failure of the defendant to pay the note at maturity and demand the stock.\nIf the agreement was as testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, the sale was complete and absolute and the stock was pledged by the defendant as a security for the payment of his note, and there was no duty of delivery or tender by the plaintiff until the note had been paid. The testimony in relation to the agreement was admitted without objection by the defendant, and no question of the modification of a written agreement by parol evidence is in the case. In any event the receipt signed by one of the parties was open to explanation: Jessop v. Ivory, 172 Pa. 44.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Graham v. Good, Appellant.\nPromissory note \u2014 Receipt\u2014Evidence.\nIn an action upon a promissory note given under an agreement between the parties to the note in relation to the purchase of shares of a corporation, it appeared that at the time of the delivery of the note plaintiff gave the defendant a receipt acknowledging that he had received the note which was for thirty days in payment of the number of shares named, and agreeing that if the note was paid at the end of thirty days, he would deliver a certificate for the shares to defendant, and that the shares would then be the property of the defendant. Testimony for the plaintiff tended to show that the sale of the stock was complete and absolute, but that because of the defendant\u2019s inability to pay for it at the time he requested the plaintiff to accept his note at thirty days; that the plaintiff agreed to do this after he had made inquiries as to' the defendant\u2019s financial standing on condition that the stock, the certificate for which was in the name of a third party who had signed a blank power of attorney indorsed on its back, should be pledged with him as a collateral security; that the writing signed by the plaintiff was in pursuance of this agreement and was intended to express it, and that after the maturity of the note the defendant repeatedly promised to pay it. Held, that plaintiff\u2019s evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict and judgment in his favor.\nArgued Jan. 8, 1909.\nAppeal, No. 212, Jan. T., 1908, by defendant, from judgment of C. P.
