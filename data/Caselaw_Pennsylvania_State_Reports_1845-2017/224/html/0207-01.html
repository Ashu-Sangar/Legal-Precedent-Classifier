At the instance of an acquaintance he went to the office of two attorneys and instructed them to bring an action against the company. He was examined by a physician employed by the attorneys, who reported to them and to him that there was no evidence of injury. He was subsequently examined by a physician employed by the railway company at the office of the physician who had first examined him. After the second examination the plaintiff, fearing that he would lose his position in a department store in which he was employed because of having brought the action, directed his attorneys to abandon it, and they did so. The head of the department in which he was employed discharged him because of information received when the officers of the railway company were making an investigation as to the extent of his injury. He subsequently brought an action against the attorneys and the acquaintance who introduced him to them to recover damages caused by the loss of employment. <em>Held, </em>that he had no cause of action.</p>
