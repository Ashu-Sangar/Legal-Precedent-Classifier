It was found by the judge who heard the testimony that the plaintiff had failed to substantiate the material allegations of his bill; that his testimony was far from being clear and precise and was substantially nullified by his admissions on cross-examination; that it was uncorroborated by other evidence direct or circumstantial. It was not alleged that the defendant made any statement in relation to the organization of the company at the <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>time the contract was entered into, and no question as to the manner of its organization was involved in the issue raised; the offers of testimony in relation to it were properly rejected. In Luther v. Luther, <a href="/pa/216/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="216 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="950354" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0001-01">216 Pa. 1</a>, it was said by our Brother Brown: “The relief afforded by a decree in equity must conform to the case made out by the pleadings as well as to the proofs.

Neither unproved allegations nor proof of matters not alleged can be made a basis for equitable relief."</p>
