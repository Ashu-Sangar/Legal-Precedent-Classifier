The prayer of the bill <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>is for an injunction to restrain the defendant from building over the rear end of an alley on the east side of his lot, laid out prior to 1810 for the common use of the owners of both lots. The ownership of the soil of the alley is in the defendant and bis right to maintain a building over it supported by an archway to the depth of twenty-five feet and eleven inches from South street is conceded; but the right to build over it to a greater depth is disputed. The case was heard on bill and answer. The averments of the answer that the extension of the archway as proposed by the defendant will not interfere with the use of the alley as a passageway and water course nor exclude light necessary for its proper use, being taken as true, narrow the dispute to the single question whether the deed creating the easement restricted the right of the grantee and his assigns to build over the alley to a greater depth than that to which it was built over at the time of the conveyance.</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[293,1247,1155,898]]]'>The grant to the plaintiffs ’ predecessor in title in 1810 gave him an easement in the following language: “Together with the free use and privilege of the said alley for free ingress .... in common with the owners, tenants and occupiers of the adjoining lot to the westward and of. a water course therein, reserving to the owner of said adjoining lot to the westward the right of building over the said alley at the same height and of the same depth as the same is now built over. . . .” In a deed of the same date in the defendant’s chain of title it is recited that a former owner had left open the easternmost two feet and eleven inches of his lot as an alleyway for the common use of his lot and the adjoining lot to the eastward, and there was excepted and reserved out of the grant to and for the use of the owners of the adjoining lot to the eastward the free use of the alley, the grantee to have the right and privilege of building over the alley of the depth of the building then erected.</p>

It is, however, contended that the stipulation in the deed of 1810 that the grantee of premises No. 611 South street and his assigns should have the right to build over the alley to the same extent that it was then built over, created by implication a restriction against building beyond the limit prescribed. The plaintiffs’ case rests upon this proposition.</p>
