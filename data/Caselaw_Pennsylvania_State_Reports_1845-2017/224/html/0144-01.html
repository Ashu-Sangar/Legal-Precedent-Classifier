In making the apportionment, the auditor simply compared the amount standing upon the books of the respective corporations to the credit of profit and loss, at the date of the creation of the trust, with that standing to the credit of the same account, at the date of the issue of the dividend obligations, and the certificates of indebtedness. The difference he regarded as the earnings of the companies, after the creation of the trust. He apparently made no attempt to ascertain the real value of the stocks at the time when the life tenancy was created. Nor did he ascertain whether after the issue of the dividend obligations by the one company, and the certificates of indebtedness by the other, the value of the stock in the respective companies was less than it was when the trust estate was created. The doctrine which the auditor attempted to apply, is that which undertakes to give the bonus to the remainder-man or to the life tenant, in accordance with the fact as to whether the bonus was earned before or after the creation of the trust; or if part was earned before and part after, then to divide the bonus between the remainder-man and the life tenant in the proportion which the amount accumulated before the creation of the trust may bear to that accumulated thereafter. This is the doctrine of Smith’s Estate, <a href="/pa/140/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="140 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="972549" data-case-paths="/pa/140/0344-01">140 Pa. 344</a>, following and restating that of Earp’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/28/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="28 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="981664" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0368-01">28 Pa. 368</a>. But under that rule, as stated in substance in 9 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 715, as the Pensylvania rule, “the result is arrived at, by ascertaining what the value of the stock was when the life tenancy was created. After the issue of bonus its value is again determined. If it is less than it was at first, just to that extent is it held that the capital has been impaired, and the trustee must apply to the corpus of the estate <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>enough of the bonus to make the capital equal to what it was when the trust was created. If on the other hand the stock is found to be as valuable as when the trust was created, or of ■ greater value, the capital has not been decreased, and the bonus goes in whole to the life tenant.” In other words, it seems to be the doctrine of our cases, that the remainder-men, are entitled to just what the stock was actually worth at the time of the creation of the trust, no less and no more. It may be suggested that this method makes no allowance to the remainder-men for such increase in value as may be due to an enlarged earning power of the corporation, or to an increased value of the franchise. But probably no rule could be framed which would work exact justice in all cases. At any rate, the method by which the auditor in the present case undertook to apply the rule was entirely inadequate to produce the right result, for the reason that he confined his calculation merely to the gross amounts standing at the different periods, fio the credit of the profit and loss accounts. This would not afford any real index to the value of the stock; and yet that was the thing to be ascertained; the value at the time the trust, was created, as compared with the value after the distribution of the bonus. Profit and loss is a resultant account, usually made up from the balances transferred from other accounts, and it must, from its nature, depend entirely upon the elements entering into those other accounts. For instance, in the present case, it appears from the resolutions authorizing the issue of the so-called dividend obligations, and the certificates of indebtedness, that for some years prior thereto, the earnings of the companies which might have been paid out in dividends to the stockholders, from year to year, had been expended in permanent additions to, and improvements of, the properties. Manifestly all such expenditures would be for the benefit of the remainder-men, and would be a taking of that which would otherwise have gone to the life tenant, in dividends. The amounts- expended in this way would have to be charged against the earnings, and would leave that much less to go to the credit of the profit and loss account. So that it is plain that the latter account, as it stood upon the books, would not <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>represent the total earnings of the corporation. No man can ascertain his business worth from his profit and loss account alone; in order to learn that, there must be shown a statement of his assets and liabilities, and an inventory of his property. This court said in Smith’s Estate, <a href="/pa/140/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="140 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="972549" data-case-paths="/pa/140/0344-01">140 Pa. 344</a>: “It is the intrinsic value of the shares, to be ascertained from the amount and value of the assets (of the corporation) at the death of the testator, and at the time of the increase of the stock, which governs in the apportionment of the surplus profits. The market value may aid in the ascertainment of the actual value, and is therefore properly received in evidence on that issue.” Citing Earp’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/28/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="28 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="981664" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0368-01">28 Pa. 368</a>, and Moss’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/83/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="83 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="1050781" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0264-01">83 Pa. 264</a>. In the case now before us, the auditor apparently took no account of either actual value or market value of the stocks in question at any time, and therefore he missed the real point of the inquiry. Presumptively every dividend goes to the beneficial holder of the shares at the time it is declared. This will carry every dividend presumptively to the life tenant instead of to the remainder-man: Thompson on Corporations, sec. 2193.</p>

The same is true with respect to the certificates of indebtedness issued by the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad Company. A very persuasive circumstance in the transactions is the fact that the dividend obligations and certificates of indebtedness were avowedly issued to make good to the shareholders the earnings which from year to year, instead of being distributed as dividends, had been applied to the permanent improvement and betterment of the properties. These dividends from earnings made after the creation of the trust, would clearly have gone to the life tenant. For some twelve years in one case, and seventeen in the other, she was thus deprived of her divi<a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>dends, and the earnings out of which they might have been paid went by way of improvements and additions to the property, to the benefit of the remainder-men. Was she not then fairly entitled to the obligations issued by the companies, avowedly in lieu of the dividends of which she had thus been deprived? It seems so, to us. And then after all, the rule for the determination of controversies over dividends, between life tenants and remainder-men, should be to give to each just what the donor intended each to have. As has been said, the intent of the grantor or testator is the pole star for the guidance of the courts.</p>

These terms are not necessarily coextensive or identical. It is to be presumed that the settlor meant to indicate by the use of these three words, “dividends,” “income” and “profits, ” pretty much everything in the way of advantage or benefit which might accrue from the stock, without decreasing the original value of the capital which it represented. We think the terms were broad enough to include the “dividend obligations” issued by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad Company, and the “certificates of indebtedness” issued by the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad Company; the latter were not stock obligations, but were acknowledgments of indebtedness to the stockholders for the funds which it was considered fairly belonged to them as current earnings, but which had been appropriated to pay for improvements and additions. Mr. Robinson, the settlor, appears to have been thoroughly familiar with the conditions and management of the corporations in question, and he doubtless intended to cover whatever form the distribution of gains arising from the stock might take, when he provided that the life tenant should receive the “dividends, income and profits” of the stocks which he placed in trust. We see no evidence in this case that the issue of the dividend obligations, or the certificates of indebtedness, lessened the value of the stock below what it was at the time of the creation of the trust. That being so, there was no reason why the whole of the bonus, whether it be con<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>sidered as “dividends,” “income” or “profits” should not go to the life tenant. We are of the opinion that the auditor and the court below erred in making any apportionment.</p>
