The plaintiff’s statement contains, inter alia, the following averment: “That at the time of the grievances hereinafter set forth the defendant was a corporation, engaged in mining coal and for such purposes in possession and use of certain premises in the said county of Carbon, upon which premises were laid railroad tracks used by said defendant in its business of coal mining and upon which tracks the said defendant company ran a locomotive and cars owned by it for the purpose of conveying material to its mines and coal from its premises.” On December 19, 1903, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey had delivered two car-loads of prop timber consigned to the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company upon the tracks of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, at Hauto, the usual place of delivery. The crew upon which John McGinley was working drew these two cars loaded with prop timber out of the siding of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey and “kicked” them into a blind siding of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company in its yard at Hauto whence they were to be taken to the mines and used by the defendant in its mining operations.</p>

The brake chain on said car had been broken and had been tied with wire and when Mc-Ginley applied the brake the wire gave way and the brake refused to hold.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[291,717,1152,477]]]'>The negligence of the defendant, as alleged by the plaintiff, consists in a failure to provide an inspection of the cars before moving them. The question thus resolves itself into whether or not the defendant was bound under the facts as they appear in this case to provide inspection. If the defendant was bound to have this car inspected before moving it and failed to do so then it was negligent; if on the other hand it was not bound to do so then the failure to provide inspection would not be negligence.and the nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

The defendant was not moving this car as a common carrier, handling a foreign car, but simply in pursuit of its private business moving said car preparatory to unloading its freight. There is no evidence that the defendant had actual notice of the defective brake chain and since the accident happened only about twenty minutes or one-half hour after the car came into its possession the time was too short to affect it with constructive notice.</p>
