An assignment by a wife of an expectancy of an interest in the income from her father-in-law’s estate contingent upon her surviving her husband, in consideration of the conveyance to her of several valuable pieces of real estate and the cancellation of a large debt of het husband to the assignee, cannot be sustained because of the provision for the cancellation of the husband’s debt, if the assignee refuses to convey to the assignor the real estate mentioned in the assignment.</p>

Such an assignment is not valid at law at the time it is executed, but is merely an executory agreement to be equitably enforced when the interest which it is intended to convey vests in the assignor.

Though the assignment acknowledges the receipt of the conveyance of the properties, such acknowledgment is not conclusive: Nichols v. Nichols, <a href="/pa/133/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="133 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="812925" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0438-01">133 Pa. 438</a>; McPherran’s Estate, <a href="/pa/212/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="212 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="941846" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0425-01">212 Pa. 425</a>. Under competent evidence the court found as a fact that there had been no conveyance of the properties to the appellant; but because the assignment was to secure to Kern the payment of $10,000 of the husband’s existing indebtedness, it was held to be valid for that purpose. This was error. Even if the wife could have pledged her contingent interest in the estate of her father-in-law to secure the $10,000 indebtedness of her husband, and an assignment for that purpose alone held by the appellee would be valid, he holds no such assignment. The one under which he claims contains a valuable consideration moving directly to the appellant, but, as a matter of fact, she never received it, and non constat that without the inducement so held out to her directly she would have assigned her interest in the estate merely to secure the payment of her husband’s indebtedness. Her assignment was of but an expectancy of an interest in the income from her father-in-law’s estate, contingent upon . her surviving her husband. If she died before him, she was to get nothing from the estate. Such an assignment is not valid at law at the time it is executed, but is merely an executory agreement to be equitably enforced when the interest which it <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>is intended to convey vests in the assignor: Bayler v.
