It constructed a railroad of standard guage, with cross ties eight feet long and with ballast and rails upon Water street along the entire front of the plaintiffs’ premises, eastwardly therefrom to the brick company’s plant and westwardly therefrom to the Philadelphia. &amp; Erie Railroad, thereby appropriating part of the street fronting on the plaintiffs’ property, preventing the use thereof by the plaintiffs and by the public and diverting it from the purpose for which it was intended. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, a public corporation, commenced running its locomotives and cars on the said railroad for the purpose of hauling coal to, and the manufactured product from, the said fire brick plant, and has been running its trains on said railroad until the present time.</p>

At this time the brick company built an additional track at the eastern end of its railroad which was elevated about eighteen or twenty feet above the surface of the ground on trestles in order that the clay might be carried by cars over this trestle into the works. This elevation made a very heavy grade a short distance east of plaintiffs’ premises. An average of about one train a day would run over the brick company’s railroad up until the time when it began transporting its clay in this manner, but the transportation of the clay made additional trains necessary, and since the year 1900 the said plant has been very much enlarged and its capacity greatly increased, so that the number of trains per day has increased and they are much heavier than they formerly were, and in order to handle the cars up the steep grade at the eastern end of said railroad to the top of the trestle, more power is required than formerly, and in the effort made in front of the plaintiffs’ premises to gain the necessary momentum to run up the incline, great noise is made and great volumes of smoke are emitted from the engines. There is also a great deal of switching and shoving of trains in front of the plaintiffs’ premises. The brick company’s railroad is situated twenty-three feet from the curb in front of plaintiffs’ front door and within nineteen and one-half feet of the curb line at the western end of their lots, thus rendering the street difficult of passage and making it impossible to turn vehicles in the street. The running of the trains frightens the horses of the plaintiffs and those of visitors at their house, so that it is dangerous and frequently impossible to drive in front of the house. Horses have been frightened and broken loose and ran away there so that the tying of horses in front of the plaitiffs’ premises has necessarily been abandoned.</p>

In 1903 it remodeled its plant, placing all machinery on heavy concrete foundations and otherwise went to a large expense to make the operation of the machinery noiseless and free from vibration, which result was obtained; that at this time also the plaintiffs were fully aware that the plant was being remodeled in such increased capacity, but stood by and permitted large sums of money to be expended for this purpose; that only one train goes into the plant in the morning between 7 and 8 o’clock and remains there on an average about fifteen minutes, and another train goes into the plant during the afternoon and remains a period of about thirty minutes, and that these two trains are the only ones going in. and out of the plant each day; that the change in the method of transportation of their clay from water to rail was rendered necessary by lack of water in the river on which to float their boats and fiats, and that the change from water to rail is at an increased expense. That they are the largest industry in the city of Lock Haven and pay taxes to the city and county amounting to over $1,400 a year; that all of their employees live in Lock Haven, or its immediate vicinity, and that if the prayer of the bill is granted it will be necessary for it to close down its plant and to remove the same from the city of Lock Haven, thereby entailing irreparable loss and damage, not only to the brick company, but to the city, resulting in the loss of employment to a large number of men, and greatly depreciating the general business of the town and the value of the property therein.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b529-3" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[141,935,1157,1451]]]'>It appears from the testimony that at the time the brick company built its railroad upon Water street it had been granted the right to do so by an ordinance of the city council, and that permission had also been granted to it by all the property owners on Water street, with the exception of the plaintiffs in this case, who had refused to sign permission for this purpose. Beyond that fact it does not appear that the plaintiffs ever made any other complaint until they brought this suit, which was instituted eighteen years after the building of the railroad and five years after the construction of the incline, which the testimony shows to have been the occasion of most of the damages which have been proved. The facts alleged in the answer filed by the Queens Run Fire Brick Company and by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, to which allusion is made above, are substantially sustained by the evidence, and conceding for the purpose of argument that all of the allegations in the plaintiffs’ bill, to which reference is above made, have also been proven, the first question to be decided is whether, under such a state of facts, a proper case has been made out for the intervention of a court of equity. It may be conceded that the city of Lock Haven could not grant to the Queens Run Fire Brick Company a legal right to build and operate its siding on Water street, and that if the plaintiffs had promptly made application to this court for an injunction to prevent such occupation of the street, in front of their premises without their permission, it would have been granted.</p>

The defense of laches may be enforced in proper cases wherein the facts appearing call for it, whether they arise upon the bill and pleadings or upon the whole case as presented by the evidence. The court will often take notice of it, even though the objection is not made by the parties: Beach’s Modern Eq. Prac., sec. 258. In the case of Bruner v.

The latter case decides that where a railroad is projected over a public road without legal authority and the abutting property owners had notice of it and failed to make prompt objection thereto they are charged with constructive consent and equity will not interpose for their relief after a portion of the track has been constructed, the plaintiffs being barred by their laches from relief <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>in equity.

While we cannot regard the reasoning in these cases as sound, it is not necessary to decide this question under our view of the present case. The cases cited above from our own appellate courts to our mind conclusively control the present case. It has never been held that an injunction is a matter of right. It will not issue when upon a broad consideration of the situation of all parties in interest, good conscience does not require it, nor where the benefit to the complainant is entirely disproportionate to the injury to the respondent. In Dilworth’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/91/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="91 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="487685" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0247-01">91 Pa. 247</a>, the court said: “It often becomes a grave question whether so great an injury would not be done to the community by enjoining the business that the complaining party should be left to his remedy at law.” An injunction will not be awarded where the benefit to the complainant is entirely disproportionate to the injury to the respondent, even though the complainant may have a right to damages at law, Becker v. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/188/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="188 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="901261" data-case-paths="/pa/188/0484-01">188 Pa. 484</a>; nor where it will inflict greater injury than it will prevent. In such case the injured party will be left to his remedy at law: Robb v. Carnegie, <a href="/pa/145/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="145 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="825917" data-case-paths="/pa/145/0324-01">145 Pa. 324</a>. Assuming in the present case that the defendant occupied the street in front of the plaintiffs’ premises without legal authority and that by reason thereof the plaintiffs have suffered all of the damages alleged in their pleadings or shown by their testimony, we are of the opinion that the damages are of such character that they may be fully compensated in an action at law and that the delay of the plaintiffs in bringing this action convicts them of such laches as to defeat their right to apply for relief in equity. As was said in the case of Orne v. Fridenberg, <a href="/pa/143/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="143 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="978542" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0487-01">143 Pa. 487</a>, “A Chancellor does not interfere by way of mandatory injunction even though the injury be clearly established, when there has been long continued delay in asserting the right, and the remedy exists at law.”</p>

The fire brick company erected its plant and began operation in 1887, and the plant has been in continuous operation ever since. The railroad siding was constructed in 1890 and has been used continuously since by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for hauling coal to, and the manufactured product from, the fire brick plant, and since 1900, has also been used in transporting fire clay to the plant. The capacity of the brick plant is about 40,000 bricks per day, and 200 men are employed to operate it. In 1900 the fire brick company constructed an additional track on its own land at the eastern end of the railroad, which was elevated eighteen or twenty feet above the surface of the ground so that the fire clay used in the plant might be carried by the cars into the works. In 1903 the company expended $60,000 in enlarging the plant, and remodeled it so as to make the operation of the machinery noiseless and free from vibration. The plaintiffs knew that the plant was being remodeled with an increased capacity but made no objection and did not attempt to restrain the operation of the railroad in front of their premises. So far as the evidence discloses, the plaintiffs did not object to the defendant laying its railroad in front of their premises or to the construction of the additional track until it filed this <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>bill in November, 1905. It is true, that when the city council and the other property owners on Water street granted permission to the fire brick company to build its railroad on the street, the plaintiffs refused to give their consent, but they did not object or make any attempt whatever, prior to filing this bill, to restrain the construction of the road. They saw the road built in front of their premises in. 1890; they saw it operated for fifteen years; they saw the additional track constructed in 1900; they saw the fire brick company's plant remodeled at great expense and knew it could only be operated by use of the railroad; and these several acts were all done with the knowledge of the plaintiffs and, so far as the record discloses, without a single word of objection by them. In addition to these facts, the plaintiffs in 1900 remodeled and enlarged their dwelling house and finished it in modern style without making any objection to the construction or operation of the fire brick company's railroad.</p>

The facts of the case clearly warranted the judge in dismissing the bill on this ground. The counsel for the plaintiffs concede that “the plaintiffs here knew their rights and stood upon them from the first.'' There was no deception or fraud practiced by the defendant, and the plaintiffs were cognizant of every move made by the fire brick company in the construction of the railroad in front of their premises. They knew all the facts and, knowing their rights as they admit, it was their duty to act promptly. There is no sufficient excuse given in the bill for the failure of the plaintiffs to assert their rights at an earlier date than 1905 when they filed this bill. Neither was there anything shown upon the trial of the cause that justified the plaintiffs in delaying their objection to the construction of the railroad until they instituted these proceedings. So far as the record discloses, there is no justification whatever for the conduct of the plaintiffs in permitting, without objection, the construction of the road, its subsequent operation for so many years, and the large expenditure of money on a plant which could only be available by use of the railroad. A party guilty <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>of such conduct cannot secure relief in a court of equity. Vigilantibus, non dormientibus, servit lex. The plaintiffs have slept upon their rights which concededly they knew, and a chancellor will not aid them to the great prejudice of another party whose equities are at least equal to those of the plaintiffs. As said in Powers’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/125/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="125 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="563992" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0175-01">125 Pa. 175</a>,186, the maxim of the common law, that wherever there is a right there is a remedy for its infraction has never been adopted by courts of equity. Hence, he who sleeps upon his rights may awake to find that his remedy for their enforcement in a court of equity has vanished.</p>
