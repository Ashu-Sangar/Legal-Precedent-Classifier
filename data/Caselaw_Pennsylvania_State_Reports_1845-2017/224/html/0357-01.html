In other words, the mere fact of parties going in now and then and cutting some timber, or cutting some ties, or some logs, such acts in themselves do not constitute adverse possession.”</p>

The jury were told: “When parties claim title by adverse possession, by virtue of the statute of limitations, it <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>has been said time after time that that possession must be a hostile, adverse, open, visible, notorious, and a continuous possession, in order for. them to maintain title.
