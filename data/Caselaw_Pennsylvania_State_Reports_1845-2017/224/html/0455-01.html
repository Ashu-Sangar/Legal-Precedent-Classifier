On the trial of a scire facias sur mortgage where forgery is set up as a defense, it is proper for the court to refuse to charge that the notary’s certificate of acknowledgment is sufficient and strong evidence of the genuineness of the mortgage, where the defendant denies that he executed the paper, the notary is unable to identify the defendant as the man who had signed it, three other persons testify that they saw the mortgage signed and that the person who signed it was not the defendant, and the wife of the defendant testifies that she procured her brother to personate her husband in the execution of the mortgage. Such a case is not one of a certificate of a notary before whom the real mortgagor actually appeared and an effort is made to contradict that to which the officer certifies.</p>

My thought is this, that it is necessary to the plaintiff’s case to establish to the satisfaction of the jury that this mortgage was executed by the defendant or was executed with his previous authority or subsequent ratification, and so far as ratification is concerned there can be no ratification without knowledge, the court holding that the preliminary requisite of ratification— some evidence must be established before the question ruled out can be inquired of.

The execution and acknowledgment of the mortgage in suit evidenced by the official notarial certificate and the subsequent recording of the mortgage is sufficient and strong evidence of the genuineness of the mortgage and entitles the plaintiff to a verdict in her favor unless overcome by convincing countervailing evidence which satisfies the jury to the contrary. <em>Answer: </em>The court is unable to say that the certificate of the notary public is sufficient and strong evidence of the genuineness of the mortgage. The law makes it evidence. It is technically evidence. But you will see that if the facts certified to in the certificate are successfully attacked by testimony, why not only the evidence of the certificate is not sufficient and not strong, but if the evidence in your judgment attacks it, overwhelms it with defeat, why, of course, it is no evidence, you will not be governed by it at all.

The proofs offered by the plaintiff are sufficient in the first instance to entitle her to a verdict and under all the evidence the jury may find a verdict in her favor. <em>Answer: </em>That can’t be affirmed just as it is written. The law is that the certificate of the notary public is written prima facie evidence, and if there were no other proofs in the case that certificate wTould prevail and in that sense the certificate of the notary public is sufficient, but if, as I said before, it is to your satisfaction shown that the certificate is not true, why, of course, the facts found in the certificate are not the facts you would find by your verdict.

On this appeal the chief complaint of the appellant is that the judge failed in his charge to give due weight to the notary’s certificate of acknowledgment. The mortgage was offered in evidence with no other proof of its execution than this certificate. It was admitted by the court as the duly executed act and deed of the appellee, and, but for the defense that followed, judgment would have been directed for the appellant.</p>

Called as a witness in his own behalf, the latter testified that he had not executed it, had never appeared before the notary public and that the first time he saw it was when the case was called for trial at a previous term of court. His wife, properly designated by the trial judge as a bad woman, had induced her brother to personate her husband in executing the mortgage and acknowledging it before the notary. That officer, who was one of the witnesses to the execution of the mortgage, was unable to identify the appellee as the man who had signed and acknowledged it before him. Albert W. James, the other witness to the execution of it, accompanied the man who signed it to the notary’s office and testified positively that the appellee was not the one who had signed and acknowledged it in his presence. Another witness, Albert James, the real estate agent to whom application was made for the loan, stated with equal positiveness that the appellee was not the man who had executed the mortgage in his office. Samuel Bunting, who finally negotiated the loan and saw the mortgage signed, testified in the same positive manner that the appellee was not the person who executed it. The admission of the wife of the appellee on the trial was that she needed money and asked her brother to go to the office of Mr. James and personate her husband in the execution of the mortgage, believing that she would be able to repay the loan herself. Under this state of facts the court could not have instructed the jury to give to the certificate of the notary the weight which counsel for appellant insist should have been attached to it: Michener and Wife v.
