In an action against a city to recover damages for death of plaintiff’s husband, it appeared that the deceased was riding on an elevated seat on an open wagon on a wide thoroughfare crowded with heavy teams, on which there were three tracks of a steam railroad. While crossing the tracks he turned his horses to one side to avoid a team crossing in front of him. One of the wheels of his wagon slid on a rail and went into a narrow depression or hole at its side, causing a jolt that threw him from his seat. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury, and that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.</p>
