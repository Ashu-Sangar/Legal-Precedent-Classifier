It is a familiar rule that equity will not entertain jurisdiction to decree execution of a contract by a vendee which contemplates only the payment of money; nor generally where the consideration consists of goods or chattels, stock or bonds for which differences in market values after purchase thereof may be adequately compensated, but it is not universal. There are many exceptional cases. It is not applicable where some specific chattel bargained for has a personal value, or which the defendant only can supply; nor where the whole issue of bonds is held by one or a few persons for investment; when they have <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>no definite value in the general market; when the difficulty of acquisition by the complainant would be great, or practically impossible.</p>

The tract was surrounded by other lands of the vendor. He exercised within thirty days the option to take these bonds, instead of the annual ground rent of five per cent upon a capitalization of $5,000, and it is, therefore, evident that his purpose had in view larger possibilities than seemed then to be measured by this percentage on investment. Jurisdiction in equity is often assumed upon the ground that relief by bill is the most convenient, although there be a remedy at law: Bierbower’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/107/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="107 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="8856062" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0014-01">107 Pa. 14</a>; Appeal of Brush Electric Light Co. et ah, <a href="/pa/114/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="114 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="550014" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0574-01">114 Pa. 574</a>.

      <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>The case relating to interest demands on real contracts, are divided into two classes with a distinction between them which is not plain until after close examination, for all of them do not seem to be harmonious at first view. The question seldom arises in suits for specific performance by a vendor except by petition to execute the contracts of decedents in the orphans’ court, as bills for that purpose are predicated upon the fact that they cannot be maintained for payment of the consideration in money. It is sometimes presented on a vendee’s bill after tender, but more frequently in actions of covenant or ejectment to enforce the payment stipulated for in articles of agreement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[118,1035,1162,1065]]]'>When the contract has not been executed by delivery of a deed at the time appointed, and possession has not been given, the general rule upon the subject is thus stated: “The vendor is regarded as trustee of the land for the benefit of the purchaser, and liable to account to him for rents and profits, or for the value of the use and occupation, and the purchaser is treated as trustee of the purchase money unpaid and charged with interest thereon unless the purchase money has been appropriated, and no benefit has accrued from it to the purchaser:” 2 Beach, Eq. Jur., sec. 633. When possession of the land, however, has been taken by the vendee (otherwise than as part of the contract), and then holds and enjoys it without disturbance, the situation is reversed, and it has been held under these circumstances that as the purchaser has the profits of his use and occupation that will be deemed equivalent to the interest on the price to be paid which then belongs to the vendor: Fasholt v.

In these instances the purchase money <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>is legally “due” by the terms of the vendee’s covenant at the day set for payment. Although he gets no deed immediately he has an equitable title in the land, and continued undisturbed possession of it makes him responsible for the interest from that date, provided the vendor is vigilant in removing the disability, and the vendee has not kept his money uninvested and unproductive, but appropriated to this anticipated and future payment.</p>

If the consideration is to be paid only upon receipt of deed for a clear title, or one free from incumbrances, the money is not “due” until such a conveyance is tendered, for the vendor may never be able to comply; and as interest, when not expressly contracted for, is the legal and uniform rate of damages for detention of money after it becomes due, it is not charged against a vendee willing to comply with the condition who is in possession under the contract itself, until the event happens upon which payment depends. It may be said of this rule what Judge Sharswood said of the distinction between sharing in profits and receiving a certain percentage of them as compensation, in the determination of a partnership existence : “ It must be admitted to be of a very refined and shadowy character, but it has been authoritatively established.” It will be found supported and illustrated by great variety of facts in McKennan v.

In this last cited case it is said by Judge Rice (p. 445): “ It is contended that where the vendee of land is put into possession, he must pay interest on the purchase money, whether the articles call for it or not. It is not to be denied that expressions can be found in text-books and reports which read by themselves and apart from the facts of the cases in which they are used would seem to sustain this contention. . . . But (p. 447) where the contract expressly provides that he shall have immediate possession of the land, and that the purchase money shall not be due and payable un<a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>til a future day, and is silent upon the subject of interest, no such equitable consideration enters into the case, and we understand the law to be that he is not chargeable with interest until the debt is due.” In Robbins v.

Until both of these conditions had been complied with the defendant was not required to pay the money, and was in no default in not paying it.”</p>

But this is not so inequitable as it seems from the statement of the fact. It was put into immediate possession, not unlawfully nor by mere acquiescence of the vendor, but by virtue of the contract, and the use of it pending a conveyance as required was part of the benefit to be received for the consideration then named, as will be seen from the receipt given for the draft of $1,000, as well as from the written agreement. The only default about the execution of the deed was that of the decedent. Under these circumstances no action at law would lie for the rents and profits, or use and occupation. He tendered no deed at all until March 31, 1903. The objection to it was not capricious. When declined because the incumbrance of the highway ex<a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>isted, the vendor did not proceed to remove it, but filed his bill in equity to compel the defendant to accept it with this defect, and continued the litigation through the appellate court where it did not reach final decision before March 20, 1905.</p>

While counsel fees and expenses incurred in a suit may not be recovered in an action at law, it must not be forgotten that specific performance is decreed only as a matter of grace, and a strict legal right is not sufficient to move a chancellor if it will be inequitable or unfair, nor without indemnification for a loss occasioned by the acts of the plaintiff: 'Waterman, Spec.

The defendant knew of the vacation of the road, but as it did not intend to rescind the contract, was not required to tender performance on its own behalf. After the decedent’s death his own deed, if yet in existence, would have conveyed no title: Karmane v.

Dig. 738), and as the defendant had always pleaded its readiness to take the title when clear of incumbrances and pay the consideration, conveyance by them under an order of court would have been attended by no material loss: Hagerty’s Case, <a href="/watts/4/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="4 Watts 305" data-case-ids="1842794" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0305-01">4 Watts, 305</a>; Chess’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/4/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="4 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="401893" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0052-01">4 Pa. 52</a>.
