      <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>2. The company after its incorporation proceeded to mine coal. Charles A. Burr was president of the company, and David J. Whiteford was secretary and treasurer. The company had directors — Burr, David J. Whiteford, William M. Whiteford, Marsh and Pellio — but the business of the company was carried on in a very informal way, the president and the secretary (Burr and D. J. Whiteford) being in charge of the business and conducting it as they saw fit. There were no stated meetings of the board of directors except the annual meeting held when the parties met as stockholders. Mr. Burr died in June, 1904, and from that time to September, 1906, the business of the company was managed by David J. White-ford, aided in an informal way by Mrs. Burr who became the owner of the Burr stock — 100 shares.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[311,1153,1152,745]]]'>3. The plaintiff, at the solicitation of David J. Whiteford, sold his five shares of stock to the Bulls Head Coal Company for the sum of $1,000, on August 17,1906. The plaintiff himself does not know whether Whiteford or the company was the purchaser, the transfer of the stock certificate having been signed in blank; but the evidence shows that the stock was paid for with the company’s check, signed by Whiteford as treasurer. The plaintiff, claiming that fraud had been practiced upon him and that he had been deceived as to the financial condition of the company and as to the value of the stock, demanded a reassignment of his stock, tendering to White-ford, and through him to the company, on March 18, 1907, the sum of $1,000 and interest from August 17, 1906. The reassignment of the stock was refused.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[311,1908,1149,531]]]'>4. The offer to buy plaintiff’s stock came from Mr. Bradbury, who was acting for one or both of defendants. Before agreeing to sell his stock, plaintiff consulted Whiteford as to the condition of the mine and the value of the stock. The substance of the information given plaintiff was that the mine was about worked out and that $300 would be a good price for his stock. This information was not only misleading; it was false; and the evidence pointing to this conclusion is of a very convincing character, as will be seen from our next finding.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b409-2" data-blocks='[["BL_409.3",409,[131,380,1162,1073]]]'>
      <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>5. The mining operation carried on by the defendant company was a small one. When the operation was started the president and treasurer each had a salary of $75.00 per month as compensation for managing the affairs of the company. Some time afterwards these two officers each received $500 per month. Up to April, 1904, they had drawn from the treasury of the company in salaries the sum of $25,000. In April, 1904, the salary of each of the two persons named was $1,000 per month, and we find that the sum of $49,000 was paid out in this way from May, 1904, to July 10, 1906. The $1,000 per month, was paid to Mr. Burr a month or two before he died, and the same sum was continued to his widow. Whiteford received the same sum. The payment of these large sums in the guise of salaries was without the authority of the board of directors and without the knowledge of some of the directors. The evidence shows further that at the time Whiteford was arranging to buy plaintiff’s stock and when Whiteford said the stock was worth only $300, the company had a large amount of cash in the treasury; that is, on July 31, 1906, the cash balance was $14,496.01, and on August 31, 1906, it was $13,278.38.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b409-3" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[127,1464,1157,908]]]'>6. It is established by the evidence that the defendants, one or the other of them, purchased the stock of Mr. Marsh, five shares, and that an effort was made to buy the stock of Ira T. Brown, five shares, from the executor of Brown, through Mr. Reynolds, attorney for the estate. Whiteford made the same kind of representations to Mr. Marsh and Mr. Reynolds that he had made to the plaintiff. He said that the property of the company was exhausted and that the assets of the company consisted of some old mine cars, some mine mules and some wornout machinery. There seems to have been a systematic effort on the part of the defendant Whiteford to buy out the small stockholders at as low a price as possible, and, to accomplish this purpose, that the property was, to say the least, unduly depreciated and the actual condition of the company concealed. Nothing was said as to the distribution of $49,000 in salaries in about two years to two of the officers of the company, without authority of law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b409-4" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[171,2383,1107,44]]]'>7. It is not necessary for us to ascertain the precise value of</p>

      <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>plaintiff's stock when he sold it to the company. It is sufficient to state that the value of the stock was much in excess of the amount paid for it, and that the plaintiff was induced to part with his stock by means of false representations made by the defendant who was acting in his own interest and in the interest of the other large stockholder.-</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[287,708,1152,586]]]'>8. About November, 1906, David Spruks became interested in the Bulls Head Coal Company. He bought 100 shares of stock from the Burr estate, paying $15,000 for them; five shares from E. F. Marsh and five shares from the Brown estate. For the 110 shares he paid altogether over $19,000. He knew that the company had purchased the plaintiff's five shares, because he saw the certificate of stock, marked “cancelled” in the treasury. Spruks reorganized the company in the sense that the company had new stockholders, a new board of directors and new officers, and the company continued to mine coal. The company, as a corporation, was the same. ■</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[287,1303,1152,257]]]'>9. When Spruks and his fellow stockholders took charge of the company the money in the treasury was a part of the assets. The new stockholders had the benefit of all the assets, and the testimony of Spruks is that there was about $13,000 in the treasury.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b410-6" data-blocks='[["BL_410.6",410,[288,1571,1149,205]]]'>10. I can find no laches on the part of the plaintiff in the assertion of his rights.

    <p class="summary" id="b410-8" data-blocks='[["BL_410.8",410,[287,1895,1150,421]]]'>- The only question that can be considered in this case is the right of the plaintiff to a return of his stock to him on payment to the company of the sum tendered to it on March 18, 1907. Having found as a matter of fact that plaintiff was deceived by an officer of the company as to the value of the stock, and that an intentional fraud was committed by the company upon the plaintiff, I have no hesitation in concluding that the plaintiff is entitled to a reassignment of his stock.</p>

This position is untenable. These questions may arise as soon as the plaintiff becomes again a stockholder. The defendant company at the instance of a stockholder may be compelled to take legal measures to recover moneys unlawfully appropriated by its officers; and on the failure of the company to do so, after notice, a stockholder possibly may do so. But this question is not before us now. The prayer of the plaintiff for such relief is denied.</p>
