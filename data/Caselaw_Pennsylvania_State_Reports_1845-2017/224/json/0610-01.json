The defendant now asks for a modification of our judgment on the theory apparently, that it will lose its right of appeal by lapse of time.\nThis is a misapprehension. The order of this court is so worded, that instead of entering the necessary judgment ourselves, we direct the court below to enter it, and the defendant\u2019s right of appeal in the original suit will run from the date of that judgment so entered.",
