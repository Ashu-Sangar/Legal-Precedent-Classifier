        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe only question argued was that of contributory negligence. The plaintiff\u2019s husband was riding on an elevated seat on an open wagon on a wide thoroughfare crowded with heavy teams, on which there were three tracks of a steam railroad. While crossing the tracks he turned his horses to one side to avoid a team crossing in front of him. One of the wheels of his wagon slid on a rail and went into a narrow depression or hole at its side, causing a jolt that threw him from his seat. Whether under the circumstances he should have seen and avoided the danger caused by the defect in the surface of the street was a question for the jury.\nWhile the duty of vigilance is obligatory on everyone in the use of city streets, a driver who is unable to give undivided attention to the roadbed, because of the care required in managing his horses and in avoiding other vehicles, cannot be held to have seen, orto have been reckless in not seeing, defects in a roadbed that would have been obvious to a pedestrian.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

While the duty of vigilance is obligatory on everyone in the use of the city streets, a driver who is unable to give undivided attention to the roadbed, because of the care required in managing his horses and in avoiding other vehicles, cannot be held to have seen, or to have been reckless in not seeing, defects in a roadbed that would have been obvious to a pedestrian.\n2. In an action against a city to recover damages for death of plaintiff\u2019s husband, it appeared that the deceased was riding on an elevated seat on an open wagon on a wide thoroughfare crowded with heavy teams, on which there were three tracks of a steam railroad. While crossing the tracks he turned his horses to one side to avoid a team crossing in front of him. One of the wheels of his wagon slid on a rail and went into a narrow depression or hole at its side, causing a jolt that threw him from his seat. Held, that the case was for the jury, and that a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained.\nArgued Jan. 18, 1909.\nAppeal, No. 183, Jan. T., 1908, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., March T., 1906, No. 1,176, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Annie McClay v. Philadelphia.\nMarch 22, 1909:\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for death of plaintiff\u2019s husband.\nThe facts are stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $4,000. Defendant \u2022 appealed.\nError assigned was in refusing binding instructions for defendant.\nThomas D. Finletter, assistant city solicitor, with him Harry T.
