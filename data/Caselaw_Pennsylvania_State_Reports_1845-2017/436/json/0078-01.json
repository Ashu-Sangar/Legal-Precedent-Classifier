        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an appeal from the entry of a judgment in favor of the defendant in an action of trespass for slander. The facts are as follows:\nFor years, consolidation of the City of Johnstown with surrounding municipalities has been advocated to help Johnstown recover from its economic problems. During the late summer of 1966 a group of interested citizens formed the Improve Johnstown Association (IJA) to promote consolidation and selected the Borough of Westmont as the first objective. They employed William Buckingham as coordinator and promoter, and he prepared a four page plan for consolidation. This was given on September 6, 1966, to Bichard Mayer, chairman of IJA and a director of WJAC, Inc. Since Mayer desired to make changes in the plan, Buckingham discarded all copies except two or three which he retained for correction. No copies were distributed to anyone, and after a corrected document was distributed to IJA members on September 9, Buckingham destroyed the remaining copies of the original document.\nAbout a week later, Buckingham prepared a three page document entitled \u201cTargets, Tactics and Time Tables\u201d for distribution to IJA. At a later date, he prepared sixteen separate typewritten documents containing instructions to the various committees which were to work to promote consolidation.\nThe members of IJA appeared openly and affixed their names to campaign documents and advertisements. A group called the Truth Committee was formed which opposed consolidation. Its membership was not disclosed, and campaign documents and advertisements appeared without the names of any sponsors.\nOn November 12, 1966, residents of Westmont received in the mail a document containing nine printed pages. The first was as follows:\n\u201cWho Is Deciding Tour Future?\n\u201cThis committee has secured the attached secret document, and it has been reproduced so that you may understand for yourself how a few men are trying to change the future of Westmont Borough.\u201d It was signed the Truth Committee and attached to it were (a) a copy of the first three pages of Buckingham\u2019s document of September 6, (b) a copy of the three pages entitled \u201cTargets, Tactics and Time Tables\u201d and (c) a copy of the instructions of Buckingham to two of the sixteen committees. There is much underlining in the document which does not appear on its original.\nThe Truth Committee\u2019s document was a subject of much discussion in the community. Ron Stephenson, a WJAC newsman, sought Mayer\u2019s approval of his comments on the subject prior to his November 14 broadcast, and Mayer suggested that he add that the document had been \u201cdoctored\u201d and \u201cpilfered.\u201d This was done, and Stephenson\u2019s commentary was as follows: \u201cThis afternoon a spokesman for the Improve Johns-town Association said the information circulated by the anti forces was a \u2018doctored report\u2019 of the real thing. ... The people of Westmont, it would seem, have every right to know who comprises the so-called Truth Committee. And who is putting up the money to fight consolidation? And for what reason or reasons? At this point, it would seem reasonable to ask: Are the angels of the anti-consolidation drive the same angels who financed the campaign of a well known area elected official? Are they the same angels who backed the move to defeat the Mayor-Council form of government in the Johnstown city election last week? Why do these angels hide behind a cloak of anonymity? The pilfered confidential document of the Improve Johns-town Association contains a time table for the consolidation drive.\u201d\nIn his deposition Stephenson stated the purpose of his comment was to force the leadership of the Truth Committee into the open; that he believed Schonek was an organizer of the Committee; and that he did not believe and did not intend to imply that the plaintiff had pilfered any document.\nOn November 15, defendant broadcast the following story: \u201cIn a byline story in this afternoon\u2019s edition of the Johnstown Tribune Democrat, suburban affairs writer, Robert Seffick reveals the leaders of the opposition to Westmont-Johnstown consolidation. Two area business men who reside in Westmont admit they are leading the opposition against consolidation. They are W. E. (Wid) Schonek of 843 Franco Ave. and Frank Pristow of 701 Tioga St. Mr. Schonek is owner-operator of Dick\u2019s Automotive in Johnstown and is affiliated with a number of other businesses locally and out of state. Mr. Pristow is the owner of Pristow Motor Sales along the Johnstown-Windber Road, the District\u2019s franchised Oldsmobile dealer. Both men admitted they financed the recent successful campaign of State Senator Richard Green who defeated John Haluska by a whopping majority. Both men say they spent money to defeat the charter commission recommendation of a mayor-council form of government in the City of Johnstown in last week\u2019s election. And both say they are now spending money and soliciting contributions to defeat the consolidation movement.\u201d Plaintiff denied having pilfered the document. He said it liad been left by an unknown person at a fire ball and then given to him by other persons.\nThe lower court found that statements as to \u201cpilfering\u201d and \u201cdoctoring\u201d were not defamatory of plaintiff; that even if they were libelous, they were not libelous per se and that plaintiff could not recover because he alleged no special damages; and that the statements were constitutionally protected as free speech. It thus granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\nUnder our analysis of the case, it is not necessary to decide whether plaintiff was a \u201cpublic figure\u201d or whether the defendant acted permissibly in light of the tests enunciated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), and Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130 (1967). Also, the fact that the complaint should have been in libel rather than in slander, Purcell v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., 411 Pa. 167, 191 A. 2d 662 (1963); Restatement 2d, Torts, Tentative Draft 11, \u00a7568A (1965), is not the basis of our decision.\nThe essence of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint is that the defendant has defamed him by accusing him of \u201cpilfering\u201d and \u201cdoctoring\u201d a campaign document of the pro-consolidation forces. It is the duty of this Court first to determine whether the communication complained of is capable of the defamatory meaning ascribed to it by the plaintiff. Volomino v. Messenger Publishing Co., 410 Pa. 611, 189 A. 2d 873 (1963); Cosgrove Studio and Camera Shop, Inc. v. Pane, 408 Pa. 314, 182 A. 2d 751 (1962); Bogash v. Elkins, 405 Pa. 437, 176 A. 2d 677 (1962). As to the charge of \u201cpilfering\u201d we will assume that an accusation of such would tend to blacken one\u2019s reputation or expose him to public hatred, contempt or ridicule or injure him in his business or profession. That is not all that is required, however. \u201cDefamatory words, in order to be actionable, must refer to some ascertained or ascertainable person, and that person must be the plaintiff.\u201d 22 P.L.E. Libel and Slander, \u00a717 (1959). \u201cThe fact that the plaintiff is not specifically named ... is not controlling. A party defamed need not be specifically named, if pointed to by description or circumstances tending to identify him.\u201d Cosgrove, supra at 319.\nThe defect in the plaintiff\u2019s case is that the communications in question in no way charge the plaintiff with having pilfered the document. As the lower court stated: \u201cThe broadcast did suggest that the Truth Committee sent out a document which had been pilfered and doctored by somebody. It is true that the broadcast referred to certain \u2018angels\u2019 financing the activities of the Truth Committee, but this statement contains no implications that \u2018angels\u2019 were the persons who . . . pilfered the document.\u201d The communications only stated that plaintiff was a leader of the Truth Committee and that the Committee had made use of a pilfered document. A reasonable man could find no basis for the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the statements accused him of the pilfering.\nPlaintiff also can not succeed on the theory that the statements defamed a group of which he was a part. Farrell v. Triangle Publications, Inc., 399 Pa. 102, 159 A. 2d 734 (1960). There are two reasons for this. First, the communications do not charge the group with having pilfered the document. Again, the charge is only that the group made use of it, not a defamatory statement. Secondly, even assuming such a charge was made\u2014\u201cWhere a defamatory publication or utterance is directed toward a class or group whose membership is so numerous that no one individual member can reasonably be deemed an intended object of the defamatory matter, no cause of action for libel or slander arises therefrom.\u201d Farrell, supra at 104. In plaintiff\u2019s own deposition lie indicated that the Truth Committee consisted of a large number of people, enough to more than fill the Westmont Fire Hall\u2014 possibly several hundred. In such a situation the statements could not be reasonably understood to have any personal application to any individual. Eestatement 2d, Torts, Tentative Draft No. 11, \u00a7564A (1965) ; 22 P.L.E. Libel and Slander, \u00a717 (Supp. 1969).\nAs to. the charge of \u201cdoctoring,\u201d it must be remembered that truth is a complete defense to a libel action. Schnabel v. Meredith, 378 Pa. 609, 107 A. 2d 860 (1954). Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Unabridged, 2d Ed. (1957), defines \u201cdoctor\u201d as \u201cto adapt to an end or use by subjecting to deceptive alteration or to special treatment, to tamper with.\u201d It certainly seems that when substantial parts of the original documents are deleted and underlining is done to draw attention to various parts that the document has been tampered with and subjected to special treatment so as to adapt it to a particular purpose. Therefore, because we have decided that the claim of \u201cdoctoring\u201d was true, it is not necessary to decide whether the defendant charged this particular plaintiff with having done the \u201cdoctoring.\u201d\nWe hold that the court below properly entered judgment for the defendant.\nJudgment affirmed.",
