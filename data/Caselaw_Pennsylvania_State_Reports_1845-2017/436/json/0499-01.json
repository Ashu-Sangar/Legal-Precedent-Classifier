        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nOn January 27, 1967, a one-story, brick house in Farrell, Pennsylvania, owned by John B. Fore and his wife, Idell, was destroyed by a gas explosion and fire. Alleging that the negligence of an employee of the United Natural Gas Company (Gas Company) was a proximate cause of the explosion, the Fores instituted this action seeking damages. At trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. Following the denial of motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial, and the entry of judgment on the verdict, the defendant Gas Company appealed. We affirm.\nFrom the evidence, the jury was warranted in finding the following facts:\nTwo days before the explosion, an employee of the defendant Gas Company came to the Fore house in the course of his employment to read the meter. Upon entering the building, he detected an odor of gas which caused him to check for leaks in the vicinity of three gas appliances located in the house. Admittedly, he did not check all the gas lines in the house for leaks. The employee then informed Mr. Fore that he found two leaks; one in the gas water heater connection, and another in the gas furnace connection, both of which should be repaired without delay. Mr. Fore said that he would make the necessary repairs. The defendant\u2019s employee then turned off the supply of gas into the house at the meter, but did not turn it off at the curb line. Later, he filed a routine report with his employer which noted that he had discovered a gas leak in the Fore house at the water heater connection, but failed to mention that he had also found a second leak at the gas furnace connection.\nMr. Fore and his son promptly repaired the two leaks called to their attention by the defendant\u2019s employee, as before related. They then turned the gas supply into the house back on and tested the couplings they had repaired for leaks by holding a lighted match in the area. No further leaks were evident. Mr. Fore and his son then returned to their residence at another address. Two hours later, the son returned to the house involved to light the furnace and the hot water tank. Shortly thereafter, the explosion occurred. The source of the gas which caused the explosion was a leak in a pipeline in the house which the defendant\u2019s employee had failed to discover or call to the Fores\u2019 attention. The safe practice standards published by the American Gas Association and accepted generally in the gas distribution industry suggest, inter alia, that if a gas leak is discovered by a gas company, it should \u201cmake sure that all possible sources of escaping gas have been located.\u201d\nIn this appeal, the defendant does not maintain that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain the verdict. It does, however, contend that certain trial errors require the grant of a new trial. We conclude that these assignments of error are without merit and that only one needs discussion.\nThe defendant\u2019s basic contention is that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury concerning the duty of the gas company under the circumstances. In relevant part the court said: \u201cOnce the company, that is the gas company, knows that the consumer\u2019s lines are not safe, it has the duty to require the lines to be repaired or else shut off the gas at the curb. The responsibility of a gas company arises from the knowledge of a dangerous condition and not by reason of the condition.\u201d\nIn this connection, the defendant first argues that it was not required to turn off the gas supply at the curb, but only at the meter. Its argument on this score is novel if not convincing. It first asserts that there is a direct relation between where its area of responsibility for repair and maintenance ends and where the gas should be turned off once there is notice of leaks in the consumer\u2019s lines. It then asserts that its duty to turn the gas off at the curb was imposed at a time when its area of responsibility for repair and maintenance ended at the curb. The Gas Company next concedes (without citing any authority for the proposition) that its general area of responsibility now embraces not only it own gas mains but also the service line extending from the curb to the meter. Thus, it argues, since its area of responsibility now extends up to the meter, its duty should be to turn off the gas at the same point. But, as the trial court instructed the jury, the negligence of the defendant does not stem from the condition itself or the defendant\u2019s failure to repair, but rather from the defendant\u2019s knowledge that a very dangerous condition existed and its failure to take every reasonable precaution to protect the Fores and others from harm.\nMoreover, the duty of a gas company under the peculiar circumstances where it becomes aware of leaks in the customer\u2019s lines is not based on a strict determination of areas of responsibility but on the very real consideration of where the flow of gas can most effectively be stopped by the gas company\u2014where can it best \u201cavoid the danger that might result.\u201d When the company can with one effective step prevent more gas from entering the consumer\u2019s home and it can do this with little inconvenience to itself and with complete finality, then the company\u2019s argument that its duty is satisfied by merely turning off the gas at the meter\u2014 where a multitude of factors may prevent the termination of gas flow\u2014carries little weight.\nNext, the defendant argues that assuming the trial court correctly defined its duty, namely, \u201cto require the lines to be repaired or else shut off the gas at the curb,\u201d the two duties are disjunctive, and since its employee advised Mr. Fore that repairs were necessary, its duty was completely satisfied, and the jury should have been so instructed.\nIn the first place, this argument fails to take into consideration the trial evidence that the defendant\u2019s employee failed to inform Mr. Fore of the specific leak or leaks which gave rise to the explosion, and also that the employee failed to make a complete check of the gas system in the house which probably would have disclosed this leakage.\nThe duty which devolves upon a gas company, once it has knowledge of a leak or defect in the consumer\u2019s lines, was first announced as dictum in Windish v. Peoples Natural Gas Co., 248 Pa. 236, 240, 93 A. 1003, 1004-1005 (1915), where the court said: \u201cHad the defendant company known that the service line was rusted and corroded to such an extent as to permit gas to escape it would have been its duty either to have caused the service line to be repaired by the person whose duty it was to do so, or to have the gas shut off at the street in order to avoid the danger that might result.\u201d\nWhile a cursory reading of this isolated passage might suggest that the duty is purely disjunctive, a closer reading of the case and the two companion cases decided the same day (Pouder v. Peoples Natural Gas Co., 248 Pa. 242, 93 A. 1005 (1915), and Smith v. Peoples Natural Gas Co., 248 Pa. 246, 93 A. 1005 (1915)) exposes the error of such a view.\nImmediately after the above quoted language in Windish, supra, the court went on to say: \u201cWe fully agree with the suggestion that the defendant company, even if .the duty to repair the service line did not devolve upon it, could not continue to furnish gas through that service Ime if known to be defective without making itself liable in damages for injuries resulting therefrom.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nMoreover, in the companion case of Ponder, supra at 245, 93 A. at 1006, there is additional dictum to the effect that: \u201cIf it appeared from the testimony that the defendant company had knowledge of leaks in the service pipe, although it did not have the duty to repair, we would be strongly impressed with the argument of learned counsel for appellants, that it would at \\east have been its duty to shut off the gas at the curb until the repairs were made.\u201d (Emphasis supplied. )\nThis is stated even more emphatically in Conway v. Philadelphia Gas Works Co., 336 Pa. 11, 16, 7 A. 2d 326, 328 (1939) : \u201cIf from the record it appeared that notice had been brought home to the defendant that there was a leakage of gas in the premises occupied by the plaintiffs, then unquestionably it would have been its duty to see that the supply of gas into the house was shut off until the necessary repairs were made, . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) See also, Heller v. Equitable Gas Co., 333 Pa. 433, 3 A. 2d 343 (1939).\nIt seems clear that if the facts in Windish, Ponder or Conway showed that the defendant had notice of the leak and merely notified the homeowner to make repairs, while continuing to transport gas through the defective piping, this Court would certainly have found the defendant negligent.\nIt seems equally clear that if the defendant had notice that gas was leaking into its consumer\u2019s house and merely turned off the gas at the curb without even informing the owner that he should repair his defective piping (thus in no way lessening the potentially dangerous condition), this Court would likewise have found negligent conduct. The point is that in neither situation would the solitary act effectively \u201cavoid the danger that might result.\u201d .\nThe gas company has the duty, once it knows or has reason to know of defects in its customer\u2019s lines to \u201chave the gas shut off at the curb\u201d until such time as it has \u201ccaused the service line to be repaired by the person whose duty it was to do so.\u201d\nThis latter requirement imports more than a duty to simply notify such person of a defect in his line, though it certainly embraces such a requirement. Given the fact that the company does know that there are leaks in the customer\u2019s lines, then before it turns the gas back on it must be satisfied that the owner has properly made the repairs.\nAs we said in Goodman and Theise, Inc. v. Scranton Spring-Brook Water Service Co., 352 Pa. 488, 492, 43 A. 2d 111, 113 (1945) [quoted in Hemrock v. Peoples Natural Gas Co., 423 Pa. 259, 223 A. 2d 687 (1966)] : \u201c[I]f the gas company knows that there are defects in such a pipe, or is in possession of facts which should reasonably inform it that it is unsafe, it then becomes its duty to investigate the safety of the pipe before it continues to use it for the transportation of gas, and if it fails in that duty it becomes liable, for any resulting accident.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nSince we conclude that the gas company\u2019s duty is not disjunctive and that the company\u2019s duty to keep the gas turned off. continues until such time as it is satisfied that the repairs have been properly made, it is clear that the instructions. to the jury in no way prejudiced the defendant Gas Company.\n. Judgment affirmed.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice' Pomeroy concur in the result.",
