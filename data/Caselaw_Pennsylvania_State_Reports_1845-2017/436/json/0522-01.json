The petition cites no reasons in support of this request for allocatur. Petitioner\u2019s appointed counsel has filed a \u201csupplementary petition for allocatur\u201d in which he seeks the allowance of an appeal for \u201cthose reasons and grounds set out by the appellant in his petition for allowance of an appeal.\u201d Such a petition utterly fails to comport with our requirement of \u201crepresentation in the role of an advocate.\u201d Commonwealth v. Stancell, 435 Pa. 301, 256 A. 2d 798 (1969). See also Supreme Court Eule 69 (petitions for allowance of an appeal must set forth particularly the questions involved and the reasons supporting the grant of the petition). We note that petitioner\u2019s counsel in the Superior Court had informed petitioner by letter that in his opinion an appeal to the Supreme Court would be unavailing. To the extent that this letter may have been an attempt by counsel to withdraw, it failed to comply with the standards for withdrawal set forth in Commonwealth v. Baker, 429 Pa. 209, 239 A. 2d 201 (1968). See Commonwealth v. Taylor, 433 Pa. 334, 250 A. 2d 487 (1969). This case is remanded to the hearing court with directions that counsel file a proper allocatur petition or a proper petition to withdraw.",
