Acting with the permission of the Provisional Government, the first Church Sobor (convention) in centuries was held in 1917-1918; the outcome was the reestablishment of the Patriarchate, and the selection of Tikhon as Patriarch.</p>

The new organization came to be called the “Living Church” and its influence spread rapidly because its founders kept in the good graces of the Soviet Government.</p>

In 1927, however, Sergius, the suffragan Patriarch, reached an Accord with the government, promising on his part, to oppose the counterrevolutionary activities asserted against the Soviet Government; the government reciprocated and gave recognition to the Patriarchal Church. Thereafter the “Living Church,” bereft of its favored position with the government, which it enjoyed from 1922 to 1927, declined in influence.</p>

Stalin restored the office of Patriarch in 1943, and Sergius was chosen Patriarch. Following Sergius’ death in 1945, Alexy was elected Patriarch and continues in that office now. The Soviet Government is generally tolerant of the Church today and, apart from its mass anti-religious propaganda, does not interfere with the Church’s activities.</p>

With the purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867, the mission was elevated to a diocese and the See was eventually transferred from Alaska to San Francisco. In 1900, Russian Orthodoxy began to spread and grow dramatically due to the immigrations of the Greek, Russian, Slavic and Syrian peoples. The See of the North American Diocese was moved to New York City in 1905, and the famous St. Nicholas Cathedral, itself the object of frequent litigation, was erected.</p>

Article II, Section 2 of the Charter provides as follows: “This Church acknowledges itself to be a member and to belong to the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in the North America Diocese and as such, it accedes to, recognizes, and accepts the Constitution, Canons, Doctrines, Discipline and Worship of the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in the Diocese of North America and acknowledges their authority accordingly.”</p>

When in 1921 it had become obvious that their efforts were doomed to failure, many of the ecclesiastics left Russia and, at the invitation of the Serbian Patriarch, held a conference at Karlovitzy, Yugoslavia. The result was the formation of the “Russian Churches Outside of Russia” (the Karlovitz Synod group) whose supreme authority was a “Synod of Bishops Outside Russia.” This group continued its active resistance to the Bolshevik take-over, and fought for the restoration of the Czarist government. The Karlovitz Synod group has been declared to be uncanonical by Patriarchs Sergius and Alexy.</p>

The representatives to that Sobor suspected strongly that Kedrovsky was a pawn of the Soviet Government ; they also feared that a new Patriarchal Archbishop might be a tool of the Soviet State. Determined to resist Kedrovsky’s efforts to wrest control of church property from them, the delegates formed the American Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church (“Metropolia”) and elected Platon as their Archbishop.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The “Metropolia” thus established is hierarchical in nature, structured with the governing Metropolitan, a Council of Bishops, and a Council of the Laity. The “Metropolia” has always asserted that its origin is legitimate and that it has a valid claim on Orthodoxy. Authority for its existence is said to rest upon a Patriarchal Ukaz (decision) of November 20, 1920, which temporarily gave authority to churches outside Russia to govern themselves until the political situation in Russia calmed.</p>

This is so because the Patriarchal Decree of 1924 dismissing Platon for his opposition to the Soviet Government was effective only when Platon’s successor announced the dismissal to him, which, of course, did not occur until 1933.

The origin of most of St. Michael’s parishioners was CarpathoRussia, which prior to World War I was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and after World War I became the territory of Poland and Czechoslovakia. Many immigrants came from Carpatho-Russia to the United States in the early 1900’s, and in 1916, the Holy Synod and Russian Emperor granted the CarpathoRussians permission to establish an independent diocese. The Holy Synod appointed a special CarpathoRussian Suffragan Bishop.</p>

St. Michael’s joined Adam’s diocese, and remained under his leadership until his retirement in 1954. In 1935, Bishop Adam reached an agreement with the “Metropolia” and joined that organization, still retaining, however, a measure of independence for his parishes. In 1939, Adam withdrew from the “Metropolia”, preferring instead the total independence to which he had formerly been accustomed. <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>From 1989 to 1944, Adam governed his parishes without hierarchical allegiance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b280-5" data-blocks='[["BL_280.6",280,[221,667,1147,1304]]]'>The causal background of the instant controversy probably has its roots in the occurrences at St. Michael’s since 1939. When Adam disaffiliated with “Metropolia” in 1939, St. Michael’s had as its parish priest Reverend George Cucura, who came to St. Michael’s in 1936 as a priest faithful to Bishop Adam. Reverend Cucura continued his allegiance to the “Metropolia” after 1939. The parishioners desired to dismiss Reverend Cucura from 1939 until 1949, but were unable to obtain another priest. The parishioners turned to the Patriarchate to find a priest, but that organization demanded that St. Michael’s first amend its Charter, so as to align itself unmistakably with the Patriarchate. That condition was rejected. Finally, the “Metropolia” assigned another priest to St. Michael’s and instructed Reverend Cucura to serve another parish. Reverend Cucura refused, withdrew from “Metropolia” and joined the Patriarchate. Thereafter, he was influential in bringing Patriarchal priests to St. Michael’s, and St. Michael’s had Patriarchal priests until late 1955 when the Patriarchate was unable to furnish a priest. At that time, the “Metropolia” sent Reverend Alexander Fedoronko to St. Michael’s; he has remained there since then.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

When Reverend Fedoronko postponed a parish meeting set for the election of officers on February 3, 1963, the Patriarchal faction nevertheless held an election, and affirmed St. Michael’s relationship with the Patriarchate, giving Reverend Fedoronko thirty days notice to leave the parish. The “Metropolia” ecclesiastical courts issued decrees disciplining the leaders of the Patriarchal group; Reverend Fedoronko and certain parish members then brought suit against the Patriarchal faction, seeking an injunction against their interference with the alleged right of “Metropolia” to control the parish.

      <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>The chancellor found that St. Michael’s was founded in 1909 and incorporated in 1915 as a Church within the North American Diocese of the Eussian Orthodox Church, and accordingly, under the authority of the Holy Synod; he found further that the substitution of the Patriarch for the Holy Synod as the supreme ruling authority within the Church was merely an organizational change, not at all affecting the basic nature of the Eussian Church. The chancellor concluded, however, that the Charter could not resolve the controversy because at the time when St. Michael’s founders dedicated the Church to the Eussian Orthodox Church, it was the only hierarchical organization within the Eussian Orthodox Church represented in America; that the founders of St. Michael’s could not foresee the political changes which occurred in Eussia in 1917, nor could they foresee the effect which the political changes had on the Eussian Orthodox Church. In line with that reasoning, the chancellor undertook to discover what were the reactions of St. Michael’s parishioners to the changes wrought by the Eussian Eevolution, and how those reactions affected St. Michael’s jurisdictionally. The first reaction, said the chancellor, was a Church bylaw passed in 1925, permitting St. Michael’s to select their ecclesiastical jurisdiction from among the several which then existed. According to the chancellor, the bylaw was consistent with the Charter, again because the Charter was formulated when there was but one Eussian Orthodox hierarchy in the United States. The chancellor then found that, acting pursuant to the 1925 bylaw, St. Michael’s united with Bishop Adam’s Carpatho-Eussian Diocese from 1925 until 1935; from 1935 until 1939 with the “Metropolia”; from 1939 until 1944, with Bishop Adam; and from 1945 on, with the Patriarchate. The chancellor found that from the time when Eeverend <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>Fedoronko came to St. Michael’s onward, practically all of St. Michael’s jurisdictional ties have been with the “Metropolia”. He concluded, however, that this de facto affiliation with the “Metropolia” and secession from the Patriarchate was in violation of the Lay Control of Church Property Act, supra, and constituted an illegal diversion of church property. According to the chancellor, a valid and legal union with “Metropolia” could have been accomplished by a majority vote of St. Michael’s parishioners, but since the last majority jurisdictional vote was in favor of the Patriarchate, the de facto affiliation with the “Metropolia” was illegal. The chancellor concluded that St. Michael’s could in the future finally bind itself to the “Metropolia” by a majority vote of its parishioners, and an amendment to its Charter.</p>

In effect, the court en banc held that the Patriarchate had abandoned the North American Diocese after the Russian Revolution, releasing its claim upon it from 1917 until 1933 when it denounced the “Metropolia” and sent Ben<a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>jamin to the United States as the Patriarchal Exarch.

In that case, a local Presbyterian Church became divided over the General Assembly’s position on slavery; the minority faction of the congregation opposed the General Assembly’s position, seized control of the church property, and seceded from the General Assembly. The Kentucky courts examined the position of the General Assembly, and concluded that it had illegally imposed upon civil matters. The litigation was brought to the federal courts on diversity jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the Circuit Court’s reversal of the Kentucky court, holding that the local church was a constituent part of the hierarchical church organization, equipped with ecclesiastical judicatories; that in such a situation, the doctrine of separation of church and state required that the decrees of the highest church tribunal be binding on the civil courts. The rule thus formulated was a radical departure from the English law as enunciated in <em>Craigdallie v. </em>Aikman, 1 Dow. 1, 3 Eng. Rep. 601 (H.L. 1813), and <em>Attorney-General Ex rel.

This method of solution involved, of course, court introspection into what were the original doctrines held by the founders, and the ascertainment of which church faction was loyal to those doctrines. An obvious byproduct of the English rule was the civil disregard of the decisions of church courts, and consequently, the discouragement of hierarchical religious systems. <em>Watson, </em>supra, decided on principles of federal common law, refused to assure doctrinal continuity at the risk of curtailing the growth and establishment of religious systems and ideas, and at the risk of preventing the meaningful functioning of church judicatories.</p>

Under Georgia law, the doctrinal-continuity approach of the English courts is followed, and the general church organization can hold a local church in trust only as long as it continues in the practice of traditional religious tenets. The Georgia courts submitted to a jury the question of whether the General Assembly had departed from the traditional doctrine, and the jury found that it had, thereby breaking the trust, and freeing the local church from the hierarchical structure. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the Georgia Supreme Court, finding the “departure from doctrine” element of the implied-trust theory unconstitutional.</p>

The parties in interest were the “Metropolia” and the Patriarchal Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church.

The Supreme Court of the United States reversed, holding the pertinent legislation unconstitutional; the Court indicated that any legislation which determines in a hierarchical church ecclesiastical administration or the appointment of clergy or transfers church property from <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>one group to another impinges upon the free exercise of religion.

In <em>Kedroff, </em>the transfer of church property from that hierarchical organization could not be accomplished by legislative fiat. Here, St. Michael’s property cannot be transferred simply because a majority of its parishioners so desire. If that were permitted, then no real protection would be afforded to hierarchical religious systems. It seems to us that a logical reading of the relevant decisions of the United States Supreme Court produces the conclusion that the constitutional protection of hierarchical organizations precludes not only legislative and judicial action which would destroy church government, but also action by church members themselves which effects a transfer of church property from the control of one hierarchy into the hands of a competing hierarchy. St. Michael’s, whether a member of the Russian Orthodox Church of America or of the Patriarchal Exarchate (Russian Orthodox Church) is a constituent part of a church hierarchy. Given such a structure, we find untenable the chancellor’s conclusion that the 1925 bylaw allowing St. Michael’s to choose by majority vote its hierarchi<a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>cal allegiance, is consistent with its corporate Charter. The Charter secured St. Michael’s relationship within a hierarchical organization; the bylaw, in effect, sought to make St. Michael’s congregational in form.</p>
