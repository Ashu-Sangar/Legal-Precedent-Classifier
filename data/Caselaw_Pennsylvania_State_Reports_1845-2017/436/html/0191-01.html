L. , 18 P.S. §4524 (Supp. 1969). Section 4 of that act repealed the Act of September 17, 1959, P. L. 902, 4 P.S. §70.10, which had given the Board of Censors standing to seek an injunction against obscene movies. The 1968 act did not, however, repeal the statute which makes criminal the showing of an obscene movie. See Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §528, as amended, 18 P.S. §4528. The act did consolidate various statutes dealing with sale and distribution of obscene works to adults and minors. In section 1(b), which sets out separate provisions relating only to minors, the act specifically mentions sound recordings, sculpture, and motion pictures, <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>none of which media are mentioned in section 1(a) which deals with adults. Section 1(g), which gives the district attorney standing to seek an injunction, only enumerates the media mentioned in section 1(a). Thus appellants argue, quite persuasively, that since the Legislature failed to use the term “motion pictures” in 1(g), a term used elsewhere in the statute, the district attorney has no power to seek an injunction under the statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.6",246,[202,999,1149,1086]]]'>The first is that this Court must make “an independent constitutional judgment on the facts of the case as to whether the material involved is constitutionally protected.” <em>Jacobellis v.

The third proposition is that to find obscenity, “three elements must coalesce: it must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.” <em>Memoirs v.

      <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>There are no United States Supreme Court decisions since <em>Dell Publications </em>which would lead us to a different view of what constitutes obscenity. The district attorney, however, argues that for two reasons we should depart from the propositions set out in <em>Jacobellis </em>and <em>Memoirs, </em>and relied on in <em>Dell Publications. </em>For one, the instant case is a proceeding in equity, rather than a criminal proceeding as in <em>Jacobellis, </em>supra. Therefore, it is argued, our standard of review should, for some reason, be different. This argument overlooks the fact that the <em>Jacobellis </em>standard of review was adopted because First Amendment guarantees were involved, and not because the proceedings were criminal. See <em>Jacobellis, </em><a href="/us/378/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="378 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6166005" data-case-paths="/us/378/0184-01">378 U.S. at 189</a>, <a href="/us/378/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="378 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="6166005" data-case-paths="/us/378/0184-01">84 S. Ct. at 1679</a>. This being a federal constitutional standard, we may not depart from it. We thus may not constitutionally overrule this part of our decision in <em>Dell Publications, </em>a case which involved an equity proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b247-4" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[197,1455,1149,645]]]'>The district attorney next urges that a different standard for determining obscenity should be used when dealing with motion pictures. He argues that a motion picture reproduces actual conduct through sight and sound and, therefore, the impact on the viewer is far more vivid. Presumably the district attorney is arguing that if the medium can portray what is alleged to be obscene with greater impact, the medium itself is deserving of less constitutional protection. We cannot accept this argument, for the First Amendment permits no such limitation on its protection of free expression.</p>
    <p id="b247-5" data-blocks='[["BL_247.6",247,[198,2115,1147,327]],["BL_248.1",248,[189,408,1146,314]]]'>This is so for at least two reasons. First, as a factual matter, we cannot say that the impact of an obscene work will always be greater when put on film. Each medium has a different type of impact, one which is difficult to quantify on any sort of obscenity scale. A nude figure seen on the screen for a short time may <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>very well have less impact than a nude figure in a magazine, which can be leered at leisurely. Since we cannot say that the medium of motion pictures will inevitably render a work more obscene, we are constitutionally precluded from adopting a less protective constitutional standard.</p>
    <p id="b248-4" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[189,740,1147,1299]]]'>Second, we find no indication in any United States Supreme Court decision that movies are to be treated differently than any other medium. As Judge Friendly has recently pointed out, <em>“Jacobellis </em>related to a film and neither the majority nor the dissenting opinions suggested that any stricter standard would apply.” <em>United States v.

The conclusion that the Supreme Court approved this different test cannot be drawn from such silence, particularly since there was evidence of pandering and because the movie itself was classified by the lower court as being “hard-core pornography.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We agree with Judge Friendly that the per curiam affirmance “affords too frail a foundation” to support a different test for movies. <em>I Am Curious-Yellow, </em><a href="/f2d/404/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="404 F.2d 196" data-case-ids="2125153" data-case-paths="/f2d/404/0196-01">404 F. 2d at 201</a>.</p>

      <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>The chancellor found that the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex. The district attorney urges that no evidence other than the film need be introduced to prove violation of this standard, since “[t] his area is one where a judge’s subjective reaction is most relevant.” <em>Dell Publications, <a href="/pa/427/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="427 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1910376" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0189-01">427 </a></em><a href="/pa/427/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="427 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1910376" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0189-01">Pa. at 201</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20840" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="233 A.2d 840">233 A. 2d at 847</a>. That may be so where all agree that the “dominant theme of the work as a whole” is sex, leaving only the question of whether this theme appeals to a <em>prurient </em>interest in sex. But we could obviously not rely on a trial judge’s “subjective reaction” to “King Lear,” for example, since its dominant theme has nothing to do with sex. Compare <em>I am Curious-Yellow, </em><a href="/f2d/404/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="404 F.2d 196" data-case-ids="2125153" data-case-paths="/f2d/404/0196-01">404 F. 2d at 199</a> (holding picture not obscene; whatever the dominant theme may be, “it is certainly not sex”).

For example, one witness, a former New York <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>State film censor, testified that the movie “points up the destructive effect that the lack of parental love has on a young person. It shows how young people caught in this kind of situation can very easily, in their search for affection or love, become involved in this kind of exploratory or transitory homosexual relationship.” Another witness, who was chairman of this Commonwealth’s Board of Censors before it was disbanded, felt that the effects of maternal rejection shown in the movie were a lesson for parents.
