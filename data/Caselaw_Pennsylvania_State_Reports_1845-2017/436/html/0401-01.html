At that, time, appellant’s complaint asserts, appellee was driving a motor vehicle in a reckless and negligent manner as a result of which the automobile skidded onto the sidewalk and destroyed or struck down a fire hydrant, a litter pole and basket, a newsstand and appellant’s son, who at that time was standing next to appellant. Almost immediately after this destructive path was cut by appellee’s car, appellant claims that he suffered severe chest pain and that upon examination in the hospital, where he was confined for five <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>weeks, appellant was diagnosed to have sustained acute coronary insufficiency, coronary failure, angina pectoris, and possible myocardial infarction.

The judge noted “The impact rule will, no doubt, eventually be rejected as was the formerly well-entrenched rule of charitable immunities.

The Restatement has adopted a view in harmony with this approach: “§436 ... (2) If the actor’s conduct is negligent as creating an unreasonable risk of causing bodily harm to another otherwise than by subjecting him to fright, shock, or other similar and immediately emotional disturbance, the fact that such harm results solely from the internal operation of fright or other emotional disturbance does not protect the actor from liability.” Restatement (Second), Torts §436(2).</p>

The rule has been stated: “However, where, as here, a plaintiff sustains bodily injuries, <em>even though trivial </em>or minor in character, which are accompanied by fright or mental suffering directly traceable to the peril in which the defendant’s negligence placed the plaintiff, then mental suffering is a legitimate element of damages.” <em>Potere v.

However, the problem of tracing a causal connection from negligence to injury is not peculiar to cases without impact and occurs in all types of litigation ... in any event, difficulty of proof should not bar the plaintiff from the opportunity of attempting to convince the trier of fact of the truth of her claim.” <em>Falzone v.

First, it is not at all clear that the flood of litigation has occurred in states without the impact rule. “The truth of the matter is that the feared flood tide of litigation has simply not appeared in states following the majority rule allowing recovery of psychic injuries without impact. The volume of litigation has been heaviest in states following the <em>Mitchell </em>doctrine and its impact rule.
