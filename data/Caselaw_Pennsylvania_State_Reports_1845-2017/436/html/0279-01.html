The question in this case is whether the Company may have become contractually obligated to one of its employees, appellant herein, by virtue of the actions of both parties pursuant to the program. This appeal is from the sustaining of preliminary objections by the Company in the nature of a demurrer. Consequently, the facts before us are confined to the appellant’s complaint, as amended, and the demurrer admits for present purposes every well pleaded material fact set forth in the pleading to which it is addressed, as well as the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom. <em>Eden Roc Country Club v.

Appellant submitted the suggestion, as required, on the standard form with its stipulation that the decision of the Suggestion Committee should be determinative as to all matters. Thereafter, the Suggestion Committee informed the appellant in writing that his suggestion had been rejected (Exhibit C to the complaint). This communication stated that a change of the panels would necessitate large expenditures for design work, the building of models, and laboratory tests, and that these <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>costs would more than offset any savings which might be realized from the proposed change. Appellant was informed that “If breaker re-design is started for other reasons in the future, this idea will be considered.” He was also advised, in the same communication, that his suggestion could be reopened within a year or resubmitted after a year.</p>

In explaining its action, the Suggestion Committee cited its original reasons, adverted to further problems in the design of the panels resulting from the need to use nonmagnetic materials in the panel, and mentioned that redesign of the panels to include partial nonmagnetic materials was being undertaken as part of an independent cost reduction study.</p>

The complaint averred, in paragraph 8, that thereafter, probably in 1964, the Company “did adopt and utilize” the recommendations advanced by the suggestion, and the plaintiff (appellant) thereupon requested reconsideration of his suggestion. The Company apparently made such a review and communicated the results thereof to appellant in a letter of May, 1965 (Exhibit F to the complaint). This letter adverts to the Company’s “application of the same basic idea [as that contained in appellant’s suggestion] in a redesign” and confirms the Company’s view that the reason given for the initial rejection of the suggestion in 1962 had been valid at that time. It further states the opinion of the writer (General Manager of the Switchgear Division) that “the action taken [by the Company] in 1964 changing the back plate was the <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>result of independent action taken without knowledge of your [appellant’s] suggestion,” and reaffirmed the Company’s refusal to make an award to appellant.</p>
    <p id="b335-3" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[143,561,1152,1515]]]'>In November, 1966, appellant filed a complaint which averred that the Company had adopted the appellant’s suggestion and prayed for an accounting as to the Company’s savings therefrom, and damages equal to 20% thereof. The Company filed preliminary objections, on the ground that the complaint did not set forth a valid claim against the Company on which relief could be granted. In support of this conclusion the objections cited the stipulation that “the decision of the Local Suggestion Committee on all matters pertaining to this suggestion . . . will be final.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The lower court (Smith, Jk., J.), in sustaining the Company’s objections, found that the suggestion program of the Company was an invitation to its employes to make an offer; that the offer of the appellant was by its terms subject to acceptance or rejection by the Company through its Committees; and that the offer had been duly and consistently rejected by the Company. The court further held: “Plaintiff is bound by the statement to which he agreed that the decision of the Suggestion Committee will be final on all matters pertaining to his suggestion and his eligibility for an award unless there is fraud or deceit practiced by or an unjust enrichment enuring to the defendant and no such allegations are made in this case.” Finding that no enforceable contract had been pleaded by appellant, the court sustained defendant’s preliminary objections and granted plaintiff leave to amend his complaint.</p>

The lower court (McKenna, Jr., J.) found that the amended complaint added no substantial allegation to the original complaint. Holding that appellant was bound by the adverse determinations of the Suggestion Committee, the court below sustained the objections and dismissed the amended complaint.

    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.6",338,[198,885,1148,695]]]'>If, as appellant argues, the Company’s suggestion program constituted an offer of a unilateral contract, appellant’s “acceptance” necessarily incorporated, and was determined by, the terms and conditions of that program. By its express terms, the Company’s offer was a request, not merely for a suggestion, but for a suggestion its own committee acting in good faith would deem acceptable. Even if it is assumed that an act so conditioned could form a valid unilateral contract, appellant’s suggestion on the face of this record was not such an act as the Company required. Consequently, the act required of appellant to effect a unilateral contract was not performed.</p>
    <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.7",338,[201,1593,1147,637]]]'>If, on the other hand, the interpretation of the lower court is accepted and the suggestion of the appellant is treated as an offer in response to the Company’s invitation, it is clear that the Company, so long as it acted in good faith, was entitled to reject the offer and decline to compensate appellant for the rejected suggestion. The Company did not undertake to reward employees for all suggestions, but only for those it deemed acceptable by the procedure set forth in its submission form. Here no acceptable suggestion was submitted, and there was therefore no contract upon which appellant could recover.</p>

The Company responds that these are but conclusory averments and that no cause of action is set forth.</p>

The word seems innocent enough, but is perhaps susceptible to variant meanings in this situation. The Company refers repeatedly to the terms of the suggestion program, and states that “adopted” means, and means only, affirmative and express verbal adoption by the Suggestion Committee acting on behalf of the Company; since the suggestion of appellant was explicitly rejected, it could not be adopted. In the context of the suggestion program, this seems irrefutable. Appellant, however, argues that the Company, at its operating level and not through the Suggestion Committee, in fact adopted his suggestion by incorporating it physically into the Company’s redesigned cir<a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>cuit breakers and putting it to practical and operational use. This is a meaning which lies outside the suggestion program, although the suggestion itself derived from that program. “Adopted” in the Company’s use of the term would be essential to recovery under the contract theory of count I; “adopted” in the appellant’s use of the term would be essential to recovery under the quasi-contract theory of count II. The word “appropriate” is probably preferable to express the appellant’s meaning, and the second count does indeed use that term.</p>

Plaintiff was told (in the letter, Exhibit C) at the time his first suggestion was rejected that that suggestion would be considered in the future should breaker redesign be undertaken. It further appears from the exhibits that such redesign was undertaken and that the Company applied the appellant’s <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>“same basic idea” in that redesign (Exhibit E to the eomplaint). The appellant has alleged, further, that redesign of the panels in question and the use of this “basic idea” has resulted in savings to the Company. This states a claim upon which, if true, relief can be granted. “A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other.” <em>Restatement of Restitution, </em>§1 (1937). We cannot find on the facts as alleged that it was clear as a matter of law that appellant expected no payment or intended to confer a gratuity, nor in the context of the suggestion program is it clear that the benefit was conferred officiously. We are, in short, unable to conclude that the law would not permit quasi-contractual recovery on the basis of these facts.</p>

We do not find that case to be controlling. We note initially that the appeal in the <em>Thomas </em>case was from an order granting defendant’s motion for judgment on the record. Accordingly, the issue was whether the plaintiff at trial had established a right to recover. The question before us in this case is whether it can be said without doubt that appellant could not establish a basis for recovery if he were allowed to proceed to trial.</p>

In Thomas, this Court held that plaintiff could recover for use of his idea by another only upon proof that the idea was reduced to concrete form and was novel. The plaintiff in <em>Thomas </em>had gratuitously informed the Company by letter that he was persuaded that their cigarette, Camels, was the most economical brand to smoke and that other smokers <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>could substantiate this conclusion by' comparing the time it took for Camels and other cigarettes to burn. He also attached a second letter stating that the Company could reproduce his letter for advertising purposes provided it would “recompensate” him. Roughly four years after receipt of plaintiff’s letter, the Company’s advertisements stressed the slow-burning economical quality of its cigarettes. Thomas then brought suit in assumpsit for the value of his suggestion. At trial there was uncontradicted evidence that the Company had been making comparative burning tests for several years before receipt of appellant’s letter and that the idea contained in appellant’s letter had been previously submitted to the Company. Under these facts this Court found that the “idea” in plaintiff’s letter was neither concrete in form nor novel in nature and that he was not entitled to recovery.</p>
    <p id="b343-4" data-blocks='[["BL_343.5",343,[131,1324,1149,739]]]'>We are unable to see how that holding governs the case before us, at least at this stage. Appellant’s suggestion was set forth in writing in full compliance with the terms of the Company’s suggestion program, and nothing in the complaint, including the exhibits, indicates that the idea was not in fact a novel one. While it might have been better pleading to allege categorically the ultimate fact of novelty, we think the idea is there by necessary inference and by the phrase “valuable idea”, as used in paragraphs 11 and 17. Thus, there is nothing in the complaint as amended which will preclude appellant from demonstrating at trial, if he can, that his idea was indeed both concrete and novel.</p>

When appellant submitted his suggestion on appellee’s form, in accordance with appellee’s procedure, in my view he gave up any claim he might have had to unjust enrichment damages. If appellant is to recover at all, it must be within the limitations of appellee’s procedure for offering suggestions. I do not believe that it is wise to become entangled in metaphysical notions of whether appellee extended an offer or an invitation to deal, and whether appellant thus tendered an acceptance or an offer. In my view it is enough to say that appellant cannot, under these circumstances, recover outside of appellee’s established procedure, a procedure appellant accepted when tendering his suggestion, and thus unjust enrichment in my judgment is not appropriate.</p>
