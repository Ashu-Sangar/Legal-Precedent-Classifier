The two girls were ordered into the interior of the same motor vehicle. The abductors then entered that vehicle and drove to a restaurant, at which time and place Perrine purchased beer, and the parties then proceeded to a place near a railroad siding.</p>

The two men returned approximately one-half hour later. Perrine and Hosack, at gunpoint, then ordered Frick out of the trunk of the motor vehicle, took him with them down the lane and later returned without him.</p>

Two of the men, with the Kreminski girl, then rode in the one motor vehicle, and the other two men, with the Leister girl, rode in the other motor vehicle. At approximately 5:00 a.m. on March 29, 1968, both motor vehicles proceeded to McConnell’s farmhouse, and, shortly after arriving there, Perrine and McConnell departed in the one motor vehicle, leaving at the farmhouse Batley, Hosack, the two girls and Dragan. Dragan, up to that point, had been continuously confined in the trunk of the one motor vehicle but was released from the trunk at that time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> After the departure of Perrine and McConnell, Dragan, who had been tied up and placed in an upstairs bed<a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>room at the farmhouse, managed to untie himself. The fact that Dragan was untied was unknown to Hosack but known to Batley. Without Hosack’s knowledge, Batley then managed to give a knife to Dragan, and, shortly thereafter, Batley left the farmhouse. Dragan and the two girls finally managed to overpower Hosack, ran away from the farmhouse, and notified the Pennsylvania State Police of the incidents. In all, Dragan and the two girls had been with the abductors from approximately 9 :00 p.m. on March 28th until 10:00 a.m. on March 29th.</p>

The search continued until approximately 9:30 p.m. on March 29th, and, during the course of the search, the girls accompanied the police, endeavoring to point out various points and locations which they recalled during the time they were in the custody of their abductors. On March 29th, at approximately 9:20 p.m., Batley, accompanied by his mother and his girl friend’s mother, appeared at the Mercer substation of the Pennsylvania State Police and gave himself up. He was removed from the presence of his mother and his girl friend’s mother, taken into an office in the substation, and, in the presence of four State Policemen and before any questioning, he was given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The police handed Batley a card containing the warnings, then asked each of the questions of Batley, to which <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>Batley responded. After Batley had been given these warnings and upon his indication that he was aware of his constitutional rights and did not want counsel, questioning then began.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Shortly after the questioning began, Batley told the police that Perrine and Hosack had taken Frick up “Skunk Lane,” located near a house owned by a family named Bestwick and that, when Perrine and Hosack returned, they said that they had shot Frick. At that point the questioning ceased, and the police officers, accompanied by Batley, went to the area indicated, followed footprints up the lane, noticed a spot where there had been recent digging and found Frick’s body lying in a grave two feet deep. Batley was then returned to the substation, again orally given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to which he responded, and then Batley made a statement which was tape recorded.</p>

When arraigned, Batley and the three other men pleaded guilty to two counts of rape, to armed robbery and to murder generally. A three-judge court then sat, accepted Batley’s pleas, entered into a hearing, and, after hearing, Batley was <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>found guilty of murder in the first degree, of rape and armed robbery. Batley was sentenced on the murder conviction to life imprisonment, to two 10 to 20-year terms on the rape conviction, said terms to run consecutively, and to a 5 to 10-year sentence on the armed robbery conviction, that sentence to run concurrently rather than consecutively. From the judgment of sentence to life imprisonment on the murder conviction, the instant appeal has been taken.</p>

(2) Were the statements obtained from Batley secured in violation of his constitutional rights?

The plea of guilty was entered voluntarily and intelligently by Batley, who at that time and for some time prior thereto was represented by counsel. The sole argument in support of Batley’s right to withdraw his plea is that the Commonwealth utilized Batley’s direction as to the location of Frick’s body, that such direction arose from an illegally-obtained statement and, hence, the plea was induced by tainted evidence. We have previously determined that Batley’s statement was not illegally obtained. The instant record reveals no evidence nor even any inference that Batley, at the time he entered his plea, was induced or influenced to do so by any tainted evidence.

    <p id="b441-3" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[140,522,1152,1670]]]'>The concatenation of events which transpired points unequivocally to a common design on the part of Batley and his three companions to engage in, at least, robbery and rape. Batley, <em>armed </em>with a gun which he termed “Old Faithful,” joined by three <em>armed </em>companions, held up and robbed Frick and Dragan of the contents of their wallets, forced the two girls into McConnell’s rented vehicle and imprisoned the two young men in the trunk of that vehicle. Batley then proceeded to the point near the railroad crossing with his companions and participated in the ravishment of the two girls. While the evidence does not indicate that Batley broke into and entered the tool shed and stole therefrom the shovels, the evidence is that he remained in the motor vehicle while the burglary took place, obviously to aid in preventing the escape of the two girls. While the evidence does not indicate that Batley actually took part in the digging of Frick’s grave and the actual shooting of Frick—in fact, he was then engaged in again ravishing one of the girls—the record indicates that he knew what his companions were doing and neither remonstrated with them nor attempted to withdraw and disassociate himself from the venture. Not until approximately an hour later, when he and McConnell went up the road—obviously to prepare the same fate for Dragan as that which befell Frick—did Batley “chicken out” and refuse to do away with Dragan. Throughout all the hours and events of March 28th and March 29th until after Frick’s killing, Batley remained armed and a partner in the venture.</p>

    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[202,782,1148,1015]]]'>The record supports the existence of a criminal conspiracy on the part of Batley and his companions to commit robbery and rape. Proof of the existence of such a conspiracy may be inferentially established by proof of the relation, conduct or circumstances of the parties and the acts of the parties may demonstrate a concerted action pursuant to a common design to accomplish a common purpose. See: <em>Commonwealth v. Neff, </em><a href="/pa/407/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="407 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1307413" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0001-01">407 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="179 A.2d 630">179 A. 2d 630</a> (1962). The instant circumstances reveal the existence of a concerted purpose on the part of these four armed men to commit, at least, the felonies of robbery and rape. The argument that the felonies committed had no connection with the killing of Frick or were too remote in time is definitely refuted by the evidence of record. Frick was killed by one or more of Batley’s fellow conspirators, and for that killing Batley was properly found guilty of first-degree murder under the felony-murder statute.</p>
