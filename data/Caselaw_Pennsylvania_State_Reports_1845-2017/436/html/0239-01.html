Thereafter, real estate was acquired in the name of Pilgrim Holiness Church of Athens Township, Inc., upon which a church was constructed and wherein its members continued to worship throughout the years.</p>
    <p id="b290-9" data-blocks='[["BL_290.12",290,[196,1476,1146,596]]]'>In the Articles of Incorporation, the purposes of the Athens Church corporation were set forth as follows: “3. The purposes for which the corporation is formed is to support and maintain the worship of God as a congregation of the Pilgrim Holiness Church believers associated by covenants in the faith and fellowship of the gospel; observing the ordinances of Christ; governed by His laws; and exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by His word, according to the tenets and doctrine of the Pilgrim Holiness Church of Indianapolis, Indiana.”</p>

In June, 1967, Indianapolis Church voted to merge with the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Ameri<a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>ca in the International Conference. A majority of the members of the congregation of Athens Church opposed this merger and as a result the members of the Athens Church corporation passed a resolution on October 14, 1967, expressing their wish and intention to dissolve their affiliation with Indianapolis Church and to become affiliated with the Pilgrim Holiness Church of New York. To legally effectuate this new affiliation, Paragraph 18 of the Bylaws of the corporation was amended to read as follows: “18. This Corporation is, and is intended to be, the arm of the Church Congregation of the Pilgrim Holiness Church of Sayre, Pennsylvania, and shall do no act or thing contrary to the will of such Church Congregation. It is further an affiliated member of the Pilgrim Holiness Church of New York, Inc.”</p>
    <p id="b291-3" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[155,1293,1151,870]]]'>When the pastor of Athens Church and some of its members proceeded to follow through with this new affiliation, representatives of Indianapolis Church attempted to take possession and physical control of the Athens Church property. When these efforts were successfully resisted, this action in equity was instituted by the Indianapolis Church corporation<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to gain possession and control. The named defendants were Athens Church, the pastor and the Board of Trustees. After the pleadings were closed, the court below entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the plaintiffs and filed a decree directing the defendants to “deliver” all of the Athens Church property to Indianapolis Church and its members and to execute any documents necessary to effectuate this transfer. The defendants appealed.</p>

(1) Prelatical, which includes the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox Churches in which each subordinate unit is controlled by an ascending order of individual dignitaries; (2) Denominational, which is typified by the ecclesiastical government of the Presbyterian Church, in which there are in regular succession, the Presbytery over the session or local church, The Synod over the Presbytery, and the General Assembly over all; and (3) Congregational, which includes, inter alia, the Baptists and the Churches of God, in which the prevailing rule is complete autonomy and independence of denominational authority in the local congregation.
