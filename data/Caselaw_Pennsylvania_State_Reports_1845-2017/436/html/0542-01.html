Nevertheless, <em>Jackson’s </em>insistence on a “clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession” must be satisfied. We must find that the trier of fact has “fac[ed] the issue squarely.” <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">378 U.S. at 390</a>, <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">84 S.

For example, the Commonwealth’s witnesses testified to a somewhat leisurely interrogation and stated that the confessions were completely voluntary; appellant testified that he was questioned for two days, got little sleep, was placed in a very uncomfortable cell, and did not remember what he said or did during those two days (he made numerous contradictory confessions). Further, as the trial judge noted in his opinion, appellant is a borderline case between sanity and insanity, and the Commonwealth’s experts all agreed that appellant lacks the ability to stand pressure, is wholly impulsive, and is given to self-pity. Under these circumstances, we cannot now possibly determine—from a cold record without any finding as to voluntariness—whether appellant’s “will ha[d] been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.” <em>Culombe v. Connecticut, </em><a href="/us/367/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="367 U.S. 568" data-case-ids="1785545" data-case-paths="/us/367/0568-01">367 U.S. 568</a>, 602, <a href="/us/367/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="367 U.S. 568" data-case-ids="1785545" data-case-paths="/us/367/0568-01">81 S.

    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[190,1574,1146,480]]]'>There remains one further consideration. The Commonwealth urges, and the hearing court so found, that appellant’s trial counsel did not bring to the trial court’s attention their desire to object to these confessions on the ground of involuntariness. Clearly, appellant would not now be entitled to relief if counsel had made a choice to not attack the voluntariness of the confessions. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Smart v.

True, appellant’s counsel did not object to every statement, oral and written, which was introduced. He did, however, object specifically to the introduction of several written statements, and his cross-examination of the Commonwealth’s witnesses evidences counsel’s desire to test the <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>voluntariness of all the confessions. In fact, when he specifically noted, near the beginning of the trial, his objections to the confessions on the ground of involuntariness, the trial court held that the statements were admissions, not confessions, and hence admissible. We do not exalt form over substance, and we do not require counsel to make constant and repetitive objections where, as here, the tainted evidence constituted the bulk of the hearing. We do require that the issues be called to the trial court’s attention. That requirement has been met here. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Fox v.

As to the problem of his indigency, no one contends that, in 1946, he was told of his right to free appellate counsel. The Commonwealth does contend, however, that appellant was not indigent and, therefore, did not forego an appeal because he could not pay for counsel. But there is absolutely no proof that he could afford appellate counsel. At best, the Commonwealth has shown that appellant had a very small amount of money. The Commonwealth has not shown that this money was sufficient to have retained appellate counsel, nor may we speculate that it was. “Indigency,” in the context of <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>

Further, when defense counsel objected to the introduction of a statement, on the basis that he wished to interrogate witnesses as to how the statement was obtained, the judge ruled that this objection applied only to confessions, not admissions. At only one time did the trial judge make any reference to voluntariness when ruling on admissibility. But this ruling was a bare statement that the confession was voluntary, and it hardly fulfills the <em>Jaclcson </em>requirement. The trial court did not give any reasons for finding the statement voluntary, either in the record or in its opinion, and this finding was made before appellant’s testimony, or the testimony of any of the psychiatrists was even heard. Thus the record as a whole would appear to indicate that the hearing court never did consider squarely the question of voluntariness, as opposed to truthfulness.</p>

This contention is without merit. All but one of appellant’s collateral attack proceedings were commenced before <em>Douglas </em>was decided. Thus, they could not operate to waive his claim. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Berkery v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/429/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="429 Pa. 378" data-case-ids="1913524" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0378-01">429 Pa. 378</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20805" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="239 A.2d 805">239 A. 2d 805</a> (1968) ; <em>Commonwealth v. Stevens, </em><a href="/pa/429/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="429 Pa. 593" data-case-ids="1913468" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0593-01">429 Pa. 593</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=240%20A.2d%20536" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="240 A.2d 536">240 A. 2d 536</a> (1968). The only collateral attack pursued after <em>Douglas </em>was done without counsel. Again, we have “made it quite clear that waiver may be <em>presumed </em>only where the petitioner had counsel at the time the waiver allegedly occurred.” <em>Commonwealth v. Mumford, </em><a href="/pa/430/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="430 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1915778" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0451-01">430 Pa. 451</a>, 455, <a href="/citations/?q=243%20A.2d%20440" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="243 A.2d 440">243 A. 2d 440</a>, 442 (1968). The Commonwealth could, of course, prove intentional waiver in the <em>post-Douglas </em>proceeding, but this it has not done. Further, although the Commonwealth does not suggest that appellant waived his right to <em>Jaclcson-Denno </em>relief, we might note that the reasons for finding no waiver of his <em>Douglas </em>claim apply with equal force to his <em>Jackson-Denno </em>claim, <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>not having been decided until 1964.</p>
