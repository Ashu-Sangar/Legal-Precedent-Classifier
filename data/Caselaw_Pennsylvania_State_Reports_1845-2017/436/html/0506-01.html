The accident took place on Route 18, <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>a paved two-lane highway running north and south, at a place south of the Borough of Greenville, Pennsylvania. The accident happened at approximately 9:00 P.M. The weather was cold and clear, the surface of the road was slippery, icy and slushy. The McElhinnys were returning from a hunting trip, proceeding <em>south </em>on Route 18. They intended to turn left into a lane but had apparently stopped, to wait until a northbound car had passed them in the opposite lane. It is a matter of some dispute whether or not their <em>"brake and turnsignals </em>were on. Defendant’s car was also proceeding <em>southward </em>on Route 18, some distance behind the McElhinny car. Defendant’s car struck the rear end of the McElhinny car, causing substantial damage to both cars and injuring both Francis and Vincent McElhinny.</p>

Defendant obtained a severance of the plaintiffs’ claims and filed a complaint joining Vincent McElhinny (the driver of the McElhinny car) as an additional defendant in the action brought by Francis McElhinny (the passenger in the McElhinny car), alleging that the collision was due to the negligence of Vincent McElhinny <em>in stopping without </em>lights, <em>without </em>turnsignals, and failing to keep a proper watch on traffic approaching from the rear.</p>
