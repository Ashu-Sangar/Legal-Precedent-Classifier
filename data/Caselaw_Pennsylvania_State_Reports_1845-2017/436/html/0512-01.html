Loutzenhiser, a single man 72 years old, was the owner of approximately <em>8y2 </em>acres of land in Hempfield Township, upon which were erected four finished houses and a fifth house which was partially completed. Appellant had leased three of the finished houses to various tenants and relied partially upon the rent therefrom for his subsistence. In the spring of 1966, appellant contacted Robert F. Banks, an attorney, and told him that he wanted to transfer his real estate to Amy Doddo,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> his niece, and to John Loutzenhiser,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">**</a> his nephew. Amy was to be deeded three finished houses and John was to receive one finished house and the house under construction.</p>

      <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>In September 1966, Amy and her husband gave up their home in Transfer, Mercer County, Pennsylvania, and moved into the main house on appellant’s property on Donation Eoad, Hempfield Township. Appellant moved into a cottage on the same property, with the expectation of moving into the partially constructed house when it was completed. The main house was in run-down condition and Amy and her husband renovated it, and paid the expenses of renovation.</p>

At the suggestion of Banks, a conference was held ivith all the interested parties for the purpose of effecting delivery of the deeds. At this conference, it was discovered that the name of John’s wife was incorrectly stated in one of the deeds, and therefore it was necessary to retype the deed. During the conference, <em>Banks explained to appellant </em>that the conveyances to his niece and nephew must be <em>without “any strings attached ” </em>if he was to accomplish his purpose of avoiding estate and inheritance taxes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a>
      <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>Banks suggested that appellant pay rent to John, for the privilege of occupying a portion of the property being conveyed to John, in order to insure that the transferred property would not be included in appellant’s estate for tax purposes. Appellant agreed to pay John $24 a month for rent. Banks also suggested, and <em>the parties agreed, that the grantees (donees) pay all recording costs, transfer taxes and attorney’s fees in connection with the conveyances.</em>

Banks then recorded these deeds in the Recorder’s Office of Mercer County.</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.6",566,[187,1193,1148,802]]]'>Appellant testified that he transferred the property to his niece Amy and his nephew John upon the condition that they “come across with something.” Accordingly, on <em>January 1%, 1967, </em>appellant demanded that John and Amy (and her husband) pay him rent for the houses on the property which he had conveyed to them. Both Amy and John complied. In February, appellant again demanded the monthly rents, plus an additional $600 for the purpose of completing the partially constructed house—his future residence. The parties were unable to arrive at an agreement concerning the money. John reconveyed to appellant the property which was recorded in John’s name. Amy and her husband refused to reconvey or to pay any more rent; hence this suit.</p>
