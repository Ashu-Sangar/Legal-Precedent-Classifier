Although he was in financial difficulties and his quarters were small, Dwyer permitted the appellant and his female companion to stay with him and his wife Monday night. The following day Dwyer located a place for them to stay with a friend of his, and helped them move to the friend’s apartment. He did not see appellant again until 12:30 a.m. on Friday following the evening during which the burglary was committed. When appellant and his female companion arrived at Dwyer’s home early Friday morning, appellant was carrying a suitcase, a radio, an iron and an electric clock. Immediately upon arriving, appellant stated to Dwyer, “I think we hit the jackpot.” The witness and appellant then proceeded to examine the contents of the suitcase; it contained money, jewelry and securities which had been stolen in the burglary. Appellant gave Dwyer $300.00 of the stolen money and left with him all of the jewelry. From the door of his home, the <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>witness watched appellant dispose of the suitcase and the strongbox which had contained the securities, after which they congenially drank beer together.</p>

Defendant’s requested points were in part erroneous, since they would have taken from the jury the question of whether Dwyer was an accomplice. That error was not adverted to by the trial court, however, and, as noted above, the court’s refusal to give the requested points was based on its erroneous conclusion that Dwyer could not be found an accomplice under the facts presented.</p>

There, the point refused was said to be too broad in that it requested the jury to consider any Commonwealth witness whom they found to have been an accomplice as a “self-confessed criminal.” The Superior Court, in upholding the refusal of this requested point, stated (at 276-7) : “The charge of the court and the answers to .other points . . . were such as to leave no doubt in the minds of the jury as to the caution, careful scrutiny and critical examination which should be given by them in considering the testimony of <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>accomplices, and the corrupt source from which it came. <em>The court is only required to answer the points as submitted. It is not its duty to remold them; and when the law has been correctly stated in the charge and answers to the points presented, the defendant has no just cause for complaint.’’ </em>(Emphasis supplied) The implication of this holding is that a party whose requested point, although erroneous, alerts the trial judge to an important issue in the case, does have just cause for complaint if the law to which that point pertains is not otherwise correctly stated in the charge.</p>

Shupshinskas testified that the defendant entered his cafe around 11:00 or 11:30 with <em>“a large </em>suitcase.” Shupshinskas then testified that he called a cab for the defendant, at his request, and defendant <em>left the cafe with the suitcase.</em>

Dwyer’s wife had met defendant the night before while baby-sitting. Although he was in financial difficulties and his quarters were small, Dwyer permitted defendant and his female companion (whom he called his wife) to stay with him and his wife Monday night. The following day Dwyer located a place for them to stay with a friend of his, and helped them move to the friend’s apartment. He did not see defendant again until 12:30 A.M. on Friday morning following the evening during which the burglary was committed. When defendant and his female companion arrived at Dwyer’s home early Friday morning, defendant was carrying a suitcase, a radio wrapped in a towel, an iron and an electric clock. Immediately upon arriving, defendant said to Dwyer, “I think we hit the jackpot.” Dwyer and defendant then proceeded to examine the contents of the suitcase; it contained money, jewelry and securities which had been stolen in the burglary. Defendant gave Dwyer $300 of the stolen money and left with him all of the jewelry. <em>Dwyer admitted he had been previously convicted of robbery and larceny. </em>Although Dwyer testified that he had originally refused to take the money, he quickly changed his mind and accepted it and used it to pay off some of his obligations. From the door of his home, Dwyer watched defendant throw the suitcase and the strongbox (both of which were Miss Fisher’s) which <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>had contained the securities into an empty railroad boxcar across the street, after which they congenially drank beer together. Dwyer further testified that defendant came to see him next day and told him he had to get out of town, so Dwyer drove him to several places to find a motel where defendant and his alleged wife could spend the night in order to aid defendant’s escape.</p>

She testified that defendant entered with a “suitcase ... a radio and an iron and binoculars.” Defendant and his (alleged) wife then opened the suitcase in the presence of both Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer. Mrs. Dwyer further testified: “Q. And did you see the Defendant open up the suitcase? A. Yes. Q. And were the contents examined in your presence? A. Yes. Q. Now, did you see any name on any of the bonds and other papers in the suitcase? A. There was one bond that I seen that had <em>Miss Harriet or Franh Fisher.” </em>She also saw a woman’s watch, which was later identified as Miss Fisher’s, and there were a lot of other things, such as papers, bonds and jewelry. <em>When defendant left, she watched him go across the street and throw this suitcase and a strongbox into a raib~oad boxcar, </em>which was right across the street. Defendant put the jewelry on a television set, where it remained until the next night when the police came, and she gave the jewelry to the police.

      <em>Dwyer’s testimony and his admissions both as to his prior criminal record </em>and his assistance to the defendant before and after defendant’s burglary and larceny, as well as his participation with defendant in the fruits of the crime, clearly showed the jury—without any admonition from the Court—(1) the kind of a man he was and (2) that his testimony must be carefully scrutinized<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">**</a> and accepted with caution.

It is crystal clear that the Court’s failure under the facts and testimony in this case to instruct the jury as to the caution <em>to be given Dwyer’s </em>testimony—especially when not requested to do so by <em>defendant—did not amount to basic and fundamental error or deprive this guilty defendant of Justice.</em>
