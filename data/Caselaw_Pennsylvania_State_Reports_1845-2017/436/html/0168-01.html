L. , 43 P.S. §217.1 et seq. (Supp. 1969). Under the authority of this statute the City of Washington entered into negotiations with its policemen. It soon became apparent that no voluntary agreement could be reached and that the parties would have to invoke the arbitration provisions of the aforementioned statute. Arbitration was entered into, hearings were held, and an award was given on December 11, 1968. There were no procedural irregularities in the arbitration process, but the city challenged that portion of the award which required that it provide, “at its sole expense, hospitalization coverage for the members of the family of each member of the Police Department of the City of Washington, equal to the coverage now provided . . . for the member himself.” The city has at all times contended that it would be illegal for it to make such payments.</p>

The city filed exceptions to the trial court’s opinion, appealed its decision, and concurrently petitioned this Court to allow an appeal under Rule 68% directly from the arbitration award.</p>

An arbitration panel is neither a court nor an administrative agency.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The inherent differences between an ar<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>bitration panel on the one hand, and courts and administrative agencies on the other, well explain the logic behind the distinction. An arbitration panel is a temporary “one shot” institution, convened to respond to a specific conflict. Once it reaches a decision it is disbanded and its members disperse. Its resolution of the dispute must be sure and swift, and much of its effectiveness would be lost if the mandate of its decision could be delayed indefinitely through protracted litigation.</p>
    <p id="b223-3" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[168,938,1151,808]]]'>We have concluded therefore that the city did not have the right to appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> However, the city’s rights under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions, and specifically its right to due process, are not harmed thereby. Neither constitution requires that there be a right of appeal from an arbitration award. Every decision-making (tribunal is required to conduct its affairs in accordance with the mandates of due process, and we will not indulge in the presumption that the likelihood of a due process or other constitutional violation is significantly greater in a tribunal such as an arbitration panel than it is in an appellate court. In addition, the procedure under Rule 68% of this Court is a perfectly adequate mechanism for the protection of constitutional rights.</p>

No adjudicatory body has unlimited discretion. At the very least, each and every adjudicator is bound by the Constitution of the United States; and most are bound by even tighter strictures. The restrictions may go to the nature of the controversies which they can decide, the parties who may appear before them, the type of relief they may grant, or any other element in the adjudicatory process.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In the instant case the adjudicatory <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>power is an arbitration panel.

If they were, and if the panel went beyond the limits of its authority, then it committed an excess in the exercise of power and the tainted portions of its mandate may be reviewed and corrected.</p>

    <p id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[191,1200,1146,849]]]'>Our task is to give content to the phrase “acting in accordance with law.” Our difficulty is that it must be interpreted in the context of a statute and constitutional provision which explicitly provide that an arbitration award serves as an affirmative mandate to the administrative and legislative branches of the public employer.

We reach this result by quite frankly reading into the enabling legisla<a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>tion the requirement that the scope of the submission to the arbitrators be limited to conflicts over legitimate terms and conditions of employment. Were this not so, virtually any issue could be submitted to the arbitrators under the guise of a labor conflict. Further, we fully realize that there will be issues that would be fully legitimate in the context of a private sector labor dispute which will not be legitimate in the context of a public sector labor dispute. Public employers are in many respects more limited in what they may do visa-vis their employees, and those limitations must be maintained. The essence of our decision is that an arbitration award may only require a public employer to do that which it could do voluntarily. We emphasize that this does <em>not </em>mean that a public employer may hide behind self-imposed legal restrictions. An arbitration award which deals only with proper terms and conditions of employment serves as a mandate to the legislative branch of the public employer, and if the terms of the award require affirmative action on the part of the Legislature, they must take such action, if it is within their power to do so.</p>

The statute which is most relevant is the Act of May 22, 1933, P. L. 927, 53 P.S. §37403-53. It is there provided that a third class city may “make contracts of insurance . . . insuring its elected or appointed officers, officials and employees, or any class or classes thereof, under a policy or policies of group insurance covering . . . hospitalization.” The city ar<a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>gues that this statute prevents them from paying hospitalization insurance premiums for anyone who is not actually an employee of the city.

The first is the Act of November 27, 1967, P.

The second is the Optional Third Class City Charter Law, Act of July 15, 1957, P. L. 901, 53 P.S. §41404 et seq. (Supp. 1969), which provides an optional form of government for cities of the third class and gives those cities who exercise the option a much broader range of power. See Act of July 15,1957, P. L. 901, 53 P.S. §§41301-41305 (Supp. 1969). Although it may be argued that both of these enactments demonstrate the absence of a clear legislative policy favoring the proscription, neither is of sufficient force to imply a legislative abandonment of that enactment. The first mentioned piece of legislation was a narrow response to the specific problems encountered by a city stepping into a pre-existing employment relationship. The sec<a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>ond statute is by its very terms intended to provide an alternative method of governing a third class city, and can be utilized only after the residents have voted to abandon their old form of government and adopt this one in its stead.</p>

In that case the Secretary of Banking refused to issue Articles of Merger on the ground that the proposed combination would result in “overbanking” in the affected area. The statute provided that the secretary’s decision was unreviewable. The secretary had jurisdiction over controversies of the type involved and due process had not been violated.
