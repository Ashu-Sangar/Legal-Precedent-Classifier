In the third paragraph of his will, he provided: “Third: I give, devise and bequeath, <em>my </em>interest<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> in the building located at 135-137 West Grant Avenue, Duquesne, Pennsylvania, <em>said interest being a one-half interest, </em>unto Louis Enough.”</p>

He was made a co-executor and was appointed to supervise the collection of rents and the maintenance of testator’s real estate. Moreover, in the second paragraph of testator’s will, he gave a one-half interest to Enough in his real estate and insurance business. The second paragraph provides: “Second: I give, devise and bequeath, my real estate and insurance business, known as, Burstin Realty, situate 137 West Grant Avenue, Duquesne, Pennsylvania, together with all office equipment, unto the following persons, <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>

    <p id="b215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[172,565,1150,652]]]'>The thirteenth paragraph of testator’s will provided : “Thirteenth: A charitable trust is to be created and known as, ‘The Albert Burstin Charities’. The funds of said trust are to consist of the income from all my other properties (excluding, of course, property at 135-137 West Grant Avenue, Duquesne, which I have bequeath [sic] to Louis Keough, and also excluding the other properties specifically bequeathed) . . . .” He then directed that the income therefrom— and later the principal—should be paid to the American Bed Cross, the Pennsylvania Association for the Blind, and United Jewish Appeal.</p>
    <p id="b215-5" data-blocks='[["BL_215.6",215,[168,1231,1150,427]]]'>When he executed his will on February 6,1960, Burstin owned a one-half interest in the property at 135-137 West Grant Avenue. However, on September 6, 1961, testator acquired from his brother title to the other one-half interest in the said real estate. At his death, Burstin owned this property in fee simple but never changed his will during the five years in which he owned the entire property.</p>
    <p id="b215-6" data-blocks='[["BL_215.7",215,[167,1672,1148,318]]]'>At the audit of the executor’s account, Keough claimed the entire West Grant Avenue property.

      <em>“In the absence of a contrary intent appearing therem, </em>wills shall be construed as to real and personal estate in accordance with the following rules:</p>
