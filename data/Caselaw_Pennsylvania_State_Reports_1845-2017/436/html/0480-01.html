(Exton) filed a complaint in assumpsit against The Home Indemnity Co. (Home) seeking damages under a performance bond in which Home and W. Arnold Blythe (Blythe) had bound themselves jointly and severally to Exton in the sum of $52,000. The bond was conditioned on the full and prompt per<a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>formance by Blytbe of a contract between him and Ex-ton for the grading and paving of a site for an outdoor motion picture theater. Exton alleged that this contract had not been fully and promptly performed and claimed damages in the amount of $42,500, being the profits allegedly lost because of delay in performance plus the estimated cost of remedying the defects in performance. Because the bond was a joint undertaking of Blythe as principal and Home as surety, Home impleaded Blythe as an additional defendant asserting joint and several liability. In his answer to the third party complaint, Blythe denied that he had breached the contract and brought a counterclaim against Exton for the unpaid balance of the contract price and for payment for certain additional work he had performed, allegedly at the request of Exton.</p>

This provision as to timely performance gave Blythe notice that a delay in completion of the contract would delay the opening of the theater and result in losses for Exton. Losses caused by Blythe’s failure to make timely performance were accordingly foreseeable. The <em>Restatement of Contracts, </em>§346 (1932) provides as follows: “(1) For a breach by one who has contracted to construct a specified product, the other party can get judgment for compensatory damages for all unavoidable harm that the builder had reason to foresee when the contract was made, less such part of the contract price as has not been paid and is not still payable, determined as follows ... (b) For any delay in completion fairly chargeable to the builder, the plaintiff can get judgment for the value of the use of the product, if it was being constructed for use.” We believe this rule is proper and sound.

Caught between adverse site conditions due to frequent rains and Exton’s officer who admitted, “I was rushing Blythe, yes,” Blythe sought to finish the job on time and went ahead with the grading and paving even though the soil conditions were bad. The evidence shows that the grading and paving were within a close tolerance of the contractual specifications. It also shows that the paving was impervious to water except where it had broken up. The evidence as to the causes of this deterioration is not clear, but adverse soil conditions at the time of paving and subsequent use of the theater area seem to have been the prime causal factors. The observations of Exton’s nonexpert theater employees as to the quantity of materials used constitute the only evidence in support of Exton’s claim that Blythe failed to use the required minimum quantities of materials. This testimony lacks probative value, and Avas, moreover, contradicted by substantiated testimony that ade<a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>quate quantities of materials were used.

In order to recover such damages, however, it had the burden of proving them. Exton’s only proof of damages due to faulty workmanship was an estimate of repair costs prepared by another contractor as a unit price approximation; this estimate was made prior to some of Blythe’s own repair work. Although the estimated cost of repair amounted to between one-third and one-half of the original contract price, Exton never considered the defects serious enough to contract for any portion of this repair work during the four-year period between the commencement of this suit and the trial. This estimate was not a sufficient basis for the award of damages to Exton. We hold, therefore, that the trial court correctly decided against Exton on the original complaint and for Blythe on its counterclaim for the balance of the contract, price.</p>

Exton, however, waived this requirement by its failure to employ an architect to supervise the performance of the work. Further, the evidence supports Blythe’s contention that Exton’s on-site representative requested that he do the extra work and that this work benefited Ex-ton. The trial court did not err in awarding the cost of this work to Blythe. See <em>Universal Builders, Inc. v.

The action was tried in the court below, without a jury on May 3, 4, 6 and 9, 1960. On July 29, 1966 appellee, W. Arnold Blythe, instituted an action in mandamus to compel a decision by the trial judge. Considering the great delay that had already occurred, the filing of that action made it impossible for the trial judge to fulfill properly his functions. That is, through the institution of that action, he was no longer an independent, disinterested trier of fact, but rather a litigant himself. The filing of the action may have prejudiced him against the party pursuing that course. The refusal of that party to press that action may have created a bias in favor of that party. It does not matter what the judge’s decision <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>ultimately was. The important thing is that he was placed in a position in which it would have been impossible to exercise his powers of judgment free of any interest in the matter. Therefore, I dissent.</p>

The primary responsibility for this task is placed on the trier of fact. It is argued, and I think correctly, that having heard the testimony and seen the witnesses the trier of fact is in the best position to weigh the probative value of the evidence. In accordance with this belief we accord such findings great weight and are reluctant to reach different conclusions on the basis of cold records.</p>
    <p id="b543-6" data-blocks='[["BL_543.8",543,[125,1622,1152,700]]]'>I think it clear that appellant was denied its right to have its evidence received and judged in this kind of a proceeding. It is impossible that the trier of fact— here the trial judge—could have remembered very much if anything of the evidence offered at trial. His decision was in effect rendered on a cold record. I would analogize the situation in this case to those instances in which a trier of fact dies after the conclusion of the trial and before rendition of a decision. In those cases it is required that the case be retried, even though a complete record of the trial may exist. <em>Carlsson v.
