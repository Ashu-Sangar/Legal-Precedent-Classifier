Each of the defendants was separately tried. Each was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. Chapasco was convicted by a jury on June 13, 1951; in rendering its verdict the jury fixed the sentence at life imprisonment and recommended that parole should never be considered.

They were requested to withdraw from the shadows by the owner of the store, whereupon each pulled his gun, forcing the owner and two other men to line up with their hands against the back of the store. One of the gunmen struck David Sklar, the decedent on the head causing him to fall. The same gunman apparently pulled the trigger of his pistol, which misfired. Thereupon the second gunman shot and killed Sklar. The two gunmen then ran <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>Ground the building to a waiting automobile which, with two passengers, sped toward Philadelphia. One of the three men who was held up behind the store was one Allen Ostroff, who at trial, said that he had a close view of the defendant and identified Chapasco as one of the gunmen. Some hours after the crime, a pistol was found near the site where the gunmen entered the automobile. The cartridge clip in the pistol was found to have a thumbprint, which thumbprint was identified at trial as being that of Chapasco. The second gun said to have been involved was later discovered in the home of Chapasco, and a ballistics expert, testifying on behalf of the Commonwealth, stated that the fatal bullet was discharged by the gun so found. After surveillance by the police for a period of time, Chapasco and Pearson were taken into custody by the police for questioning. Pearson made a lengthy written statement describing the events preceding the killing, the killing itself, and the activities of Pearson and Chapasco following the shooting. The confession states that he was the gunman who killed Sklar, that Chapasco was the other gunman and that Chapasco had pulled the trigger of his pistol, which had misfired. He then described in his statement how he and Chapasco went ‘up state’ and proceeded to burn the wallets which they had taken during the holdup, and then proceeded to take a hotel room in Reading, Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth’s witnesses testified that Pearson’s statement was read by Chapasco and also read aloud to him by the Assistant District Attorney. Following this, and after conferring with the District Attorney, Chapasco made a brief written statement in which he confirmed all of the acts set forth in the statement of Pearson. . . •</p>

L. 1621, §1, 18 P.S. §4701, the Commonwealth was permitted to introduce evidence of a defendant’s prior criminal record during its case-in-chief against a defendant on trial for murder. This procedure was sanctioned by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v.

Under the so-called Parker rule, prior conviction evidence was not to be considered by the jury either in its determination of the fact of guilt or the degree of guilt. Rather, this evidence of a defendant’s past record was admitted only “for the purpose of showing the jury the manner of man he was to aid it in fixing the penalty” in the event he was found guilty of first-degree murder. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Sprangle v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/423/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="423 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="1903157" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0589-01">423 Pa. 589</a>, 593, <a href="/citations/?q=225%20A.2d%20236" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="225 A.2d 236">225 A. 2d 236</a> (1967).

Even with careful instructions from the trial court, allowance of such evidence may lead to a confusion of issues. Jurors may be over-persuaded by evidence of past criminal conduct, prejudge a defendant with a bad general record, and deny him a fair opportunity to acquit himself of a particular offense. Indeed, Judge Biggs has called the jurors’ need to put knowledge of a defendant’s extensive record out of mind while considering his guilt or innocence “a feat of psychological wizardry [which] verges on the impossible even for berobed judges.” <em>United States ex rel.

At trial the Commonwealth offered no direct evidence of defendant’s guilt) only a confession and certain statements by the defendant (both allegedly the result of coercion) connected the defendant with the crime. Moreover, the prior conviction evidence was admitted over objection, even though the prosecuting District Attorney did not press for the death penalty at any point in the proceedings and even though the foreman of the ju y had stated during the voir dire examination that he would not return a penalty of death.

The decisions of these half dozen cases have considered significant three separate, although not totally unrelated, factors in weighing the possible prejudice engendered by adherence to the Parker rule procedure. No one factor is decisive; no single element is the touchstone of decision. The likelihood of prejudice must be measured in the light of these factors taken together.</p>
    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.6",204,[197,1101,1146,586]]]'>The first factor is the number and nature of the offenses disclosed in defendant’s prior criminal record, and particularly the relationship between those crimes and the circumstances of the murder with which he is charged. The attention paid to this facet reflects judicial concern that either a marked similarity between the defendant’s past crimes and the circumstances surrounding the crime presently charged or a record replete with prior misdeeds will influence the jury on the issue of defendant’s guilt despite any contrary admonition of the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.7",204,[201,1708,1146,482]],["BL_205.1",205,[174,396,1147,433]]]'>Thus, in <em>Seoleri, </em>the Commonwealth presented evidence of twenty-five prior charges of armed robbery against a defendant accused of committing a murder in the course of an armed robbery. The Court labeled this evidence “gravely prejudicial” and granted Seoleri’s petition for habeas corpus. In <em>Lowry, </em>the relator’s prior criminal record concerned mostly larceny of motor vehicles, as distinguished from armed robbery, but the court lumped these crimes together as efforts <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>by tbe accused to obtain property without working for it legitimately. Judge Freedman, in deciding “whether in all the circumstances of the particular cage it can be said that defendant may have been seriously prejudiced by introduction of his prior criminal record”, pointed out that the “nature as well as number of prior convictions” represents an element to be considered in estimating the prejudice involved.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[175,840,1149,1143]]]'>On the other hand, the court in <em>Marino, supra, </em>at p. 455, considered the relator’s prior crimes, although also against the person, as “not strikingly common or significantly similar” to the situation involving the murder of his teenaged daughter’s alleged seducer and refused to grant Marino’s habeas corpus petition. Relator’s criminal record in <em>Gist, supra, </em>involved conviction only for carrying a concealed deadly weapon, a minor crime which the court regarded as having no prejudicial relationship to the murder charge at trial. <em>Bucher, supra, </em>however, fails to fit this pattern. Even though relator’s prior criminal record of voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault seemingly bore substantial similarity to his murder charge, the court rejected the argument that the introduction of Rucker’s past offenses may have unfairly influenced the jury. The result in <em>Bucher, supra, </em>confirms the need to look not only to this one element but rather to the “critical intersection and cumulative effect,” of all the factors involved in a particular case. <em>Marino, supra, </em>at p. 455.</p>

If the prosecution does not insist upon the electric chair, no apparent reason exists for the introduction of defendant’s prior criminal record, since that evidence is only relevant for its bearing on the jurors’ choice of life imprisonment or death as <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>the first degree murder sentence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Indeed, the state’s endeavor to introduce such evidence during trial seems prejudicial in and of itself, absent a prosecutorial intention to press for the death penalty. Hence, in <em>Lowry, supra, </em>the court paid particular attention to the Commonwealth’s lack of interest in the death penalty. <em>Scoleri, <a href="/f2d/310/0720-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="310 F.2d 720" data-case-ids="193805" data-case-paths="/f2d/310/0720-01">supra,</a> </em>represents the only decided case known to us in which the prosecution at trial asked the jury for the electric chair, and the introduction of defendant’s prior criminal record was later found to be a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Commonwealth in <em>Rucker, Gist, </em>and <em>Marino </em>actively sought the death penalty.</p>
    <p id="b206-4" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[200,1105,1150,979]],["BL_207.1",207,[156,397,1144,98]]]'>The third, and perhaps most crucial, factor considered in the cases is the existence of what Judge Freedman referred to in <em>Lowry, <a href="/f2d/364/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="364 F.2d 297" data-case-ids="811207" data-case-paths="/f2d/364/0297-01">supra,</a> </em>as a “substantial issue of guilt.” The opinions in <em>Scoleri, <a href="/f2d/310/0720-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="310 F.2d 720" data-case-ids="193805" data-case-paths="/f2d/310/0720-01">supra,</a> </em>and <em>Ijowry, supra,- </em>all reflect the existence of a conflict in the evidence sufficient to raise the possibility of acquittal absent the tainted admission of defendant’s record of prior unrelated offenses. Thus, Judge Smith found that <em>United States ex rel. Gist v. Rundle, supra, </em>at p. 409, was not “a case in which the scales of justice were delicately balanced between guilt and innocence,” holding that there was “ample evidence” to justify the relator’s murder conviction. Similarly, the court in <em>Rucker, <a href="/f2d/311/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="311 F.2d 311" data-case-ids="190019" data-case-paths="/f2d/311/0311-01">supra,</a> </em>where the only real issue was the validity of a defense of intoxication, viewed the evidence against the relator as “clear, overwhelming and uncontroverted.” <em>Marino, supra, </em>involved only the issue of the degree of the murder, and this Court found <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>that the “overwhelming weight” of “direct and abundant” evidence was against the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b207-3" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[155,509,1148,1255]]]'>Viewing appellant’s case in light of these three factors, we are unable to find that any prejudice he may have suffered amounted to a denial of due process. First, defendant’s prior criminal record consisted of guilty pleas entered at one time in 1935 to charges of arson, entering a building with intent to commit a felony, larceny, carrying concealed deadly weapons, and assault and battery with intent to Mil. An assessment of appellant’s case, based only on the relationship between this record and the pending murder charge is inconclusive, since it places Chapasco in the same class with <em>Lowry, supra, </em>where Judge Freedman for the Court of Appeals found a denial of due process, and <em>Rucker, <a href="/f2d/311/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="311 F.2d 311" data-case-ids="190019" data-case-paths="/f2d/311/0311-01">supra,</a> </em>and <em>Marino, supra, </em>where the same federal court and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, respectively, upheld defendants’ convictions. Appellant’s record consisted of this one instance of prior pleas which were entered some fifteen years before the trial in question. While the prior record and the present action both involved crimes against the person, robbery, and the use or possession of a deadly weapon, we do not find that this similarity was of itself so prejudicial as to amount to a denial of due process.</p>
    <p id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[157,1775,1145,210]]]'>Second, since the prosecution actively demanded the death penalty for appellant, the admission into evidence of appellant’s prior convictions served its lawful purpose under the Parker rule procedure.</p>

As indicated above, the evidence against Chapasco was quite strong. He at one point admitted participation in the holdup resulting in the death of David Sldar. Ostroff, the victim’s brother-in-law, identified Chapasco as one of the robbers. The <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>statement of Martin Pearson, also convicted for Ms role in the crime, implicated Chapasco. The police found Chapasco’s thumbprint on the cartridge clip of the pistol discovered near the scene of the episode; Chapasco himself revealed the whereabouts of the actual murder weapon to the authorities. The cumulative weight of this evidence is heavy and in our view more than offsets any likelihood that the disputed introduction of appellant’s prior criminal record prejudiced the jury’s determination on the issue of guilt.</p>
    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[195,932,1144,264]]]'>Viewing the case as a whole, the introduction of Chapasco’s criminal record in this case stands nearer to <em>Bucher, Marino, </em>and <em>Gist </em>than to those instances in which the courts have found a violation of the due process standards.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.6",208,[195,1207,1149,1138]]]'>This Court’s concluding observations in <em>Marino, supra, </em>are equally pertinent here: “In reaching our conclusion we are not unmindful of the potential hazards presented by the pre-Split-Ver diet Act practice. The enactment of that Act was a legislative response to this potential and a desirable corrective. This Court is sensitive to the need for scrupulous care in the consideration of those cases which come before us under the shadow of our former practice. But we are also mindful of our responsibility to insure that those who have justly earned the condemnation of their peers are not the undeserved beneficiaries of a mistaken and misdirected largesse. Our system of jurisprudence has traditionally been concerned with the accommodation of the rights of the criminally accused and the rights of society. In accordance with that tradition, we seek by our review to insure that those who by reason of realistic probability of prejudice have been denied their constitutional right to a fair trial are afforded that right.” <em>Marino, supra, </em>at p. 457.
