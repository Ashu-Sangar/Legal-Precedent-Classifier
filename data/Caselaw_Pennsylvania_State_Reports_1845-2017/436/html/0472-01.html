In the first place, the Levins failed to pursue the appropriate procedure. Distribution of the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale, originally controlled by the provisions of the Act of June 16, 1836 (P. L, 755, §86, 12 P.S. §2661), is-governed by Rule 3136, <em>Pa. R. G. </em>P.,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which suspended the 1836 Act. Under Rule 3136, in order to participate in the fund created by a sheriff’s sale, it is necessary that creditors have a lien on- the fund as of the date of the sale because, on the date of the sale, the title to the property passes to the purchaser. . In the case at bar, as of the date of the sale, the Levins not only did not have a lien on the fund but could not have had since the basis of their claim was for damage which did not occur until after the sale. In fact, as of the date of the sale, Levins did not even have a cause of action. Therefore, they were not in a position to invoke the terms of Rule 3136.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In seeking their damages out of the balance of the funds payable to both Yetty and Frank Luckenbach, the Levins argue that the right of the Luckenbachs to the balance of the fund is as tenants by the entireties and that as between the Levins and the Luckenbachs, the wrongdoing of Yetty Luckenbach must be treated as the wrongdoing of <em>both </em>Yetty and Frank Luckenbach.

To the rule granted, Yetty <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>Luckenbach. filed no answer, and the court, on June 16, 1967, directed that the rule be made absolute, and that order stands unappealed. Thus, whether we construe the failure of Yetty Luckenbach to file an answer as tantamount to an agreement to a termination of the tenancy by the entireties or the order of the court as a judicial termination of the tenancy, Yetty Luckenbach and Frank Luckenbach <em>each </em>became entitled to one half of the balance of the proceeds of the sale. The division of the fund must be deemed to have taken place on March 3, 1967, and when the Levins, on March 8, 1967, filed their exceptions, no fund held by a tenancy by the entireties existed. Frank Luckenbach became entitled to distribution of one half of the fund of $8,-677.61 held by the sheriff as the balance of the proceeds of the sale.</p>
