Kotwasinski, McErlane Knitting Mills, Inc., Samuel Steinberg and Normandie Yarn Mills, Inc. are all commercial tenants in a loft building owned by Phyllis Rasner and Mildred Gutman, which building is managed by Lanard &amp; Axilbund, Inc. as agents for the owners. On January 15, 1964, Kotwasinski, Mc-Erlane and Steinberg occupied, separately, the first four floors of the building, while Normandie occupied the fifth floor. On that date, a sprinkler pipe in the ceiling of Normandie’s premises froze and burst, thereby releasing a torrent of water which did considerable physical damage to the property of the tenants on the floors below. Kotwasinski, McErlane and Steinberg brought suit against Rasner and Gutman, the owners, Lanard <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>&amp; Axilbund, tbeir agent, and, subsequently by amendment to the complaint, Normandie, the occupant of the fifth floor. The suit alleged negligence against the defendants in failing to replace broken windows, in removing heating units and otherwise allowing conditions to exist which caused the freezing of the sprinkler pipe.</p>

The court below granted summary judgment in favor of Lanard &amp; Axilbund and the plaintiffs appealed.

The amounts in controversy with respect to Eotwasinski and McErlane are each in excess of $10,000.00 and have been so certified by the court below.

Appellee has not filed a motion to quash Steinberg’s appeal but has raised the question in its brief. We conclude that inasmuch as the claims of two of the appellants are sufficient to confer jurisdiction and the questions as to all of the plaintiffs’ appeals are essentially identical and their interests inseparable, we shall retain jurisdiction over all of the appeals.

In that case, the lessee’s insurer sued the lessor on the theory that the lessor’s negligence was responsible for the rupture of a sprinkler system pipe and consequent damage to the lessee’s property. The lessor’s defense was based upon an exculpatory clause typed into the printed lease, which provided: “[Lessor] shall not be responsible and [lessee] agrees, for any damages occurring to the property of [lessee].” We did not permit that clause to insulate the lessor from liability, nor do we permit such insulation to result from the clauses here in question.</p>

We there said: “Generally speaking, an exculpatory clause is valid if: (a) ‘it does not contravene any policy of the law, that is, if it is not a matter of interest to the public or State . . . .’ (Dilks v. Flohr Chevrolet, <a href="/pa/411/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="411 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1886015" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0425-01">411 Pa. 425</a>, 434, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20682" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="192 A.2d 682">192 A. 2d 682</a> (1963) and authorities therein cited); (b) ‘the contract is between persons relating entirely to their own private affairs’ (Dilks v. Flohr Chevrolet, supra, page 433); (c) ‘each party is a free bargaining agent’ and the clause is not in effect ‘a mere contract of adhesion, whereby [one party] simply adheres to a document which he is powerless to alter, having no alternative other than to reject the transaction entirely.’ (Galligan v. Arovitch, <a href="/pa/421/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="421 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="1900435" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0301-01">421 Pa. 301</a>, 304, <a href="/citations/?q=219%20A.2d%20463" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="219 A.2d 463">219 A. 2d 463</a> (1966).

In both cases, the tenants alleged that the condition which resulted in the water flow occurred prior to the lease. In both cases, the condition which caused the sprinkler system to fail existed in areas not leased to the tenant and beyond the tenant’s control. In both cases, the tenants had no knowledge or reason to know of the condition and the lessor and his agents did know of the condition. We there held that “if a clause in a written agreement purporting to extend immunity from <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>liability for negligent conduct is to embrace negligent ■conduct occurring <em>before </em>as well as <em>after </em>the execution of the agreement, the intent of the parties to that effect must be expressed with the utmost clarity and without any ambiguity. . . . When parties enter into a lease agreement they are contemplating a status which will be created in the future; their engagements undertaken are to be performed in the future, not the past. If a party seeking immunity from liability for negligent conduct intends exculpation for past as well as future negligent conduct it is his obligation to express in the agreement such intent in an unequivocal manner; absent a clear expression of intent, the clause of exculpation will not be so construed.” (emphasis in original).</p>
    <p id="b90-4" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[185,1231,1147,475]]]'>The instant case is, if anything, stronger than <em>Employers. </em>There the exculpatory clause was typed into a printed lease, not, as here, part of the fine print of the lease where it would least likely be found. In <em>Employers </em>we cited with approval <em>Saewitz v. Levittown Shopping Center, Inc., </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/34/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="34 Pa.

Foremost among these is that even if the owners are liable to Kotwasinski—and through the owners, their agents may also be liable—paragraph 13(d) exonerates the agents. This argument is, of course, predicated on the view that 13(d) is broad enough to exculpate the agent from any and all liability. Appellee points specifically to the language of that paragraph purporting to release it from liability “for any errors of omission or commission ... or for any action or proceeding that may be taken by the owner against Lessee or by Lessee <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>against the owner.” We conclude that the “any errors of omission or commission” language is not sufficiently clear to meet the test of <em>Employers </em>relative to past negligent conduct. Moreover, this is both an action against the owner and the agent, the action against the agent being for its own negligence as manager of the building.</p>

From the affidavit of Stanley Fried in support of appellee’s motion for summary judgment, we learn that the leases held by the appellants at the time of the damage were dated, respectively, December 28, 1961, January 2, 1962, and April 14, 1959. It is also then stated, and not contradicted in the counteraffidavit, that appellant McErlane, whose officer was the affiant in the counteraffidavit, had leased its portion of this loft building continuously since 1951 under two earlier leases containing language identical to paragraph 13(d). The antecedent nature of the alleged negligence may therefore be rather difficult for McErlane to prove at trial. It is to be noted, moreover, that that portion of the building in which the piping burst had been vacant from May 31, 1959 until June 11, 1963.</p>
