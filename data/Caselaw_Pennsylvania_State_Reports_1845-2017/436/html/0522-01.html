The petition cites no reasons in support of this request for allocatur. Petitioner’s appointed counsel has filed a “supplementary petition for allocatur” in which he seeks the allowance of an appeal for “those reasons and grounds set out by the appellant in his petition for allowance of an appeal.” Such a petition utterly fails <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>to comport with our requirement of “representation in the role of an advocate.” <em>Commonwealth v. Stancell, </em><a href="/pa/435/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="435 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="1924318" data-case-paths="/pa/435/0301-01">435 Pa. 301</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=256%20A.2d%20798" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="256 A.2d 798">256 A. 2d 798</a> (1969). See also Supreme Court Eule 69 (petitions for allowance of an appeal must set forth particularly the questions involved and the reasons supporting the grant of the petition). We note that petitioner’s counsel in the Superior Court had informed petitioner by letter that in his opinion an appeal to the Supreme Court would be unavailing. To the extent that this letter may have been an attempt by counsel to withdraw, it failed to comply with the standards for withdrawal set forth in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Baker, <a href="/pa/429/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="429 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1913475" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0209-01">429 Pa. 209</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20201" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="239 A.2d 201">239 A. 2d 201</a> (1968). See <em>Commonwealth v. Taylor, </em><a href="/pa/433/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="433 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="1921053" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0334-01">433 Pa. 334</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=250%20A.2d%20487" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="250 A.2d 487">250 A. 2d 487</a> (1969). This case is remanded to the hearing court with directions that counsel file a proper allocatur petition or a proper petition to withdraw.</p>
