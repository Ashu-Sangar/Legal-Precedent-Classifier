    <p id="b575-7" data-blocks='[["BL_575.11",575,[131,1618,1152,587]]]'>On April 21, 1964, the Redevelopment Authority of the City of New Kensington acquired, by eminent domain, partnership property owned by William Sams and Samuel Mannarino. After extensive litigation, on February 6, 1969 a jury awarded the condemnees $200,-000.00 compensation, of which the sum of $186,665.00 remained due on April 8, 1969. On that date, on petition of the Redevelopment Authority, the court below ordered this sum paid into court and appointed a Master to determine the relative priorities of the competing claimants.</p>

After payment of approximately $53,000.00 worth of prior claims not here in issue the Master and the court denied Lhormer’s claim, and awarded the balance of Samuel Mannarino’s share to the United States. The United States here concedes that it was awarded too much. Even if its tax liens prevail over the assignment to Lhormer, the United States is not entitled to the balance of Samuel Mannarino’s share, but only to the amount of the tax liens, $43,721.25. The Master and the court below erroneously awarded the United States part of Mannarino’s share to cover the tax liens of $319,141.94 against Sams’ share.</p>

These tax liens were duly filed in the prothonotary’s office of Westmoreland County, and notices of levy were sent on January 4, 1967, and February 12, 1969.</p>

It is clear from their form that they were intended to give appellant security with respect to the taxpayer-assignor’s contingent liability to the appellant, an accommodation party on the notes. The amounts due to Lhormer on the assignments were to be no less than the balances then due on the notes, plus any payments on them which Lhormer might be called upon to make. If the notes were paid in full by others than Lhormer, Lhormer would be entitled to nothing. These are hardly outright transfers.</p>

A security interest exists at any time (A) if, at such time, the property is in existence <em>and the mterest has become protected under Ipcal law against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation, </em>and (B) to the extent that, at such time, the holder has parted with money or money’s worth.” (Emphasis added). In order to be protected against the subsequent lien creditor, i.e., in order that his security interest be perfected, the secured party must file a financing statement under §9-302(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code, Act of April 6, 1953, P. L, 3, 12A P.S. §9-302(1). Failure to <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>file thus deprives the security interest of priority over the federal tax lien under present law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Ct. 384</a> (1961), would indicate that in some cases private security interests can prevail over federal tax liens, the inexorable conclusion is that those security interests must be perfected in order to prevail. Although the precise situation of a private Article 9 security interest that was not a mortgage or pledge has not been before the Supreme Court, on numerous occasions that Court has stated that “as against a recorded federal tax lien, the relative priority of a state lien is determined by the rule ‘first in time is first in right’ which in turn hinges upon whether, on the date the federal lien was recorded, the state lien was ‘specific and <em>perfected.’” </em>(Emphasis added). <em>United States v. Equitable Life, </em><a href="/us/384/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="384 U.S. 323" data-case-ids="12045134" data-case-paths="/us/384/0323-01">384 U.S. 323</a>, 327, <a href="/us/384/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="384 U.S. 323" data-case-ids="12045134" data-case-paths="/us/384/0323-01">86 S.

    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[195,1577,1146,750]]]'>We recognize that there is a split of authority on the question of the relative priority of a duly filed federal tax lien and an unrecorded security interest. Compare the cases cited in footnote 4 of the Government’s brief with those cited in footnote 5. We further recognize that a reasonable argument exists that the unrecorded security interest should prevail because the Government, unlike a subsequent creditor or bona fide purchaser, did not rely upon the state of the record. So long as the security interest is valid as between the parties, the argument goes, it should be valid against the Government as well. See, particularly, <em>United States v. Lebanon Woolen Mills Corp., </em><a href="/f-supp/241/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="241 F. Supp. 393" data-case-ids="385282" data-case-paths="/f-supp/241/0393-01">241 F.

      <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>However, on the other side is the argument that the federal revenues must be protected, and that a requirement of filing a financing statement will prevent fraudulent attempts to back-date security arrangements. Cf. <em>United States v. Security Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em><a href="/us/340/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="340 U.S. 47" data-case-ids="6930731" data-case-paths="/us/340/0047-01">340 U.S. 47</a>, <a href="/us/340/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="340 U.S. 47" data-case-ids="6930731" data-case-paths="/us/340/0047-01">71 S. Ct. 111</a> (1950). This latter argument obviously prevailed in the 1966 Act, an Act which, as we have stated, made things easier for secured creditors. The language of the cases stretching back approximately twenty years would indicate that the Supreme Court had also adopted the argument that security interests must be perfected to prevail. <em>United States v. Equitable Life, </em><a href="/us/384/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="384 U.S. 323" data-case-ids="12045134" data-case-paths="/us/384/0323-01">supra.</a></p>

In some thirty-five pages in his treatise, <em>Security Interests in Personal </em>Property<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Professor Gilmore has treated in great detail the competition between federal tax liens and other claims, including private security interests. He has performed the Herculean task of examining the tortured involutions of the Supreme Court, and the often pathetic cries of the lower federal courts and the state courts which were forced to act in the face of Supreme Court eases which seemed to conflict with each other every year and which were often in the form of per curiam reversals. We need not repeat Professor Gilmore’s work here. Suffice it to say that he concludes definitively at page 1068, that a security interest, to prevail, must be perfected under applicable state law. We agree with his reasoning and hold that, Lhormer’s security interest not having been perfected, it is subordinate to the federal tax liens.</p>
